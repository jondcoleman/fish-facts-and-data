00:00:00,00:00:02,(phone ringing)
00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Can I look at it, put it on like this."
00:00:04,00:00:07,(upbeat music)
00:00:07,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:14,00:00:16,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast."
00:00:16,00:00:19,This week coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
00:00:19,00:00:21,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:21,00:00:23,I'm joined once again by the three other elves.
00:00:23,00:00:24,Please welcome to the stage.
00:00:24,00:00:27,"It's Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski."
00:00:27,00:00:30,(audience cheering)
00:00:30,00:00:37,"And once again, we have gathered around"
00:00:37,00:00:40,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:40,00:00:42,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Starting with my fact this week,"
00:00:44,00:00:48,my fact this week is that the current French Scrabble Champion
00:00:48,00:00:50,doesn't speak a word of French.
00:00:50,00:00:51,(audience laughing)
00:00:51,00:00:53,"This was in the news not too long ago,"
00:00:53,00:00:55,"so I feel like some people know it,"
00:00:55,00:00:57,but I just found that absolutely amazing.
00:00:57,00:00:58,Did he just randomly play letters
00:00:58,00:00:59,which all turned out to be
00:00:59,00:01:01,except the French Scrabble dictionary?
00:01:01,00:01:04,"He memorized the French Scrabble dictionary,"
00:01:04,00:01:06,and then he just used that.
00:01:06,00:01:09,"And even in the finals, he told the French guy,"
00:01:09,00:01:10,that's not a word.
00:01:10,00:01:13,(audience laughing)
00:01:13,00:01:14,"Yeah, it's amazing character."
00:01:14,00:01:17,"Yeah, his name's Nigel Richards, he's from New Zealand."
00:01:17,00:01:18,- Oh wow.
00:01:18,00:01:20,(audience laughing)
00:01:20,00:01:23,- I read an article about him on shortlist.com
00:01:23,00:01:27,"entitled, ""Why Nigel Richards is better than Lionel Messi?"""
00:01:27,00:01:29,(audience laughing)
00:01:29,00:01:32,"- Well, they do call him the Tiger Woods Scrabble, don't they?"
00:01:32,00:01:35,'Cause we should stress he is not known to be an adulterer.
00:01:35,00:01:38,(audience laughing)
00:01:38,00:01:41,"I've read a thing a guy who's written a book about Scrabble,"
00:01:41,00:01:42,"he's a sort of Scrabble expert,"
00:01:42,00:01:45,"he's called Stefan Fatzis, and he said,"
00:01:45,00:01:47,"""Right now, Richards is,"" or I'm quoting here,"
00:01:47,00:01:49,"""like Tiger Woods at his peak,"""
00:01:49,00:01:51,"and then Tiger saying, ""I think I'll also take up tennis"
00:01:51,00:01:54,"""and then winning Wimbledon the next year."""
00:01:54,00:01:55,"- Wow, yeah."
00:01:55,00:01:57,- Did he engulf people call Tiger Woods
00:01:57,00:01:59,the Nigel Richards of golf?
00:01:59,00:02:00,- Yes.
00:02:00,00:02:01,(audience laughing)
00:02:01,00:02:02,- What happened?
00:02:02,00:02:03,"- I saw an interview with him on YouTube,"
00:02:03,00:02:05,"and they asked what the secret is,"
00:02:05,00:02:07,"and he said, ""I'm not sure there is a secret,"
00:02:07,00:02:10,"""it's just a matter of learning all the words."""
00:02:10,00:02:12,(audience laughing)
00:02:12,00:02:13,I was not secret anymore.
00:02:13,00:02:14,(audience laughing)
00:02:14,00:02:17,"And apparently he's read the 1,953 page"
00:02:17,00:02:19,"Chambers Dictionary five times,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,and memorized every single word in the dictionary.
00:02:21,00:02:23,- Wow.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"Apparently, you're at more of an advantage."
00:02:25,00:02:27,"Scrabble players say, ""When you don't speak"
00:02:27,00:02:29,"""the language that you're playing in."""
00:02:29,00:02:31,"- I bet it's the French who said that, is it?"
00:02:31,00:02:32,(audience laughing)
00:02:32,00:02:35,"- No, it's, apparently it's more about memorizing"
00:02:35,00:02:37,"the coding of it, the mathematics of it."
00:02:37,00:02:39,"You look at it, like you look at a,"
00:02:39,00:02:40,"I don't know, a big--"
00:02:40,00:02:41,"- I mean, certainly what you do need to do"
00:02:41,00:02:43,is know all the two letter words
00:02:43,00:02:44,"'cause they're the most useful ones,"
00:02:44,00:02:46,and most of them aren't really real words.
00:02:46,00:02:48,They're just like two letters put together.
00:02:48,00:02:49,"- No, no, no, no."
00:02:49,00:02:50,"- Like real is common, too, like a word."
00:02:50,00:02:51,"I think it's the most common, too, like a word."
00:02:51,00:02:52,- Yeah.
00:02:52,00:02:54,- The most commonly used word in all of Scrabble.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"- Is, is, uh, Chi, which is about QI."
00:02:56,00:02:59,(audience laughing)
00:02:59,00:03:03,Do you want to hear a move that Richard's made in 1998?
00:03:03,00:03:04,- Yeah.
00:03:04,00:03:05,- You do.
00:03:05,00:03:06,(audience laughing)
00:03:06,00:03:07,Right.
00:03:07,00:03:08,- It's 1998.
00:03:08,00:03:10,(audience laughing)
00:03:10,00:03:11,I've set the scene.
00:03:11,00:03:13,(audience laughing)
00:03:13,00:03:14,"So he was, he was pretty new at the time"
00:03:14,00:03:15,"to competitive Scrabble,"
00:03:15,00:03:20,"and he had C, D, H, L, R, N, and then a blank tile."
00:03:20,00:03:21,- Children.
00:03:21,00:03:22,"- There was an E on the board,"
00:03:22,00:03:23,"and he could have played that,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,and he used up all seven letters
00:03:25,00:03:28,"and got a 50 point bonus, like an idiot."
00:03:28,00:03:28,- Oh.
00:03:28,00:03:29,(audience laughing)
00:03:29,00:03:33,"- Instead, he found two O's and an E,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,"which were all in line on the board,"
00:03:34,00:03:35,"not connected to each other,"
00:03:35,00:03:38,and played all of his letters to make the ten letter
00:03:38,00:03:39,chloradine.
00:03:39,00:03:41,- Oh my God.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- Yeah.
00:03:42,00:03:43,"- That is like a dream,"
00:03:43,00:03:45,'cause you always want to connect all of those
00:03:45,00:03:47,"vertical columns, but it never works."
00:03:47,00:03:48,- Wow.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"- And he only loved the game at the age of 28,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"and his mother introduced it to him,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,"and she said, this is her words."
00:03:54,00:03:57,"I said, I know a game you're not going to be very good at."
00:03:57,00:03:59,(audience laughing)
00:03:59,00:04:01,"Because you can't spell very well,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,and you won't very good at English at school.
00:04:03,00:04:04,(audience laughing)
00:04:04,00:04:06,"Unfortunately, here's a mathematical genius,"
00:04:06,00:04:09,"so you can't see all the, you just see it, yeah."
00:04:09,00:04:10,- But another Scrabble move that's been made
00:04:10,00:04:12,was in the first ever World Scrabble Championships
00:04:12,00:04:14,in the early '90s.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"There was a winner, but the person who was runner up,"
00:04:17,00:04:20,"the reason he lost was because one of the last words he played,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,"and sometimes, you know, even if you've got a few letters left,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,"you take a pun on a word that you hope exists,"
00:04:24,00:04:25,"'cause there are lots of weird words,"
00:04:25,00:04:26,"and the first word he played,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"the last word he played was the word ""smail"","
00:04:28,00:04:32,"as in ""snail"" with an ""m"" in the hope that that could"
00:04:32,00:04:36,"get him some points, and it couldn't,"
00:04:36,00:04:40,"but now that ""smail"" is an anagram of another word,"
00:04:40,00:04:41,which gets points.
00:04:41,00:04:42,- Mails?
00:04:42,00:04:44,"- Yeah, so he couldn't have played males,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"and he lost the Scrabble Championship,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,"because he played ""smail"" instead."
00:04:48,00:04:49,(laughter)
00:04:49,00:04:50,- You want to do it?
00:04:50,00:04:51,- You want to do it?
00:04:51,00:04:52,- You want to do it?
00:04:52,00:04:53,"- It's like, that's awful."
00:04:53,00:04:56,- He's very much the today's Tiger Woods of Scrabble.
00:04:56,00:04:59,(laughter)
00:04:59,00:05:01,- Do you guys know about the inventor of Scrabble?
00:05:01,00:05:03,- He was cut.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"- Yes, Alfred Butts, which is just a lovely surname."
00:05:06,00:05:11,"- Alfred Mosher Butts was his middle name, not his nickname, right?"
00:05:11,00:05:14,"- Yeah, and he only revealed a few days before"
00:05:14,00:05:15,he died.
00:05:15,00:05:16,He lived until quite old.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"He was 93, I think."
00:05:18,00:05:20,"He said that he was a bad speller, and everyone was like,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,"""That's hilarious,"" and then he died."
00:05:22,00:05:24,It was less hilarious.
00:05:24,00:05:25,(laughter)
00:05:25,00:05:28,"But on his tombstone, it said, ""R.P.I."""
00:05:28,00:05:31,(laughter)
00:05:31,00:05:32,- Mm-hmm.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"- Yeah, so he invented Scrabble."
00:05:34,00:05:36,He called it it originally.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"I had another name for it, and then someone bought it off him"
00:05:39,00:05:41,"and turned it into Scrabble, so when we use this word,"
00:05:41,00:05:44,"and so he had that whole thing of the difficult second album,"
00:05:44,00:05:49,"and he actually released the game, and it was called..."
00:05:49,00:05:50,"Oh, sorry, I've lost it now."
00:05:50,00:05:51,"- I know what it was called. - Yeah, what's it called?"
00:05:51,00:05:53,- Alfred's Other Game.
00:05:53,00:05:54,- That's it.
00:05:54,00:05:57,- His follow-up to Scrabble was called Alfred's Other Game.
00:05:57,00:05:59,- No one knew who Alfred was. - No one knew who Alfred was.
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- To know anything about it, because no one's ever bought it"
00:06:01,00:06:03,"as far as I can tell, except four reviewers"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"who reviewed it online, all of them say,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,"""It's like Solitaire, but it involves two players,"
00:06:07,00:06:10,"""but the two players don't interact with each other at all."""
00:06:10,00:06:13,"So I think it's basically two Solitaire sets,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,and you're just supposed to sit next to someone
00:06:14,00:06:16,while you do them. - Right.
00:06:16,00:06:20,"- Yeah, he wasted a lot of his talent on the first one, I think."
00:06:20,00:06:22,"So he decided the points for Scrabble, based on..."
00:06:22,00:06:24,He studied the front page of the New York Times
00:06:24,00:06:25,"over a series of months, didn't he?"
00:06:25,00:06:28,And then logged the frequency of certain letters
00:06:28,00:06:30,"in the New York Times that appeared,"
00:06:30,00:06:31,and decided the point scores based on that.
00:06:31,00:06:33,So a lot of people now think we should change it.
00:06:33,00:06:36,"- I wonder if he counted the letters in New York Times,"
00:06:36,00:06:37,which appeared every single day.
00:06:37,00:06:40,That is such a good point. - Yeah.
00:06:40,00:06:43,- And that's why why isn't worth as much as it should be.
00:06:43,00:06:44,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:46,- That's probably why I'm so bad at Scrabble.
00:06:46,00:06:51,"Yeah, and actually, if you're playing it in another language,"
00:06:51,00:06:53,"it's not just the words, it's also the letters"
00:06:53,00:06:56,"of worth different amounts, so that must be pretty hard."
00:06:56,00:06:58,"In Polish, a Z is worth one point."
00:06:58,00:07:05,Although a Z with an accent on it is worth 10 points.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"- Really? - Yeah, that's weird."
00:07:07,00:07:09,"In Ukrainian, an apostrophe is worth 10 points."
00:07:09,00:07:12,(laughing)
00:07:12,00:07:14,"But in Armenian, the board is 17 by 17,"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"instead of 15 by 15, 'cause they have longer words."
00:07:17,00:07:20,And they also have loads of letters that I've never heard of.
00:07:20,00:07:24,"So for one point, the letters ""yeck"" and ""khen""."
00:07:24,00:07:28,"For two points, the letter ""men""."
00:07:28,00:07:30,"For three points, the letter ""ben""."
00:07:30,00:07:33,"And for four points, the letter ""ra""."
00:07:33,00:07:35,(laughing)
00:07:35,00:07:38,"I assume that's how you pronounce these ""ra""."
00:07:38,00:07:41,"- Well, did you see the ""gur"" has been added"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"to the official Scrabble Dictionary in the last update,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,which was made in 2011.
00:07:45,00:07:50,"The words ""gur"" ""thang"" and ""blingy"" have been added"
00:07:50,00:07:51,to the Scrabble Dictionary.
00:07:51,00:07:52,You can now play those.
00:07:52,00:07:55,There's this huge wall between the Americans
00:07:55,00:07:57,"and everyone else, because..."
00:07:57,00:08:00,"- Classic wall there, probably."
00:08:01,00:08:05,"- So, we'll, as you guys know, use the OSPD,"
00:08:05,00:08:08,"the official Scrabble Dictionary, when we're playing Scrabble,"
00:08:08,00:08:10,"and we've actually combined that with the OSW,"
00:08:10,00:08:11,the official Scrabble word list.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"But the US refuses to do that,"
00:08:13,00:08:16,"and keeps on using its own dictionary, the tournament word list,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,which is a completely different list of what...
00:08:18,00:08:20,"I mean, there's probably some overlap."
00:08:20,00:08:22,(laughing)
00:08:22,00:08:25,"- I mean, as long as both have ""thang"", I'm happy."
00:08:25,00:08:27,(laughing)
00:08:27,00:08:28,"- But yeah, people get very angry about this."
00:08:28,00:08:31,"- Well, they don't like swear words in the American one."
00:08:31,00:08:32,"- I don't know, they've banned this."
00:08:32,00:08:34,"- Yeah, they've banned all swear words,"
00:08:34,00:08:38,and ESPN decided to put the Scrabble Championships
00:08:38,00:08:39,onto their channel.
00:08:39,00:08:42,"But they had a thing where they said, ""These are the lists."""
00:08:42,00:08:44,I think it was about 170 words.
00:08:44,00:08:46,"They said, ""You can't say this on television."
00:08:46,00:08:48,"""You can do this in normal Scrabble competition,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,"""but you can't do this on television."""
00:08:50,00:08:52,"But so, what they did was the first 30 rounds"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"of the competition, they could use all the rude words"
00:08:54,00:08:55,that were banned.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"And then when it got to the televised bit,"
00:08:57,00:08:58,they couldn't do it anymore.
00:08:58,00:09:00,- That's pretty bad that they were allowed it
00:09:00,00:09:02,"for half of the tournament, and then not afterwards."
00:09:02,00:09:03,'Cause what about someone like me
00:09:03,00:09:05,who only ever plays rude words in Scrabble?
00:09:05,00:09:06,(laughing)
00:09:06,00:09:08,"I'm gonna be nailing it halfway through,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,and then I'm gonna be absolutely useless
00:09:09,00:09:11,as on TV as well.
00:09:11,00:09:13,"I will be using a lot of those words,"
00:09:13,00:09:14,but not on the board.
00:09:14,00:09:15,(laughing)
00:09:15,00:09:16,- I'm gonna have to move it on in a few minutes.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"So if anyone's got anything else,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,there's a very cool thing about Scrabble in Senegal
00:09:20,00:09:22,"where it's an official sport,"
00:09:22,00:09:24,"and they take it so seriously,"
00:09:24,00:09:27,and Senegal hosted the French Scrabble World Championship
00:09:27,00:09:28,in 2008.
00:09:28,00:09:30,So this was before Richard's won.
00:09:30,00:09:32,But the Senegalese government composed
00:09:32,00:09:34,"an official song to mark the occasion,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,and I read this in an article about it
00:09:36,00:09:39,"that in Senegal, you can buy a set of Scrabble"
00:09:39,00:09:40,"on most street corners,"
00:09:40,00:09:42,(laughing)
00:09:42,00:09:43,"which I can't quite believe, but I want to believe."
00:09:43,00:09:44,And I'm never gonna go to Senegal
00:09:44,00:09:46,in case it turns out not to be true.
00:09:46,00:09:47,(laughing)
00:09:47,00:09:49,- Comes free with your bag of crack.
00:09:49,00:09:51,Just to Scrabble dials.
00:09:51,00:09:52,(laughing)
00:09:52,00:09:55,"I was on some online chat forums,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,just separate to work.
00:09:57,00:10:00,"And it was one of those,"
00:10:00,00:10:01,I was just taking a break.
00:10:01,00:10:03,"And it was, you know, it was like a Yahoo,"
00:10:03,00:10:04,"answers thing or something,"
00:10:04,00:10:06,"and it was a parent who said,"
00:10:06,00:10:07,"this is literally what it read,"
00:10:07,00:10:10,"""Hmm, my seven-year-old just swallowed a Scrabble dial."
00:10:10,00:10:13,"""No, wait, it's a banana-grams-tile."""
00:10:13,00:10:16,"He tells me, ""Anyone have an experience with this?"""
00:10:16,00:10:19,(laughing)
00:10:19,00:10:20,"I mean, it is exactly the same"
00:10:20,00:10:22,a banana-grams-tile to a Scrabble-tile.
00:10:22,00:10:23,I guess she meant to specify not--
00:10:23,00:10:25,- Probably just like make another tile out of cardboard
00:10:25,00:10:26,and use that.
00:10:26,00:10:29,(laughing)
00:10:29,00:10:35,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two,"
00:10:35,00:10:37,and that is James Harkin.
00:10:37,00:10:40,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the world's only"
00:10:40,00:10:43,venomous frogs headbutt their enemies to death.
00:10:43,00:10:46,(laughing)
00:10:46,00:10:49,- They're very little known species from Millwall.
00:10:49,00:10:51,(laughing)
00:10:51,00:10:54,"- And you Googled Violent Football Team, didn't you?"
00:10:54,00:10:56,You've got no idea what you just said.
00:10:56,00:10:58,(laughing)
00:10:58,00:11:02,"- And I'll never go, in case it turns out to be true."
00:11:02,00:11:04,(laughing)
00:11:04,00:11:05,- I think that's very safe.
00:11:05,00:11:09,"So yeah, you get a lot of frogs which are poisonous,"
00:11:09,00:11:12,"which means if you eat them, you would be sick."
00:11:12,00:11:14,"But these are venomous, so they stick the poison"
00:11:14,00:11:16,into the body of their prey.
00:11:16,00:11:20,And they are called Apparas Venodon Brunoi
00:11:20,00:11:23,and Cory Philmante's Greening Eye.
00:11:23,00:11:24,And they have really flexible necks
00:11:24,00:11:28,"and really pointy skulls, and they have poison on their skulls."
00:11:28,00:11:31,"Actually, a single gram of venom from the first one"
00:11:31,00:11:34,of those frogs would be enough to kill 80 people.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"- Wow, 80, so they're proper hardcore"
00:11:37,00:11:38,and they're only little guys as well.
00:11:38,00:11:39,(laughing)
00:11:39,00:11:40,- Wow.
00:11:40,00:11:42,- And have you heard of the Harry frog?
00:11:42,00:11:43,- No.
00:11:43,00:11:44,- So the Harry frog does this thing
00:11:44,00:11:45,"that when it's getting to a fight,"
00:11:45,00:11:49,"it will break its toe bones to snap them,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,which is always intimidating to see someone doing that
00:11:51,00:11:52,when you're in a fight with them.
00:11:52,00:11:55,And they start breaking themselves before they go for you.
00:11:55,00:11:58,So they'll just snap their toes off.
00:11:58,00:12:02,"And then they push their toe bones through their skin,"
00:12:02,00:12:05,"like Wolverine, like, and they just come out"
00:12:05,00:12:07,"and they go, do you want some?"
00:12:07,00:12:12,And then it's the most aggressive fighting I've ever heard of.
00:12:12,00:12:13,"- Andy, I don't know if you know this is exactly"
00:12:13,00:12:14,what they do in Millwall.
00:12:14,00:12:16,(laughing)
00:12:16,00:12:19,"- Also, sea cucumbers, just while we're"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"on the kind of fighting defense thing,"
00:12:21,00:12:25,they shoot their internal organs out through their ass hole.
00:12:25,00:12:28,"- So, sorry, Andy hates what they say"
00:12:28,00:12:30,"where it's like that, I don't know."
00:12:30,00:12:32,- That's why you two never place grubbles together.
00:12:32,00:12:34,(laughing)
00:12:34,00:12:36,"- Yeah, imagine that, shooting bits of your body"
00:12:36,00:12:38,"out through your ass, that's quite crazy."
00:12:38,00:12:39,"- Yeah, I can regrow them afterwards."
00:12:39,00:12:41,They can regrow them and the idea is
00:12:41,00:12:43,that the predators will eat the stuff that's come out
00:12:43,00:12:45,and they won't eat the cucumber themselves.
00:12:45,00:12:47,"But actually, they also have a fish"
00:12:47,00:12:50,that live inside the renaces called slender pearl fish.
00:12:50,00:12:52,So that must be pretty bad for those fish
00:12:52,00:12:54,who are just sitting in a nice little home
00:12:54,00:12:56,and suddenly everything gets ejected out.
00:12:56,00:12:58,(laughing)
00:12:58,00:12:59,- A nice little home.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"Oh, we've got it great, haven't we?"
00:13:01,00:13:03,(laughing)
00:13:03,00:13:04,Look at our anus.
00:13:04,00:13:06,- We've got a nice two up two down anus.
00:13:06,00:13:09,(laughing)
00:13:09,00:13:10,- We're really hoping to move to a bigger anus
00:13:10,00:13:11,in the country.
00:13:11,00:13:14,(laughing)
00:13:14,00:13:18,"- So, there's two on a gist, were in Ecuador recently."
00:13:18,00:13:19,And they spotted this frog that was obviously
00:13:19,00:13:21,a new species 'cause it was like covered in spikes
00:13:21,00:13:22,that they'd never seen before.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"So they're like, this is really exciting."
00:13:24,00:13:25,And they spotted it around a way.
00:13:25,00:13:27,So they spent years and years in Ecuador
00:13:27,00:13:28,looking for this frog again.
00:13:28,00:13:29,And they eventually found it.
00:13:29,00:13:31,"I think this year or last year, and they got it"
00:13:31,00:13:32,and they put it in a jar overnight.
00:13:32,00:13:33,"And I will deal with that tomorrow, you know,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,classified or whatever.
00:13:34,00:13:36,Came downstairs in the morning
00:13:36,00:13:37,and all of its spikes had gone.
00:13:37,00:13:40,"And so the geologist, the female geologist said,"
00:13:40,00:13:43,"""I thought I must have just picked up the wrong frog."""
00:13:43,00:13:43,(laughing)
00:13:43,00:13:45,And so I was very disappointed.
00:13:45,00:13:46,"But I just, you know, as she said,"
00:13:46,00:13:49,I laid down some moss so it would be comfortable in there.
00:13:49,00:13:51,And then I decided to take it back out into the wild the next day.
00:13:51,00:13:53,And then the next day the spikes were back.
00:13:53,00:13:56,"And it became apparent that this is a shape-shifting frog,"
00:13:56,00:13:58,the first known shape-shifting amphibian.
00:13:58,00:14:00,"- Well, do we know if they can turn into princes?"
00:14:00,00:14:02,(audience laughing)
00:14:02,00:14:04,I read that in a scientific manual.
00:14:04,00:14:06,(laughing)
00:14:06,00:14:09,"There was, when Disney released the princess and the frog,"
00:14:09,00:14:12,more than 50 children were hospitalised with cell manella
00:14:12,00:14:13,from trying to kiss frogs.
00:14:13,00:14:14,- Wow.
00:14:14,00:14:18,- Just play banana grams with them like normal.
00:14:18,00:14:19,Much better.
00:14:19,00:14:25,In 2008 some scientists found a frog with no lungs.
00:14:25,00:14:26,"So this is really, really cool."
00:14:26,00:14:29,It's called Barbara Ruler Kalim Mantanensis.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Don't write in.
00:14:30,00:14:32,And it hadn't been dissected before
00:14:32,00:14:34,because they only had two specimens of it.
00:14:34,00:14:35,And they didn't want to destroy
00:14:35,00:14:37,the only two specimens they had.
00:14:37,00:14:39,So nobody suspected that it wouldn't have lungs.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"And then they found another one and they thought,"
00:14:41,00:14:42,"well, let's dissect it."
00:14:42,00:14:44,- And sucks to be the third frog.
00:14:44,00:14:46,(laughing)
00:14:46,00:14:47,- The early bird catches the worm.
00:14:47,00:14:49,And the second mouse gets the cheating.
00:14:49,00:14:50,The third frog is dissected.
00:14:50,00:14:52,(laughing)
00:14:52,00:14:54,But it gets all its oxygen through its skin.
00:14:54,00:14:55,It's so cool.
00:14:55,00:14:58,"And the really, really cool thing is that"
00:14:58,00:15:01,it actively threw away its own lungs.
00:15:01,00:15:02,As then it used to have lungs
00:15:02,00:15:05,"and then it thought, I don't need these."
00:15:05,00:15:06,(laughing)
00:15:06,00:15:10,"And because it saves space on lungs in its body,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,it's a bit slimmer and flatter.
00:15:12,00:15:13,So it has a bigger surface area.
00:15:13,00:15:16,So it can absorb more oxygen proportional to its size.
00:15:16,00:15:18,"- Well, that's like there's the scrotum frog,"
00:15:18,00:15:20,which does quite a similar thing.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"Yeah, the scrotum frog is cool that"
00:15:22,00:15:24,because it just has incredibly floppy skin.
00:15:24,00:15:26,So it's got these really tiny lungs
00:15:26,00:15:28,"that can't really take much, but it got way too much skin."
00:15:28,00:15:30,And so it's loads of surface area.
00:15:30,00:15:31,And so it looks like a scrotum.
00:15:31,00:15:33,"So obviously it's far too much skin, it's kind of gross."
00:15:33,00:15:34,(laughing)
00:15:34,00:15:36,But it does help it respire.
00:15:36,00:15:38,- Can I do some stuff on headbutting?
00:15:38,00:15:39,"- Yes, yeah, yeah."
00:15:39,00:15:43,- So a Welsh police force has trained its dogs
00:15:43,00:15:45,to disable their targets by leaping at them
00:15:45,00:15:49,and delivering a flying headbutt rather than biting them.
00:15:49,00:15:50,(laughing)
00:15:50,00:15:53,And this is because people were being bitten by police dogs
00:15:53,00:15:56,and kind of getting compensation or whatever
00:15:56,00:15:57,"and they thought, well, a better way of doing it"
00:15:57,00:16:00,is just having them attacking the people with their heads.
00:16:00,00:16:03,"- I read that if cats headbutt you,"
00:16:03,00:16:07,this is what the scientist report I saw said.
00:16:07,00:16:08,(laughing)
00:16:08,00:16:10,"That when cats headbutt you,"
00:16:10,00:16:13,it's the equivalent of them giving you a high five.
00:16:13,00:16:15,(laughing)
00:16:15,00:16:17,- And that's like the science you say.
00:16:17,00:16:21,"- Yeah, that's from my way."
00:16:21,00:16:22,"They just come over and they're just going,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,"""Yeah, man, you're all right."""
00:16:24,00:16:27,- That's a loose definition of the equivalent of a high five.
00:16:27,00:16:30,"I mean, so they rub against you to express affection."
00:16:30,00:16:31,"- Can I take it up with science, eh?"
00:16:31,00:16:33,(laughing)
00:16:33,00:16:36,- My five can signify so much.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"- Joy, sorrow, affection, sorrow, high five."
00:16:39,00:16:40,(laughing)
00:16:40,00:16:43,- That's the last time I take you to a funeral.
00:16:43,00:16:45,(laughing)
00:16:45,00:16:49,"- Just one more thing about headbutt's Bedfordshire Council,"
00:16:49,00:16:52,"apparently, according to this newspaper article I read,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,they banned local artists from displaying paintings
00:16:54,00:16:57,"behind glass and there were a few different reasons they gave,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,but one of them was that someone might
00:16:59,00:17:02,headbutt a picture and cut themselves.
00:17:02,00:17:05,- Who's going around art gallery's headbutting pictures?
00:17:05,00:17:07,- The Millwall fans day out.
00:17:07,00:17:07,(laughing)
00:17:07,00:17:11,"- Oh my God, I'm sorry I even mentioned Millwall."
00:17:11,00:17:13,(laughing)
00:17:13,00:17:18,"- Actually, have you read that the headbutting record world record"
00:17:18,00:17:21,"has recently been set, recently been reset and beaten?"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"And by quite some way, so..."
00:17:23,00:17:24,"- Wait, wait, wait, what, to do what?"
00:17:24,00:17:25,"- Also, this is what you have to do."
00:17:25,00:17:27,You have to crack walnuts with your head.
00:17:27,00:17:30,"And so the record previously was 44 walnuts,"
00:17:30,00:17:31,so you lay walnuts out on a table.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"You just bash, bash, bash."
00:17:33,00:17:35,44 walnuts held by an American.
00:17:35,00:17:37,And then this Pakistani guy called Muhammad Rashid
00:17:37,00:17:40,has reset the record and he cracked 155 walnuts
00:17:40,00:17:42,within the space of a minute.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"- A minute? - One minute, yeah."
00:17:44,00:17:45,"- He's the tiger woods, oh."
00:17:45,00:17:47,(laughing)
00:17:47,00:17:48,- Competitive headbutting.
00:17:48,00:17:50,(laughing)
00:17:50,00:17:52,- I just like to say that Mr Rashid
00:17:52,00:17:53,is not an adulterer.
00:17:53,00:17:55,(laughing)
00:17:55,00:17:56,"- That's what, two and a half, a second?"
00:17:56,00:17:57,Is that right? - Yeah.
00:17:57,00:17:58,- Can I be right?
00:17:58,00:17:59,- But is he smashing a big bunch of them
00:17:59,00:18:00,or are they all in a line?
00:18:00,00:18:01,"- No, no, they're in a line."
00:18:01,00:18:02,You're gonna do one at a time.
00:18:02,00:18:03,"- Wow, yeah."
00:18:03,00:18:05,- I couldn't do that with a hammer.
00:18:05,00:18:06,"- No, I know, that's why you're not even..."
00:18:06,00:18:08,- You're not even anywhere near the competition.
00:18:08,00:18:10,- That's why I failed to place.
00:18:10,00:18:12,(laughing)
00:18:12,00:18:13,"- A turned up with a hammer, B."
00:18:13,00:18:15,(laughing)
00:18:15,00:18:16,- It did not break records.
00:18:16,00:18:18,(laughing)
00:18:18,00:18:20,- We're gonna have to move on in a minute.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"Any last, before we go?"
00:18:22,00:18:24,"- Just, did you hear,"
00:18:24,00:18:25,do you remember reading in 2005
00:18:25,00:18:29,about the exploding frog freak out in Hamburg?
00:18:29,00:18:31,- It's so amazing.
00:18:31,00:18:32,- It's so weird.
00:18:32,00:18:33,"So there was suddenly,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,this started happening in Hamburg.
00:18:35,00:18:37,Thousands of frogs started exploding
00:18:37,00:18:39,"and, you know, spattering their entrails,"
00:18:39,00:18:41,all over the streets and their entrails would spatter up
00:18:41,00:18:43,to like a meter wide.
00:18:43,00:18:44,And people didn't know why they were doing this.
00:18:44,00:18:46,And there were these weird theories flying around
00:18:46,00:18:47,about what was going on.
00:18:47,00:18:48,So some of those hot frogs
00:18:48,00:18:51,were just starting to commit mass suicide
00:18:51,00:18:52,for no apparent reason.
00:18:52,00:18:54,Someone else thought they'd caught a virus
00:18:54,00:18:55,from race horses.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"Go on, James."
00:18:58,00:19:00,- Just wondering where the horse racing theory came from.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"- Yeah, the horse exploding scandal in Hamburg"
00:19:02,00:19:04,the week before was...
00:19:04,00:19:05,(laughing)
00:19:05,00:19:07,I can't believe I didn't mention that.
00:19:07,00:19:09,So what actually happened?
00:19:09,00:19:11,"So what happened was, it turned out it was crows."
00:19:11,00:19:12,So crows had figured out
00:19:12,00:19:13,that you can't eat the whole toad
00:19:13,00:19:15,because it's skin is poisonous.
00:19:15,00:19:17,"And so, you know, you die."
00:19:17,00:19:18,But you can pierce the skin
00:19:18,00:19:20,"and the only good bit of a frog,"
00:19:20,00:19:22,any food connoisseur knows is the liver anyway.
00:19:22,00:19:23,You suck the liver out.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"And then what happens is,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,the liver of these toads
00:19:25,00:19:27,is what's keeping all their organs in.
00:19:27,00:19:29,"And so they end up like,"
00:19:29,00:19:30,they puff up in defense
00:19:30,00:19:32,and all their organs start exploding out of their body.
00:19:32,00:19:33,- Wow.
00:19:33,00:19:34,- Yeah.
00:19:34,00:19:36,- But the crows have a nice bit of foie gras
00:19:36,00:19:37,and aren't poisoned.
00:19:37,00:19:39,So it depends who's side you're on.
00:19:39,00:19:41,(laughing)
00:19:41,00:19:45,"- Okay, we're gonna move on to our next act."
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Time for fact, number three."
00:19:46,00:19:48,And that is Juzinski.
00:19:48,00:19:49,"- Oh yeah, my effect is that"
00:19:49,00:19:52,when the film All Quiet on the Western Front
00:19:52,00:19:54,"was released in Germany,"
00:19:54,00:19:56,Gubbles went to see it at the cinema.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"And within 10 minutes, he'd release stink bombs,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,itching powder and white mice
00:20:01,00:20:04,in order to scare everyone out of the cinema.
00:20:04,00:20:06,"So this was fun guy, Gubbles."
00:20:06,00:20:08,(laughing)
00:20:08,00:20:09,Everyone's favorite clown.
00:20:09,00:20:11,(laughing)
00:20:11,00:20:13,- So he did it 10 minutes in.
00:20:13,00:20:14,"- He started doing it at the start,"
00:20:14,00:20:15,but he wrote in his diary.
00:20:15,00:20:19,"He kept 10,000 pages of diary entries, which my god."
00:20:19,00:20:22,And one of his pages related how he started doing it.
00:20:22,00:20:25,"Within 10 minutes, the whole cinema was in chaos."
00:20:25,00:20:27,"People were running away, itching themselves,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"you know, fainting with the smell."
00:20:29,00:20:31,"- Yeah, they really didn't like that movie, did they?"
00:20:31,00:20:35,'Cause it was the fact that the German soldiers
00:20:35,00:20:36,"died in a not brave way,"
00:20:36,00:20:39,and the French soldiers did die in a more brave way.
00:20:39,00:20:40,- Yeah.
00:20:40,00:20:41,- So it got banned.
00:20:41,00:20:42,"But then ironically in Poland,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,it also got banned because it was pro-German.
00:20:44,00:20:45,- Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:47,- So Germany banned it for being anti-German
00:20:47,00:20:49,and Poland banned it for being pro-German.
00:20:49,00:20:50,- What's pretty crazy as well?
00:20:50,00:20:52,"So I was reading the IMDB page for it today,"
00:20:52,00:20:55,"and in the little trivia bit,"
00:20:55,00:20:58,they were saying that a lot of the extras in the movie
00:20:58,00:21:00,"were actual German soldiers from World War I,"
00:21:00,00:21:02,"who had moved over to America,"
00:21:02,00:21:04,"who they said were doing this thing,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,"and we just want to know about how you would march and so on,"
00:21:06,00:21:08,"and the uniforms, can we have the better look,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"and they all said, ""I'd love to be in the film."""
00:21:10,00:21:12,"And so a lot of the German soldiers in it,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,are actual German soldiers from World War I.
00:21:14,00:21:17,"Pretty crazy, pretty bold casting."
00:21:17,00:21:19,"So the intervention that was kind of,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,"I think you had a lot of brown shirts or the essay,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,"with the brown shirts, to disrupt the..."
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- Yeah, to freak people out, yeah."
00:21:26,00:21:27,"- And then it was, I think it was banned"
00:21:27,00:21:29,shortly afterwards in Germany.
00:21:29,00:21:30,"- It was banned, yes."
00:21:30,00:21:32,"All the Nazis came to power, it was, I think it was 19..."
00:21:32,00:21:34,"- Yeah, it was, it was 2030, and so."
00:21:34,00:21:35,- 2030.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"- But you know, they were already a thing."
00:21:37,00:21:38,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:21:38,00:21:39,"- So yeah, he brought the brown shirts in,"
00:21:39,00:21:41,"and it was banned, and the writer of the original book,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,who was called...
00:21:43,00:21:43,- Remark.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"- Remark had to leave the country,"
00:21:45,00:21:47,"and then he was in fight, so he was told he had to leave,"
00:21:47,00:21:49,"'cause he was in this unpatriotic book,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,and turned into an unpatriotic film.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"And then, girl was obviously rethought that,"
00:21:53,00:21:54,"and wrote him a few months later,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,"and said, ""Actually, no, no, honestly, come back."
00:21:56,00:21:57,"""Do come back."""
00:21:57,00:21:58,"But at this point, you know,"
00:21:58,00:22:00,"people were starting to get the hang of the whole Nazis,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,"not being good guys idea, and so,"
00:22:02,00:22:05,"Remark wrote back and said, ""What, 65 million people"
00:22:05,00:22:06,"""want to get out of the country,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,"""and I'm supposed to come back of my own free will,"
00:22:08,00:22:11,"""not on your life,"" and he never returned,"
00:22:11,00:22:13,which is probably a good move.
00:22:13,00:22:15,He was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for that.
00:22:15,00:22:15,- Who was?
00:22:15,00:22:18,"- Remark, for the film."
00:22:18,00:22:19,"So, it's quite cool."
00:22:19,00:22:22,"You can go on the Nobel Peace Prize website,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,and look at all the nominations that were more than 50 years ago
00:22:24,00:22:25,when they've been released.
00:22:25,00:22:26,"And that saved me in 1931,"
00:22:26,00:22:29,he was nominated for writing all quiet on the Western Front.
00:22:29,00:22:32,"Also, the government of Finland was nominated."
00:22:32,00:22:34,- That's it. - I don't know why.
00:22:34,00:22:35,Yeah.
00:22:35,00:22:38,Just really peace-loving guys back then.
00:22:38,00:22:39,Yeah.
00:22:39,00:22:42,- Not like now when we're all living out of the Finnish jackboot.
00:22:42,00:22:45,(all laughing)
00:22:45,00:22:49,- I have a few things about censorship and stuff.
00:22:49,00:22:50,- Yeah.
00:22:50,00:22:52,- There was a British council
00:22:52,00:22:53,"who banned the life of Brian,"
00:22:53,00:22:56,even though they had no cinemas in their boundaries.
00:22:56,00:22:59,(all laughing)
00:22:59,00:23:02,"- And in 1999, the censors in Bournemouth"
00:23:02,00:23:05,asked to see a sexually explicit French film
00:23:05,00:23:06,"with a view to banning it,"
00:23:06,00:23:10,even though no cinema had expressed any interest in showing it.
00:23:10,00:23:12,(all laughing)
00:23:12,00:23:17,"- Wasn't the first everything not banned,"
00:23:17,00:23:20,but censored in the film industry in this country
00:23:20,00:23:22,was the cheese board.
00:23:22,00:23:23,- Yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:25,"- Sorry, it's not an actual cheese board."
00:23:25,00:23:28,It's like a group of people who talk about cheese a lot.
00:23:28,00:23:30,"And there was a movie that came out where they showed,"
00:23:30,00:23:33,"I think it was close up on cheese and all the bacteria and stuff,"
00:23:33,00:23:34,so they asked for it to be censored.
00:23:34,00:23:35,And it was censored.
00:23:35,00:23:39,It was the first to ask and get of censorship in cinemas.
00:23:39,00:23:40,- Yeah.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"- What a movie though, it sounds great, hey."
00:23:42,00:23:44,- Imagine ordering the cheese board at a restaurant
00:23:44,00:23:48,and you get 12 folks who just love cheese to live at your table.
00:23:48,00:23:50,(all laughing)
00:23:50,00:23:51,- I wish I had had the pudding.
00:23:51,00:23:54,(all laughing)
00:23:54,00:23:56,- On Monty Python's Life of Brian.
00:23:56,00:23:57,- Oh yeah.
00:23:57,00:24:00,- 'Cause it was banned in lots of different local burrows
00:24:00,00:24:02,in the UK as James says.
00:24:02,00:24:06,"And in ""Thanit"" in ""Cent"" the ban was overturned"
00:24:06,00:24:09,"and there were local avas placed in the newspaper saying,"
00:24:09,00:24:11,"""Have you seen Monty Python's Life of Brian?"""
00:24:11,00:24:14,"""Thanit District Council have."""
00:24:14,00:24:16,Because they'd had to see it in order to overturn the ban.
00:24:16,00:24:19,(all laughing)
00:24:19,00:24:20,I think every film should be avid.
00:24:20,00:24:23,(all laughing)
00:24:23,00:24:25,- I was looking at pranking.
00:24:25,00:24:29,"And in the 19th century, electricity-based pranks"
00:24:29,00:24:30,were really fashionable.
00:24:30,00:24:34,'Cause they just discovered how to how to sort of wield electricity.
00:24:34,00:24:37,There were things on sale like electric hammocks.
00:24:37,00:24:38,"You could buy, you lie in a hammock,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,"it'd electrocute someone, that's quite fun."
00:24:40,00:24:42,(all laughing)
00:24:42,00:24:45,"Electric carpets, so someone's walking of your carpet"
00:24:45,00:24:46,"and then you could, it's the same idea."
00:24:46,00:24:47,- Yeah.
00:24:47,00:24:48,(all laughing)
00:24:48,00:24:52,- I read one that was called The Wireless Trick Telephone.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Did you hear about this one?
00:24:53,00:24:54,- Yeah.
00:24:54,00:24:54,"- Okay, The Wireless Trick Telephone."
00:24:54,00:24:56,This is the description for it.
00:24:56,00:24:58,"When the candidate attempts to answer this phone,"
00:24:58,00:25:02,a 32 caliber blank cartridge will explode
00:25:02,00:25:04,"with a loud report, and at the same time,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,white powder will be blown with a strong blast
00:25:06,00:25:08,from the transmitter into his face.
00:25:08,00:25:10,(all laughing)
00:25:10,00:25:11,That's a full-on prank.
00:25:11,00:25:13,And then check this one out.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"The pledge alter, right?"
00:25:15,00:25:17,"This, if you bought it, is an alter."
00:25:17,00:25:19,"It's the size of, like, we've all got alters in our home."
00:25:19,00:25:20,- Exactly.
00:25:20,00:25:21,(all laughing)
00:25:21,00:25:24,- A very practical prank that you'd almost do daily.
00:25:24,00:25:25,- Is it for Vickers making pranks?
00:25:25,00:25:29,"- It must be right, who's using the pledge alter?"
00:25:29,00:25:30,(all laughing)
00:25:30,00:25:32,"Okay, well, let's picture it as there"
00:25:32,00:25:33,and that it is in the church.
00:25:33,00:25:34,This is what happens.
00:25:34,00:25:35,This is the description.
00:25:35,00:25:37,The candidate kneels before the alter in a darkened room
00:25:37,00:25:40,"and when low, up before him jumps a skeleton"
00:25:40,00:25:42,"with large illuminated glaring eyes,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,a blank cartridge is exploding.
00:25:44,00:25:46,(all laughing)
00:25:46,00:25:48,A stream of water hits him in the face.
00:25:48,00:25:51,- An electric shock is shot through his knees.
00:25:51,00:25:53,(all laughing)
00:25:53,00:25:56,"- April Fool's Day, pretty wild in the 1800s."
00:25:56,00:25:57,That's amazing.
00:25:57,00:26:00,"The original thing was about itching powder, wasn't it?"
00:26:00,00:26:01,- Yeah.
00:26:01,00:26:04,"- And in World War II, the British put itching powder"
00:26:04,00:26:08,"into German uniforms to try and, you know."
00:26:08,00:26:09,- I think this isn't the early days
00:26:09,00:26:11,when we weren't sure we wanted to go all out.
00:26:11,00:26:12,(all laughing)
00:26:12,00:26:14,- I'm sure we wanted to pull the full pledge alter drink
00:26:14,00:26:15,on the Germans.
00:26:15,00:26:17,(all laughing)
00:26:17,00:26:20,"- Yeah, they called it itchkrieg, I believe, in the business."
00:26:20,00:26:21,(all laughing)
00:26:21,00:26:22,"No, they did call it that."
00:26:22,00:26:23,- No way.
00:26:23,00:26:24,(all laughing)
00:26:24,00:26:25,- That's amazing.
00:26:25,00:26:27,But how do we get access to German uniforms
00:26:27,00:26:28,to put itching powder in them?
00:26:28,00:26:30,- They infiltrated laundries.
00:26:30,00:26:32,So they had members of the resistance in Germany
00:26:32,00:26:34,"who would go into laundries and then, you know,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,"that, well, it's obvious from there."
00:26:36,00:26:37,(all laughing)
00:26:37,00:26:38,But another thing that happened.
00:26:38,00:26:41,"So in Norway, the Norwegian resistance,"
00:26:41,00:26:44,"when Norway was taken by the Nazis,"
00:26:44,00:26:46,the resistance coated condoms in itching powder
00:26:46,00:26:48,and sold them to the Nazis.
00:26:48,00:26:49,- Wow.
00:26:49,00:26:51,- Which I think caused problems.
00:26:51,00:26:52,- Yeah.
00:26:52,00:26:53,(all laughing)
00:26:53,00:26:55,- Be very stimulating for a second.
00:26:55,00:26:58,(all laughing)
00:26:58,00:27:00,You're so positive about everything that.
00:27:00,00:27:03,(all laughing)
00:27:03,00:27:06,"- You know the seven year rich, it's a saying for,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,"after seven years in relationship,"
00:27:08,00:27:09,it all goes sour or whatever.
00:27:09,00:27:12,It seems to be a thing that a lot of scientists
00:27:12,00:27:14,"do studies on to see when the actual time is,"
00:27:14,00:27:16,"it's not seven years, it's another time."
00:27:16,00:27:19,And obviously the newspapers pick up on it.
00:27:19,00:27:21,There was an article in the Daily Telegraph
00:27:21,00:27:22,a couple of years ago that said it's actually
00:27:22,00:27:25,"a four year rich, not a seven year rich."
00:27:25,00:27:28,The Daily Mail seems to go for this almost weekly.
00:27:28,00:27:29,(all laughing)
00:27:29,00:27:31,They have had various articles over the last few years
00:27:31,00:27:33,"that say, actually, rather than the seven year rich,"
00:27:33,00:27:37,"humans have either a 12 year rich, a five year rich,"
00:27:37,00:27:41,"an 11 year rich, a 25 year rich, a three year rich,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"an 11 month age, or the most recent one I found"
00:27:44,00:27:47,was a two year six month and 25 day rich.
00:27:47,00:27:49,(all laughing)
00:27:49,00:27:51,- I think someone has been supplying the mail HQ
00:27:51,00:27:54,with these condoms that they've done in the describing.
00:27:54,00:27:58,"It's been a very exciting few years for itch science,"
00:27:58,00:27:58,I think.
00:27:58,00:27:59,(all laughing)
00:27:59,00:28:02,"I've seen a number of, we've cracked a lot of mysteries"
00:28:02,00:28:05,"in the last few years, 2011, they worked out"
00:28:05,00:28:08,"why, they've worked out that itching is contagious."
00:28:08,00:28:09,So that's a big moment. - Yeah.
00:28:09,00:28:12,"- And in 2014, they've worked out"
00:28:12,00:28:15,that scratching makes you want to scratch more.
00:28:15,00:28:15,- So when is that contagious?
00:28:15,00:28:16,Do you mean from one person to another?
00:28:16,00:28:18,"- Yeah, so if I, if you start itching,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,"I'll be like, oh, that looks good."
00:28:19,00:28:20,And then I'll just do it.
00:28:20,00:28:22,- We've already established your itching fettish.
00:28:22,00:28:25,(all laughing)
00:28:25,00:28:27,- The only reason Dan knows so much about itch science
00:28:27,00:28:29,in the last few years is he subscribes to itch monthly.
00:28:29,00:28:31,(all laughing)
00:28:31,00:28:32,Itch good.
00:28:32,00:28:34,(all laughing)
00:28:34,00:28:40,"You know, in cinemas, I don't know if anyone here"
00:28:40,00:28:41,"knows about them, but I'd certainly never heard"
00:28:41,00:28:44,the cinemas used to have crying rooms.
00:28:44,00:28:45,Do you know about that?
00:28:45,00:28:46,"Yeah, I know."
00:28:46,00:28:47,So immediately I thought it was for any sort of like
00:28:47,00:28:50,"the wall fans go, I'm not gonna cry here."
00:28:50,00:28:52,And then suddenly the notebook is really getting to them
00:28:52,00:28:54,"and they're just like, I'm just gonna be gone for a minute"
00:28:54,00:28:55,and they go into this room.
00:28:55,00:28:57,It turns out it's for babies.
00:28:57,00:28:58,It's mothers with babies.
00:28:58,00:28:59,They would go in there if it was crying.
00:28:59,00:29:01,So they could continue to watch the movie.
00:29:01,00:29:03,And it would be just a soundproof room.
00:29:03,00:29:04,"They would have speakers coming in,"
00:29:04,00:29:05,but they could watch it from in there
00:29:05,00:29:08,and not have to miss the movie themselves.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"Or fathers, that was really sexist of me,"
00:29:10,00:29:11,fathers and babies.
00:29:11,00:29:13,That sounds like such a fantastic thing.
00:29:13,00:29:15,I quite like the idea of just being individual booths
00:29:15,00:29:17,"for everyone, so I don't have to be there"
00:29:17,00:29:18,anyone else in the cinemas.
00:29:18,00:29:20,I think that's called just your bedroom.
00:29:20,00:29:21,Yeah.
00:29:21,00:29:22,Or the CD or parts of Soho.
00:29:22,00:29:26,There are places where you can do that in.
00:29:26,00:29:27,We're gonna have to move on.
00:29:27,00:29:28,We're gonna have to move on.
00:29:28,00:29:29,We're gonna have to move on.
00:29:29,00:29:32,(all laughing)
00:29:32,00:29:34,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show"
00:29:34,00:29:36,and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:29:36,00:29:37,My fact this week is that
00:29:37,00:29:40,defunct sports from the early 20th century
00:29:40,00:29:44,"include archery golf, boxing on horseback"
00:29:44,00:29:47,and competitive flag pole sitting.
00:29:47,00:29:50,(all laughing)
00:29:50,00:29:52,This is from a book I read recently
00:29:52,00:29:53,and it's such a good book.
00:29:53,00:29:54,I loved it so much.
00:29:54,00:29:56,It's called Fox Tossing Octopus Wrestling
00:29:56,00:29:57,and Other Forgotten Sports
00:29:57,00:29:59,by Edward Brook Hitching.
00:29:59,00:30:01,And it is electric.
00:30:01,00:30:04,It is sort of this list of incredible sports
00:30:04,00:30:05,"that we've forgotten about, so."
00:30:05,00:30:07,"An archery golf just to confirm is archery hyphen golf,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,"not archery, comma, golf."
00:30:09,00:30:10,"All right, 'cause you still have those."
00:30:10,00:30:11,"Ah, yes, yes, yes."
00:30:11,00:30:13,This is where you have golfers and archers
00:30:13,00:30:15,on the same course at the same time.
00:30:15,00:30:16,That's amazing.
00:30:16,00:30:17,(all laughing)
00:30:17,00:30:19,'Cause I read an article where there was one person
00:30:19,00:30:22,the archer was playing against the golfer
00:30:22,00:30:23,is that there was that the standard way
00:30:23,00:30:24,you'd have an archer versus a golfer.
00:30:24,00:30:27,"If you archers take a 10-point handicap against golfers,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,'cause obviously they've got a bow and arrow.
00:30:29,00:30:31,(all laughing)
00:30:31,00:30:32,So the archers fire their shots
00:30:32,00:30:34,and everyone tees off from the same spot except
00:30:34,00:30:36,"the archers are firing towards the,"
00:30:36,00:30:37,what was it called?
00:30:37,00:30:39,(all laughing)
00:30:39,00:30:40,Don't get all technical.
00:30:40,00:30:43,(all laughing)
00:30:43,00:30:45,"And so for the archers, the hole is something"
00:30:45,00:30:47,like a tennis ball balanced on a tink and you have to hit it.
00:30:47,00:30:49,And you have three different kinds of arrow that you use.
00:30:49,00:30:51,You have a light one for the first drive
00:30:51,00:30:54,and then a really heavy one for the putting.
00:30:54,00:30:57,"Yeah, and people played it until the 1970s as a sport."
00:30:57,00:30:58,Sounds great.
00:30:58,00:30:59,How about horse boxing?
00:30:59,00:31:00,Talk us through that.
00:31:00,00:31:02,Is that boxing against a horse?
00:31:02,00:31:03,"Yeah, no."
00:31:03,00:31:07,Is two guys sitting on the horseback and boxing each other
00:31:07,00:31:10,and you lose if the other guy knocks you off your horse
00:31:10,00:31:12,and you're unable to get back on within 10 seconds?
00:31:12,00:31:13,(all laughing)
00:31:13,00:31:14,"Well, it's similar to chess boxing, right?"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"People like to inject boxing, I think,"
00:31:16,00:31:19,into other sports to make other sports more exciting.
00:31:19,00:31:21,Like chess boxing where you play a round of chess
00:31:21,00:31:22,and then you do a round of boxing.
00:31:22,00:31:24,And I think the winner is the person either
00:31:24,00:31:26,who manages to checkmate the other person
00:31:26,00:31:27,or to knock them unconscious.
00:31:27,00:31:29,"I don't really, it doesn't sound fair that, does it?"
00:31:29,00:31:30,"'Cause I'm okay at chess,"
00:31:30,00:31:33,but probably would get knocked out immediately in boxing.
00:31:33,00:31:35,So you have to get checkedmate pretty fast.
00:31:35,00:31:37,"Well, that's, you've got to be multi-talented."
00:31:37,00:31:39,"And also, you probably get increasingly worse at chess"
00:31:39,00:31:40,than all you are concussed.
00:31:40,00:31:41,(all laughing)
00:31:41,00:31:43,"Yeah, but then the other person"
00:31:43,00:31:46,doesn't get worse at boxing the more I put him closer to that area.
00:31:46,00:31:47,(all laughing)
00:31:47,00:31:49,"If anything, it'll only make him angry."
00:31:49,00:31:52,(all laughing)
00:31:52,00:31:55,"Just on the horseboxing thing,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"you had to wear boxing gloves, obviously,"
00:31:57,00:31:58,"'cause they played by Queen's B rules,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,but that made it very hard to grip the reins.
00:32:00,00:32:04,So most of the round involved lining your horse up next
00:32:04,00:32:05,to the other guy's horse.
00:32:05,00:32:07,(all laughing)
00:32:07,00:32:09,It's really hard to do with boxing gloves on.
00:32:09,00:32:10,Yeah.
00:32:10,00:32:11,(all laughing)
00:32:11,00:32:14,"So a few other of the sports that was in that book,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,I did have a look through the book and it's amazing.
00:32:17,00:32:20,"Ice tennis, which seems really cool,"
00:32:20,00:32:23,"is literally what it says, it is."
00:32:23,00:32:24,Phone booth stuffing.
00:32:24,00:32:25,(all laughing)
00:32:25,00:32:27,"And the record is 25,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,just if anyone wants to go against it.
00:32:30,00:32:31,"Yeah, and flag pole sitting, that's my favorite one."
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:32,00:32:35,"Yeah, because they produced huge celebrities off the back of it."
00:32:35,00:32:36,(all laughing)
00:32:36,00:32:38,"No, honestly, so there was one guy, in particular,"
00:32:38,00:32:41,called Alvin Shipwreck Kelly.
00:32:41,00:32:45,"So no one's quite sure why he's called Shipwreck,"
00:32:45,00:32:47,other than he claimed to be involved in five shipwrecks.
00:32:47,00:32:48,And...
00:32:48,00:32:49,That's probably why.
00:32:49,00:32:50,"Well, no, but..."
00:32:50,00:32:53,(all laughing)
00:32:53,00:32:54,He claimed he'd been on the Titanic.
00:32:54,00:32:56,"Yeah, but people aren't sure about that,"
00:32:56,00:33:00,'cause the passenger records seem to not indicate a hint.
00:33:00,00:33:01,"Yes, yeah."
00:33:01,00:33:02,"His, I don't think you'd let someone"
00:33:02,00:33:04,call Shipwreck on the Titanic.
00:33:04,00:33:06,(all laughing)
00:33:06,00:33:08,He probably gave him a false name.
00:33:08,00:33:10,"John Iceberg Smith, welcome on board."
00:33:10,00:33:11,(all laughing)
00:33:11,00:33:12,"They're all good, mate."
00:33:12,00:33:13,Nice to see you.
00:33:13,00:33:17,"But pole sitting genuinely was, I think,"
00:33:17,00:33:20,a proper fad in the 1920s and 30s.
00:33:20,00:33:23,"In America, people were really into it"
00:33:23,00:33:24,and constantly breaking records for it.
00:33:24,00:33:27,And so I was looking into the British newspaper archive
00:33:27,00:33:31,during that time and we really disapproved of it.
00:33:31,00:33:32,Like every single article that references pole sitting
00:33:32,00:33:35,in America talks about this degrading exhibition
00:33:35,00:33:37,has now reached the dangerous stage.
00:33:37,00:33:39,"So basically, I mean, the competition is you just sit"
00:33:39,00:33:41,at the top of a pole for as long as you possibly can
00:33:41,00:33:43,until it gets uncomfortable and then you come back down.
00:33:43,00:33:45,We thought poles would be quite spiky at the top.
00:33:45,00:33:46,They opened up a platform.
00:33:46,00:33:47,"I mean, I don't know what to do with that."
00:33:47,00:33:49,"It's really, really tiny, you know?"
00:33:49,00:33:51,"Yeah, but, you know..."
00:33:51,00:33:52,(all laughing)
00:33:52,00:33:53,"Frozen balls, guys."
00:33:53,00:33:54,(all laughing)
00:33:54,00:33:57,71 hours was the record in the Don D'Courier
00:33:57,00:33:58,that was reported.
00:33:58,00:34:00,"Well, Shipwreck Kelly supposedly sat on it"
00:34:00,00:34:03,for 49 days and one hour.
00:34:03,00:34:04,"Yeah, that's good."
00:34:04,00:34:05,"Yeah, that's pretty amazing."
00:34:05,00:34:07,It's very much the Tiger Woods of pole sitting there.
00:34:07,00:34:09,(all laughing)
00:34:09,00:34:13,He did a 28 city tour of sitting on poles.
00:34:13,00:34:16,And he did a tour and he charged people with roof access
00:34:16,00:34:18,so that they could see him at the top of his pole.
00:34:18,00:34:21,So you bought tickets to the roof of buildings
00:34:21,00:34:22,and you could watch him doing it.
00:34:22,00:34:23,He did it all through his life.
00:34:23,00:34:24,"That's it, David Blaney, isn't it?"
00:34:24,00:34:25,"Yeah, exactly."
00:34:25,00:34:26,Yeah.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"And he, for sleeping, obviously,"
00:34:28,00:34:29,'cause you would have to sleep a bit.
00:34:29,00:34:33,He would cut holes into the side of the flagpole
00:34:33,00:34:34,and put his fingers in there.
00:34:34,00:34:38,"And then if he slept and he started to sag right down,"
00:34:38,00:34:40,"it would hurt his fingers and he'd sort of, you know,"
00:34:40,00:34:41,stay up there.
00:34:41,00:34:42,Like that.
00:34:42,00:34:43,"Yeah, keep him up."
00:34:43,00:34:44,Keep him up there.
00:34:44,00:34:45,"It's a not career choice, isn't it?"
00:34:45,00:34:46,"It is, yeah."
00:34:46,00:34:49,"He died, you know, broke many years after the glory days."
00:34:49,00:34:50,"Yeah, exactly."
00:34:50,00:34:51,His career went downhill.
00:34:51,00:34:53,He got hit by a car.
00:34:53,00:34:55,"And he, so he died from being hit by this car"
00:34:55,00:34:57,and they found on him a scrapbook of his life.
00:34:57,00:35:01,"And it was called, the title was, ""The luckiest fool on earth."""
00:35:01,00:35:02,"Ooh, ironic."
00:35:02,00:35:03,Yeah.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"I want to know, the name of this book"
00:35:05,00:35:07,"was octopus, something, and fox tossing."
00:35:07,00:35:09,What's fox tossing?
00:35:09,00:35:12,"You have an arena, right?"
00:35:12,00:35:14,And you get men and women lined up opposite each other.
00:35:14,00:35:16,"And you're all holding long, long strips of cloth,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,loose and slack on the ground.
00:35:18,00:35:21,You release a load of foxes into the arena.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"When they run over the bit that you're holding,"
00:35:23,00:35:24,"you and your partner pull it taut,"
00:35:24,00:35:27,and the fox flies into the air.
00:35:27,00:35:29,That was a genuine sport that the aristocracy played
00:35:29,00:35:31,in the 17th century in Europe.
00:35:31,00:35:34,And the fun was in seeing the foxes die.
00:35:34,00:35:36,The fun was in seeing the foxes fly through the air.
00:35:36,00:35:38,I think that's biostroporting.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"Well, we're not all as wholesome as you, Anna."
00:35:40,00:35:44,"I read an article about that, and the end of the article"
00:35:44,00:35:48,said it was not unknown for the terrified animals
00:35:48,00:35:50,to turn on the tosses.
00:35:50,00:35:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:53,00:35:56,There was a spot in ancient Egypt called Fisherman's
00:35:56,00:35:57,Jousting.
00:35:57,00:35:59,It was really popular.
00:35:59,00:36:01,"And you would basically get people in boats,"
00:36:01,00:36:02,"and they were joust against each other,"
00:36:02,00:36:04,trying to knock each other off the boat.
00:36:04,00:36:06,And it took place on the Nile.
00:36:06,00:36:07,"But of course, the worst thing about the Nile"
00:36:07,00:36:09,is it's full of crocodiles.
00:36:09,00:36:11,"And because the crocodiles were sacred,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,it was illegal to fight back.
00:36:13,00:36:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:14,00:36:15,That'll get you anywhere.
00:36:15,00:36:17,"You'll be in big trouble, mister,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,if you fight back against the crocodile that's eating you.
00:36:19,00:36:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:22,00:36:24,What legal sanction exactly can we work?
00:36:24,00:36:25,It's true.
00:36:25,00:36:27,"It's a very much a no-win situation, isn't it?"
00:36:27,00:36:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:30,00:36:35,Do you know the national sport of Afghanistan?
00:36:35,00:36:36,No.
00:36:36,00:36:38,Is goat dragging?
00:36:38,00:36:42,"But Buzz Cashy, which is played in countries"
00:36:42,00:36:44,"across Central Asia, but it's like Polo,"
00:36:44,00:36:47,"but with instead of a ball, a headless goat."
00:36:47,00:36:50,"So the goat's been stied already, and you've removed the head."
00:36:50,00:36:53,"Yeah, it's been stied already once you've removed the head."
00:36:53,00:36:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:55,00:36:55,I know.
00:36:55,00:36:57,"I said that in the right order, I think."
00:36:57,00:36:59,"It died, then you removed the head."
00:36:59,00:37:01,"And then you have to drag it towards a goal,"
00:37:01,00:37:02,and then throw it through a goal.
00:37:02,00:37:04,"I don't know why you'd use a goat instead of a ball,"
00:37:04,00:37:05,maybe they're short and balls.
00:37:05,00:37:07,But that's the national sport of Afghanistan.
00:37:07,00:37:07,They love it.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"Well, we would have used a pig splatter for soccer,"
00:37:10,00:37:10,and black in the old days.
00:37:10,00:37:12,"Not an entire pig, though."
00:37:12,00:37:12,No.
00:37:12,00:37:15,It's much more unwieldy.
00:37:15,00:37:17,"And mill all, apparently, they do, though."
00:37:17,00:37:21,I don't know if you know about that.
00:37:21,00:37:23,Can I tell you a bit more about flag poles?
00:37:23,00:37:23,Yeah.
00:37:23,00:37:25,Just the flag-positing thing.
00:37:25,00:37:28,So I think the all-time champion of flag-pole setting
00:37:28,00:37:32,"was a saint called Simion Stylites, who lived up a pole"
00:37:32,00:37:34,for 36 years.
00:37:34,00:37:37,And he started with a flag-pole six feet off the ground.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"Oh, sorry, not a flag-pole, but just"
00:37:39,00:37:40,a little platform on a pole.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"And then he went to a higher one, until he eventually"
00:37:42,00:37:44,was 60 feet up in the air.
00:37:44,00:37:44,Why aren't you just--
00:37:44,00:37:45,He lived up there.
00:37:45,00:37:49,And I read a book about early Christianity
00:37:49,00:37:53,"about this guy, and as it says, what was he doing?"
00:37:53,00:37:55,There are lots of theories as to why he did it.
00:37:55,00:37:57,Either he found the crowds who approached him asking
00:37:57,00:37:59,for wisdom and advice to exhausting.
00:37:59,00:38:03,Or he-- I read one theory that he wanted to be physically
00:38:03,00:38:07,"closer to Christ, because Christ is in the sky."
00:38:07,00:38:09,Or he wanted just a more Spartan existence
00:38:09,00:38:11,than he could get in a monastery.
00:38:11,00:38:14,"And his Wikipedia page says, ""It has been stated that,"
00:38:14,00:38:17,"as he seemed to be unable to avoid escaping the world horizontally,"
00:38:17,00:38:21,"he may have thought to attempt to try to escape it vertically."""
00:38:21,00:38:25,"Nobody says what he did with his poo, though."
00:38:25,00:38:27,"Because he'd have to drop it off, wouldn't he?"
00:38:27,00:38:29,"He just threw it, held it at those irritating people,"
00:38:29,00:38:33,constantly asking him for advice down at the bottom.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"Because he still has followers, doesn't he?"
00:38:35,00:38:38,"I think his most well-known followers,"
00:38:38,00:38:42,"guy called Maxime Cav Taradze, and he's a 59-year-old monk,"
00:38:42,00:38:46,"and he's been living on a stone pillar in Georgia,"
00:38:46,00:38:47,and he comes down once a week.
00:38:47,00:38:50,But he spends basically his entire life up on top of this pillar.
00:38:50,00:38:51,He climbs his hundred and thirty-one foot ladder.
00:38:51,00:38:56,He has to have staff who pull by a pulley system his food
00:38:56,00:38:57,and supplies up to him.
00:38:57,00:39:01,So these people need to be well-stuffed.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"And yeah, he dropped down twice a week to give some advice"
00:39:03,00:39:05,"to his following message, and then he pops back up onto the pillar"
00:39:05,00:39:07,and hangs out there.
00:39:07,00:39:08,What a good man.
00:39:08,00:39:09,We're going to have to wrap up in a sec.
00:39:09,00:39:12,So have we got anything thrown in before we go?
00:39:12,00:39:14,The current setting up a poll competition record
00:39:14,00:39:15,is held by a poll.
00:39:15,00:39:16,That's all.
00:39:16,00:39:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:18,00:39:25,"His name is Daniel Baraniuk, and he is from Poland."
00:39:25,00:39:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:26,00:39:29,196 days for fans who are in.
00:39:29,00:39:31,"OK, we are going to have to wrap up."
00:39:31,00:39:32,That is it.
00:39:32,00:39:33,That is all of our facts.
