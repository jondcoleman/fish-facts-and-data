WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.160
 Yeah.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.720
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.560
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:23.880
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.960
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 My name is Dan Triber.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 I'm sitting here with three other elves

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.920
 and it's Zinsky, James Arkin, and Anne Miller.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.120
 And we've got on fact checking duties today, Alex Bell.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphone

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.640
 to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.960
 So in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.320
 Fact number one, James.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.400
 OK, my fact is the world record for most kicks to one's own head

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.560
 is 127 in a minute.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.360
 Jeez, so more than two a second.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.600
 That's more than two a second.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.560
 That's a lot of kicks.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.680
 How did he do it?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.200
 Well, there's a video on the Guinness Book of Records website, I think.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.520
 It's, I think he's like kind of a martial arts guy

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.320
 and he's very supple and fast and--

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.240
 Possibly stupid.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.760
 And possibly slightly mental.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.000
 But that means for him to do that speed, he has to be going, like, literally--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.640
 Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.960
 Is he related to Roy Kirby, who I know is the guy who's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.360
 spoken the Guinness World Record, he's also a martial arts guy for the hardest kick to the groin.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.600
 Oh, no!

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.240
 I think he took a 22 mile an hour kick to the groin with 1100 pounds of force

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.480
 and didn't register any pain at all, he said.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.000
 Yeah.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 He's built up a pain threshold.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.680
 Apparently they do it in a certain type of martial art.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.800
 And I can't remember what it's called, where basically you run hard objects

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.680
 over your muscles every day and it sort of pulverises the nerve fibers

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.880
 and causes fractures to the bone.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.320
 And then when they heal, the body compensates by adding extra calcium to you,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.840
 which means that you stop feeling pain.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.360
 Here's a newspaper article that I found, which is somewhat related to Anna's fact.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.200
 Yeah.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.800
 A 28-year-old man who claimed to be acting out of curiosity when he asked seven women

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 to kick him in the groin was sentenced yesterday to 60 days in jail.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.520
 One of the women, afraid of what he might do if she refused, kicked him repeatedly.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.520
 Oh my god.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.320
 The guy thanked her and left on his bicycle.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.400
 Which I have no seat.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.240
 So the court asked his wife what she thought about it.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.560
 And she told the court that she was at a loss to explain his consult.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.360
 And she said, "I can honestly say I find this as odd and peculiar

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.480
 and disturbing as everyone else."

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.120
 I wanted to look more into this guy, Joel Lindecker.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.000
 He's the guy who kicked himself in the head 127 times.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.600
 He's broken his own record a number of times.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.200
 So on one of the occasions, he was interviewed by someone

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.240
 and they said, "Can I see an example of you doing this?"

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.000
 And he said, "Yeah, sure."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And so he did it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 He only managed 80.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.360
 But what was great was the interview afterwards.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.320
 The interview is going, "Wow, I don't know what to say after seeing such a spectacle.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.320
 How do you feel?"

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.520
 And he was breathing heavily and he's like, "Oh, I'm really exhausted.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.000
 It's really tiring."

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.320
 She starts trying to interview him and he just keeps getting more and more concussed

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.160
 and out of it.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160
 Yeah.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.440
 She says, "So how often do you do this?"

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.520
 He's like, "Oh, I pretty much only do it when I know that I'm going to be making a record attempt.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.560
 I don't really practice in my spare time or anything."

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560
 Sorry.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 Can I get a second?

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.560
 I'm really light-headed right now.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.560
 She goes, "Sure, sure.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560
 Don't pass out.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560
 He bends down.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 Hands on these.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560
 Takes deep breaths.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.560
 I might actually have to sit down or something."

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.480
 Can we do this interview inside?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.080
 She basically is just totally concussed off the back of it.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.800
 And the first time he did it, he did it with shoes on and he didn't know that he should

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.800
 have done that.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.400
 And now he does it with either socks or--

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 Slipper socks.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400
 Where's Slipper?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 You're right.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400
 No, he does it barefoot or with socks on.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.800
 I imagine the interview would be like, "So, how do you feel about kicking yourself 127 times

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800
 in the head?"

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.600
 He's like, "What are you talking about?"

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 Yes.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600
 He's gone to hell.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600
 Who are you?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600
 Who am I?

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 There is another Guinness World Record champ.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.360
 He's called Ashreeta Ferman and he was born the year the first Guinness Book of World

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.960
 Records came out and he holds the Guinness World Record for holding the most Guinness World

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.960
 Records.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:22.000
 So, he's had 533 and 189 are still active and they include Pogo Stick Jumping Under Water,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.120
 popcorn sculpture, balancing most eggs on head, M&Ms eaten blindfolded with chopsticks and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.000
 drinking 200 milliliters of mustard.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Wow.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Wow.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 So, the really serious record is breaking the legs.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Does it include?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Yeah.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Does it include this one?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Longest distance pulled by a horse while on fire?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Yeah.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 I've seen that guy.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Yeah.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 He was dragged 1,551 feet while on fire by a horse.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.360
 I think the funnest world record to break is the most rotations hanging from a power drill

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.600
 in a minute, which is 148, it was in 2008, but it's not fun.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.480
 So, this guy just attached a power drill to the ceiling, held onto it and just spun around

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480
 on it for a minute.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.480
 I want to start doing that recreationally.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480
 That is great.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.040
 So, this one I found was for this distance of squirting milk from eyes.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040
 Nice.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040
 Oh, wow.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.040
 279.5 centimeters.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.040
 Well, why is milk coming out of your eyes?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.040
 Shouldn't you see something about that?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.040
 Yeah.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.720
 People do it because their sinuses are all attached and they snort it through, then I was

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.520
 and shoot it through the eyes.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.520
 I think students do it.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.520
 I have a friend at school.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.920
 He could put a whole cocktail stick up his nose.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920
 Don't do that.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920
 They can kill you.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920
 Wow.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920
 That was his part.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.920
 Alfred Kinsey could put a whole toothbrush up his penis.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920
 Chris led first.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920
 I don't mind that.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.920
 What?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920
 Really?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.920
 Yeah.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.920
 He's a sexologist.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920
 Alfred Kinsey.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.920
 Yeah.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.920
 Alfred Kinsey from the 50s.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.920
 Yeah, his party trick was to put--

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920
 Party trick.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.920
 Who wants to see that?

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920
 Wait, wait.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920
 I've got a great--

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.920
 The guy who got women's kingdom and the bulls was arrested.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920
 I hope he was arrested at some point.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920
 Shall we invite Alfred to the wedding?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.920
 Well--

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920
 So there's party piece.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920
 Can we search his bag on the way in?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.120
 If there's a toothbrush in there, no way.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.560
 In 2009, Jonathan Lee Riches filed an injunction against the Guinness Book of Records seeking

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.360
 to stop them from naming him as the most litigious individual in the history of mankind.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.360
 Brilliant.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.640
 We might have to bleep his name out of this podcast.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.640
 Yeah.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.640
 That's brilliant.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.640
 Evil Knievel used to have a lot of world records.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.640
 Did he?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640
 Do you remember him?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.600
 He would jump over buses on a bike and stuff like that.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.120
 As far as I can say, I think there is one record that he still owns.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.200
 This is really hard to Google, but I think there's one thing that he still owns.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.480
 Can you guess what it is?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.480
 Most bones broken?

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480
 It's correct.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.480
 Is it?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480
 Yes.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480
 Yes.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.640
 That's one thing that I know about him.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.240
 As you watch videos of him, it's actually in terms of Shardin Freud, the funniest video

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.240
 is online.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.880
 Because you see this man just like, "Yeah, I'm going to own it.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.880
 I look at these buses.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880
 I'm going to go right over them.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.760
 It's going to be awesome at every single time."

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.720
 He just collapses and just flies across the ground.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.080
 The guy who has related to the guy who has the record for the furthest ever flown in

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.880
 a car crash was Matthew McNight.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.420
 It was in 2018, he flew 118 feet, but while he was recovering in a hospital, his doctor

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.620
 brought him the forms to sign, the Guinness forms to sign, to prove that he had flown further

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.920
 than anyone else, but I just think it's a very unsympathetic doctor move, like a couple

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.920
 of days.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920
 He broke all of his bones.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920
 I'm not thinking of that record.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.920
 Yeah, not as many as evil can evil.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.920
 Yeah.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920
 Correct.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.880
 We should try and think up a record that we can break.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.720
 Here's one that we could break.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.880
 The most Ferrero rushes eaten in one minute is ten.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880
 Yes.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.920
 Is it like crackers, they dry your mouth, that's who you think it's easy.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920
 Or is it cinnamon?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.840
 In the middle they have like, it's kind of liquidy.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.840
 I could eat ten in a minute.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840
 Yeah.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.840
 Alex, have you got anything to add before we wrap up?

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.840
 Yeah, I did find that in 2006, the man who holds the world record for spending the most

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.000
 time in a cage of centipedes married the woman who held the same record, but with scorpions.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Oh, great.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.840
 Okay, it's time now to move on to fact number two, Anne.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.480
 Yes, there is a bear in the Pyrenees who is facing castration because he has fathered nearly

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.480
 all the other bears.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.480
 Oh, that's a bit harsh.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.480
 I think it's harsh.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.480
 Well done, him.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.480
 Well done, him.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.480
 I would say well done, him.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480
 He's amazing.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.960
 He's called Pyros and there are about 30 bears and there are only four other males and

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.320
 none of them have followed any bears themselves.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.400
 But the problem is, officials don't like it because they're worried that he's ruining their

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400
 gene pool, basically.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.000
 And there was recently a bear born that was his daughter and his granddaughter and they started

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.440
 to get a bit worried that this is problematic, the problem with Pyros is bears generally

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.840
 stop being sexually active around 19, but a Pyros is 26 and still going.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840
 Wow.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.040
 Are the bears becoming increasingly more deformed?

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.400
 I think a bear always looks pretty good, so you can't tell they're deformed and they're

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.400
 all there for.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.880
 Well, Pliny didn't think that was true.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.800
 You thought when a baby bear was born, it was completely shapeless and that they got into

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.120
 their bear shape by being licked into shape by their mothers.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.480
 I think everything when it's brand new is quite strange shape and they start getting more

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480
 of their shape when they're--

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480
 Yeah.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480
 That's a good excuse.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.760
 I'm not sure what his excuse was for saying that they had very dim eyes when they're

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.320
 born and the way that they get their eyes better is to allow bees to sting their faces

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.920
 to improve their eyesight.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.120
 I was-- I got very interested in the idea of this bear because I didn't realize that their

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.960
 sex drive was so high, so I did a very quick Google on it.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.960
 I didn't get very far.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.960
 What did you Google?

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.960
 Pony bears.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.960
 [laughter]

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.720
 I mean something very different in the gay community.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.400
 Which I didn't-- I completely forgot.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400
 I did know that.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.400
 I completely forgot.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.480
 So just anyone out there, if you do click, "Hornie Bear" into Google, don't then click

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.920
 on the link that says, "My favorite hot and horny bears, certainly don't do it at work."

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.920
 Imagine that we're all completely misunderstanding this news article.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.920
 [laughter]

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920
 Oh dear.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.920
 Okay.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.920
 There's a bear in the Bible.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.600
 It was a few actually, but one of them I like, and the biblical prophet Elisha wants cursed

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.780
 a group of children who teased him for being bold as a result they were mulled by bears

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.780
 and killed.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.780
 Yeah.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.780
 I love that story.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.760
 Because it's something ridiculous, like 42 kids, like it's a lot of children.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.760
 And they're like, "Boldie, boldie."

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.760
 And he's like, "Right.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.760
 Fine.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.760
 You're going to get killed by bears."

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.560
 So, do you know what you had to do if you were attacked by bears?

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.560
 I think we covered on this.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560
 There's a witch bear in the bear, isn't it?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560
 Yeah, that's right.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.560
 What's that?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.400
 So, you might be attacked by a brown bear or a black bear.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.400
 Yes.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.240
 The problem is that brown bears are sometimes black and black bears are sometimes brown, so

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.480
 it's hard to tell.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.160
 If you're attacked by a brown bear, then you should play dead.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.320
 But if you're attacked by a black bear and you play dead, you'll almost certainly be

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.320
 killed.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.320
 Yeah.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.320
 Yeah.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.320
 They didn't dress like brown.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320
 Oh yeah, and they're just like, "Oh, this is so much easy."

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.120
 They also be like, "I want a chase. I don't need just a light bear."

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120
 Pirates, shaggers.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
 Probably shaggers.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.120
 Yeah.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.360
 Peter the Great trained up two bears.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.680
 He had two white bears to serve vodka to his guests.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.520
 And if they didn't accept the vodka, then he would train the bear to harass them, which

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.720
 I think might explain Russia's vodka problem because you're not going to turn down vodka

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.720
 from an angry bear.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.720
 What do you mean, "harass them"?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.720
 Just like nod you.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720
 Come on, mate.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.720
 Come on.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.720
 The other thing is a white bear is presumably a polar bear.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720
 Yeah.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.440
 The other kind of bear is a spectacled bear.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.400
 They actually have markings like they're wearing a pair of glasses.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.800
 They're amazing if you haven't seen them.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800
 Look them up.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.800
 Isn't Paddington based on--

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.800
 That's what I was going.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800
 Yeah.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.400
 Because they are the only bear found in South America.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.480
 So Paddington by default must be a spectacled bear.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.960
 But of course, we know he's not a polar.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.320
 But I like the idea of Paddington with glasses.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.400
 And Paddington was originally going to be from deepest darkest Africa, but the problem

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.200
 with that is there are no bears in Africa.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200
 There's no bears in Africa, isn't there?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200
 Is it true that Byron had a bear?

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.200
 Yeah.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200
 Yeah.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200
 So that's true.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200
 We've discussed this in the vodka, actually.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200
 I'm sorry to Oxford.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.680
 Any time that I've seen news about this bear, the one thing that doesn't come up is the name

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.680
 of the bear.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680
 Oh.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.800
 How do we know that he had a bear, yet the name of the bear has not made it through?

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.960
 One more bear thing I didn't know was that during the Cold War in the 1960s Americans tested

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.040
 their supersonic ejector seats on bears, and they fired bears out of the ejector seats

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.000
 and then tested how safely they landed.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And they survived, actually.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 But then they had to put the bears down to study what had happened to their spines and

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 what happened to their internal organs.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.160
 And so they were launching bears out of airplanes.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160
 Yeah, there were pictures.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.880
 These bears look pretty terrifying.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.120
 How did they get a bear in an ejector seat?

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.120
 Yeah.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.120
 They must have been drugged.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120
 They were drugs.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.800
 So we did the thing on QI about the pig face ladies, which was actually a shaved bear in

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800
 a dress.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.320
 And they used to get the bears really drunk before they shaved them.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320
 Yeah.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320
 That's insane.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.600
 Hey, do you know what a, it's either the pronunciation is "tap it" or "tap it."

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.560
 I'm not sure what the pronunciation is.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.200
 It's associated with bears, do you know what that is?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200
 T-A-P-P-E-T.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200
 What?

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200
 I don't think I know that word.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.640
 It's basically the blockage that is created when they go into hibernation.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.640
 Like a butt plug.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.640
 It's a butt plug.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640
 Yeah.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.640
 Yeah, a butt plug of hair.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640
 Yeah.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.640
 It's amazing.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.640
 For seven months, they can sleep.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.440
 They don't eat, drink, urinate, defecate.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.440
 How do you do that?

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440
 Seven months.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.440
 It's like...

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440
 By plugging up your butt.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.960
 My mind's blown by hibernation.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.960
 Yeah, no.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.960
 They do.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.640
 They're going to to topper, which is slightly different, but some female bears can give birth

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.640
 while they're asleep.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.640
 What?

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.640
 Yeah.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.640
 Wow.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.640
 It's not all of them, but some of them.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.240
 They must have a seriously high-paying threshold.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.240
 I think they just pass out drunk for a full seven months, that kind of explains that.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.240
 And they do like alcohol.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.240
 Well, Boy Check the Bear loved beer, didn't he?

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.080
 Boy Check who helped the polls in World War II, carrying artillery back and forth.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080
 OK.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.440
 But his favourite drink was beer, and he loved a cigarette.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.440
 This was a bear.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440
 Yeah, Boy Check the Bear.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440
 He's really famous.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.920
 I think there's a statue of him in Princess Street now in Edinburgh because he, when the rest

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920
 of his days in Scotland, I think.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.400
 Well, we've also got that penguin at Edinburgh Zoo, Neil's all-off, is he a Norwegian guard?

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400
 Yeah.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400
 A knighthood?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.200
 We are going to have to move on.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.000
 Alex, have you got anything you want to add?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.760
 Only that Byron's bear was called Bruin.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.760
 We know his name.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.760
 Oh, OK.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.520
 Bruin is just a name for a bear, though, really, isn't it?

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.760
 It also just sounds like a misspelling of Byron, right?

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.720
 That down wrong at Cambridge.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.680
 OK, time to move on to fact number three, and that's my fact.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:15.040
 And that is, Poland's only official ghost hunter thinks that ghosts have given up on haunting

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.040
 humans.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040
 Oh.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.040
 Yeah.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.000
 Now, it's amazing that Poland has an official registered ghost hunter to begin with.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Yeah.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.520
 Finally, he's very dispirited because he thinks that we've become all too skeptical and that ghosts

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.520
 are no longer interested in humans.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.080
 Or it could be that he's a very, very bad hunter, and he just can't find them because he's

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.920
 a rowish hunter, and he's blaming it on them disappearing.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.920
 That's very true.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.960
 I mean, I know that in Bhutan, there's an official Yeti hunter, and he's been working for

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960
 the king.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.640
 He's under his second king now, because the new king took over, and he's been working

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.640
 with him for something like 20 odd years.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.640
 And nothing.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.640
 He's, you know, nothing.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.640
 Really?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.480
 But what he said is, as the reason we haven't seen any, is that, A, they have the ability to

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.800
 turn themselves invisible.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.840
 Secondly, he says that they have the ability to take their feet off and put them back on

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840
 the other way around.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.320
 So when it looks like they've walked one way, in fact, they've gone the other way.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.320
 They're sneaky.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.760
 It's very hard to tell where Yeti's gone.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.360
 Well, I've been to Bhutan, and they have a Yeti sanctuary, don't they?

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360
 They do.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.360
 Sanctuary.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360
 Yes.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.360
 They have a Yeti park.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.360
 It's an actual Yeti park where there are, like, park rangers.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.840
 We look after the Yetis.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.040
 So when you say an official ghost hunter, is this like a government sanctioned post?

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.040
 Yeah.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.160
 I mean, presumably he's just a private guy and people pay him to go and hunt for ghosts, right?

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.160
 Yeah, I think that's what it is.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.400
 And people have stopped paying him now, because they don't believe in ghosts anymore and he

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400
 is a bit pissed off.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.600
 So he's decided to claim that the ghosts are angry with people.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.040
 I think they might have gone to Wales, because last year, the Welsh police force received

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.120
 13 reports of ghosts up from only two in 2010.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.120
 Bloody Polish immigrants.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.160
 Is this what people are talking about when they say that?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.720
 I could say that because I'm half Polish.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:53.720
 But as well as finding 13 ghosts in Wales, South Wales police also got reports of three zombies,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.920
 two werewolves, two vampires and six witches.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920
 Wow.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.720
 I think they're unlike a paranormal voter, because notting him in 2011, the company said in

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.240
 the last six years, they had 34 cases of ghosts.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.720
 And they also had 46 witchcraft and three UFOs, all of which turned out to be Chinese lanterns.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.720
 Yeah.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.000
 Chinese lanterns are often the most mistaken object for a UFO.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.160
 They did this huge breakdown of everything that people thought was a UFO and what it actually

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.160
 turned out to be.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.680
 And Chinese lanterns was way up.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.120
 Right at the bottom, two percent of all UFO sightings turned out to be the moon.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.680
 Do you know about the big ghostly frenzy that happened in London back in 1762?

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680
 I do not.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.680
 Okay.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680
 This is the story.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.720
 It's called Scratching Fanny of Cocklay.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.720
 Oh, yes, I do know about it.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.720
 Yeah.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.320
 Scratching Fanny of Cocklay is amazing.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.320
 Just for anybody who doesn't know it.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.160
 In 1762, there was a public frenzy in London over the ghost of Fanny Kent, scratching

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.840
 and knocking coded messages from behind the wall of a room where she lived.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.800
 The owner of the house saw tickets so that you could witness it and storeholders, hold

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.520
 refreshments to crowds who are gathering outside.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.760
 So it was a really big thing.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.240
 The Duke of York came to see it, Samuel Johnson came.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.800
 He did a say-ons there, but he debunked the whole thing.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800
 Wow.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.200
 And the noise turned out to be made by an 11 year old girl called Elizabeth who had concealed

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.640
 behind the wooden board and was doing it with her corset.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.080
 But this is the interesting thing is that obviously throughout history, people have reported

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.560
 poltergeist-y kind of things.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.560
 And a surprising fact, though, I read, is that it's mostly associated with pubescent girls

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.720
 around 11 and 12 years old, which is why in all the movies like Exorcist, it's always

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.720
 a young girl.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.920
 But James, do you know anything about that?

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.240
 Like, is there any research?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.360
 I know some history of it.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.000
 You know how sometimes people say, if they're trying to talk to a ghost, they'll say knock

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.720
 once for yes and twice for no.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.920
 That came from some sisters, I can't remember the name, I think they might be the fox sisters

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.320
 or something.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.480
 And they were tricking their parents by setting up a load of levers which would make banks

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.080
 underneath a table just for fun, really.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.440
 But then suddenly all the neighbors got involved and then suddenly it became really famous

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.760
 across the country and then eventually they admitted that it was all a hoax.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.720
 But yeah, that's where that once, once and twice knocking thing comes from.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.720
 Okay, right.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.480
 But there have been a few over the history about young girls doing things like that, yeah.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.480
 Yeah.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.240
 And the Enfield poltergeist case, which was an 18 month long ghost haunting that had been

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.000
 in up in Enfield in London.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.760
 We had a guy on the upcoming series of museum curiosity who he's a skeptic, but he studied

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.760
 it all.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.200
 His point about it was the only thing that they said as a what could be the explanation was

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.360
 is that the girl in question who was a young 11 to 12 year old girl at time was that she

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.280
 was very clever, but he doesn't buy that as an excuse because he thinks that was Will

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.280
 star, wasn't it?

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.280
 Will story.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.280
 Yeah.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.200
 But you can see, you can see because like in your story, the not one and two knocking, that's

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.200
 an 11 year old girl in the story of scratching Fanny at Cochlein.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.840
 That's a 11 to 12 year old girl.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.160
 Maybe 11 to 12 year old girls are incredibly clever.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160
 Maybe that's it.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.120
 There's also, they're quite susceptible to hysteria.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.920
 When you get things happening where large groups of people all believe something which isn't

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920
 quite true.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920
 Or all get hiccups.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.440
 Yeah, all get hiccups or all get a laughing fit or whatever, often it does turn out to be

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440
 pubescent girls.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440
 Makes sense.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.720
 Based on what you know of adolescence, the beginning of adolescence, you're very impressionable

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.000
 and there is a cult, there's a history of like people are assuming hysteria and girls.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.240
 Can I tell you about Scottish ghost stories?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.240
 Yes.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.760
 When I was really young, my mum basically put me off them for ages because she told me she

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.720
 saw an ad in the local paper for a jumper Uter.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.920
 Okay, Alex, have you got anything you want to add to this before we move on?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.280
 Only if anyone is interested in looking up the origin of the knock wants for yes twice

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.880
 for no, the sisters are called Margaret and Kate Fox.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.880
 Are they with Fox?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.880
 Yeah, it was Fox.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.880
 Hang on.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.880
 Foxy girls.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:57.360
 I just want to quickly add that this guy in Poland, this official ghost hunter, is very

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.920
 upset with the situation.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.920
 Does want it to change?

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.040
 He has a 24 hour hotline that you can call him on if you have a ghost that you'd like

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.760
 to report because he complains that very few people now take ghost seriously.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.000
 So even if they do have a paranormal experience, they tend to ignore it and are reluctant to contact

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 him.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.560
 And his name is Poeta Schelkevitz and if you want to get in contact with him, there is

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.480
 a hotline or you can email him on ghost_hunted@vp.pl.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.640
 He thinks that people are just, they see ghosts, but they don't care enough these days.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.240
 You see a ghost and you think, whatever, I'm just going on with my day.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.840
 Yeah, the thing is about ghosts, apparently, is most of them are not like see-through people

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.720
 who are people in sheets or whatever, they're just normal looking people, which makes me

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.000
 think they probably are normal people.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Yeah.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Yeah, that means I see ghosts all the time.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Yeah.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.800
 You guys are instance.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.200
 And what Bruce Willis doing in the corner of the room?

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:59.640
 All right, time to move on to fact number four.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.120
 That is Chazinski.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:07.960
 Yep, my fact I found out this week in a recent news scientist is that fallout from the cold

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.720
 war has been used to solve murders.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.240
 Okay, explain.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.240
 Right.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:19.440
 So, nuclear testing of the US and the USSR between 1952 and 1963 caused a massive spike in the

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.720
 carbon-14 isotope.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.160
 And it's the type of carbon that you measure the degeneration of when you're carbon dating

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.560
 to see how old something is.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560
 Okay.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.520
 So, there's a sudden spike in the atmosphere of carbon-14.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.720
 It was spread all over the world.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:39.320
 And then as soon as the weapons ban came in in 1963, it started declining again.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:47.160
 So, you can tell when something died by comparing how much carbon-14 in their body to what they

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.200
 call the bomb curve, which is the gradual decrease of carbon-14 in the atmosphere since 1963.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.200
 You can tell when they died.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.200
 Right.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.200
 That's how you date someone's death.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.520
 So, it's actually been really useful.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.240
 I just like the fact like in hundreds of thousands of years time they're going to look at

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.720
 our bodies and will be the cold war generation because our bodies have, you know, kind of all

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.720
 superheroes.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720
 Yeah.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.520
 Do you know what the perfect thing for forensics is?

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.280
 Apparently it's glitter.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.280
 Glittering.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.920
 Yeah, the reason is that glitter sticks to you and you can't get rid of it.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920
 No matter what.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.000
 And because people just accept it and it's there, they don't really care about it.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.400
 So, they just leave it on themselves for days and days and days and apparently it's, if

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:30.840
 you commit a crime in a circus, for instance, or in a child's birthday party or something,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.360
 then they can use the glitter to it.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.280
 So, if someone comes and assaults you or murders you, you should always keep a little

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.280
 box of glitter.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.920
 They can throw it over them at the last minute and be like, "I'd be like smart water."

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.920
 It's interesting as well.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.320
 There must been a big period where people were testing out new methods like forensics

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.160
 and fingerprints and so on and we've adopted them as kind of absolute truth now for a lot

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.160
 of them.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.720
 Fingerprints, I know, is actually slightly queried because every different country has different

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.960
 requirements for what makes up a match of a fingerprint.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.640
 So, in France and Australia, they need 12 identical points to make sense of a fingerprint

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.760
 whereas in Italy, they need 16 and in America it just varies from state to state of how

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.760
 many identities.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.040
 They're just like, he's got fingers.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040
 Yeah, he's the guy.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.040
 Yeah, that's how man.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.560
 But fingerprinting somehow has made it through, but there's other ones back in the 1970s that

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.320
 was a lady called Dr. Louise Robbins and she was at the University of North Carolina.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:31.000
 She declared herself to be the world's only footprint identification experts and she

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.560
 claimed that she could not only identify the shoes but the person who had been wearing

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560
 the shoes as well.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.440
 And as a result, 12 people were sent to prison and after her death, the panel of 135 forensic

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.400
 experts reviewed her work and realized that it was just absolute nonsense.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.720
 Oh, hey, people went to prison.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720
 12.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720
 Yeah.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.720
 Wow.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.720
 Actually, I really remember solving a crime.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.720
 I love this story.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.760
 It's a 12-year-old called Jessica Maple and she went on a summer camp called Be a Junior

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.280
 District Attorney and then her grandma there had died a few years ago and people broke

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.400
 in and stole stuff from her house and so she used her skills and outsmarted the police

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.400
 and found the guys that she went to the house, found a broken window and fingerprints that

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.000
 the police had missed and then she told them and then while they were following her lead,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.040
 she found a local pawn job that had all her grandma's stuff in it and then they had managed

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.800
 to identify the guys who had taken it.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800
 She was 12.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800
 Good for her.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.560
 So the just junior district attorney?

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.560
 Yeah.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.320
 Well, I have another thing about kids and this is about nuclear stuff.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.760
 There was a boy scout in America called David Hahn and he earned his merit badge in

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.800
 atomic energy, presumably by answering a quiz or something like that.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.040
 We're making nuclear pops.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.960
 Well that's what he decided to do.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.640
 He had a badge and so he was going to build a nuclear reactor and so he collected small

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.360
 amounts of radioactive material from household goods like smoke detectors and built himself

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.200
 a nuclear reactor in his shed and the police accidentally discovered it when they were looking

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.200
 for something else.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:01.600
 The US government commandeered his mother's house, decontaminated it and buried his shed

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.920
 in the desert in Utah.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.920
 Wow.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.920
 Oh my god.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:11.000
 Well, this is his whole shed to the desert that's like up for like with radiation down.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.520
 Wasn't there a guy in England recently who became the youngest person to build a nuclear

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.120
 reactor and I might have made that up so maybe Alex could check it.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.880
 I think he lived in, I want to say, slow.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.840
 It was somewhere that sounds comically bad, really glamorous.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.960
 A 13 year old boy called Jamie Edwards who made it at school here.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.960
 Yeah.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.280
 Apparently it's illegal to move sheep and whales until they've been checked to see

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.000
 whether they carry traces of the fallout from Chernobyl as well.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Really?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Yeah.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 On this particular subject, I've got a question for you guys.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Oh yeah.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.400
 Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400
 I don't know.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.640
 Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.400
 Chernobyl fallout.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.720
 Ladies and gentlemen, that is the joke.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720
 Yeah.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.600
 Just so you know, just as a little inside bit of behind the scenes information here, Anna

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.520
 has consistently, for the last 14 podcasts, said that same joke and we've cut it out every

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
 single episode.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.480
 She has refused to have it in the book.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480
 This is a day.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.520
 And you will not hear it in this one either, unless someone else said it.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.400
 It's the best joke ever.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.840
 Alex, do you have anything to add before we move on?

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.840
 Yeah, the thing about sheep and whales being radioactive is right.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:25.120
 All the sheep in the highest pastures still are exposed to the highest levels of cesium.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.920
 And so they will have to be tested and regulated before they go to market.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.000
 So for those people left, still shagging sheep, stop it.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 It's very dangerous.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.640
 No, yeah, I'm not sure they do that.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.400
 James, don't ruin my fantasies.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.240
 Because if they did, the knobs would fall out.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:48.160
 Okay, that's it, that's the end of our show.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.800
 Thanks everyone for listening.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.720
 If you want to find out anything about the stuff that we've been talking about, you can

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.080
 actually head over to our qi.com/podcast page where we're going to have all sorts of

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.200
 videos, maybe a list of records that you could break, an update on whether we actually did

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:08.020
 the Ferrero Rocher experiment, some great evil, con evil videos where he gets tossed around.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:16.960
 So to speak, so to speak, some ghost imagery, perhaps, and a picture of pirus, the horny bear,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.360
 without actual horny bears that I saw on the internet this morning.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.960
 Okay, that's it really.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.960
 If you want to talk to any of us about the things that we've said during the course of

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.040
 this podcast, you can get us all on our Twitter handle.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:36.360
 So I'm on @Sriberland, James, @egshaped, @millar_an, @Alex, @AlexBell_, and Anna.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:45.200
 If you email podcast@qi.com, #getAnnaOnTwitter, someone made the argument that if you don't

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.040
 have Twitter, how can you see the hashtag?

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.400
 So what we've done is we printed out all of the tweets and posted them around Anna's desk

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.400
 wallet.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:59.400
 Thanks so much for listening, we'll be back again next week with another episode of No Such

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:18.600
 thing as a fish, and we'll catch you then, goodbye.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.600
 Bye.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:20.600
 Bye.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:21.600
 Bye.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.600
 Bye.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:32.600
