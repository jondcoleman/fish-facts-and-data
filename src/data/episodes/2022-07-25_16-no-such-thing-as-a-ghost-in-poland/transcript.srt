1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,160
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,720
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,560
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:23,880
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,960
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
 My name is Dan Triber.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,760
 I'm sitting here with three other elves

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,920
 and it's Zinsky, James Arkin, and Anne Miller.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,120
 And we've got on fact checking duties today, Alex Bell.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,000
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphone

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,640
 to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
 So in no particular order, here we go.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,320
 Fact number one, James.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,400
 OK, my fact is the world record for most kicks to one's own head

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
 is 127 in a minute.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,360
 Jeez, so more than two a second.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,600
 That's more than two a second.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,560
 That's a lot of kicks.

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,680
 How did he do it?

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,200
 Well, there's a video on the Guinness Book of Records website, I think.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,520
 It's, I think he's like kind of a martial arts guy

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,320
 and he's very supple and fast and--

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,240
 Possibly stupid.

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,760
 And possibly slightly mental.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,000
 But that means for him to do that speed, he has to be going, like, literally--

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,640
 Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,960
 Is he related to Roy Kirby, who I know is the guy who's

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,360
 spoken the Guinness World Record, he's also a martial arts guy for the hardest kick to the groin.

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,600
 Oh, no!

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,240
 I think he took a 22 mile an hour kick to the groin with 1100 pounds of force

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,480
 and didn't register any pain at all, he said.

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,000
 Yeah.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,360
 He's built up a pain threshold.

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,680
 Apparently they do it in a certain type of martial art.

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,800
 And I can't remember what it's called, where basically you run hard objects

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,680
 over your muscles every day and it sort of pulverises the nerve fibers

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,880
 and causes fractures to the bone.

42
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,320
 And then when they heal, the body compensates by adding extra calcium to you,

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,840
 which means that you stop feeling pain.

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,360
 Here's a newspaper article that I found, which is somewhat related to Anna's fact.

45
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,200
 Yeah.

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,800
 A 28-year-old man who claimed to be acting out of curiosity when he asked seven women

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 to kick him in the groin was sentenced yesterday to 60 days in jail.

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,520
 One of the women, afraid of what he might do if she refused, kicked him repeatedly.

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
 Oh my god.

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,320
 The guy thanked her and left on his bicycle.

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,400
 Which I have no seat.

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,240
 So the court asked his wife what she thought about it.

53
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,560
 And she told the court that she was at a loss to explain his consult.

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,360
 And she said, "I can honestly say I find this as odd and peculiar

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,480
 and disturbing as everyone else."

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,120
 I wanted to look more into this guy, Joel Lindecker.

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,000
 He's the guy who kicked himself in the head 127 times.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,600
 He's broken his own record a number of times.

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,200
 So on one of the occasions, he was interviewed by someone

60
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,240
 and they said, "Can I see an example of you doing this?"

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,000
 And he said, "Yeah, sure."

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And so he did it.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 He only managed 80.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,360
 But what was great was the interview afterwards.

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,320
 The interview is going, "Wow, I don't know what to say after seeing such a spectacle.

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
 How do you feel?"

67
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,520
 And he was breathing heavily and he's like, "Oh, I'm really exhausted.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,000
 It's really tiring."

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,320
 She starts trying to interview him and he just keeps getting more and more concussed

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,160
 and out of it.

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
 Yeah.

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,440
 She says, "So how often do you do this?"

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,520
 He's like, "Oh, I pretty much only do it when I know that I'm going to be making a record attempt.

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,560
 I don't really practice in my spare time or anything."

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
 Sorry.

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
 Can I get a second?

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
 I'm really light-headed right now.

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
 She goes, "Sure, sure.

79
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
 Don't pass out.

80
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
 He bends down.

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
 Hands on these.

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 Takes deep breaths.

83
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 I might actually have to sit down or something."

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,480
 Can we do this interview inside?

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,080
 She basically is just totally concussed off the back of it.

86
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,800
 And the first time he did it, he did it with shoes on and he didn't know that he should

87
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 have done that.

88
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
 And now he does it with either socks or--

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 Slipper socks.

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 Where's Slipper?

91
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
 You're right.

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
 No, he does it barefoot or with socks on.

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,800
 I imagine the interview would be like, "So, how do you feel about kicking yourself 127 times

94
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
 in the head?"

95
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
 He's like, "What are you talking about?"

96
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
 Yes.

97
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
 He's gone to hell.

98
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
 Who are you?

99
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 Who am I?

100
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 There is another Guinness World Record champ.

101
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,360
 He's called Ashreeta Ferman and he was born the year the first Guinness Book of World

102
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,960
 Records came out and he holds the Guinness World Record for holding the most Guinness World

103
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
 Records.

104
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,000
 So, he's had 533 and 189 are still active and they include Pogo Stick Jumping Under Water,

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,120
 popcorn sculpture, balancing most eggs on head, M&Ms eaten blindfolded with chopsticks and

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,000
 drinking 200 milliliters of mustard.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Wow.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Wow.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So, the really serious record is breaking the legs.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Does it include?

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yeah.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Does it include this one?

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Longest distance pulled by a horse while on fire?

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Yeah.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I've seen that guy.

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Yeah.

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 He was dragged 1,551 feet while on fire by a horse.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,360
 I think the funnest world record to break is the most rotations hanging from a power drill

119
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,600
 in a minute, which is 148, it was in 2008, but it's not fun.

120
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,480
 So, this guy just attached a power drill to the ceiling, held onto it and just spun around

121
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
 on it for a minute.

122
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
 I want to start doing that recreationally.

123
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
 That is great.

124
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,040
 So, this one I found was for this distance of squirting milk from eyes.

125
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
 Nice.

126
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
 Oh, wow.

127
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
 279.5 centimeters.

128
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
 Well, why is milk coming out of your eyes?

129
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
 Shouldn't you see something about that?

130
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
 Yeah.

131
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,720
 People do it because their sinuses are all attached and they snort it through, then I was

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,520
 and shoot it through the eyes.

133
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
 I think students do it.

134
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
 I have a friend at school.

135
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,920
 He could put a whole cocktail stick up his nose.

136
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
 Don't do that.

137
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
 They can kill you.

138
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
 Wow.

139
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
 That was his part.

140
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
 Alfred Kinsey could put a whole toothbrush up his penis.

141
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
 Chris led first.

142
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
 I don't mind that.

143
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
 What?

144
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
 Really?

145
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
 Yeah.

146
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
 He's a sexologist.

147
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
 Alfred Kinsey.

148
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
 Yeah.

149
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
 Alfred Kinsey from the 50s.

150
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
 Yeah, his party trick was to put--

151
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
 Party trick.

152
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
 Who wants to see that?

153
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
 Wait, wait.

154
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
 I've got a great--

155
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
 The guy who got women's kingdom and the bulls was arrested.

156
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
 I hope he was arrested at some point.

157
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
 Shall we invite Alfred to the wedding?

158
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
 Well--

159
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
 So there's party piece.

160
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
 Can we search his bag on the way in?

161
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,120
 If there's a toothbrush in there, no way.

162
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,560
 In 2009, Jonathan Lee Riches filed an injunction against the Guinness Book of Records seeking

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,360
 to stop them from naming him as the most litigious individual in the history of mankind.

164
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
 Brilliant.

165
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,640
 We might have to bleep his name out of this podcast.

166
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
 Yeah.

167
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
 That's brilliant.

168
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,640
 Evil Knievel used to have a lot of world records.

169
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
 Did he?

170
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
 Do you remember him?

171
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,600
 He would jump over buses on a bike and stuff like that.

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,120
 As far as I can say, I think there is one record that he still owns.

173
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,200
 This is really hard to Google, but I think there's one thing that he still owns.

174
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,480
 Can you guess what it is?

175
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 Most bones broken?

176
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
 It's correct.

177
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
 Is it?

178
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
 Yes.

179
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
 Yes.

180
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,640
 That's one thing that I know about him.

181
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,240
 As you watch videos of him, it's actually in terms of Shardin Freud, the funniest video

182
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
 is online.

183
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,880
 Because you see this man just like, "Yeah, I'm going to own it.

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
 I look at these buses.

185
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
 I'm going to go right over them.

186
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,760
 It's going to be awesome at every single time."

187
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,720
 He just collapses and just flies across the ground.

188
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
 The guy who has related to the guy who has the record for the furthest ever flown in

189
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,880
 a car crash was Matthew McNight.

190
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,420
 It was in 2018, he flew 118 feet, but while he was recovering in a hospital, his doctor

191
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,620
 brought him the forms to sign, the Guinness forms to sign, to prove that he had flown further

192
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,920
 than anyone else, but I just think it's a very unsympathetic doctor move, like a couple

193
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 of days.

194
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
 He broke all of his bones.

195
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
 I'm not thinking of that record.

196
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
 Yeah, not as many as evil can evil.

197
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
 Yeah.

198
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 Correct.

199
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,880
 We should try and think up a record that we can break.

200
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
 Here's one that we could break.

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,880
 The most Ferrero rushes eaten in one minute is ten.

202
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
 Yes.

203
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,920
 Is it like crackers, they dry your mouth, that's who you think it's easy.

204
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
 Or is it cinnamon?

205
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,840
 In the middle they have like, it's kind of liquidy.

206
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
 I could eat ten in a minute.

207
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
 Yeah.

208
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
 Alex, have you got anything to add before we wrap up?

209
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
 Yeah, I did find that in 2006, the man who holds the world record for spending the most

210
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,000
 time in a cage of centipedes married the woman who held the same record, but with scorpions.

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Oh, great.

212
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,840
 Okay, it's time now to move on to fact number two, Anne.

213
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,480
 Yes, there is a bear in the Pyrenees who is facing castration because he has fathered nearly

214
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
 all the other bears.

215
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
 Oh, that's a bit harsh.

216
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
 I think it's harsh.

217
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
 Well done, him.

218
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
 Well done, him.

219
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 I would say well done, him.

220
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
 He's amazing.

221
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,960
 He's called Pyros and there are about 30 bears and there are only four other males and

222
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,320
 none of them have followed any bears themselves.

223
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,400
 But the problem is, officials don't like it because they're worried that he's ruining their

224
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
 gene pool, basically.

225
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
 And there was recently a bear born that was his daughter and his granddaughter and they started

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,440
 to get a bit worried that this is problematic, the problem with Pyros is bears generally

227
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,840
 stop being sexually active around 19, but a Pyros is 26 and still going.

228
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
 Wow.

229
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,040
 Are the bears becoming increasingly more deformed?

230
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,400
 I think a bear always looks pretty good, so you can't tell they're deformed and they're

231
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
 all there for.

232
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,880
 Well, Pliny didn't think that was true.

233
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,800
 You thought when a baby bear was born, it was completely shapeless and that they got into

234
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,120
 their bear shape by being licked into shape by their mothers.

235
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
 I think everything when it's brand new is quite strange shape and they start getting more

236
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 of their shape when they're--

237
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 Yeah.

238
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
 That's a good excuse.

239
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,760
 I'm not sure what his excuse was for saying that they had very dim eyes when they're

240
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,320
 born and the way that they get their eyes better is to allow bees to sting their faces

241
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
 to improve their eyesight.

242
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,120
 I was-- I got very interested in the idea of this bear because I didn't realize that their

243
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,960
 sex drive was so high, so I did a very quick Google on it.

244
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
 I didn't get very far.

245
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
 What did you Google?

246
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
 Pony bears.

247
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
 [laughter]

248
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,720
 I mean something very different in the gay community.

249
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,400
 Which I didn't-- I completely forgot.

250
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
 I did know that.

251
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
 I completely forgot.

252
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,480
 So just anyone out there, if you do click, "Hornie Bear" into Google, don't then click

253
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,920
 on the link that says, "My favorite hot and horny bears, certainly don't do it at work."

254
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
 Imagine that we're all completely misunderstanding this news article.

255
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
 [laughter]

256
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
 Oh, yeah.

257
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
 Oh dear.

258
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
 Okay.

259
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
 There's a bear in the Bible.

260
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,600
 It was a few actually, but one of them I like, and the biblical prophet Elisha wants cursed

261
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,780
 a group of children who teased him for being bold as a result they were mulled by bears

262
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,780
 and killed.

263
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,780
 Yeah.

264
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
 I love that story.

265
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,760
 Because it's something ridiculous, like 42 kids, like it's a lot of children.

266
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
 And they're like, "Boldie, boldie."

267
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
 And he's like, "Right.

268
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
 Fine.

269
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
 You're going to get killed by bears."

270
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,560
 So, do you know what you had to do if you were attacked by bears?

271
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
 I think we covered on this.

272
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
 There's a witch bear in the bear, isn't it?

273
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
 Yeah, that's right.

274
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
 What's that?

275
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,400
 So, you might be attacked by a brown bear or a black bear.

276
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
 Yes.

277
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,240
 The problem is that brown bears are sometimes black and black bears are sometimes brown, so

278
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,480
 it's hard to tell.

279
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,160
 If you're attacked by a brown bear, then you should play dead.

280
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,320
 But if you're attacked by a black bear and you play dead, you'll almost certainly be

281
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
 killed.

282
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 Yeah.

283
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
 Yeah.

284
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 They didn't dress like brown.

285
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
 Oh yeah, and they're just like, "Oh, this is so much easy."

286
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,120
 They also be like, "I want a chase. I don't need just a light bear."

287
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
 Pirates, shaggers.

288
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
 Probably shaggers.

289
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
 Yeah.

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,360
 Peter the Great trained up two bears.

291
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,680
 He had two white bears to serve vodka to his guests.

292
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,520
 And if they didn't accept the vodka, then he would train the bear to harass them, which

293
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,720
 I think might explain Russia's vodka problem because you're not going to turn down vodka

294
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 from an angry bear.

295
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 What do you mean, "harass them"?

296
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
 Just like nod you.

297
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
 Come on, mate.

298
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
 Come on.

299
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
 The other thing is a white bear is presumably a polar bear.

300
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 Yeah.

301
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,440
 The other kind of bear is a spectacled bear.

302
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,400
 They actually have markings like they're wearing a pair of glasses.

303
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,800
 They're amazing if you haven't seen them.

304
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
 Look them up.

305
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 Isn't Paddington based on--

306
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 That's what I was going.

307
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 Yeah.

308
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,400
 Because they are the only bear found in South America.

309
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,480
 So Paddington by default must be a spectacled bear.

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,960
 But of course, we know he's not a polar.

311
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,320
 But I like the idea of Paddington with glasses.

312
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,400
 And Paddington was originally going to be from deepest darkest Africa, but the problem

313
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,200
 with that is there are no bears in Africa.

314
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 There's no bears in Africa, isn't there?

315
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 Yeah, that makes sense.

316
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
 Is it true that Byron had a bear?

317
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 Yeah.

318
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 Yeah.

319
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
 So that's true.

320
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
 We've discussed this in the vodka, actually.

321
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
 I'm sorry to Oxford.

322
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,680
 Any time that I've seen news about this bear, the one thing that doesn't come up is the name

323
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
 of the bear.

324
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
 Oh.

325
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,800
 How do we know that he had a bear, yet the name of the bear has not made it through?

326
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,960
 One more bear thing I didn't know was that during the Cold War in the 1960s Americans tested

327
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,040
 their supersonic ejector seats on bears, and they fired bears out of the ejector seats

328
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,000
 and then tested how safely they landed.

329
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And they survived, actually.

330
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 But then they had to put the bears down to study what had happened to their spines and

331
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 what happened to their internal organs.

332
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,160
 And so they were launching bears out of airplanes.

333
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
 Yeah, there were pictures.

334
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
 These bears look pretty terrifying.

335
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,120
 How did they get a bear in an ejector seat?

336
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
 Yeah.

337
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
 They must have been drugged.

338
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
 They were drugs.

339
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,800
 So we did the thing on QI about the pig face ladies, which was actually a shaved bear in

340
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
 a dress.

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,320
 And they used to get the bears really drunk before they shaved them.

342
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
 Yeah.

343
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
 That's insane.

344
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,600
 Hey, do you know what a, it's either the pronunciation is "tap it" or "tap it."

345
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,560
 I'm not sure what the pronunciation is.

346
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,200
 It's associated with bears, do you know what that is?

347
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
 T-A-P-P-E-T.

348
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
 What?

349
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
 I don't think I know that word.

350
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,640
 It's basically the blockage that is created when they go into hibernation.

351
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
 Like a butt plug.

352
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
 It's a butt plug.

353
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
 Yeah.

354
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
 Yeah, a butt plug of hair.

355
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
 Yeah.

356
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 It's amazing.

357
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
 For seven months, they can sleep.

358
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,440
 They don't eat, drink, urinate, defecate.

359
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
 How do you do that?

360
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 Seven months.

361
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
 It's like...

362
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
 By plugging up your butt.

363
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
 My mind's blown by hibernation.

364
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
 Yeah, no.

365
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
 They do.

366
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,640
 They're going to to topper, which is slightly different, but some female bears can give birth

367
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
 while they're asleep.

368
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
 What?

369
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
 Yeah.

370
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
 Wow.

371
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
 It's not all of them, but some of them.

372
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,240
 They must have a seriously high-paying threshold.

373
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,240
 I think they just pass out drunk for a full seven months, that kind of explains that.

374
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
 And they do like alcohol.

375
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
 Well, Boy Check the Bear loved beer, didn't he?

376
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,080
 Boy Check who helped the polls in World War II, carrying artillery back and forth.

377
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
 OK.

378
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,440
 But his favourite drink was beer, and he loved a cigarette.

379
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
 This was a bear.

380
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
 Yeah, Boy Check the Bear.

381
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
 He's really famous.

382
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,920
 I think there's a statue of him in Princess Street now in Edinburgh because he, when the rest

383
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
 of his days in Scotland, I think.

384
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,400
 Well, we've also got that penguin at Edinburgh Zoo, Neil's all-off, is he a Norwegian guard?

385
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 Yeah.

386
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
 A knighthood?

387
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,200
 We are going to have to move on.

388
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,000
 Alex, have you got anything you want to add?

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
 Only that Byron's bear was called Bruin.

390
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
 We know his name.

391
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
 Oh, OK.

392
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,520
 Bruin is just a name for a bear, though, really, isn't it?

393
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,760
 It also just sounds like a misspelling of Byron, right?

394
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,720
 That down wrong at Cambridge.

395
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,680
 OK, time to move on to fact number three, and that's my fact.

396
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,040
 And that is, Poland's only official ghost hunter thinks that ghosts have given up on haunting

397
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
 humans.

398
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
 Oh.

399
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
 Yeah.

400
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,000
 Now, it's amazing that Poland has an official registered ghost hunter to begin with.

401
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Yeah.

402
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,520
 Finally, he's very dispirited because he thinks that we've become all too skeptical and that ghosts

403
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
 are no longer interested in humans.

404
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,080
 Or it could be that he's a very, very bad hunter, and he just can't find them because he's

405
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,920
 a rowish hunter, and he's blaming it on them disappearing.

406
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
 That's very true.

407
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,960
 I mean, I know that in Bhutan, there's an official Yeti hunter, and he's been working for

408
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
 the king.

409
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,640
 He's under his second king now, because the new king took over, and he's been working

410
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
 with him for something like 20 odd years.

411
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
 And nothing.

412
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
 He's, you know, nothing.

413
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
 Really?

414
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,480
 But what he said is, as the reason we haven't seen any, is that, A, they have the ability to

415
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,800
 turn themselves invisible.

416
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,840
 Secondly, he says that they have the ability to take their feet off and put them back on

417
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
 the other way around.

418
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,320
 So when it looks like they've walked one way, in fact, they've gone the other way.

419
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
 They're sneaky.

420
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,760
 It's very hard to tell where Yeti's gone.

421
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,360
 Well, I've been to Bhutan, and they have a Yeti sanctuary, don't they?

422
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
 They do.

423
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
 Sanctuary.

424
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
 Yes.

425
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
 They have a Yeti park.

426
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 It's an actual Yeti park where there are, like, park rangers.

427
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,840
 We look after the Yetis.

428
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,040
 So when you say an official ghost hunter, is this like a government sanctioned post?

429
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
 Yeah.

430
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
 I mean, presumably he's just a private guy and people pay him to go and hunt for ghosts, right?

431
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
 Yeah, I think that's what it is.

432
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,400
 And people have stopped paying him now, because they don't believe in ghosts anymore and he

433
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 is a bit pissed off.

434
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
 So he's decided to claim that the ghosts are angry with people.

435
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,040
 I think they might have gone to Wales, because last year, the Welsh police force received

436
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,120
 13 reports of ghosts up from only two in 2010.

437
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
 Bloody Polish immigrants.

438
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,160
 Is this what people are talking about when they say that?

439
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,720
 I could say that because I'm half Polish.

440
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 But as well as finding 13 ghosts in Wales, South Wales police also got reports of three zombies,

441
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,920
 two werewolves, two vampires and six witches.

442
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
 Wow.

443
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,720
 I think they're unlike a paranormal voter, because notting him in 2011, the company said in

444
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,240
 the last six years, they had 34 cases of ghosts.

445
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,720
 And they also had 46 witchcraft and three UFOs, all of which turned out to be Chinese lanterns.

446
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
 Yeah.

447
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,000
 Chinese lanterns are often the most mistaken object for a UFO.

448
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,160
 They did this huge breakdown of everything that people thought was a UFO and what it actually

449
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
 turned out to be.

450
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
 And Chinese lanterns was way up.

451
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,120
 Right at the bottom, two percent of all UFO sightings turned out to be the moon.

452
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,680
 Do you know about the big ghostly frenzy that happened in London back in 1762?

453
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
 I do not.

454
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
 Okay.

455
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
 This is the story.

456
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,720
 It's called Scratching Fanny of Cocklay.

457
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
 Oh, yes, I do know about it.

458
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
 Yeah.

459
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,320
 Scratching Fanny of Cocklay is amazing.

460
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
 Just for anybody who doesn't know it.

461
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,160
 In 1762, there was a public frenzy in London over the ghost of Fanny Kent, scratching

462
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,840
 and knocking coded messages from behind the wall of a room where she lived.

463
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,800
 The owner of the house saw tickets so that you could witness it and storeholders, hold

464
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,520
 refreshments to crowds who are gathering outside.

465
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,760
 So it was a really big thing.

466
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,240
 The Duke of York came to see it, Samuel Johnson came.

467
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,800
 He did a say-ons there, but he debunked the whole thing.

468
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 Wow.

469
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,200
 And the noise turned out to be made by an 11 year old girl called Elizabeth who had concealed

470
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,640
 behind the wooden board and was doing it with her corset.

471
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,080
 But this is the interesting thing is that obviously throughout history, people have reported

472
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,560
 poltergeist-y kind of things.

473
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,560
 And a surprising fact, though, I read, is that it's mostly associated with pubescent girls

474
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,720
 around 11 and 12 years old, which is why in all the movies like Exorcist, it's always

475
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 a young girl.

476
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,920
 But James, do you know anything about that?

477
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,240
 Like, is there any research?

478
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,360
 I know some history of it.

479
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,000
 You know how sometimes people say, if they're trying to talk to a ghost, they'll say knock

480
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,720
 once for yes and twice for no.

481
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,920
 That came from some sisters, I can't remember the name, I think they might be the fox sisters

482
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,320
 or something.

483
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,480
 And they were tricking their parents by setting up a load of levers which would make banks

484
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,080
 underneath a table just for fun, really.

485
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,440
 But then suddenly all the neighbors got involved and then suddenly it became really famous

486
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,760
 across the country and then eventually they admitted that it was all a hoax.

487
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,720
 But yeah, that's where that once, once and twice knocking thing comes from.

488
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 Okay, right.

489
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,480
 But there have been a few over the history about young girls doing things like that, yeah.

490
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
 Yeah.

491
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,240
 And the Enfield poltergeist case, which was an 18 month long ghost haunting that had been

492
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,000
 in up in Enfield in London.

493
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,760
 We had a guy on the upcoming series of museum curiosity who he's a skeptic, but he studied

494
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
 it all.

495
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,200
 His point about it was the only thing that they said as a what could be the explanation was

496
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,360
 is that the girl in question who was a young 11 to 12 year old girl at time was that she

497
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,280
 was very clever, but he doesn't buy that as an excuse because he thinks that was Will

498
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
 star, wasn't it?

499
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
 Will story.

500
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
 Yeah.

501
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,200
 But you can see, you can see because like in your story, the not one and two knocking, that's

502
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
 an 11 year old girl in the story of scratching Fanny at Cochlein.

503
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,840
 That's a 11 to 12 year old girl.

504
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,160
 Maybe 11 to 12 year old girls are incredibly clever.

505
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
 Maybe that's it.

506
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,120
 There's also, they're quite susceptible to hysteria.

507
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,920
 When you get things happening where large groups of people all believe something which isn't

508
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
 quite true.

509
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
 Or all get hiccups.

510
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,440
 Yeah, all get hiccups or all get a laughing fit or whatever, often it does turn out to be

511
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
 pubescent girls.

512
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
 Makes sense.

513
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,720
 Based on what you know of adolescence, the beginning of adolescence, you're very impressionable

514
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,000
 and there is a cult, there's a history of like people are assuming hysteria and girls.

515
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,240
 Can I tell you about Scottish ghost stories?

516
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
 Yes.

517
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,760
 When I was really young, my mum basically put me off them for ages because she told me she

518
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,720
 saw an ad in the local paper for a jumper Uter.

519
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,920
 Okay, Alex, have you got anything you want to add to this before we move on?

520
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,280
 Only if anyone is interested in looking up the origin of the knock wants for yes twice

521
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,880
 for no, the sisters are called Margaret and Kate Fox.

522
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
 Are they with Fox?

523
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
 Yeah, it was Fox.

524
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
 Hang on.

525
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
 Foxy girls.

526
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,360
 I just want to quickly add that this guy in Poland, this official ghost hunter, is very

527
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,920
 upset with the situation.

528
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
 Does want it to change?

529
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,040
 He has a 24 hour hotline that you can call him on if you have a ghost that you'd like

530
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,760
 to report because he complains that very few people now take ghost seriously.

531
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,000
 So even if they do have a paranormal experience, they tend to ignore it and are reluctant to contact

532
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 him.

533
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,560
 And his name is Poeta Schelkevitz and if you want to get in contact with him, there is

534
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,480
 a hotline or you can email him on ghost_hunted@vp.pl.

535
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,640
 He thinks that people are just, they see ghosts, but they don't care enough these days.

536
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,240
 You see a ghost and you think, whatever, I'm just going on with my day.

537
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,840
 Yeah, the thing is about ghosts, apparently, is most of them are not like see-through people

538
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,720
 who are people in sheets or whatever, they're just normal looking people, which makes me

539
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,000
 think they probably are normal people.

540
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Yeah.

541
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Yeah, that means I see ghosts all the time.

542
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Yeah.

543
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,800
 You guys are instance.

544
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,200
 And what Bruce Willis doing in the corner of the room?

545
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:59,640
 All right, time to move on to fact number four.

546
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,120
 That is Chazinski.

547
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,960
 Yep, my fact I found out this week in a recent news scientist is that fallout from the cold

548
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,720
 war has been used to solve murders.

549
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,240
 Okay, explain.

550
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
 Right.

551
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,440
 So, nuclear testing of the US and the USSR between 1952 and 1963 caused a massive spike in the

552
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,720
 carbon-14 isotope.

553
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,160
 And it's the type of carbon that you measure the degeneration of when you're carbon dating

554
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,560
 to see how old something is.

555
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
 Okay.

556
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,520
 So, there's a sudden spike in the atmosphere of carbon-14.

557
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,720
 It was spread all over the world.

558
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,320
 And then as soon as the weapons ban came in in 1963, it started declining again.

559
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:47,160
 So, you can tell when something died by comparing how much carbon-14 in their body to what they

560
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,200
 call the bomb curve, which is the gradual decrease of carbon-14 in the atmosphere since 1963.

561
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
 You can tell when they died.

562
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
 Right.

563
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
 That's how you date someone's death.

564
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,520
 So, it's actually been really useful.

565
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,240
 I just like the fact like in hundreds of thousands of years time they're going to look at

566
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,720
 our bodies and will be the cold war generation because our bodies have, you know, kind of all

567
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 superheroes.

568
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
 Yeah.

569
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,520
 Do you know what the perfect thing for forensics is?

570
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,280
 Apparently it's glitter.

571
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
 Glittering.

572
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,920
 Yeah, the reason is that glitter sticks to you and you can't get rid of it.

573
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
 No matter what.

574
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,000
 And because people just accept it and it's there, they don't really care about it.

575
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,400
 So, they just leave it on themselves for days and days and days and apparently it's, if

576
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,840
 you commit a crime in a circus, for instance, or in a child's birthday party or something,

577
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,360
 then they can use the glitter to it.

578
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,280
 So, if someone comes and assaults you or murders you, you should always keep a little

579
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
 box of glitter.

580
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,920
 They can throw it over them at the last minute and be like, "I'd be like smart water."

581
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
 It's interesting as well.

582
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,320
 There must been a big period where people were testing out new methods like forensics

583
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,160
 and fingerprints and so on and we've adopted them as kind of absolute truth now for a lot

584
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
 of them.

585
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,720
 Fingerprints, I know, is actually slightly queried because every different country has different

586
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,960
 requirements for what makes up a match of a fingerprint.

587
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,640
 So, in France and Australia, they need 12 identical points to make sense of a fingerprint

588
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,760
 whereas in Italy, they need 16 and in America it just varies from state to state of how

589
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
 many identities.

590
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,040
 They're just like, he's got fingers.

591
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
 Yeah, he's the guy.

592
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
 Yeah, that's how man.

593
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,560
 But fingerprinting somehow has made it through, but there's other ones back in the 1970s that

594
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,320
 was a lady called Dr. Louise Robbins and she was at the University of North Carolina.

595
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,000
 She declared herself to be the world's only footprint identification experts and she

596
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,560
 claimed that she could not only identify the shoes but the person who had been wearing

597
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
 the shoes as well.

598
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,440
 And as a result, 12 people were sent to prison and after her death, the panel of 135 forensic

599
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,400
 experts reviewed her work and realized that it was just absolute nonsense.

600
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,720
 Oh, hey, people went to prison.

601
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
 12.

602
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
 Yeah.

603
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 Wow.

604
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
 Actually, I really remember solving a crime.

605
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
 I love this story.

606
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,760
 It's a 12-year-old called Jessica Maple and she went on a summer camp called Be a Junior

607
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,280
 District Attorney and then her grandma there had died a few years ago and people broke

608
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,400
 in and stole stuff from her house and so she used her skills and outsmarted the police

609
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
 and found the guys that she went to the house, found a broken window and fingerprints that

610
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,000
 the police had missed and then she told them and then while they were following her lead,

611
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,040
 she found a local pawn job that had all her grandma's stuff in it and then they had managed

612
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,800
 to identify the guys who had taken it.

613
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 She was 12.

614
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 Good for her.

615
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,560
 So the just junior district attorney?

616
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
 Yeah.

617
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,320
 Well, I have another thing about kids and this is about nuclear stuff.

618
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,760
 There was a boy scout in America called David Hahn and he earned his merit badge in

619
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,800
 atomic energy, presumably by answering a quiz or something like that.

620
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,040
 We're making nuclear pops.

621
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,960
 Well that's what he decided to do.

622
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,640
 He had a badge and so he was going to build a nuclear reactor and so he collected small

623
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,360
 amounts of radioactive material from household goods like smoke detectors and built himself

624
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,200
 a nuclear reactor in his shed and the police accidentally discovered it when they were looking

625
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
 for something else.

626
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,600
 The US government commandeered his mother's house, decontaminated it and buried his shed

627
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,920
 in the desert in Utah.

628
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
 Wow.

629
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
 Oh my god.

630
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,000
 Well, this is his whole shed to the desert that's like up for like with radiation down.

631
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,520
 Wasn't there a guy in England recently who became the youngest person to build a nuclear

632
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,120
 reactor and I might have made that up so maybe Alex could check it.

633
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,880
 I think he lived in, I want to say, slow.

634
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,840
 It was somewhere that sounds comically bad, really glamorous.

635
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,960
 A 13 year old boy called Jamie Edwards who made it at school here.

636
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
 Yeah.

637
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,280
 Apparently it's illegal to move sheep and whales until they've been checked to see

638
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,000
 whether they carry traces of the fallout from Chernobyl as well.

639
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Really?

640
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Yeah.

641
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 On this particular subject, I've got a question for you guys.

642
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Oh yeah.

643
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,400
 Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?

644
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
 I don't know.

645
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,640
 Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?

646
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,400
 Chernobyl fallout.

647
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,720
 Ladies and gentlemen, that is the joke.

648
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
 Yeah.

649
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,600
 Just so you know, just as a little inside bit of behind the scenes information here, Anna

650
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,520
 has consistently, for the last 14 podcasts, said that same joke and we've cut it out every

651
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
 single episode.

652
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,480
 She has refused to have it in the book.

653
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
 This is a day.

654
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,520
 And you will not hear it in this one either, unless someone else said it.

655
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,400
 It's the best joke ever.

656
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,840
 Alex, do you have anything to add before we move on?

657
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,840
 Yeah, the thing about sheep and whales being radioactive is right.

658
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,120
 All the sheep in the highest pastures still are exposed to the highest levels of cesium.

659
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,920
 And so they will have to be tested and regulated before they go to market.

660
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,000
 So for those people left, still shagging sheep, stop it.

661
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 It's very dangerous.

662
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,640
 No, yeah, I'm not sure they do that.

663
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,400
 James, don't ruin my fantasies.

664
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,240
 Because if they did, the knobs would fall out.

665
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:48,160
 Okay, that's it, that's the end of our show.

666
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,800
 Thanks everyone for listening.

667
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,720
 If you want to find out anything about the stuff that we've been talking about, you can

668
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,080
 actually head over to our qi.com/podcast page where we're going to have all sorts of

669
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,200
 videos, maybe a list of records that you could break, an update on whether we actually did

670
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,020
 the Ferrero Rocher experiment, some great evil, con evil videos where he gets tossed around.

671
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:16,960
 So to speak, so to speak, some ghost imagery, perhaps, and a picture of pirus, the horny bear,

672
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,360
 without actual horny bears that I saw on the internet this morning.

673
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,960
 Okay, that's it really.

674
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,960
 If you want to talk to any of us about the things that we've said during the course of

675
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,040
 this podcast, you can get us all on our Twitter handle.

676
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:36,360
 So I'm on @Sriberland, James, @egshaped, @millar_an, @Alex, @AlexBell_, and Anna.

677
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:45,200
 If you email podcast@qi.com, #getAnnaOnTwitter, someone made the argument that if you don't

678
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,040
 have Twitter, how can you see the hashtag?

679
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,400
 So what we've done is we printed out all of the tweets and posted them around Anna's desk

680
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
 wallet.

681
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:59,400
 Thanks so much for listening, we'll be back again next week with another episode of No Such

682
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:18,600
 thing as a fish, and we'll catch you then, goodbye.

683
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
