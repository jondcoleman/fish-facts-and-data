00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:11,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:23,"Hello, and welcome to another edition of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:23,00:00:26,coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:26,00:00:27,My name is Dan Triber.
00:00:27,00:00:29,I'm sitting here with three other elves
00:00:29,00:00:32,"and it's Zinsky, James Arkin, and Anne Miller."
00:00:32,00:00:36,"And we've got on fact checking duties today, Alex Bell."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphone"
00:00:38,00:00:40,to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:40,00:00:42,"So in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:48,"Fact number one, James."
00:00:48,00:00:52,"OK, my fact is the world record for most kicks to one's own head"
00:00:52,00:00:55,is 127 in a minute.
00:00:55,00:00:57,"Jeez, so more than two a second."
00:00:57,00:00:58,That's more than two a second.
00:00:58,00:01:00,That's a lot of kicks.
00:01:00,00:01:01,How did he do it?
00:01:01,00:01:05,"Well, there's a video on the Guinness Book of Records website, I think."
00:01:05,00:01:08,"It's, I think he's like kind of a martial arts guy"
00:01:08,00:01:12,and he's very supple and fast and--
00:01:12,00:01:13,Possibly stupid.
00:01:13,00:01:15,And possibly slightly mental.
00:01:15,00:01:20,"But that means for him to do that speed, he has to be going, like, literally--"
00:01:20,00:01:21,Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.
00:01:21,00:01:25,"Is he related to Roy Kirby, who I know is the guy who's"
00:01:25,00:01:30,"spoken the Guinness World Record, he's also a martial arts guy for the hardest kick to the groin."
00:01:30,00:01:31,"Oh, no!"
00:01:31,00:01:38,I think he took a 22 mile an hour kick to the groin with 1100 pounds of force
00:01:38,00:01:40,"and didn't register any pain at all, he said."
00:01:40,00:01:41,Yeah.
00:01:41,00:01:42,He's built up a pain threshold.
00:01:42,00:01:44,Apparently they do it in a certain type of martial art.
00:01:44,00:01:47,"And I can't remember what it's called, where basically you run hard objects"
00:01:47,00:01:51,over your muscles every day and it sort of pulverises the nerve fibers
00:01:51,00:01:53,and causes fractures to the bone.
00:01:53,00:01:57,"And then when they heal, the body compensates by adding extra calcium to you,"
00:01:57,00:01:59,which means that you stop feeling pain.
00:01:59,00:02:04,"Here's a newspaper article that I found, which is somewhat related to Anna's fact."
00:02:04,00:02:05,Yeah.
00:02:05,00:02:10,A 28-year-old man who claimed to be acting out of curiosity when he asked seven women
00:02:10,00:02:14,to kick him in the groin was sentenced yesterday to 60 days in jail.
00:02:14,00:02:18,"One of the women, afraid of what he might do if she refused, kicked him repeatedly."
00:02:18,00:02:19,Oh my god.
00:02:19,00:02:22,The guy thanked her and left on his bicycle.
00:02:22,00:02:25,Which I have no seat.
00:02:25,00:02:29,So the court asked his wife what she thought about it.
00:02:29,00:02:32,And she told the court that she was at a loss to explain his consult.
00:02:32,00:02:36,"And she said, ""I can honestly say I find this as odd and peculiar"
00:02:36,00:02:39,"and disturbing as everyone else."""
00:02:39,00:02:42,"I wanted to look more into this guy, Joel Lindecker."
00:02:42,00:02:45,He's the guy who kicked himself in the head 127 times.
00:02:45,00:02:47,He's broken his own record a number of times.
00:02:47,00:02:51,"So on one of the occasions, he was interviewed by someone"
00:02:51,00:02:54,"and they said, ""Can I see an example of you doing this?"""
00:02:54,00:02:56,"And he said, ""Yeah, sure."""
00:02:56,00:02:57,And so he did it.
00:02:57,00:02:58,He only managed 80.
00:02:58,00:03:00,But what was great was the interview afterwards.
00:03:00,00:03:04,"The interview is going, ""Wow, I don't know what to say after seeing such a spectacle."
00:03:04,00:03:05,"How do you feel?"""
00:03:05,00:03:07,"And he was breathing heavily and he's like, ""Oh, I'm really exhausted."
00:03:07,00:03:10,"It's really tiring."""
00:03:10,00:03:14,She starts trying to interview him and he just keeps getting more and more concussed
00:03:14,00:03:16,and out of it.
00:03:16,00:03:17,Yeah.
00:03:17,00:03:19,"She says, ""So how often do you do this?"""
00:03:19,00:03:23,"He's like, ""Oh, I pretty much only do it when I know that I'm going to be making a record attempt."
00:03:23,00:03:26,"I don't really practice in my spare time or anything."""
00:03:26,00:03:27,Sorry.
00:03:27,00:03:28,Can I get a second?
00:03:28,00:03:30,I'm really light-headed right now.
00:03:30,00:03:31,"She goes, ""Sure, sure."
00:03:31,00:03:32,Don't pass out.
00:03:32,00:03:33,He bends down.
00:03:33,00:03:34,Hands on these.
00:03:34,00:03:35,Takes deep breaths.
00:03:35,00:03:36,"I might actually have to sit down or something."""
00:03:36,00:03:39,Can we do this interview inside?
00:03:39,00:03:43,She basically is just totally concussed off the back of it.
00:03:43,00:03:46,"And the first time he did it, he did it with shoes on and he didn't know that he should"
00:03:46,00:03:47,have done that.
00:03:47,00:03:49,And now he does it with either socks or--
00:03:49,00:03:50,Slipper socks.
00:03:50,00:03:51,Where's Slipper?
00:03:51,00:03:52,You're right.
00:03:52,00:03:53,"No, he does it barefoot or with socks on."
00:03:53,00:03:57,"I imagine the interview would be like, ""So, how do you feel about kicking yourself 127 times"
00:03:57,00:03:58,"in the head?"""
00:03:58,00:04:00,"He's like, ""What are you talking about?"""
00:04:00,00:04:01,Yes.
00:04:01,00:04:02,He's gone to hell.
00:04:02,00:04:03,Who are you?
00:04:03,00:04:04,Who am I?
00:04:04,00:04:06,There is another Guinness World Record champ.
00:04:06,00:04:10,He's called Ashreeta Ferman and he was born the year the first Guinness Book of World
00:04:10,00:04:13,Records came out and he holds the Guinness World Record for holding the most Guinness World
00:04:13,00:04:14,Records.
00:04:14,00:04:22,"So, he's had 533 and 189 are still active and they include Pogo Stick Jumping Under Water,"
00:04:22,00:04:27,"popcorn sculpture, balancing most eggs on head, M&Ms eaten blindfolded with chopsticks and"
00:04:27,00:04:29,drinking 200 milliliters of mustard.
00:04:29,00:04:30,Wow.
00:04:30,00:04:31,Wow.
00:04:31,00:04:33,"So, the really serious record is breaking the legs."
00:04:33,00:04:34,Does it include?
00:04:34,00:04:35,Yeah.
00:04:35,00:04:36,Does it include this one?
00:04:36,00:04:39,Longest distance pulled by a horse while on fire?
00:04:39,00:04:40,Yeah.
00:04:40,00:04:41,I've seen that guy.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Yeah.
00:04:42,00:04:47,"He was dragged 1,551 feet while on fire by a horse."
00:04:47,00:04:51,I think the funnest world record to break is the most rotations hanging from a power drill
00:04:51,00:04:56,"in a minute, which is 148, it was in 2008, but it's not fun."
00:04:56,00:04:59,"So, this guy just attached a power drill to the ceiling, held onto it and just spun around"
00:04:59,00:05:00,on it for a minute.
00:05:00,00:05:02,I want to start doing that recreationally.
00:05:02,00:05:03,That is great.
00:05:03,00:05:07,"So, this one I found was for this distance of squirting milk from eyes."
00:05:07,00:05:08,Nice.
00:05:08,00:05:09,"Oh, wow."
00:05:09,00:05:10,279.5 centimeters.
00:05:10,00:05:12,"Well, why is milk coming out of your eyes?"
00:05:12,00:05:13,Shouldn't you see something about that?
00:05:13,00:05:14,Yeah.
00:05:14,00:05:18,"People do it because their sinuses are all attached and they snort it through, then I was"
00:05:18,00:05:20,and shoot it through the eyes.
00:05:20,00:05:21,I think students do it.
00:05:21,00:05:22,I have a friend at school.
00:05:22,00:05:23,He could put a whole cocktail stick up his nose.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Don't do that.
00:05:24,00:05:25,They can kill you.
00:05:25,00:05:26,Wow.
00:05:26,00:05:27,That was his part.
00:05:27,00:05:29,Alfred Kinsey could put a whole toothbrush up his penis.
00:05:29,00:05:30,Chris led first.
00:05:30,00:05:31,I don't mind that.
00:05:31,00:05:32,What?
00:05:32,00:05:33,Really?
00:05:33,00:05:34,Yeah.
00:05:34,00:05:35,He's a sexologist.
00:05:35,00:05:36,Alfred Kinsey.
00:05:36,00:05:37,Yeah.
00:05:37,00:05:38,Alfred Kinsey from the 50s.
00:05:38,00:05:40,"Yeah, his party trick was to put--"
00:05:40,00:05:41,Party trick.
00:05:41,00:05:42,Who wants to see that?
00:05:42,00:05:43,"Wait, wait."
00:05:43,00:05:44,I've got a great--
00:05:44,00:05:46,The guy who got women's kingdom and the bulls was arrested.
00:05:46,00:05:48,I hope he was arrested at some point.
00:05:48,00:05:50,Shall we invite Alfred to the wedding?
00:05:50,00:05:51,Well--
00:05:51,00:05:52,So there's party piece.
00:05:52,00:05:53,Can we search his bag on the way in?
00:05:53,00:05:57,"If there's a toothbrush in there, no way."
00:05:57,00:06:02,"In 2009, Jonathan Lee Riches filed an injunction against the Guinness Book of Records seeking"
00:06:02,00:06:07,to stop them from naming him as the most litigious individual in the history of mankind.
00:06:07,00:06:08,Brilliant.
00:06:08,00:06:11,We might have to bleep his name out of this podcast.
00:06:11,00:06:12,Yeah.
00:06:12,00:06:13,That's brilliant.
00:06:13,00:06:15,Evil Knievel used to have a lot of world records.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Did he?
00:06:16,00:06:17,Do you remember him?
00:06:17,00:06:19,He would jump over buses on a bike and stuff like that.
00:06:19,00:06:23,"As far as I can say, I think there is one record that he still owns."
00:06:23,00:06:26,"This is really hard to Google, but I think there's one thing that he still owns."
00:06:26,00:06:27,Can you guess what it is?
00:06:27,00:06:28,Most bones broken?
00:06:28,00:06:29,It's correct.
00:06:29,00:06:30,Is it?
00:06:30,00:06:31,Yes.
00:06:31,00:06:32,Yes.
00:06:32,00:06:34,That's one thing that I know about him.
00:06:34,00:06:40,"As you watch videos of him, it's actually in terms of Shardin Freud, the funniest video"
00:06:40,00:06:41,is online.
00:06:41,00:06:44,"Because you see this man just like, ""Yeah, I'm going to own it."
00:06:44,00:06:45,I look at these buses.
00:06:45,00:06:46,I'm going to go right over them.
00:06:46,00:06:50,"It's going to be awesome at every single time."""
00:06:50,00:06:54,He just collapses and just flies across the ground.
00:06:54,00:06:58,The guy who has related to the guy who has the record for the furthest ever flown in
00:06:58,00:06:59,a car crash was Matthew McNight.
00:06:59,00:07:05,"It was in 2018, he flew 118 feet, but while he was recovering in a hospital, his doctor"
00:07:05,00:07:09,"brought him the forms to sign, the Guinness forms to sign, to prove that he had flown further"
00:07:09,00:07:13,"than anyone else, but I just think it's a very unsympathetic doctor move, like a couple"
00:07:13,00:07:14,of days.
00:07:14,00:07:15,He broke all of his bones.
00:07:15,00:07:16,I'm not thinking of that record.
00:07:16,00:07:18,"Yeah, not as many as evil can evil."
00:07:18,00:07:19,Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:20,Correct.
00:07:20,00:07:22,We should try and think up a record that we can break.
00:07:22,00:07:24,Here's one that we could break.
00:07:24,00:07:27,The most Ferrero rushes eaten in one minute is ten.
00:07:27,00:07:28,Yes.
00:07:28,00:07:34,"Is it like crackers, they dry your mouth, that's who you think it's easy."
00:07:34,00:07:35,Or is it cinnamon?
00:07:35,00:07:37,"In the middle they have like, it's kind of liquidy."
00:07:37,00:07:38,I could eat ten in a minute.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Yeah.
00:07:39,00:07:41,"Alex, have you got anything to add before we wrap up?"
00:07:41,00:07:45,"Yeah, I did find that in 2006, the man who holds the world record for spending the most"
00:07:45,00:07:50,"time in a cage of centipedes married the woman who held the same record, but with scorpions."
00:07:50,00:07:51,"Oh, great."
00:07:51,00:07:59,"Okay, it's time now to move on to fact number two, Anne."
00:07:59,00:08:04,"Yes, there is a bear in the Pyrenees who is facing castration because he has fathered nearly"
00:08:04,00:08:05,all the other bears.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"Oh, that's a bit harsh."
00:08:06,00:08:07,I think it's harsh.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"Well done, him."
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Well done, him."
00:08:09,00:08:10,"I would say well done, him."
00:08:10,00:08:11,He's amazing.
00:08:11,00:08:15,He's called Pyros and there are about 30 bears and there are only four other males and
00:08:15,00:08:18,none of them have followed any bears themselves.
00:08:18,00:08:21,"But the problem is, officials don't like it because they're worried that he's ruining their"
00:08:21,00:08:22,"gene pool, basically."
00:08:22,00:08:26,And there was recently a bear born that was his daughter and his granddaughter and they started
00:08:26,00:08:31,"to get a bit worried that this is problematic, the problem with Pyros is bears generally"
00:08:31,00:08:35,"stop being sexually active around 19, but a Pyros is 26 and still going."
00:08:35,00:08:36,Wow.
00:08:36,00:08:39,Are the bears becoming increasingly more deformed?
00:08:39,00:08:42,"I think a bear always looks pretty good, so you can't tell they're deformed and they're"
00:08:42,00:08:43,all there for.
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Well, Pliny didn't think that was true."
00:08:44,00:08:49,"You thought when a baby bear was born, it was completely shapeless and that they got into"
00:08:49,00:08:53,their bear shape by being licked into shape by their mothers.
00:08:53,00:08:56,I think everything when it's brand new is quite strange shape and they start getting more
00:08:56,00:08:57,of their shape when they're--
00:08:57,00:08:58,Yeah.
00:08:58,00:08:59,That's a good excuse.
00:08:59,00:09:02,I'm not sure what his excuse was for saying that they had very dim eyes when they're
00:09:02,00:09:08,born and the way that they get their eyes better is to allow bees to sting their faces
00:09:08,00:09:09,to improve their eyesight.
00:09:09,00:09:15,I was-- I got very interested in the idea of this bear because I didn't realize that their
00:09:15,00:09:18,"sex drive was so high, so I did a very quick Google on it."
00:09:18,00:09:19,I didn't get very far.
00:09:19,00:09:20,What did you Google?
00:09:20,00:09:21,Pony bears.
00:09:21,00:09:22,[laughter]
00:09:22,00:09:25,I mean something very different in the gay community.
00:09:25,00:09:27,Which I didn't-- I completely forgot.
00:09:27,00:09:28,I did know that.
00:09:28,00:09:29,I completely forgot.
00:09:29,00:09:33,"So just anyone out there, if you do click, ""Hornie Bear"" into Google, don't then click"
00:09:33,00:09:37,"on the link that says, ""My favorite hot and horny bears, certainly don't do it at work."""
00:09:37,00:09:41,Imagine that we're all completely misunderstanding this news article.
00:09:41,00:09:42,[laughter]
00:09:42,00:09:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:43,00:09:44,Oh dear.
00:09:44,00:09:45,Okay.
00:09:45,00:09:46,There's a bear in the Bible.
00:09:46,00:09:51,"It was a few actually, but one of them I like, and the biblical prophet Elisha wants cursed"
00:09:51,00:09:56,a group of children who teased him for being bold as a result they were mulled by bears
00:09:56,00:09:57,and killed.
00:09:57,00:09:58,Yeah.
00:09:58,00:09:59,I love that story.
00:09:59,00:10:03,"Because it's something ridiculous, like 42 kids, like it's a lot of children."
00:10:03,00:10:04,"And they're like, ""Boldie, boldie."""
00:10:04,00:10:05,"And he's like, ""Right."
00:10:05,00:10:06,Fine.
00:10:06,00:10:07,"You're going to get killed by bears."""
00:10:07,00:10:10,"So, do you know what you had to do if you were attacked by bears?"
00:10:10,00:10:11,I think we covered on this.
00:10:11,00:10:12,"There's a witch bear in the bear, isn't it?"
00:10:12,00:10:13,"Yeah, that's right."
00:10:13,00:10:14,What's that?
00:10:14,00:10:17,"So, you might be attacked by a brown bear or a black bear."
00:10:17,00:10:18,Yes.
00:10:18,00:10:21,"The problem is that brown bears are sometimes black and black bears are sometimes brown, so"
00:10:21,00:10:22,it's hard to tell.
00:10:22,00:10:27,"If you're attacked by a brown bear, then you should play dead."
00:10:27,00:10:30,"But if you're attacked by a black bear and you play dead, you'll almost certainly be"
00:10:30,00:10:31,killed.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Yeah.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Yeah.
00:10:33,00:10:34,They didn't dress like brown.
00:10:34,00:10:35,"Oh yeah, and they're just like, ""Oh, this is so much easy."""
00:10:35,00:10:38,"They also be like, ""I want a chase. I don't need just a light bear."""
00:10:38,00:10:39,"Pirates, shaggers."
00:10:39,00:10:40,Probably shaggers.
00:10:40,00:10:41,Yeah.
00:10:41,00:10:44,Peter the Great trained up two bears.
00:10:44,00:10:47,He had two white bears to serve vodka to his guests.
00:10:47,00:10:51,"And if they didn't accept the vodka, then he would train the bear to harass them, which"
00:10:51,00:10:55,I think might explain Russia's vodka problem because you're not going to turn down vodka
00:10:55,00:10:56,from an angry bear.
00:10:56,00:10:57,"What do you mean, ""harass them""?"
00:10:57,00:10:59,Just like nod you.
00:10:59,00:11:00,"Come on, mate."
00:11:00,00:11:01,Come on.
00:11:01,00:11:03,The other thing is a white bear is presumably a polar bear.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Yeah.
00:11:04,00:11:06,The other kind of bear is a spectacled bear.
00:11:06,00:11:08,They actually have markings like they're wearing a pair of glasses.
00:11:08,00:11:09,They're amazing if you haven't seen them.
00:11:09,00:11:10,Look them up.
00:11:10,00:11:11,Isn't Paddington based on--
00:11:11,00:11:12,That's what I was going.
00:11:12,00:11:13,Yeah.
00:11:13,00:11:16,Because they are the only bear found in South America.
00:11:16,00:11:18,So Paddington by default must be a spectacled bear.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"But of course, we know he's not a polar."
00:11:19,00:11:22,But I like the idea of Paddington with glasses.
00:11:22,00:11:25,"And Paddington was originally going to be from deepest darkest Africa, but the problem"
00:11:25,00:11:27,with that is there are no bears in Africa.
00:11:27,00:11:28,"There's no bears in Africa, isn't there?"
00:11:28,00:11:29,"Yeah, that makes sense."
00:11:29,00:11:30,Is it true that Byron had a bear?
00:11:30,00:11:31,Yeah.
00:11:31,00:11:32,Yeah.
00:11:32,00:11:33,So that's true.
00:11:33,00:11:34,"We've discussed this in the vodka, actually."
00:11:34,00:11:35,I'm sorry to Oxford.
00:11:35,00:11:39,"Any time that I've seen news about this bear, the one thing that doesn't come up is the name"
00:11:39,00:11:40,of the bear.
00:11:40,00:11:41,Oh.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"How do we know that he had a bear, yet the name of the bear has not made it through?"
00:11:44,00:11:50,One more bear thing I didn't know was that during the Cold War in the 1960s Americans tested
00:11:50,00:11:57,"their supersonic ejector seats on bears, and they fired bears out of the ejector seats"
00:11:57,00:11:59,and then tested how safely they landed.
00:11:59,00:12:00,"And they survived, actually."
00:12:00,00:12:03,But then they had to put the bears down to study what had happened to their spines and
00:12:03,00:12:04,what happened to their internal organs.
00:12:04,00:12:07,And so they were launching bears out of airplanes.
00:12:07,00:12:08,"Yeah, there were pictures."
00:12:08,00:12:09,These bears look pretty terrifying.
00:12:09,00:12:12,How did they get a bear in an ejector seat?
00:12:12,00:12:13,Yeah.
00:12:13,00:12:14,They must have been drugged.
00:12:14,00:12:15,They were drugs.
00:12:15,00:12:19,"So we did the thing on QI about the pig face ladies, which was actually a shaved bear in"
00:12:19,00:12:20,a dress.
00:12:20,00:12:23,And they used to get the bears really drunk before they shaved them.
00:12:23,00:12:24,Yeah.
00:12:24,00:12:25,That's insane.
00:12:25,00:12:29,"Hey, do you know what a, it's either the pronunciation is ""tap it"" or ""tap it."""
00:12:29,00:12:31,I'm not sure what the pronunciation is.
00:12:31,00:12:34,"It's associated with bears, do you know what that is?"
00:12:34,00:12:35,T-A-P-P-E-T.
00:12:35,00:12:36,What?
00:12:36,00:12:37,I don't think I know that word.
00:12:37,00:12:42,It's basically the blockage that is created when they go into hibernation.
00:12:42,00:12:43,Like a butt plug.
00:12:43,00:12:44,It's a butt plug.
00:12:44,00:12:45,Yeah.
00:12:45,00:12:46,"Yeah, a butt plug of hair."
00:12:46,00:12:47,Yeah.
00:12:47,00:12:48,It's amazing.
00:12:48,00:12:49,"For seven months, they can sleep."
00:12:49,00:12:51,"They don't eat, drink, urinate, defecate."
00:12:51,00:12:52,How do you do that?
00:12:52,00:12:53,Seven months.
00:12:53,00:12:54,It's like...
00:12:54,00:12:55,By plugging up your butt.
00:12:55,00:12:56,My mind's blown by hibernation.
00:12:56,00:12:57,"Yeah, no."
00:12:57,00:12:58,They do.
00:12:58,00:13:04,"They're going to to topper, which is slightly different, but some female bears can give birth"
00:13:04,00:13:05,while they're asleep.
00:13:05,00:13:06,What?
00:13:06,00:13:07,Yeah.
00:13:07,00:13:08,Wow.
00:13:08,00:13:09,"It's not all of them, but some of them."
00:13:09,00:13:11,They must have a seriously high-paying threshold.
00:13:11,00:13:15,"I think they just pass out drunk for a full seven months, that kind of explains that."
00:13:15,00:13:16,And they do like alcohol.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"Well, Boy Check the Bear loved beer, didn't he?"
00:13:18,00:13:24,"Boy Check who helped the polls in World War II, carrying artillery back and forth."
00:13:24,00:13:25,OK.
00:13:25,00:13:28,"But his favourite drink was beer, and he loved a cigarette."
00:13:28,00:13:29,This was a bear.
00:13:29,00:13:30,"Yeah, Boy Check the Bear."
00:13:30,00:13:31,He's really famous.
00:13:31,00:13:34,"I think there's a statue of him in Princess Street now in Edinburgh because he, when the rest"
00:13:34,00:13:35,"of his days in Scotland, I think."
00:13:35,00:13:41,"Well, we've also got that penguin at Edinburgh Zoo, Neil's all-off, is he a Norwegian guard?"
00:13:41,00:13:42,Yeah.
00:13:42,00:13:43,A knighthood?
00:13:43,00:13:45,We are going to have to move on.
00:13:45,00:13:48,"Alex, have you got anything you want to add?"
00:13:48,00:13:49,Only that Byron's bear was called Bruin.
00:13:49,00:13:50,We know his name.
00:13:50,00:13:51,"Oh, OK."
00:13:51,00:13:54,"Bruin is just a name for a bear, though, really, isn't it?"
00:13:54,00:13:58,"It also just sounds like a misspelling of Byron, right?"
00:13:58,00:14:03,That down wrong at Cambridge.
00:14:03,00:14:09,"OK, time to move on to fact number three, and that's my fact."
00:14:09,00:14:15,"And that is, Poland's only official ghost hunter thinks that ghosts have given up on haunting"
00:14:15,00:14:16,humans.
00:14:16,00:14:17,Oh.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Yeah.
00:14:18,00:14:21,"Now, it's amazing that Poland has an official registered ghost hunter to begin with."
00:14:21,00:14:22,Yeah.
00:14:22,00:14:26,"Finally, he's very dispirited because he thinks that we've become all too skeptical and that ghosts"
00:14:26,00:14:28,are no longer interested in humans.
00:14:28,00:14:32,"Or it could be that he's a very, very bad hunter, and he just can't find them because he's"
00:14:32,00:14:34,"a rowish hunter, and he's blaming it on them disappearing."
00:14:34,00:14:35,That's very true.
00:14:35,00:14:40,"I mean, I know that in Bhutan, there's an official Yeti hunter, and he's been working for"
00:14:40,00:14:41,the king.
00:14:41,00:14:44,"He's under his second king now, because the new king took over, and he's been working"
00:14:44,00:14:47,with him for something like 20 odd years.
00:14:47,00:14:48,And nothing.
00:14:48,00:14:49,"He's, you know, nothing."
00:14:49,00:14:50,Really?
00:14:50,00:14:54,"But what he said is, as the reason we haven't seen any, is that, A, they have the ability to"
00:14:54,00:14:55,turn themselves invisible.
00:14:55,00:14:58,"Secondly, he says that they have the ability to take their feet off and put them back on"
00:14:58,00:14:59,the other way around.
00:14:59,00:15:02,"So when it looks like they've walked one way, in fact, they've gone the other way."
00:15:02,00:15:03,They're sneaky.
00:15:03,00:15:04,It's very hard to tell where Yeti's gone.
00:15:04,00:15:08,"Well, I've been to Bhutan, and they have a Yeti sanctuary, don't they?"
00:15:08,00:15:09,They do.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Sanctuary.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Yes.
00:15:11,00:15:12,They have a Yeti park.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"It's an actual Yeti park where there are, like, park rangers."
00:15:14,00:15:15,We look after the Yetis.
00:15:15,00:15:20,"So when you say an official ghost hunter, is this like a government sanctioned post?"
00:15:20,00:15:21,Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:24,"I mean, presumably he's just a private guy and people pay him to go and hunt for ghosts, right?"
00:15:24,00:15:25,"Yeah, I think that's what it is."
00:15:25,00:15:27,"And people have stopped paying him now, because they don't believe in ghosts anymore and he"
00:15:27,00:15:28,is a bit pissed off.
00:15:28,00:15:30,So he's decided to claim that the ghosts are angry with people.
00:15:30,00:15:35,"I think they might have gone to Wales, because last year, the Welsh police force received"
00:15:35,00:15:39,13 reports of ghosts up from only two in 2010.
00:15:39,00:15:40,Bloody Polish immigrants.
00:15:40,00:15:44,Is this what people are talking about when they say that?
00:15:44,00:15:46,I could say that because I'm half Polish.
00:15:46,00:15:53,"But as well as finding 13 ghosts in Wales, South Wales police also got reports of three zombies,"
00:15:53,00:15:56,"two werewolves, two vampires and six witches."
00:15:56,00:15:57,Wow.
00:15:57,00:16:01,"I think they're unlike a paranormal voter, because notting him in 2011, the company said in"
00:16:01,00:16:04,"the last six years, they had 34 cases of ghosts."
00:16:04,00:16:09,"And they also had 46 witchcraft and three UFOs, all of which turned out to be Chinese lanterns."
00:16:09,00:16:10,Yeah.
00:16:10,00:16:15,Chinese lanterns are often the most mistaken object for a UFO.
00:16:15,00:16:19,They did this huge breakdown of everything that people thought was a UFO and what it actually
00:16:19,00:16:20,turned out to be.
00:16:20,00:16:21,And Chinese lanterns was way up.
00:16:21,00:16:26,"Right at the bottom, two percent of all UFO sightings turned out to be the moon."
00:16:26,00:16:31,Do you know about the big ghostly frenzy that happened in London back in 1762?
00:16:31,00:16:32,I do not.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Okay.
00:16:33,00:16:34,This is the story.
00:16:34,00:16:36,It's called Scratching Fanny of Cocklay.
00:16:36,00:16:38,"Oh, yes, I do know about it."
00:16:38,00:16:39,Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:41,Scratching Fanny of Cocklay is amazing.
00:16:41,00:16:42,Just for anybody who doesn't know it.
00:16:42,00:16:47,"In 1762, there was a public frenzy in London over the ghost of Fanny Kent, scratching"
00:16:47,00:16:50,and knocking coded messages from behind the wall of a room where she lived.
00:16:50,00:16:54,"The owner of the house saw tickets so that you could witness it and storeholders, hold"
00:16:54,00:16:57,refreshments to crowds who are gathering outside.
00:16:57,00:16:58,So it was a really big thing.
00:16:58,00:17:02,"The Duke of York came to see it, Samuel Johnson came."
00:17:02,00:17:04,"He did a say-ons there, but he debunked the whole thing."
00:17:04,00:17:05,Wow.
00:17:05,00:17:10,And the noise turned out to be made by an 11 year old girl called Elizabeth who had concealed
00:17:10,00:17:14,behind the wooden board and was doing it with her corset.
00:17:14,00:17:18,"But this is the interesting thing is that obviously throughout history, people have reported"
00:17:18,00:17:20,poltergeist-y kind of things.
00:17:20,00:17:26,"And a surprising fact, though, I read, is that it's mostly associated with pubescent girls"
00:17:26,00:17:30,"around 11 and 12 years old, which is why in all the movies like Exorcist, it's always"
00:17:30,00:17:31,a young girl.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"But James, do you know anything about that?"
00:17:33,00:17:35,"Like, is there any research?"
00:17:35,00:17:37,I know some history of it.
00:17:37,00:17:43,"You know how sometimes people say, if they're trying to talk to a ghost, they'll say knock"
00:17:43,00:17:45,once for yes and twice for no.
00:17:45,00:17:50,"That came from some sisters, I can't remember the name, I think they might be the fox sisters"
00:17:50,00:17:52,or something.
00:17:52,00:17:58,And they were tricking their parents by setting up a load of levers which would make banks
00:17:58,00:18:01,"underneath a table just for fun, really."
00:18:01,00:18:04,But then suddenly all the neighbors got involved and then suddenly it became really famous
00:18:04,00:18:08,across the country and then eventually they admitted that it was all a hoax.
00:18:08,00:18:12,"But yeah, that's where that once, once and twice knocking thing comes from."
00:18:12,00:18:13,"Okay, right."
00:18:13,00:18:17,"But there have been a few over the history about young girls doing things like that, yeah."
00:18:17,00:18:18,Yeah.
00:18:18,00:18:23,"And the Enfield poltergeist case, which was an 18 month long ghost haunting that had been"
00:18:23,00:18:25,in up in Enfield in London.
00:18:25,00:18:29,"We had a guy on the upcoming series of museum curiosity who he's a skeptic, but he studied"
00:18:29,00:18:30,it all.
00:18:30,00:18:35,His point about it was the only thing that they said as a what could be the explanation was
00:18:35,00:18:40,is that the girl in question who was a young 11 to 12 year old girl at time was that she
00:18:40,00:18:44,"was very clever, but he doesn't buy that as an excuse because he thinks that was Will"
00:18:44,00:18:45,"star, wasn't it?"
00:18:45,00:18:46,Will story.
00:18:46,00:18:47,Yeah.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"But you can see, you can see because like in your story, the not one and two knocking, that's"
00:18:50,00:18:54,an 11 year old girl in the story of scratching Fanny at Cochlein.
00:18:54,00:18:56,That's a 11 to 12 year old girl.
00:18:56,00:18:59,Maybe 11 to 12 year old girls are incredibly clever.
00:18:59,00:19:00,Maybe that's it.
00:19:00,00:19:04,"There's also, they're quite susceptible to hysteria."
00:19:04,00:19:08,When you get things happening where large groups of people all believe something which isn't
00:19:08,00:19:09,quite true.
00:19:09,00:19:10,Or all get hiccups.
00:19:10,00:19:16,"Yeah, all get hiccups or all get a laughing fit or whatever, often it does turn out to be"
00:19:16,00:19:17,pubescent girls.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Makes sense.
00:19:18,00:19:23,"Based on what you know of adolescence, the beginning of adolescence, you're very impressionable"
00:19:23,00:19:27,"and there is a cult, there's a history of like people are assuming hysteria and girls."
00:19:27,00:19:29,Can I tell you about Scottish ghost stories?
00:19:29,00:19:30,Yes.
00:19:30,00:19:33,"When I was really young, my mum basically put me off them for ages because she told me she"
00:19:33,00:19:36,saw an ad in the local paper for a jumper Uter.
00:19:36,00:19:40,"Okay, Alex, have you got anything you want to add to this before we move on?"
00:19:40,00:19:45,Only if anyone is interested in looking up the origin of the knock wants for yes twice
00:19:45,00:19:47,"for no, the sisters are called Margaret and Kate Fox."
00:19:47,00:19:48,Are they with Fox?
00:19:48,00:19:49,"Yeah, it was Fox."
00:19:49,00:19:50,Hang on.
00:19:50,00:19:51,Foxy girls.
00:19:51,00:19:57,"I just want to quickly add that this guy in Poland, this official ghost hunter, is very"
00:19:57,00:19:58,upset with the situation.
00:19:58,00:19:59,Does want it to change?
00:19:59,00:20:05,He has a 24 hour hotline that you can call him on if you have a ghost that you'd like
00:20:05,00:20:08,to report because he complains that very few people now take ghost seriously.
00:20:08,00:20:13,"So even if they do have a paranormal experience, they tend to ignore it and are reluctant to contact"
00:20:13,00:20:14,him.
00:20:14,00:20:19,"And his name is Poeta Schelkevitz and if you want to get in contact with him, there is"
00:20:19,00:20:24,a hotline or you can email him on ghost_hunted@vp.pl.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"He thinks that people are just, they see ghosts, but they don't care enough these days."
00:20:27,00:20:30,"You see a ghost and you think, whatever, I'm just going on with my day."
00:20:30,00:20:35,"Yeah, the thing is about ghosts, apparently, is most of them are not like see-through people"
00:20:35,00:20:39,"who are people in sheets or whatever, they're just normal looking people, which makes me"
00:20:39,00:20:42,think they probably are normal people.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Yeah.
00:20:43,00:20:45,"Yeah, that means I see ghosts all the time."
00:20:45,00:20:46,Yeah.
00:20:46,00:20:47,You guys are instance.
00:20:47,00:20:50,And what Bruce Willis doing in the corner of the room?
00:20:50,00:20:59,"All right, time to move on to fact number four."
00:20:59,00:21:01,That is Chazinski.
00:21:01,00:21:07,"Yep, my fact I found out this week in a recent news scientist is that fallout from the cold"
00:21:07,00:21:10,war has been used to solve murders.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"Okay, explain."
00:21:12,00:21:13,Right.
00:21:13,00:21:19,"So, nuclear testing of the US and the USSR between 1952 and 1963 caused a massive spike in the"
00:21:19,00:21:21,carbon-14 isotope.
00:21:21,00:21:26,And it's the type of carbon that you measure the degeneration of when you're carbon dating
00:21:26,00:21:27,to see how old something is.
00:21:27,00:21:28,Okay.
00:21:28,00:21:30,"So, there's a sudden spike in the atmosphere of carbon-14."
00:21:30,00:21:32,It was spread all over the world.
00:21:32,00:21:39,"And then as soon as the weapons ban came in in 1963, it started declining again."
00:21:39,00:21:47,"So, you can tell when something died by comparing how much carbon-14 in their body to what they"
00:21:47,00:21:52,"call the bomb curve, which is the gradual decrease of carbon-14 in the atmosphere since 1963."
00:21:52,00:21:53,You can tell when they died.
00:21:53,00:21:54,Right.
00:21:54,00:21:55,That's how you date someone's death.
00:21:55,00:21:56,"So, it's actually been really useful."
00:21:56,00:21:59,I just like the fact like in hundreds of thousands of years time they're going to look at
00:21:59,00:22:04,"our bodies and will be the cold war generation because our bodies have, you know, kind of all"
00:22:04,00:22:05,superheroes.
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:10,Do you know what the perfect thing for forensics is?
00:22:10,00:22:12,Apparently it's glitter.
00:22:12,00:22:13,Glittering.
00:22:13,00:22:16,"Yeah, the reason is that glitter sticks to you and you can't get rid of it."
00:22:16,00:22:17,No matter what.
00:22:17,00:22:21,"And because people just accept it and it's there, they don't really care about it."
00:22:21,00:22:24,"So, they just leave it on themselves for days and days and days and apparently it's, if"
00:22:24,00:22:30,"you commit a crime in a circus, for instance, or in a child's birthday party or something,"
00:22:30,00:22:32,then they can use the glitter to it.
00:22:32,00:22:36,"So, if someone comes and assaults you or murders you, you should always keep a little"
00:22:36,00:22:37,box of glitter.
00:22:37,00:22:40,"They can throw it over them at the last minute and be like, ""I'd be like smart water."""
00:22:40,00:22:41,It's interesting as well.
00:22:41,00:22:46,There must been a big period where people were testing out new methods like forensics
00:22:46,00:22:51,and fingerprints and so on and we've adopted them as kind of absolute truth now for a lot
00:22:51,00:22:52,of them.
00:22:52,00:22:57,"Fingerprints, I know, is actually slightly queried because every different country has different"
00:22:57,00:23:00,requirements for what makes up a match of a fingerprint.
00:23:00,00:23:06,"So, in France and Australia, they need 12 identical points to make sense of a fingerprint"
00:23:06,00:23:11,"whereas in Italy, they need 16 and in America it just varies from state to state of how"
00:23:11,00:23:12,many identities.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"They're just like, he's got fingers."
00:23:14,00:23:15,"Yeah, he's the guy."
00:23:15,00:23:16,"Yeah, that's how man."
00:23:16,00:23:20,"But fingerprinting somehow has made it through, but there's other ones back in the 1970s that"
00:23:20,00:23:25,was a lady called Dr. Louise Robbins and she was at the University of North Carolina.
00:23:25,00:23:31,She declared herself to be the world's only footprint identification experts and she
00:23:31,00:23:35,claimed that she could not only identify the shoes but the person who had been wearing
00:23:35,00:23:36,the shoes as well.
00:23:36,00:23:41,"And as a result, 12 people were sent to prison and after her death, the panel of 135 forensic"
00:23:41,00:23:45,experts reviewed her work and realized that it was just absolute nonsense.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"Oh, hey, people went to prison."
00:23:47,00:23:48,12.
00:23:48,00:23:49,Yeah.
00:23:49,00:23:50,Wow.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"Actually, I really remember solving a crime."
00:23:51,00:23:52,I love this story.
00:23:52,00:23:57,It's a 12-year-old called Jessica Maple and she went on a summer camp called Be a Junior
00:23:57,00:24:02,District Attorney and then her grandma there had died a few years ago and people broke
00:24:02,00:24:06,in and stole stuff from her house and so she used her skills and outsmarted the police
00:24:06,00:24:10,"and found the guys that she went to the house, found a broken window and fingerprints that"
00:24:10,00:24:15,"the police had missed and then she told them and then while they were following her lead,"
00:24:15,00:24:19,she found a local pawn job that had all her grandma's stuff in it and then they had managed
00:24:19,00:24:20,to identify the guys who had taken it.
00:24:20,00:24:21,She was 12.
00:24:21,00:24:22,Good for her.
00:24:22,00:24:24,So the just junior district attorney?
00:24:24,00:24:25,Yeah.
00:24:25,00:24:29,"Well, I have another thing about kids and this is about nuclear stuff."
00:24:29,00:24:33,There was a boy scout in America called David Hahn and he earned his merit badge in
00:24:33,00:24:37,"atomic energy, presumably by answering a quiz or something like that."
00:24:37,00:24:39,We're making nuclear pops.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Well that's what he decided to do.
00:24:40,00:24:45,He had a badge and so he was going to build a nuclear reactor and so he collected small
00:24:45,00:24:50,amounts of radioactive material from household goods like smoke detectors and built himself
00:24:50,00:24:55,a nuclear reactor in his shed and the police accidentally discovered it when they were looking
00:24:55,00:24:56,for something else.
00:24:56,00:25:01,"The US government commandeered his mother's house, decontaminated it and buried his shed"
00:25:01,00:25:02,in the desert in Utah.
00:25:02,00:25:03,Wow.
00:25:03,00:25:04,Oh my god.
00:25:04,00:25:11,"Well, this is his whole shed to the desert that's like up for like with radiation down."
00:25:11,00:25:14,Wasn't there a guy in England recently who became the youngest person to build a nuclear
00:25:14,00:25:17,reactor and I might have made that up so maybe Alex could check it.
00:25:17,00:25:19,"I think he lived in, I want to say, slow."
00:25:19,00:25:23,"It was somewhere that sounds comically bad, really glamorous."
00:25:23,00:25:27,A 13 year old boy called Jamie Edwards who made it at school here.
00:25:27,00:25:28,Yeah.
00:25:28,00:25:32,Apparently it's illegal to move sheep and whales until they've been checked to see
00:25:32,00:25:35,whether they carry traces of the fallout from Chernobyl as well.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Really?
00:25:36,00:25:37,Yeah.
00:25:37,00:25:38,"On this particular subject, I've got a question for you guys."
00:25:38,00:25:39,Oh yeah.
00:25:39,00:25:42,Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?
00:25:42,00:25:43,I don't know.
00:25:43,00:25:45,Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?
00:25:45,00:25:50,Chernobyl fallout.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"Ladies and gentlemen, that is the joke."
00:25:52,00:25:53,Yeah.
00:25:53,00:25:58,"Just so you know, just as a little inside bit of behind the scenes information here, Anna"
00:25:58,00:26:04,"has consistently, for the last 14 podcasts, said that same joke and we've cut it out every"
00:26:04,00:26:05,single episode.
00:26:05,00:26:07,She has refused to have it in the book.
00:26:07,00:26:08,This is a day.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"And you will not hear it in this one either, unless someone else said it."
00:26:11,00:26:13,It's the best joke ever.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"Alex, do you have anything to add before we move on?"
00:26:15,00:26:18,"Yeah, the thing about sheep and whales being radioactive is right."
00:26:18,00:26:25,All the sheep in the highest pastures still are exposed to the highest levels of cesium.
00:26:25,00:26:27,And so they will have to be tested and regulated before they go to market.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"So for those people left, still shagging sheep, stop it."
00:26:31,00:26:32,It's very dangerous.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"No, yeah, I'm not sure they do that."
00:26:35,00:26:37,"James, don't ruin my fantasies."
00:26:37,00:26:41,"Because if they did, the knobs would fall out."
00:26:41,00:26:48,"Okay, that's it, that's the end of our show."
00:26:48,00:26:49,Thanks everyone for listening.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"If you want to find out anything about the stuff that we've been talking about, you can"
00:26:52,00:26:57,actually head over to our qi.com/podcast page where we're going to have all sorts of
00:26:57,00:27:01,"videos, maybe a list of records that you could break, an update on whether we actually did"
00:27:01,00:27:08,"the Ferrero Rocher experiment, some great evil, con evil videos where he gets tossed around."
00:27:08,00:27:16,"So to speak, so to speak, some ghost imagery, perhaps, and a picture of pirus, the horny bear,"
00:27:16,00:27:20,without actual horny bears that I saw on the internet this morning.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"Okay, that's it really."
00:27:21,00:27:24,If you want to talk to any of us about the things that we've said during the course of
00:27:24,00:27:27,"this podcast, you can get us all on our Twitter handle."
00:27:27,00:27:36,"So I'm on @Sriberland, James, @egshaped, @millar_an, @Alex, @AlexBell_, and Anna."
00:27:36,00:27:45,"If you email podcast@qi.com, #getAnnaOnTwitter, someone made the argument that if you don't"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"have Twitter, how can you see the hashtag?"
00:27:47,00:27:51,So what we've done is we printed out all of the tweets and posted them around Anna's desk
00:27:51,00:27:52,wallet.
00:27:52,00:27:59,"Thanks so much for listening, we'll be back again next week with another episode of No Such"
00:27:59,00:28:18,"thing as a fish, and we'll catch you then, goodbye."
00:28:18,00:28:19,Bye.
00:28:20,00:28:20,Bye.
00:28:21,00:28:21,Bye.
00:28:21,00:28:22,Bye.
