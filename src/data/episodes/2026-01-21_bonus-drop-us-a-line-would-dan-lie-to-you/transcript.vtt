00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
 (telephone rings)

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.920
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.500
 (fun music)

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.940
 - Hi!

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.480
 - Hey Andy.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720
 - Hi everybody, welcome to Drop us a Line.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.600
 Thank you for listening, thank you for watching.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.960
 We hope you've had a lovely break.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.080
 We're back, we're raring to go.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
 We're full of beans.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.160
 How's the inbox?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.000
 Bulging.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.960
 (clears throat)

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 It's stunning.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.480
 I've actually got a hefty bit of paper pile in front of me.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.100
 Any inbox-related New Year's resolutions?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.920
 - Ooh, for me.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.760
 - Yeah.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.920
 - I think just, I'm gonna keep reading everything

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.400
 and that's my, I'm just trying to stay on top of it.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.560
 - Yeah, okay, great.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.560
 - Yeah, I'm gonna stay on top of it.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.760
 It's my resolution.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.600
 - Okay.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.000
 - I'm not gonna let it get like it did last year.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.880
 - It was an absolute shambles last year.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.240
 - It really was, it really was.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.400
 You have to just sort of pretend

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.320
 you've lost those 10,000 emails, no, I don't know.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.160
 - Yeah, right.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.400
 - I do read them, and they're all brilliant.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.920
 You've been emailing in podcast@ky.com

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.840
 and we've got a lot to get through, guys.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.680
 - Okay.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.520
 - Let's do it, let's go.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.160
 - Well, let's start with the business lounge.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 - Oh, this is new.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.160
 - This is new.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.660
 (laughs)

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.500
 - What is the business lounge?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.280
 - Well, it's where people pitch us ideas.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.000
 - Oh, business lounge, as in, this is a business idea.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.840
 - Yeah.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.680
 - Oh, I see.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 - I can't trust it.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.520
 - Okay, well.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.920
 - This is a dragonfish dead.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.880
 - We're fish tank, fish tank.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.880
 - Yeah.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.960
 - James writes,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.360
 "While playing hungry, hungry hippos over Christmas,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.480
 "my entrepreneurial mind invented a sure fire.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.720
 "No such thing as a fish money spinner."

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.560
 - Yeah.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.400
 - Okay.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.000
 "Swap out the hippos with faithful recreations

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.720
 "of President James Garfield's buttocks.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.200
 "Hey presto, a fun and educational game for all the family.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.840
 "I'm looking for 450,000 pounds."

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080
 - Okay, in return for a 30% stake.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.920
 - Here's the issue.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.040
 I feel that what he ate through his anus

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.080
 was largely soup based, which is--

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.200
 - Yeah, eggs though.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.040
 - Sorry.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.880
 - Eggs.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.720
 - He had eggs?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.400
 - Yeah.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.000
 - Fried or--

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.800
 - I think they were probably chopped up.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.560
 - Not just whole, it wasn't like a reverse chicken.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.280
 - It wasn't like a boiled.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.640
 - It's the reverse chicken.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.480
 - No.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.440
 - Okay.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.560
 - I believe they stopped giving him eggs

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.160
 because it was causing annoying smells.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.000
 - Yes.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.160
 - So eggs could work.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.000
 - Eggs could work.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.720
 - I've got a question for James.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.600
 And that is, how do you differentiate

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.320
 President Garfield's buttocks from any other buttocks

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.160
 around the world?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 How do we know that they're Garfieldian?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.640
 - I think you'll have to have a little mold of his face,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.040
 his upper half at the other end.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.880
 - I see.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.720
 - Of the hippo.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.960
 I guess you pressed down on his,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.040
 on the top of his head actually,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.160
 to make the buttocks leap out and grab some food.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.760
 Visually, that could work great.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.600
 - I think so.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.440
 - Yeah.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.840
 - Anyway, I have been into your bank accounts.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.920
 I'm siphoned off 150,000 of each of you.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.120
 I don't even know 149,000 pounds in the red.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.720
 Sorry.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 - What's it called?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.960
 Because that might not be a problem.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.400
 I might be happy about that.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.960
 - There's not much you can do with hungry, hungry hippos.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.800
 - No.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.600
 This ass eats.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.760
 - This, well, kids, kids, time.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.240
 Where's grandma?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.600
 We're playing this ass eats.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.000
 - Quick.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.760
 - Yeah.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.600
 - Yeah.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.800
 - And you can stop me watching that.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.160
 I hope those of you have been waiting for me

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.080
 to cry at the sound of the sound.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.680
 - email one minute three, brilliant.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.840
 - Oh, so thanks James.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.520
 That's a great idea and the check is in the post.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.520
 All right, I've got some serious legal news.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.680
 - Oh, we had a business lounge.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.520
 - Yes, we are.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.720
 We're into plagiarism corner.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.560
 - Oh, yeah.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.680
 - Oh, wow.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680
 - Yeah.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.880
 So Declan Costello writes,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.080
 "I am a very recent new listener to the podcast.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.840
 I'm very much enjoying working my way

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.000
 through the back catalog."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.400
 Nice, perfect.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.880
 Listening to your theme music,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.200
 I was struck by the resemblance to the opening bars

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.800
 of Kate Bush's "Wuthering Heights."

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.280
 - Hmm.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.200
 - I surely cannot be the only person

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200
 to have commented on this.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.360
 Declan, you are.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.920
 You're the first person in nearly 12 years.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.400
 - Please suggest to me that they're not similar.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.720
 - Well, do you want to hear it?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.560
 - Yeah.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.360
 - Sure, well, I think you and I know.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.200
 - Right.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.160
 - I feel like I know "Wuthering Heights" as well, but.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.480
 - I thought I knew it too.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.840
 This is quite striking, I'm going to say.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.800
 Have a listen to this.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.640
 - So.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.840
 - It'll be an exciting, exciting 2026 for Fish

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.920
 and we will see you then.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.560
 - That sounds nothing like Kate Bush.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.400
 Wait, okay.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.080
 That bit?

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.920
 Yeah.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.280
 Okay, wait for it.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.880
 (soft music)

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.880
 (singing)

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.880
 (singing)

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.880
 (singing)

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.880
 - Yeah? - Not bad, yeah.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.520
 - I can see a slight resemblance, but not enough

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.680
 for it to be legally challengeable.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.680
 - I can see why Bush's lawyers had to step down

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.280
 when presenting their case, yeah.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.720
 - I think that's right, James.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.200
 I think legally there's not remotely similar enough

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.280
 for that to be any chance of a successful action.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.160
 - Well, do you remember when Robin Thickey got

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.600
 done for plagiarism and it was all on the vibe?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.760
 And I don't reckon that the vibe is the same there?

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.680
 - No, I think we're a bit more mystical in the material.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.520
 - than Kate Bush.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.720
 (laughing)

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.520
 - But anyway, so thank you, Declan, that's good

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.520
 to keep us on our toes.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520
 - Yeah. - Cool.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.720
 - That's great. - Let's see if you spotted something

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.400
 that might financially ruin us.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.920
 The email address is podcasting.com.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.760
 Thanks very much.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.840
 - Well, we didn't write that feature.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.680
 - Yeah.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.520
 - No, no.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520
 - That was written by Ash Gardner.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.360
 - That's true.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.640
 - Some time of this parish.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.080
 - Yeah. - Yes, yeah.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.920
 - Yeah.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.520
 - Hugo and Alan Betts as well, yeah.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.360
 - Yeah.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.200
 - Empre yes.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.360
 - Yes. - If you want to go on Spotify.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 - Yeah, it's on Spotify.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.240
 - Yeah. - It's a great album.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.560
 - Yeah.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.160
 - And Kate Bush is also available.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.120
 (laughing)

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.960
 - Good.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.400
 Ellie Pearson writes in about a recent episode

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.640
 we did with Lou Sanders.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.480
 - Yeah. - Oh.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.160
 - This is a telling off for me.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.720
 Hi Andy, I feel like a lot of people

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.920
 might write in about this.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.520
 I'm afraid you're the first, Ellie.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.840
 So I apologize if that's the case.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.920
 I wasn't gonna mention it when you only said it once,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.040
 but then you said it five times and I couldn't let it go.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.520
 Okay, the pronunciation of Wyoming

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.640
 has the inflection on the second syllable, not the first.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.760
 So it's Wyoming.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.200
 - No, it's not Wyoming. - It's Wyoming.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.080
 - Oh, I've done it six, six times.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.360
 It's Wyoming.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.440
 - And you said Wyoming. - Wyoming.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.760
 Five times apparently. - Okay.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.040
 - Wyoming.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.560
 - Yeah, Wyoming. - Wyoming, that's fair enough.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.480
 - I know it's a slight difference,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.880
 but I figure if the Australians are allowed

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.080
 to correct pronunciation, so are the Americans.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.920
 Fair enough?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.320
 - One thing I've noticed very early in this year

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.440
 is how many times people are apologizing to you

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.040
 for writing in almost as if you've been saying

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.520
 quite often on the podcast.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.080
 We get too many emails, guys.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.600
 You know what, James, this brings me,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.120
 you've actually precipitated,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.800
 I need to get ahead because we had an email from,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.080
 I think it was called Park.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080
 Yeah, Park.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.240
 I hate when you all say don't write in.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.160
 It makes me feel bad,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.000
 even if I wasn't planning on writing in.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.240
 (laughing)

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.240
 Like me saying don't write in is prompted him to write in,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.560
 so it hasn't worked.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.120
 So I'm really sorry, always write in.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.960
 Always write in, I do be genuinely loved.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.400
 - We love these. - Oh, we do, we do, we do.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.640
 - And if you don't want to write in,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.200
 then do write in and tell us.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.240
 - Podcasts of UI.com.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.160
 - Whether or not you want to write in, please write in.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.480
 - Right, thanks but no thanks.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.320
 - Okay, oh.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.480
 - No, thanks but no thanks.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480
 - Yeah, okay.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.880
 Dan's unexpected anecdotes are always a real treat.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.960
 It never ceases to amaze me.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.880
 How frequently Dan is able to perfectly segue

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.440
 into some personal experience

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.320
 based on something other hosts have said.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.840
 From my family was featured in a friend's parking

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.720
 in fraction photo and the tip off was a pumpkin suit.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.880
 - To, I was featured in a Hong Kong Karate magazine

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.200
 for spitting on an opponent.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.640
 (laughing)

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.240
 - There are hours of ready-made material

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.600
 just begging to be collected and released as a special.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.760
 - Well, I think, you know, one day Bob Mortimer has to retire,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.760
 right?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.840
 And would I like you are gonna need someone

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.440
 with ridiculous stories to come on the show?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.800
 - Yeah, I think you're right.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.440
 Yeah, the problem is, is they're all true.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.520
 So I would just, I would be caught out every single time.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.640
 - You get to make, what, no.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.000
 - I don't know if I can make up one.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.920
 I don't know if I can fabricate a life story.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.520
 - Yeah, in the moment.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.360
 - Try me.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.720
 - I'll try one during this episode.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.560
 See if it's on it.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.880
 - Okay, great, exciting, okay.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.640
 (laughing)

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.160
 Now interestingly, Jim Dennis.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.640
 - My uncle's called Jim Dennis.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.360
 - Right, that's a lie.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.200
 - Correct.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.600
 (laughing)

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.440
 - God, you're good.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.280
 - He's good.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.120
 - You're both good.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.240
 - Well, I'm not going on if he's going on.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.520
 (laughing)

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.880
 - No, but you know, Jim, James, Dan, Dennis.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.200
 - You know, you can sometimes get Nick Mender, I do.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.160
 - Just a bit weird, isn't it?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.760
 - I'm just thinking that Lee Mack has to retire eventually.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760
 - Right.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.840
 - They need some sort of Northern Chipper Lad.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.480
 - Yes. - Come on.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.320
 - That's very good.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.920
 - So we could be the future of what I like to you.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.960
 - We could be.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.920
 - David Mitchell.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.480
 - It's not going anywhere.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.320
 - Oh no.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.520
 (laughing)

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.520
 - Dan, James, and David Mitchell

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.560
 present their new project.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.400
 - That sounds good.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.240
 - Right.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.080
 - That sounds good.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.920
 (laughing)

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.720
 - I was just thinking, you know what the special guest

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.560
 comes on.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.400
 - Oh yeah.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.320
 - How do you know this man?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.440
 Well, he actually lost all of his money

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.560
 to a game attribute to hungry hippos.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.240
 (laughing)

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240
 - Cool.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.560
 This ass eats.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.160
 (laughing)

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.040
 - Yeah.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.880
 Okay.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.880
 (laughing)

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.320
 - Well Jim Dennis says, in a recent episode at Christmas,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.520
 you mentioned James and Dan have lived really interesting

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.680
 lives before no such thing as a fish.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.160
 Weirdly no mention of me.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.680
 (laughing)

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.760
 - My suggestion.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.480
 Can I say, "Scree you, Jim."

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.320
 (laughing)

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.800
 - My suggestion will be his Andy and he's a friend of mine

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.160
 who has no anecdotes.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.840
 (laughing)

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.640
 - Rob Brighton's got to retire eventually.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.400
 (laughing)

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.240
 - My suggestion will be an episode of no such thing

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.560
 as a fish which focuses upon

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.280
 either James or Dan.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.600
 (laughing)

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.440
 - Yeah.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.280
 - What am I?

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.120
 - What am I?

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.880
 - We could do you one week and me the next year.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.720
 - Yeah.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.560
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.920
 - We the listeners can find out more about you guys,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.320
 but also draw upon interesting facts from your past.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.240
 Facts built around an interesting life well lived.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.600
 Well Andy, I presume it just continues reading the emails.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.200
 (laughing)

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.440
 - Can't believe I put that in thanks, but no thanks.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440
 - Right, say thanks.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.160
 - Good Lord.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.400
 - I can't believe you're getting bullied on email

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.680
 from our fans.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.120
 - It's quite something, isn't it?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.360
 But not even bullied actively, bullied by a mission.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.200
 - Yeah.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.840
 - By Jim knew why he was doing that.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.680
 - Yeah, he was doing.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.520
 - He knew what he was doing.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.360
 - Yeah.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.200
 - All right.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.200
 Well, here's one from Sully.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.440
 Hello, any chance you could post a video

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.600
 of James Harkin doing his Donald Duck impression

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.640
 on Instagram.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.720
 I'd love to see what he looks like when he's doing it.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.200
 He's so funny.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.960
 - Okay, well, thanks.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.720
 PS Dance Terrific, too.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.520
 (laughing)

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.560
 - Well, we're filming this, so I can quickly do it.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.400
 - We're filming this.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.560
 - I can quickly do it.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.400
 - Yeah.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.520
 - Good luck.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.200
 - Goofy's got to retire eventually.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.480
 (laughing)

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.320
 - Cool.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.160
 - Guy.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.000
 - Wow.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.840
 - Yeah, pretty good.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.680
 - So, I'm pretty good.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.880
 - I don't know what I look like in any case, actually,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.560
 'cause I have face blackness, but it's true.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.760
 Like, I don't know what I look like there.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.440
 I assume I just have a slightly open mouth on one side.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.280
 - Yeah.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.120
 - Yeah.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.960
 - No, it was good.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.480
 That's a very good impression.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.080
 So, thank you, Sully.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.000
 We now come to get yourself off the hook.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.840
 Okay.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.200
 And then we're gonna segue into this week's rodeo clown,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.920
 which is a different kind of get yourself off the hook.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.760
 - Yes.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.760
 - Unfortunately.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.480
 Ian Flower says there's one for me.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.880
 I'm so sorry, I imagine you're getting this a lot all week.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.720
 It seems as though the clock faces on the Elizabeth Tower.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.200
 Do show X's.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.040
 - Interesting.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.040
 - They're just in the Fractour font,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.360
 which makes them look quite a lot like F's.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.640
 - Yes, so, this is, I think they're right.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.520
 I forgot the name, sorry.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.840
 - Ian, is that Ian?

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.720
 - Yeah, I think Ian is right about that.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.120
 But one interesting thing is,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.880
 if you go onto the website of the House of Parliament,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.720
 they specifically say that they're not X's, they're F's.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.920
 But when you look at it,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.960
 they're very obviously stylized X's

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.320
 that Pugin just decided he wanted to do that.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.840
 - Yeah, look, 'cause I spent quite a long time looking at that.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.160
 Basically, what we said was, in case anyone missed this,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.040
 Lord Borwick wrote in and said that the X's

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.080
 on the face of the Big Bang clock are in fact F's.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.560
 And there are some very weird Gothic fonts

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.320
 where the X looks quite a bit like it.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.480
 But it's really tall with a sticky outfit at the time.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.360
 - Yeah, we looked at the pictures at the time.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.440
 - Yeah, it does look like it.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.720
 - Well, after we got that email from Lord Borwick,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.720
 I thought I wondered if we could run it on QI

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.440
 'cause we're currently researching the X series on QI.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.600
 And we did some more work on it.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.960
 And I think we're not gonna run it for that reason

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.760
 because we think they are stylized X.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.600
 - 'Cause it's not true.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.080
 - Yeah, just fair enough.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.360
 Well, but you must have loads of material for the X series.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.240
 - Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.240
 - Yeah.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.240
 - And thank you also to Salman,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.880
 long time listener from Riyad,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.560
 who wrote in saying the same thing.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.200
 And he claimed that a Lord wrote in

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.760
 to tell him there are no X's.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.680
 He's a real Lord, what does he want to say?

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.520
 The Lord is real.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.360
 - You were getting a kicking in this episode.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.200
 - For me?

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.040
 - At your own hand as well,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.600
 'cause you select these emails to bring.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.720
 - Well, don't worry, Dan.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.800
 Your time will come.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.640
 - Will it?

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.560
 - Uh, not sure.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.560
 Can't remember.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.440
 - Oh, here's another thing.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.760
 - Here's the last threat ever.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.000
 (laughing)

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.600
 - This is why I failed my audition to play Fanos.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.560
 - And then that's Bonville and your time will come.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.400
 - Maybe.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.720
 - Anyway, I'm just gonna throw myself

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.600
 into the shark tank now.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.840
 - Speaking of shark tank, Mr. Bond.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.320
 Have I told you my idea?

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.600
 (laughing)

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.320
 - So do you know the phrase this eats ass

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.000
 means something bad, okay.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.840
 What if?

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.680
 Okay.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.600
 Right, Dawn Heatherington

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.640
 raced with something else that I got wrong.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.120
 (laughing)

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.640
 I don't want to be dishonest.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.600
 I can't let a fact go wrong on the show.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.440
 - Absolutely.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.280
 - You know.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.120
 - No way.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.920
 - Yeah, he's gonna have integrity.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.440
 - Dawn Heatherington writes,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.520
 "My ears pricked up when listening to this week's podcast

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.600
 "as I felt sure I had listened to an interview

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.960
 "with the British author of the Jack Reacher books

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.000
 "saying he no longer wished to live in America

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.240
 "and he was returning to Britain."

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.960
 So, I said he lives in Wyoming.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.800
 - Off the grid.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.640
 - So off-grid.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.480
 - End of a long drive.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.920
 - 10 miles from his own postbox.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.760
 - Yes.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.240
 - And 45 miles from the nearest grocery store.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.360
 Well, apparently he's moved back to the lake district.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.200
 - Okay.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.040
 - Oh, lovely.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.880
 - That's right, yeah.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.000
 - So he's back in the lake district.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And I looked up and he's done it.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.160
 He has been interviewed and said,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.640
 "Yes, I've moved back."

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.480
 So.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.520
 - Having lived in the lake district,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.000
 I can say that you can often be a long way

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.400
 from your nearest shop as well.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.240
 - Absolutely.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.400
 - So he hasn't moved to the hustle bustle.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.240
 - No.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.160
 - Well, those trains from Windermere are pretty unreliable,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.000
 aren't they?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.840
 - Yeah.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.520
 - Good stuff.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.920
 - Once an hour to Watson Home.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.320
 (laughing)

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.240
 - I'll, you used to live properly there, didn't you?

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.560
 And that brings us to the rodeo clown.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.400
 - Okay.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.240
 - Ooh.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.080
 - Here we go.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.800
 - Now you'll see why I did so much preparatory

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.800
 dunking on myself.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.640
 - Oh shit.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.640
 - Because I'm about to read out about 1,500 words

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.280
 which backs me up on something I said.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.280
 - Oh, here we go.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.120
 - Oh, here we go.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.960
 - Here we go.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.800
 - Okay, sorry, right.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.640
 - Don't you worry.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.640
 Right, Shane Doran says,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.720
 "Your novels aren't that bad after all."

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.920
 (laughing)

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.160
 Shane Doran says,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.200
 "Regarding the point made by Andy about the train

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.600
 "that requires zero energy to run,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.200
 "I would like to point out it is possible for this to work

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.560
 "without requiring either magical

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.680
 "any kind of perpetual motion device."

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.440
 So this was, there's a train in Australia

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.880
 which gets loaded up with iron ore at the top of the hill,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.720
 goes downhill, breaks on the way

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.320
 to reach out its battery 'cause it's an electric train,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.880
 and then empties out the iron ore

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.920
 and has enough extra juice from the braking

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.080
 to get itself to the top of the hill.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.600
 - Yeah, and I think what the problem,

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.240
 'cause Alice was saying that it might not be possible,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.760
 and I think I sort of said that as well,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.960
 but I think we didn't really take into account

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.760
 the potential energy that you're adding

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.440
 when you put the loads on,

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.080
 which obviously you need to use energy

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.800
 to put the loads on as well, right?

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.480
 - The work is basically,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.120
 well, I'll read Shane's email basically.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.120
 If the train is loaded at the top of the hill,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.280
 the load has a large amount of potential energy

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.000
 that can be used to charge the battery.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.840
 If the train goes back up the hill empty,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.720
 then there is less potential energy required

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.840
 to drive it up the hill

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.440
 than was available to drive it down.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.280
 This is just a slightly more convoluted version

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.760
 of a water wheel.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.520
 So the rocks are descending in a controlled manner

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.520
 and charging the battery.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.740
 I think Professor Alice owes Andy an apology.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.080
 (laughing)

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:14.920
 - I think.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.760
 - Let's call her up.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.280
 - Yes, there we go.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.760
 - Now I think we, yeah, it was just the,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.120
 obviously you need energy to load it up.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.840
 - Yes, the work is being done at the top of the hill.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.400
 Like that is effectively another version

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.240
 of a battery being charged

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.520
 is filling a train up with these rocks,

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.680
 which then, you know, once that mountain is empty,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.440
 then you won't be able to run an infinity train anymore.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.320
 Anyway, I wanna thank David Hopkins.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.720
 I thought you were not treated very well

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.640
 when talking about the infinite train.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.600
 Nash Rochman.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.240
 James indicated this would constitute

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.120
 a perpetual motion machine, but it would not.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.560
 Andy even summarized the mechanism

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.800
 but was unfairly silenced.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.480
 Eric Samuel.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.160
 - Let's go, I'm not gonna go on.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.000
 - Please.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.160
 - We've had dozens of emails about it.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.600
 - When you're making up these names,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.760
 do you take two separate names

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.920
 and bash them together to make a full one?

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.760
 - Oh, let's see.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.920
 - Yeah, lie.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.400
 (laughing)

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.800
 - No, thank you to everyone.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.480
 I'm really touched by your support, you wrote in.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.560
 - It works, the infinite train works.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.160
 I thought you said the mountain runs out though.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.560
 - Yeah, like in a hundred years

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.360
 when they've emptied out this entire mine,

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.120
 what is infinite to you?

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.960
 - Oh my gosh.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.600
 (laughing)

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.120
 - Stop.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.520
 Anyway, no, thank you everyone for writing

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.360
 and about the infinite train, the theory works.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.280
 And the train is going, anyway, whatever.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.360
 I'm cool about it.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.760
 Right, now we move on to a really fun section,

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.160
 a new section that I think we're lobbying for names for.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.080
 It's personal experiences that people have had

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.600
 based on things we've talked about.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.440
 - Oh, okay.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.880
 And I can't think of a fishy pun for it.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.360
 - Right, Alexander Dudley writes,

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.480
 "My wife, Jane and I just listened to the episode,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.160
 "little fish, this could tail off really quickly

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.800
 "and we're heartened to hear our story mentioned."

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.400
 "For I am the husband

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.320
 "that cured my wife, Jane's treatment resistant

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.360
 "by polar disorder with poo transplants."

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.560
 - Come on.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.400
 - 2017.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.240
 - Okay.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.080
 - No way.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.120
 - This is, I'm Starstruck.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.080
 My wife has now been without bipolar symptoms

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.560
 and off all medications for eight years, not one year.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.000
 Can't remember if we said that.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.400
 And we know of 18 other people who have resolved

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.560
 their bipolar disorder

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.680
 through this somewhat unconventional treatment.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.920
 - Can you give us,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.840
 can you just remind us the basics of the story?

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.760
 - Yeah, so this lady had this problem of bipolar disorder

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.920
 and they found out that by having a fecal transplant,

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.280
 they changed the biome presumably, I forgot, and...

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.120
 - How was that?

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.760
 - It was a hominage fecal transplant.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.520
 It was administered at home the old fashioned way.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.360
 - And then the bit that we did was imagining

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.200
 how you bring that up in a relationship.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.520
 - Yes.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.360
 - Yeah.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.600
 - But I'm amazed that these people are actually listening.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600
 That's incredible.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.640
 - And Alexander writes, "Prior to the treatment,

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.560
 "missing any of her three medications

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.720
 "for more than 48 hours,

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.440
 "mentally would be in a psych ward within a week."

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.080
 And then since the treatment, it's now fine.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.760
 The treatment also began on my birthday,

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.200
 but that was purely coincidental.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.040
 Suspicious.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.720
 - That is stunning.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.000
 - I know, because the post line of that was like,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.680
 "Maybe we could try it on my birthday."

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.000
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 - That's amazing.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.240
 - I know.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.080
 - So there you go.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.480
 So thank you, Alexander.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.320
 - Oh, good.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.320
 - And he includes a lot more details,

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.160
 but it was quite a long email

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.320
 so we don't have time to read the whole thing.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.160
 But just stunning.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.280
 It's a new field of research and it is exploding.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.160
 He says, "Like the bowels of someone

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.000
 "with clistradiodes difficile,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.240
 "which is presently the only disease

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.760
 "the treatment is officially approved for."

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.920
 Anyway.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.760
 - Incredible.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.600
 - That's great.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.040
 - I'm really, like you say, star stroke, genuinely.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.880
 Yeah. - Yeah.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.720
 - Yeah.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.560
 - Really cool.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.400
 - Can I give you a similar one,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.440
 someone who had an experience?

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.760
 - Yes. - So great.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.160
 - So we said on a recent podcast

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.920
 that Kanye West, on his rider,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.320
 said that they had to iron his carpets.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.000
 - Okay.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.840
 - Do you remember that?

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.680
 - Yeah.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.320
 - I was giving some strange riders

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.880
 and that was one of them.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.480
 We had someone who I'm not allowed to name,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.200
 but I can say that they worked on the Jewels Holland show.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.880
 And when they were working on that show,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.240
 Kanye had his carpets ironed

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.520
 and that's where the story came from.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.360
 - Amazing.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.320
 - Now, the reason was,

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.600
 is Kanye likes everything to be white

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.080
 in his dressing room.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.120
 And the events team put a new white carpet on the floor.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.760
 So that's normal.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.840
 And then they steamed it because it needed to be clean.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.440
 But then someone walked past and saw it being steamed

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.240
 and thought that he deliberately asked it to be ironed.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.480
 When actually they were just cleaning it

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.080
 because you would clean it normally.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.440
 And then that person walked past,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.920
 sold the story to the sun.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.560
 And then it became folklore that Kanye West

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.960
 always asked for his carpets to be ironed.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.800
 - So how this happens?

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.000
 - When in fact, he just wants an all white dressing room

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.920
 like any normal artist.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.680
 (laughing)

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.520
 - That's brilliant.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.360
 - That's so good.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.800
 - Is that your celeb ghost that you said you heard?

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.720
 - That is my spicy celebrity meat.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.960
 - I've got a friend who got to go on Jewels Holland.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.640
 I think it was last year or the year before.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.040
 And he's in a band and so the band was on there.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.160
 And it just so happens that Jewels Holland

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.520
 is also his landlord for the flat that he rents.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.480
 So, sorry, that's really funny.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.320
 - Yeah.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.080
 And Jewels Holland apparently is really hands on

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.040
 as a landlord because there's a problem.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.080
 If there's a problem, he really wants to sort it, right?

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.560
 He runs over, "Hell, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.800
 "Dishonel is your lullaby."

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.160
 I will now fix the live-on.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.600
 So he didn't know that my friend was going to be on the show.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.400
 And so they play their song, and Jules does the ending.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.320
 He's like, "Oh, goodnight, everyone." He turns around, and he sees my friend,

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.480
 and he's like, "Hey, it's me." And so you can see at the end,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.080
 Jules is talking to him, and what Jules is saying is, "The boiler, I'm going to fix it."

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:13.440
 Someone coming in, I booked it in, he's doing house-maintored stuff in the credits.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.040
 Okay, what are we going to say, Andy? I think lie.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.440
 I think lie. I'm clearly followed.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.400
 We're going to say lie.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.240
 It was, in fact, true.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.800
 In fact, it was true.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.080
 Jules Holland was Dan's boiler buddy.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.840
 Now, Andy, what have you got for us?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:40.320
 I've got an anonymous poo expert who writes in an anonymous poo expert.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.160
 Who asked for their name to be removed?

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.600
 Just to gently and very kindly, correct James Harkin, who said that, climbing Everest,

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.400
 he would leave his human waste a couple of hours before collecting them, so they would freeze.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.480
 And I, at the moment, I have a dog that I walk every day, and I need to pick up his droppings.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.960
 I'm in Canada, where it's been minus 25 Celsius for the fast few days, and let me tell you,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.320
 turns freeze a lot faster than hours.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.600
 Knowing the top of Mount Everest gets to minus 19 on a hot day, I can safely say that James

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.600
 would only have to wait a few minutes before being able to pick up his poop sickle.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.280
 What was the name of this person, sorry?

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.280
 Anonymous poo expert.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:25.160
 Anonymous poo expert, I could say, "You don't know my diets."

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.880
 Two Shay, two Shay.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.760
 Cool science fact from Eric Stafford, who was a cardiac medical device representative.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.400
 We mentioned Dr. Werner Forstman, who did the first ever heart catheteriser?

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.880
 Which you mentioned, I think, in that show.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.080
 Yeah, and he's basically the first person to put a catheter into his own heart, as a

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.080
 sort of theory.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.080
 It's all very exciting.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.280
 Anyway, Eric adds just a fun little bonus fact.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.680
 In my world of cardiac electrophysiology, we now use a technique called pulsed field

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.640
 ablation to treat heart arrhythmias, where the rhythm of your heart is slightly off.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.400
 But lots of the pre-human testing was done on potatoes, because this technology is also

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.000
 used to make potato chips, and apparently there's this technique called electroporation,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.880
 which uses high-voltage bursts to use water molecules to rip tiny holes in things normally

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880
 potatoes.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880
 Wow.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.200
 But they will occasionally do it on the human heart.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200
 That's very cool.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.200
 How interesting.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.520
 There's a lovely fact there.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.920
 This correspondents called Dan James.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.520
 We had Jim Dennis earlier.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.400
 Yeah, it's Brian Wales Footballer, Welsh Footballer, Dan James.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.680
 He says, "Yes, just come off the back half of the line."

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.680
 What?

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.680
 Very good.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:47.400
 Yeah, it's the back half line of traditional football saying, because I really know.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.120
 I've just been having my orange at the half-time.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.120
 Yeah?

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120
 Yes.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:26:02.640
 Podcast@QI.com, and I will be apologising to each and every one of you.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:09.600
 Dan James, right, thanks to you all.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.080
 This is how my wife and I are seeing in 2026, and then send an image of the film, "Now you

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.080
 see me."

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.080
 Oh.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080
 Lovely.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.160
 You've changed the year, but listening to "Now you see me."

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.800
 Did they say what they thought about it?

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.800
 Very enjoyable stuff, says Dan.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800
 I mean, Dan James.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.360
 It's perfect for "Now you see me" viewer, as we know.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.560
 I've got to watch it.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560
 I've got to watch it.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.560
 Haven't seen it yet.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.560
 No, not yet.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.880
 I'm saying I'm waiting for 2027.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.400
 We've got an outrage of the week, but it's all in this personal experience thing.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.160
 Oh, have you guys thought of a name for the personal experience?

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160
 No.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.160
 No.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.720
 Yeah, it's like a personal experience.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720
 It's not good.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.600
 It's not good if a perch is kind of fish.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.600
 Yeah, no.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600
 Exactly, right?

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600
 Yeah.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.400
 Anyway, outrage of the week, Lauren Philpot, my family and I were playing an interactive

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.240
 version of pointless during our Christmas celebrations.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.920
 In real life, like real as in a...

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.960
 There we go.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960
 That's it.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.960
 Real life.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.960
 Real life, real life.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.960
 Yeah.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.960
 Lovely.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.320
 Lauren Philpot writes, "My family and I were playing an interactive version of pointless

 And I managed to get through to the final part due to my random trivia knowledge, thanks

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.320
 to your podcast."

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.320
 Right.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.320
 Okay.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.080
 The final topic was history and the category was gunpowderplot conspirators.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080
 I guess.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.080
 And I couldn't believe my luck.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.080
 Yeah.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.160
 I, of course, went with friend of the podcast, knowing in my soul that it would be pointless

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.680
 and win me eternal glory over my family.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.600
 Imagine my heartbreak when I was told that I was wrong.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600
 What?

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.280
 The makers of the game clearly don't listen to your podcast.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.280
 So it wasn't even an option?

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.600
 It wasn't even listed as an option.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:58.040
 I got to say, I mean, it's a tricky question for 99.99% of the...

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.120
 Anyone, anyone other than Guy Fawkes is going to be a pointless answer, right?

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.120
 Yeah.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.120
 Yeah.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120
 But it just...

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120
 Isn't that outrageous?

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120
 Who else was there?

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120
 That you wouldn't...

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120
 No, I'm sorry for the other.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120
 No, no, no, no.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.120
 It's not the top guy Fawkes.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.120
 And that's sort of...

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.120
 Who else is there, you know?

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.120
 Everyone did me.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120
 Everyone did me.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.000
 It feels like it's a joke from the people who made the game, knowing that people only know

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.160
 one of those things.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160
 Yeah.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.400
 They just didn't bank on Lauren being able to get another one.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.400
 Yeah.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.400
 Didn't even bother to look it up.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.080
 Anyway, that's my outrage of the week.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.080
 Yeah.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.080
 Good.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.080
 Let's get on to Osmond.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.080
 Yeah.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080
 Let's get on to Osmond.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080
 I mean, he doesn't do any modesty.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.080
 Do you reckon it's because of this?

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.080
 Yeah.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.080
 When they made this game, he probably saw that question and thought, "This is an outrage."

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.080
 That's it for me.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.080
 Yeah.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:47.280
 shocking. Jennifer Sokolov writes, "One of you mentioned that in 1935, a rabbi was

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.160
 privy to the secret ingredient of Coca-Cola for the purpose of making it kosher. I have a rabbi

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:59.160
 friend who works at the orthodox union, which is what they give Coca-Cola the kosher, Coca-Cosher.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:05.200
 Could we say that again? No. Kosher Cola? No, we didn't say either of those. Do you know what?

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:13.960
 We did the first time. That's a little inside. We lost that episode and we had to do the whole

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.840
 thing again. John Lloyd actually made that gag in the first one, but no one made it in the

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:25.360
 second one. There we go. Anyway, Jennifer writes, "My friend told me once how Coca-certified

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.160
 now so they don't have to reveal the secret ingredient to the certifying rabbi, which

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.200
 I thought you might find interesting. This is so interesting. What they do is they put

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.400
 a lot of ingredients in a room and the certifying rabbi checks every ingredient to make sure

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.040
 it is kosher and can be included in the final product. But they put extra ingredients in

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.360
 the room that aren't actually part of the Coke formula. That's so good. That's really clever.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:54.400
 I would love to taste what that Coca-Cola is if all of those things. Just out of curiosity.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.840
 But you can put in some bananas stuff, which is bananas. I'm guessing bananas are kosher.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:06.640
 There was actually, I said on that podcast, I think that we know you can basically work

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:13.200
 out the ingredients of Coca-Cola. But actually, I think literally this week there was a YouTube

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:19.280
 clip of some YouTuber had done probably the best ever version of Coca-Cola, where they'd

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.520
 worked it out and this is completely indistinguishable. Amazing. Can you tell the difference in that

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:32.520
 and Diet Coke? Well, yeah. Because I don't like to boast, but that's a little skill. That

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:38.920
 is a callback and a half, isn't it? That's another of my, would I like to you, fun, crazy

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.960
 stories about me? Samantha Jo. A lot of two named people we've had

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.840
 writing in today. So Jim Dennis, Dennis Jim and Dan James. And there have been several

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:55.360
 more. Right. Anyway, rights. There was a thing about breach babies. You said about breach

00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.520
 baby being massaged? Yeah. We had someone write in telling us about the massaging that can

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.480
 happen, yeah, with a breach baby. Yes. That was the same person, though, who claimed

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.780
 that they'd seen a big, giving another B or all sex. Yeah. Anyway, Samantha Jo hasn't

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:14.560
 add on to the breach baby bit, which is that your organs can be moved into place via massage.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:20.040
 Okay. A family member had their gall bladder removed several years ago through laparoscopic

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.720
 surgery, keyholes, isn't it? This family member also went to see a massage therapist regularly

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.360
 at the time. On one visit after surgery, the massage therapist could feel that my family

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.680
 members' organs were not with, they should be because the surgery requires extra room to

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:42.360
 be made. So the organs had slipped out of place. Luckily, the therapist was able to massage

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:49.240
 their organs back to their proper positions. I mean, this is what the masseur told them,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.920
 right? Yep. That's wild. But apparently your organs are not stitched into place. But

00:31:53.920 --> 00:32:01.280
 so could could arguably a masseuse completely rearrange you? Yeah, of course. I don't think

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:09.120
 that's possible. And have you checked this? I feel like most of your organs are generally

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:15.880
 speaking held in place. Yeah. That's a good shout. All right. Samantha, we'll need internal

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:21.400
 photos. I'm afraid. But I know I don't have Google in front of me. So maybe it's true.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:27.440
 I think it's quite nice thing about this format is we're largely flying completely blind.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:33.280
 You know, we're flying on own. We're off instruments. Yeah. We're only using horizons.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.640
 I'm going to change your wife's. Is this absolutely she does. And the one thing that you

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:42.360
 should never do is ignore your instruments. Oh, dear. Even if what you're looking at

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.920
 doesn't look right, always trust your instruments. Okay. Well, let's see if you believe the email

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:52.400
 I've had from Tom Brockington, because we're on, you know, just loving your new podcast,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:59.400
 Tom says, it's to be going for 11 years. How long is it taking you to get through these

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:12.320
 emails, Addy? Horrible. That person who let themselves be stung all over by bees. Oh, yeah.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.160
 Michael Smith. Is that so? Schmidt. Schmidt. There's a couple of them, I think. However, they

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:24.160
 missed the area. I got stung by a beyond. Oh, can we guess when was the big giving him

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:29.600
 all those little sex at the time? You can have a guess, but I'll be surprised if you get

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:36.280
 it, but please. Well, my first thought is this a seat. Is it right up there? Oh, it's

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:44.400
 not below the belt. It's not below the belt. As tonsils. Oh, that would be so sore. Yeah,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.600
 exactly. Right. That's going to be somewhere not quite accessible. It's on the head. It's

00:33:48.600 --> 00:34:00.520
 on the head. Okay. Well, after I had a massage, my gallblad is on my head now. Yeah, about 10

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:06.920
 years ago, I was walking through the park and a bee stung me on the ear drum. The pain was

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:12.000
 absolutely blinding and the ear drum ruptured, so I was also impaired with balance and movement.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.640
 I did ask him how did the bee get in there? And he says, I do not know. Wow. The pain was

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.400
 indescribable. I could hardly even see the pain was everywhere. I ended up having a new

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.680
 ear drum part grown from taking skin from the side of my head. So I also had five years of

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:31.080
 incredible ear infections and pain. Oh, my blessed. I know. But luckily, I'm fine now and

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.100
 can still scuba dive. Oh, that's good. That's an important thing. However, there is a little

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.600
 hole left in the drum. So when I equalize the pressure while diving, bubbles come out of

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:47.940
 my ear. People who are like, when you do that, like ruptured your ear drum, this is obviously

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:53.040
 a datesit, but people used to like, they would smoke pipes and then blow smoke out. Really?

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.920
 Wow. James, I'm so glad you said that Tom finishes. I have tried to blow smoke out of the

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:04.760
 hole, but it has not been observed working. That is a pain. Like the description of that

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:10.200
 pain is unlike anything. Yeah, I feel like I've heard before. That's bad. That's bad.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:16.560
 Okay. We'll do a couple more. Yeah. All right. Morris E. Corner. Ah, lovely. Alexander

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:24.000
 Andrews writes, I can confirm that not only with the audience frisked for meat, but venue

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.240
 staff were also searched. Wow. I worked in a college with someone who moonlighted at

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:33.320
 a venue he played and they were forewarned that they would be searched. However, I was

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.000
 also moonlighting as a chef. I happened to be working that weekend at the hotel he was

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.440
 staying at. We provided a full buffet breakfast, including a whole side of smoked salmon and

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:49.640
 me cooking every man out of pork product under the sun. The smell didn't seem to bother

00:35:49.640 --> 00:36:03.280
 him. Oh, more spicy celebrity meat. The spicy celebrity corn. Yeah, it's really exciting.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:10.280
 Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah. Well, Thomas Patanoster Howe has more stuff. What a middle

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:17.320
 name. Oh, it's double-barrelled. Tom Patanoster Howe. Wow. Yeah. Hello, Andy or your minion.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:24.080
 I dream. Tom of having a minion. On the subject of very veggie pop stars, Paul McCartney refuses

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.080
 to even sit on a leather chair. My sister used to manage a club that he came to and she

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.920
 had to get him a non-lether chair to sit on. Yeah, he's very. But apparently he wasn't

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:39.440
 being prissy about it. He was willing to stand, but he said no, we'll get you a chair.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:44.280
 Okay. Well, I don't think we have a problem with people's beliefs in that respect.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.680
 Yeah, exactly. Like Lisa Simpson is a veggie because of him, right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.520
 Like he's done a lot for promotion of that. Completely and I fully respect it. Willow writes.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.960
 Okay. This is important. For a long time, fish has been telling the world digital rectal

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.280
 massage. It's the only scientifically proven method for stopping hiccups. Absolutely. Yeah.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:09.800
 So the other day, when my spouse started hiccupsing, the path seemed clear. I hope it was

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:16.320
 a birthday. It was just another day in a typical nerdy lesbian house in Wellington as we prepared

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.200
 our supplies. Uh-huh. The insertion was textbook and the massage went well, but the hiccups

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.640
 did not cease. With my spouse still hiccuping, I went straight to the medical journals. It turns

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:32.160
 out that often the cases that it works on are considered the intractable hiccups rather

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.920
 than the pedestrian form that we all get. I was dismayed at the lack of research there

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:42.000
 is on this. And then I had my dear, the fish audience are a nerdy lot. And my guess is many

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.360
 of them are down for some digital rectal massage in the name of science. I'd like to propose

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.840
 a new segment, fish medical to be kicked off by asking the fans to give DRM a go for hiccups.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:58.960
 No. No. I'm sorry. We will not be held responsible for any medical procedures that we mentioned

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.600
 on this show that I've then done by our listeners. I think that's really sensible, James. I think

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:11.000
 that was really, I had to even consider the legal bit. We look great. We're thinking that

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:21.120
 this person's partner didn't cure their hiccups. That's right. But perhaps they just liked

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.640
 the DRM. True. And then fake some hiccups afterwards and said we're going to have to try

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.400
 that again. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yes. That's a good point. It's a good way of doing that. Darling,

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:40.040
 I feel some hiccups coming on just a new netflix and chill, euphemism. I mean, the hiccups.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:52.760
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. That's it from this episode. What? You normally get a bit further

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:58.920
 in than that. That's it for this episode of Drop us a line. Thank you so much for listening,

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.320
 for watching and for all your fantastic emails. Keep them flooding in. They're brilliant,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:11.800
 podcast@ky.com. But for now, bye. But for now, bye.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:25.360
 Better? Warmer? But for now, bye, bye. It's goodbye from these guys. Bye. When can

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:33.000
 you buy from me? Bye everybody. See you next time. Here on Drop us a line. It's always

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.280
 good to have 16 possible endings.
