1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
 (telephone rings)

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,500
 (fun music)

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,940
 - Hi!

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,480
 - Hey Andy.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,720
 - Hi everybody, welcome to Drop us a Line.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,600
 Thank you for listening, thank you for watching.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,960
 We hope you've had a lovely break.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,080
 We're back, we're raring to go.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
 We're full of beans.

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,160
 How's the inbox?

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,000
 Bulging.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,960
 (clears throat)

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
 It's stunning.

15
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,480
 I've actually got a hefty bit of paper pile in front of me.

16
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,100
 Any inbox-related New Year's resolutions?

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,920
 - Ooh, for me.

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,760
 - Yeah.

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
 - I think just, I'm gonna keep reading everything

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,400
 and that's my, I'm just trying to stay on top of it.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,560
 - Yeah, okay, great.

22
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
 - Yeah, I'm gonna stay on top of it.

23
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,760
 It's my resolution.

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,600
 - Okay.

25
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
 - I'm not gonna let it get like it did last year.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,880
 - It was an absolute shambles last year.

27
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,240
 - It really was, it really was.

28
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,400
 You have to just sort of pretend

29
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,320
 you've lost those 10,000 emails, no, I don't know.

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,160
 - Yeah, right.

31
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,400
 - I do read them, and they're all brilliant.

32
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,920
 You've been emailing in podcast@ky.com

33
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,840
 and we've got a lot to get through, guys.

34
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,680
 - Okay.

35
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,520
 - Let's do it, let's go.

36
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,160
 - Well, let's start with the business lounge.

37
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 - Oh, this is new.

38
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
 - This is new.

39
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,660
 (laughs)

40
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,500
 - What is the business lounge?

41
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,280
 - Well, it's where people pitch us ideas.

42
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,000
 - Oh, business lounge, as in, this is a business idea.

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
 - Yeah.

44
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,680
 - Oh, I see.

45
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
 - I can't trust it.

46
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,520
 - Okay, well.

47
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,920
 - This is a dragonfish dead.

48
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,880
 - We're fish tank, fish tank.

49
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
 - Yeah.

50
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,960
 - James writes,

51
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,360
 "While playing hungry, hungry hippos over Christmas,

52
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,480
 "my entrepreneurial mind invented a sure fire.

53
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,720
 "No such thing as a fish money spinner."

54
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,560
 - Yeah.

55
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,400
 - Okay.

56
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,000
 "Swap out the hippos with faithful recreations

57
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,720
 "of President James Garfield's buttocks.

58
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,200
 "Hey presto, a fun and educational game for all the family.

59
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,840
 "I'm looking for 450,000 pounds."

60
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,080
 - Okay, in return for a 30% stake.

61
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,920
 - Here's the issue.

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
 I feel that what he ate through his anus

63
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,080
 was largely soup based, which is--

64
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,200
 - Yeah, eggs though.

65
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
 - Sorry.

66
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,880
 - Eggs.

67
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,720
 - He had eggs?

68
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,400
 - Yeah.

69
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
 - Fried or--

70
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
 - I think they were probably chopped up.

71
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,560
 - Not just whole, it wasn't like a reverse chicken.

72
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,280
 - It wasn't like a boiled.

73
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,640
 - It's the reverse chicken.

74
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,480
 - No.

75
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,440
 - Okay.

76
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,560
 - I believe they stopped giving him eggs

77
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,160
 because it was causing annoying smells.

78
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,000
 - Yes.

79
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,160
 - So eggs could work.

80
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000
 - Eggs could work.

81
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720
 - I've got a question for James.

82
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,600
 And that is, how do you differentiate

83
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,320
 President Garfield's buttocks from any other buttocks

84
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
 around the world?

85
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,360
 How do we know that they're Garfieldian?

86
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,640
 - I think you'll have to have a little mold of his face,

87
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,040
 his upper half at the other end.

88
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,880
 - I see.

89
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
 - Of the hippo.

90
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,960
 I guess you pressed down on his,

91
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,040
 on the top of his head actually,

92
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,160
 to make the buttocks leap out and grab some food.

93
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,760
 Visually, that could work great.

94
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,600
 - I think so.

95
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,440
 - Yeah.

96
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,840
 - Anyway, I have been into your bank accounts.

97
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,920
 I'm siphoned off 150,000 of each of you.

98
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,120
 I don't even know 149,000 pounds in the red.

99
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
 Sorry.

100
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 - What's it called?

101
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960
 Because that might not be a problem.

102
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,400
 I might be happy about that.

103
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,960
 - There's not much you can do with hungry, hungry hippos.

104
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
 - No.

105
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,600
 This ass eats.

106
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,760
 - This, well, kids, kids, time.

107
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,240
 Where's grandma?

108
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,600
 We're playing this ass eats.

109
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,000
 - Quick.

110
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,760
 - Yeah.

111
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,600
 - Yeah.

112
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,800
 - And you can stop me watching that.

113
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,160
 I hope those of you have been waiting for me

114
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,080
 to cry at the sound of the sound.

115
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,680
 - email one minute three, brilliant.

116
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,840
 - Oh, so thanks James.

117
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,520
 That's a great idea and the check is in the post.

118
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,520
 All right, I've got some serious legal news.

119
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,680
 - Oh, we had a business lounge.

120
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
 - Yes, we are.

121
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
 We're into plagiarism corner.

122
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,560
 - Oh, yeah.

123
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
 - Oh, wow.

124
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
 - Yeah.

125
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,880
 So Declan Costello writes,

126
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,080
 "I am a very recent new listener to the podcast.

127
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,840
 I'm very much enjoying working my way

128
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,000
 through the back catalog."

129
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 Nice, perfect.

130
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,880
 Listening to your theme music,

131
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,200
 I was struck by the resemblance to the opening bars

132
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,800
 of Kate Bush's "Wuthering Heights."

133
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,280
 - Hmm.

134
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,200
 - I surely cannot be the only person

135
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
 to have commented on this.

136
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,360
 Declan, you are.

137
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,920
 You're the first person in nearly 12 years.

138
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,400
 - Please suggest to me that they're not similar.

139
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,720
 - Well, do you want to hear it?

140
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,560
 - Yeah.

141
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,360
 - Sure, well, I think you and I know.

142
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
 - Right.

143
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,160
 - I feel like I know "Wuthering Heights" as well, but.

144
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,480
 - I thought I knew it too.

145
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,840
 This is quite striking, I'm going to say.

146
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,800
 Have a listen to this.

147
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,640
 - So.

148
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,840
 - It'll be an exciting, exciting 2026 for Fish

149
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,920
 and we will see you then.

150
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,560
 - That sounds nothing like Kate Bush.

151
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,400
 Wait, okay.

152
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,080
 That bit?

153
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,920
 Yeah.

154
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,280
 Okay, wait for it.

155
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,880
 (soft music)

156
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,880
 (singing)

157
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,880
 (singing)

158
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,880
 (singing)

159
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
 - Yeah? - Not bad, yeah.

160
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,520
 - I can see a slight resemblance, but not enough

161
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,680
 for it to be legally challengeable.

162
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,680
 - I can see why Bush's lawyers had to step down

163
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,280
 when presenting their case, yeah.

164
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,720
 - I think that's right, James.

165
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,200
 I think legally there's not remotely similar enough

166
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,280
 for that to be any chance of a successful action.

167
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,160
 - Well, do you remember when Robin Thickey got

168
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
 done for plagiarism and it was all on the vibe?

169
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,760
 And I don't reckon that the vibe is the same there?

170
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,680
 - No, I think we're a bit more mystical in the material.

171
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,520
 - than Kate Bush.

172
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
 - Yeah, yeah.

173
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,720
 (laughing)

174
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
 - But anyway, so thank you, Declan, that's good

175
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
 to keep us on our toes.

176
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 - Yeah. - Cool.

177
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,720
 - That's great. - Let's see if you spotted something

178
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,400
 that might financially ruin us.

179
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
 The email address is podcasting.com.

180
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
 Thanks very much.

181
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,840
 - Well, we didn't write that feature.

182
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,680
 - Yeah.

183
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,520
 - No, no.

184
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
 - That was written by Ash Gardner.

185
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,360
 - That's true.

186
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,640
 - Some time of this parish.

187
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,080
 - Yeah. - Yes, yeah.

188
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,920
 - Yeah.

189
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,520
 - Hugo and Alan Betts as well, yeah.

190
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,360
 - Yeah.

191
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,200
 - Empre yes.

192
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,360
 - Yes. - If you want to go on Spotify.

193
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 - Yeah, it's on Spotify.

194
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,240
 - Yeah. - It's a great album.

195
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
 - Yeah.

196
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,160
 - And Kate Bush is also available.

197
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,120
 (laughing)

198
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
 - Good.

199
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,400
 Ellie Pearson writes in about a recent episode

200
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,640
 we did with Lou Sanders.

201
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,480
 - Yeah. - Oh.

202
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,160
 - This is a telling off for me.

203
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
 Hi Andy, I feel like a lot of people

204
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,920
 might write in about this.

205
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,520
 I'm afraid you're the first, Ellie.

206
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,840
 So I apologize if that's the case.

207
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,920
 I wasn't gonna mention it when you only said it once,

208
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,040
 but then you said it five times and I couldn't let it go.

209
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,520
 Okay, the pronunciation of Wyoming

210
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,640
 has the inflection on the second syllable, not the first.

211
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,760
 So it's Wyoming.

212
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,200
 - No, it's not Wyoming. - It's Wyoming.

213
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,080
 - Oh, I've done it six, six times.

214
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,360
 It's Wyoming.

215
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
 - And you said Wyoming. - Wyoming.

216
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,760
 Five times apparently. - Okay.

217
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,040
 - Wyoming.

218
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,560
 - Yeah, Wyoming. - Wyoming, that's fair enough.

219
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,480
 - I know it's a slight difference,

220
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,880
 but I figure if the Australians are allowed

221
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,080
 to correct pronunciation, so are the Americans.

222
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,920
 Fair enough?

223
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,320
 - One thing I've noticed very early in this year

224
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,440
 is how many times people are apologizing to you

225
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,040
 for writing in almost as if you've been saying

226
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,520
 quite often on the podcast.

227
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,080
 We get too many emails, guys.

228
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,600
 You know what, James, this brings me,

229
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,120
 you've actually precipitated,

230
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,800
 I need to get ahead because we had an email from,

231
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
 I think it was called Park.

232
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 Yeah, Park.

233
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,240
 I hate when you all say don't write in.

234
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,160
 It makes me feel bad,

235
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
 even if I wasn't planning on writing in.

236
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,240
 (laughing)

237
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
 Like me saying don't write in is prompted him to write in,

238
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,560
 so it hasn't worked.

239
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
 So I'm really sorry, always write in.

240
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
 Always write in, I do be genuinely loved.

241
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
 - We love these. - Oh, we do, we do, we do.

242
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,640
 - And if you don't want to write in,

243
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,200
 then do write in and tell us.

244
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,240
 - Podcasts of UI.com.

245
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,160
 - Whether or not you want to write in, please write in.

246
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
 - Right, thanks but no thanks.

247
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
 - Okay, oh.

248
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,480
 - No, thanks but no thanks.

249
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
 - Yeah, okay.

250
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,880
 Dan's unexpected anecdotes are always a real treat.

251
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,960
 It never ceases to amaze me.

252
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,880
 How frequently Dan is able to perfectly segue

253
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,440
 into some personal experience

254
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,320
 based on something other hosts have said.

255
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,840
 From my family was featured in a friend's parking

256
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
 in fraction photo and the tip off was a pumpkin suit.

257
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,880
 - To, I was featured in a Hong Kong Karate magazine

258
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,200
 for spitting on an opponent.

259
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,640
 (laughing)

260
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,240
 - There are hours of ready-made material

261
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,600
 just begging to be collected and released as a special.

262
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,760
 - Well, I think, you know, one day Bob Mortimer has to retire,

263
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
 right?

264
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,840
 And would I like you are gonna need someone

265
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,440
 with ridiculous stories to come on the show?

266
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,800
 - Yeah, I think you're right.

267
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,440
 Yeah, the problem is, is they're all true.

268
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,520
 So I would just, I would be caught out every single time.

269
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,640
 - You get to make, what, no.

270
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,000
 - I don't know if I can make up one.

271
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,920
 I don't know if I can fabricate a life story.

272
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
 - Yeah, in the moment.

273
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,360
 - Try me.

274
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,720
 - I'll try one during this episode.

275
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,560
 See if it's on it.

276
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,880
 - Okay, great, exciting, okay.

277
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,640
 (laughing)

278
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,160
 Now interestingly, Jim Dennis.

279
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,640
 - My uncle's called Jim Dennis.

280
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,360
 - Right, that's a lie.

281
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
 - Correct.

282
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
 (laughing)

283
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,440
 - God, you're good.

284
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,280
 - He's good.

285
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,120
 - You're both good.

286
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,240
 - Well, I'm not going on if he's going on.

287
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
 (laughing)

288
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,880
 - No, but you know, Jim, James, Dan, Dennis.

289
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
 - You know, you can sometimes get Nick Mender, I do.

290
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,160
 - Just a bit weird, isn't it?

291
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,760
 - I'm just thinking that Lee Mack has to retire eventually.

292
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
 - Right.

293
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,840
 - They need some sort of Northern Chipper Lad.

294
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,480
 - Yes. - Come on.

295
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
 - That's very good.

296
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,920
 - So we could be the future of what I like to you.

297
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,960
 - We could be.

298
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,920
 - David Mitchell.

299
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,480
 - It's not going anywhere.

300
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
 - Oh no.

301
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,520
 (laughing)

302
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
 - Dan, James, and David Mitchell

303
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,560
 present their new project.

304
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,400
 - That sounds good.

305
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
 - Right.

306
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,080
 - That sounds good.

307
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,920
 (laughing)

308
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,720
 - I was just thinking, you know what the special guest

309
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
 comes on.

310
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,400
 - Oh yeah.

311
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,320
 - How do you know this man?

312
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,440
 Well, he actually lost all of his money

313
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,560
 to a game attribute to hungry hippos.

314
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,240
 (laughing)

315
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 - Cool.

316
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,560
 This ass eats.

317
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,160
 (laughing)

318
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,040
 - Yeah.

319
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,880
 Okay.

320
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
 (laughing)

321
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,320
 - Well Jim Dennis says, in a recent episode at Christmas,

322
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,520
 you mentioned James and Dan have lived really interesting

323
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,680
 lives before no such thing as a fish.

324
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,160
 Weirdly no mention of me.

325
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,680
 (laughing)

326
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,760
 - My suggestion.

327
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,480
 Can I say, "Scree you, Jim."

328
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
 (laughing)

329
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,800
 - My suggestion will be his Andy and he's a friend of mine

330
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,160
 who has no anecdotes.

331
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,840
 (laughing)

332
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,640
 - Rob Brighton's got to retire eventually.

333
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,400
 (laughing)

334
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,240
 - My suggestion will be an episode of no such thing

335
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,560
 as a fish which focuses upon

336
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,280
 either James or Dan.

337
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,600
 (laughing)

338
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
 - Yeah.

339
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
 - What am I?

340
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,120
 - What am I?

341
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,880
 - We could do you one week and me the next year.

342
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,720
 - Yeah.

343
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,560
 - Yeah, that's great.

344
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,920
 - We the listeners can find out more about you guys,

345
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,320
 but also draw upon interesting facts from your past.

346
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,240
 Facts built around an interesting life well lived.

347
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
 Well Andy, I presume it just continues reading the emails.

348
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,200
 (laughing)

349
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,440
 - Can't believe I put that in thanks, but no thanks.

350
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
 - Right, say thanks.

351
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,160
 - Good Lord.

353
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,400
 - I can't believe you're getting bullied on email

354
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,680
 from our fans.

355
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,120
 - It's quite something, isn't it?

356
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,360
 But not even bullied actively, bullied by a mission.

357
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,200
 - Yeah.

358
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,840
 - By Jim knew why he was doing that.

359
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,680
 - Yeah, he was doing.

360
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,520
 - He knew what he was doing.

361
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,360
 - Yeah.

362
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
 - All right.

363
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,200
 Well, here's one from Sully.

364
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,440
 Hello, any chance you could post a video

365
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,600
 of James Harkin doing his Donald Duck impression

366
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,640
 on Instagram.

367
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,720
 I'd love to see what he looks like when he's doing it.

368
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,200
 He's so funny.

369
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,960
 - Okay, well, thanks.

370
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,720
 PS Dance Terrific, too.

371
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,520
 (laughing)

372
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,560
 - Well, we're filming this, so I can quickly do it.

373
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,400
 - We're filming this.

374
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,560
 - I can quickly do it.

375
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,400
 - Yeah.

376
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,520
 - Good luck.

377
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,200
 - Goofy's got to retire eventually.

378
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,480
 (laughing)

379
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
 - Cool.

380
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,160
 - Guy.

381
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,000
 - Wow.

382
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,840
 - Yeah, pretty good.

383
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,680
 - So, I'm pretty good.

384
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,880
 - I don't know what I look like in any case, actually,

385
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,560
 'cause I have face blackness, but it's true.

386
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
 Like, I don't know what I look like there.

387
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,440
 I assume I just have a slightly open mouth on one side.

388
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,280
 - Yeah.

389
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,120
 - Yeah.

390
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,960
 - No, it was good.

391
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,480
 That's a very good impression.

392
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,080
 So, thank you, Sully.

393
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,000
 We now come to get yourself off the hook.

394
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,840
 Okay.

395
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,200
 And then we're gonna segue into this week's rodeo clown,

396
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,920
 which is a different kind of get yourself off the hook.

397
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,760
 - Yes.

398
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
 - Unfortunately.

399
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,480
 Ian Flower says there's one for me.

400
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,880
 I'm so sorry, I imagine you're getting this a lot all week.

401
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,720
 It seems as though the clock faces on the Elizabeth Tower.

402
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,200
 Do show X's.

403
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,040
 - Interesting.

404
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
 - They're just in the Fractour font,

405
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,360
 which makes them look quite a lot like F's.

406
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,640
 - Yes, so, this is, I think they're right.

407
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,520
 I forgot the name, sorry.

408
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,840
 - Ian, is that Ian?

409
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,720
 - Yeah, I think Ian is right about that.

410
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
 But one interesting thing is,

411
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,880
 if you go onto the website of the House of Parliament,

412
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,720
 they specifically say that they're not X's, they're F's.

413
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,920
 But when you look at it,

414
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,960
 they're very obviously stylized X's

415
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,320
 that Pugin just decided he wanted to do that.

416
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,840
 - Yeah, look, 'cause I spent quite a long time looking at that.

417
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,160
 Basically, what we said was, in case anyone missed this,

418
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
 Lord Borwick wrote in and said that the X's

419
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,080
 on the face of the Big Bang clock are in fact F's.

420
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,560
 And there are some very weird Gothic fonts

421
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,320
 where the X looks quite a bit like it.

422
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,480
 But it's really tall with a sticky outfit at the time.

423
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,360
 - Yeah, we looked at the pictures at the time.

424
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,440
 - Yeah, it does look like it.

425
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,720
 - Well, after we got that email from Lord Borwick,

426
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
 I thought I wondered if we could run it on QI

427
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,440
 'cause we're currently researching the X series on QI.

428
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
 And we did some more work on it.

429
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,960
 And I think we're not gonna run it for that reason

430
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,760
 because we think they are stylized X.

431
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,600
 - 'Cause it's not true.

432
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,080
 - Yeah, just fair enough.

433
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,360
 Well, but you must have loads of material for the X series.

434
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,240
 - Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

435
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
 - Yeah.

436
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
 - And thank you also to Salman,

437
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,880
 long time listener from Riyad,

438
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,560
 who wrote in saying the same thing.

439
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,200
 And he claimed that a Lord wrote in

440
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,760
 to tell him there are no X's.

441
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
 He's a real Lord, what does he want to say?

442
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,520
 The Lord is real.

443
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,360
 - You were getting a kicking in this episode.

444
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,200
 - For me?

445
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,040
 - At your own hand as well,

446
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,600
 'cause you select these emails to bring.

447
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,720
 - Well, don't worry, Dan.

448
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,800
 Your time will come.

449
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,640
 - Will it?

450
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,560
 - Uh, not sure.

451
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
 Can't remember.

452
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,440
 - Oh, here's another thing.

453
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,760
 - Here's the last threat ever.

454
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,000
 (laughing)

455
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,600
 - This is why I failed my audition to play Fanos.

456
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,560
 - And then that's Bonville and your time will come.

457
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,400
 - Maybe.

458
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,720
 - Anyway, I'm just gonna throw myself

459
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,600
 into the shark tank now.

460
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,840
 - Speaking of shark tank, Mr. Bond.

461
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
 Have I told you my idea?

462
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,600
 (laughing)

463
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,320
 - So do you know the phrase this eats ass

464
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,000
 means something bad, okay.

465
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,840
 What if?

466
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,680
 Okay.

467
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,600
 Right, Dawn Heatherington

468
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,640
 raced with something else that I got wrong.

469
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,120
 (laughing)

470
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,640
 I don't want to be dishonest.

471
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,600
 I can't let a fact go wrong on the show.

472
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,440
 - Absolutely.

473
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,280
 - You know.

474
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,120
 - No way.

475
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,920
 - Yeah, he's gonna have integrity.

476
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
 - Dawn Heatherington writes,

477
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,520
 "My ears pricked up when listening to this week's podcast

478
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,600
 "as I felt sure I had listened to an interview

479
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,960
 "with the British author of the Jack Reacher books

480
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,000
 "saying he no longer wished to live in America

481
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,240
 "and he was returning to Britain."

482
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,960
 So, I said he lives in Wyoming.

483
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,800
 - Off the grid.

484
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,640
 - So off-grid.

485
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,480
 - End of a long drive.

486
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,920
 - 10 miles from his own postbox.

487
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,760
 - Yes.

488
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,240
 - And 45 miles from the nearest grocery store.

489
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,360
 Well, apparently he's moved back to the lake district.

490
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,200
 - Okay.

491
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,040
 - Oh, lovely.

492
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,880
 - That's right, yeah.

493
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,000
 - So he's back in the lake district.

494
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And I looked up and he's done it.

495
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,160
 He has been interviewed and said,

496
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,640
 "Yes, I've moved back."

497
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,480
 So.

498
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,520
 - Having lived in the lake district,

499
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
 I can say that you can often be a long way

500
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
 from your nearest shop as well.

501
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,240
 - Absolutely.

502
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,400
 - So he hasn't moved to the hustle bustle.

503
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,240
 - No.

504
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
 - Well, those trains from Windermere are pretty unreliable,

505
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,000
 aren't they?

506
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,840
 - Yeah.

507
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,520
 - Good stuff.

508
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,920
 - Once an hour to Watson Home.

509
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,320
 (laughing)

510
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,240
 - I'll, you used to live properly there, didn't you?

511
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

512
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

513
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,560
 And that brings us to the rodeo clown.

514
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,400
 - Okay.

515
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,240
 - Ooh.

516
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,080
 - Here we go.

517
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,800
 - Now you'll see why I did so much preparatory

518
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
 dunking on myself.

519
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,640
 - Oh shit.

520
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 - Because I'm about to read out about 1,500 words

521
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,280
 which backs me up on something I said.

522
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
 - Oh, here we go.

523
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,120
 - Oh, here we go.

524
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,960
 - Here we go.

525
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,800
 - Okay, sorry, right.

526
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,640
 - Don't you worry.

527
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
 Right, Shane Doran says,

528
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,720
 "Your novels aren't that bad after all."

529
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,920
 (laughing)

530
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,160
 Shane Doran says,

531
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,200
 "Regarding the point made by Andy about the train

532
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
 "that requires zero energy to run,

533
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,200
 "I would like to point out it is possible for this to work

534
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,560
 "without requiring either magical

535
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,680
 "any kind of perpetual motion device."

536
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,440
 So this was, there's a train in Australia

537
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,880
 which gets loaded up with iron ore at the top of the hill,

538
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,720
 goes downhill, breaks on the way

539
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,320
 to reach out its battery 'cause it's an electric train,

540
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,880
 and then empties out the iron ore

541
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,920
 and has enough extra juice from the braking

542
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,080
 to get itself to the top of the hill.

543
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
 - Yeah, and I think what the problem,

544
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,240
 'cause Alice was saying that it might not be possible,

545
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,760
 and I think I sort of said that as well,

546
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,960
 but I think we didn't really take into account

547
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,760
 the potential energy that you're adding

548
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,440
 when you put the loads on,

549
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,080
 which obviously you need to use energy

550
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,800
 to put the loads on as well, right?

551
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,480
 - The work is basically,

552
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,120
 well, I'll read Shane's email basically.

553
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
 If the train is loaded at the top of the hill,

554
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,280
 the load has a large amount of potential energy

555
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,000
 that can be used to charge the battery.

556
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,840
 If the train goes back up the hill empty,

557
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,720
 then there is less potential energy required

558
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,840
 to drive it up the hill

559
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,440
 than was available to drive it down.

560
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
 This is just a slightly more convoluted version

561
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,760
 of a water wheel.

562
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,520
 So the rocks are descending in a controlled manner

563
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
 and charging the battery.

564
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,740
 I think Professor Alice owes Andy an apology.

565
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,080
 (laughing)

566
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,920
 - I think.

567
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,760
 - Let's call her up.

568
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,280
 - Yes, there we go.

569
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,760
 - Now I think we, yeah, it was just the,

570
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,120
 obviously you need energy to load it up.

571
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,840
 - Yes, the work is being done at the top of the hill.

572
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,400
 Like that is effectively another version

573
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,240
 of a battery being charged

574
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,520
 is filling a train up with these rocks,

575
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,680
 which then, you know, once that mountain is empty,

576
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,440
 then you won't be able to run an infinity train anymore.

577
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,320
 Anyway, I wanna thank David Hopkins.

578
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,720
 I thought you were not treated very well

579
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
 when talking about the infinite train.

580
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,600
 Nash Rochman.

581
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,240
 James indicated this would constitute

582
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,120
 a perpetual motion machine, but it would not.

583
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,560
 Andy even summarized the mechanism

584
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,800
 but was unfairly silenced.

585
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,480
 Eric Samuel.

586
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
 - Let's go, I'm not gonna go on.

587
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,000
 - Please.

588
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,160
 - We've had dozens of emails about it.

589
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
 - When you're making up these names,

590
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,760
 do you take two separate names

591
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,920
 and bash them together to make a full one?

592
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,760
 - Oh, let's see.

593
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,920
 - Yeah, lie.

594
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,400
 (laughing)

595
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,800
 - No, thank you to everyone.

596
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,480
 I'm really touched by your support, you wrote in.

597
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,560
 - It works, the infinite train works.

598
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,160
 I thought you said the mountain runs out though.

599
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,560
 - Yeah, like in a hundred years

600
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,360
 when they've emptied out this entire mine,

601
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,120
 what is infinite to you?

602
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,960
 - Oh my gosh.

603
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,600
 (laughing)

604
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,120
 - Stop.

605
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,520
 Anyway, no, thank you everyone for writing

606
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,360
 and about the infinite train, the theory works.

607
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,280
 And the train is going, anyway, whatever.

608
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,360
 I'm cool about it.

609
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,760
 Right, now we move on to a really fun section,

610
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,160
 a new section that I think we're lobbying for names for.

611
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,080
 It's personal experiences that people have had

612
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,600
 based on things we've talked about.

613
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,440
 - Oh, okay.

614
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,880
 And I can't think of a fishy pun for it.

615
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,360
 - Right, Alexander Dudley writes,

616
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,480
 "My wife, Jane and I just listened to the episode,

617
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,160
 "little fish, this could tail off really quickly

618
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,800
 "and we're heartened to hear our story mentioned."

619
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,400
 "For I am the husband

620
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,320
 "that cured my wife, Jane's treatment resistant

621
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,360
 "by polar disorder with poo transplants."

622
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,560
 - Come on.

623
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,400
 - 2017.

624
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,240
 - Okay.

625
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,080
 - No way.

626
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,120
 - This is, I'm Starstruck.

627
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,080
 My wife has now been without bipolar symptoms

628
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,560
 and off all medications for eight years, not one year.

629
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,000
 Can't remember if we said that.

630
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,400
 And we know of 18 other people who have resolved

631
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,560
 their bipolar disorder

632
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,680
 through this somewhat unconventional treatment.

633
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,920
 - Can you give us,

634
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,840
 can you just remind us the basics of the story?

635
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,760
 - Yeah, so this lady had this problem of bipolar disorder

636
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,920
 and they found out that by having a fecal transplant,

637
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,280
 they changed the biome presumably, I forgot, and...

638
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,120
 - How was that?

639
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,760
 - It was a hominage fecal transplant.

640
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,520
 It was administered at home the old fashioned way.

641
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,360
 - And then the bit that we did was imagining

642
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
 how you bring that up in a relationship.

643
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,520
 - Yes.

644
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
 - Yeah.

645
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,600
 - But I'm amazed that these people are actually listening.

646
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
 That's incredible.

647
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,640
 - And Alexander writes, "Prior to the treatment,

648
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,560
 "missing any of her three medications

649
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,720
 "for more than 48 hours,

650
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,440
 "mentally would be in a psych ward within a week."

651
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,080
 And then since the treatment, it's now fine.

652
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,760
 The treatment also began on my birthday,

653
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,200
 but that was purely coincidental.

654
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,040
 Suspicious.

655
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,720
 - That is stunning.

656
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,000
 - I know, because the post line of that was like,

657
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,680
 "Maybe we could try it on my birthday."

658
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,000
 - Yeah, exactly.

659
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 - That's amazing.

660
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,240
 - I know.

661
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,080
 - So there you go.

662
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,480
 So thank you, Alexander.

663
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,320
 - Oh, good.

664
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
 - And he includes a lot more details,

665
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,160
 but it was quite a long email

666
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,320
 so we don't have time to read the whole thing.

667
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,160
 But just stunning.

668
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,280
 It's a new field of research and it is exploding.

669
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,160
 He says, "Like the bowels of someone

670
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,000
 "with clistradiodes difficile,

671
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,240
 "which is presently the only disease

672
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,760
 "the treatment is officially approved for."

673
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,920
 Anyway.

674
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,760
 - Incredible.

675
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,600
 - That's great.

676
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,040
 - I'm really, like you say, star stroke, genuinely.

677
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,880
 Yeah. - Yeah.

678
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,720
 - Yeah.

679
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,560
 - Really cool.

680
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,400
 - Can I give you a similar one,

681
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,440
 someone who had an experience?

682
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,760
 - Yes. - So great.

683
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,160
 - So we said on a recent podcast

684
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,920
 that Kanye West, on his rider,

685
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,320
 said that they had to iron his carpets.

686
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,160
 - Oh, yeah.

687
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
 - Okay.

688
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,840
 - Do you remember that?

689
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,680
 - Yeah.

690
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,320
 - I was giving some strange riders

691
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,880
 and that was one of them.

692
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,480
 We had someone who I'm not allowed to name,

693
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,200
 but I can say that they worked on the Jewels Holland show.

694
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,880
 And when they were working on that show,

695
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,240
 Kanye had his carpets ironed

696
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,520
 and that's where the story came from.

697
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,360
 - Amazing.

698
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,320
 - Now, the reason was,

699
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,600
 is Kanye likes everything to be white

700
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,080
 in his dressing room.

701
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,120
 And the events team put a new white carpet on the floor.

702
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,760
 So that's normal.

703
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,840
 And then they steamed it because it needed to be clean.

704
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,440
 But then someone walked past and saw it being steamed

705
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,240
 and thought that he deliberately asked it to be ironed.

706
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
 When actually they were just cleaning it

707
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,080
 because you would clean it normally.

708
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,440
 And then that person walked past,

709
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,920
 sold the story to the sun.

710
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,560
 And then it became folklore that Kanye West

711
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,960
 always asked for his carpets to be ironed.

712
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,800
 - So how this happens?

713
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,000
 - When in fact, he just wants an all white dressing room

714
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,920
 like any normal artist.

715
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,680
 (laughing)

716
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,520
 - That's brilliant.

717
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,360
 - That's so good.

718
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,800
 - Is that your celeb ghost that you said you heard?

719
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,720
 - That is my spicy celebrity meat.

720
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,960
 - I've got a friend who got to go on Jewels Holland.

721
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,640
 I think it was last year or the year before.

722
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,040
 And he's in a band and so the band was on there.

723
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,160
 And it just so happens that Jewels Holland

724
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,520
 is also his landlord for the flat that he rents.

725
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,480
 So, sorry, that's really funny.

726
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,320
 - Yeah.

727
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,080
 And Jewels Holland apparently is really hands on

728
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,040
 as a landlord because there's a problem.

729
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,080
 If there's a problem, he really wants to sort it, right?

730
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,560
 He runs over, "Hell, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."

731
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,800
 "Dishonel is your lullaby."

732
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,160
 I will now fix the live-on.

733
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,600
 So he didn't know that my friend was going to be on the show.

734
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,400
 And so they play their song, and Jules does the ending.

735
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,320
 He's like, "Oh, goodnight, everyone." He turns around, and he sees my friend,

736
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,480
 and he's like, "Hey, it's me." And so you can see at the end,

737
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,080
 Jules is talking to him, and what Jules is saying is, "The boiler, I'm going to fix it."

738
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,440
 Someone coming in, I booked it in, he's doing house-maintored stuff in the credits.

739
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,040
 Okay, what are we going to say, Andy? I think lie.

740
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,440
 I think lie. I'm clearly followed.

741
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,400
 We're going to say lie.

742
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,240
 It was, in fact, true.

743
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,800
 In fact, it was true.

744
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,080
 Jules Holland was Dan's boiler buddy.

745
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,840
 Now, Andy, what have you got for us?

746
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:40,320
 I've got an anonymous poo expert who writes in an anonymous poo expert.

747
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,160
 Who asked for their name to be removed?

748
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,600
 Just to gently and very kindly, correct James Harkin, who said that, climbing Everest,

749
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,400
 he would leave his human waste a couple of hours before collecting them, so they would freeze.

750
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,480
 And I, at the moment, I have a dog that I walk every day, and I need to pick up his droppings.

751
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,960
 I'm in Canada, where it's been minus 25 Celsius for the fast few days, and let me tell you,

752
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,320
 turns freeze a lot faster than hours.

753
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,600
 Knowing the top of Mount Everest gets to minus 19 on a hot day, I can safely say that James

754
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
 would only have to wait a few minutes before being able to pick up his poop sickle.

755
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,280
 What was the name of this person, sorry?

756
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
 Anonymous poo expert.

757
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:25,160
 Anonymous poo expert, I could say, "You don't know my diets."

758
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,880
 Two Shay, two Shay.

759
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,760
 Cool science fact from Eric Stafford, who was a cardiac medical device representative.

760
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,400
 We mentioned Dr. Werner Forstman, who did the first ever heart catheteriser?

761
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
 Oh, yeah.

762
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,880
 Which you mentioned, I think, in that show.

763
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,080
 Yeah, and he's basically the first person to put a catheter into his own heart, as a

764
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
 sort of theory.

765
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
 It's all very exciting.

766
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,280
 Anyway, Eric adds just a fun little bonus fact.

767
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,680
 In my world of cardiac electrophysiology, we now use a technique called pulsed field

768
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,640
 ablation to treat heart arrhythmias, where the rhythm of your heart is slightly off.

769
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,400
 But lots of the pre-human testing was done on potatoes, because this technology is also

770
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,000
 used to make potato chips, and apparently there's this technique called electroporation,

771
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,880
 which uses high-voltage bursts to use water molecules to rip tiny holes in things normally

772
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 potatoes.

773
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
 Wow.

774
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,200
 But they will occasionally do it on the human heart.

775
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
 That's very cool.

776
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
 How interesting.

777
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,520
 There's a lovely fact there.

778
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,920
 This correspondents called Dan James.

779
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,520
 We had Jim Dennis earlier.

780
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,400
 Yeah, it's Brian Wales Footballer, Welsh Footballer, Dan James.

781
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,680
 He says, "Yes, just come off the back half of the line."

782
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
 What?

783
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
 Very good.

784
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:47,400
 Yeah, it's the back half line of traditional football saying, because I really know.

785
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,120
 I've just been having my orange at the half-time.

786
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
 Yeah?

787
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
 Yes.

788
00:25:52,120 --> 00:26:02,640
 Podcast@QI.com, and I will be apologising to each and every one of you.

789
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,600
 Dan James, right, thanks to you all.

790
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,080
 This is how my wife and I are seeing in 2026, and then send an image of the film, "Now you

791
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
 see me."

792
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
 Oh.

793
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
 Lovely.

794
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,160
 You've changed the year, but listening to "Now you see me."

795
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,800
 Did they say what they thought about it?

796
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
 Very enjoyable stuff, says Dan.

797
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 I mean, Dan James.

798
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,360
 It's perfect for "Now you see me" viewer, as we know.

799
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,560
 I've got to watch it.

800
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
 I've got to watch it.

801
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
 Haven't seen it yet.

802
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
 No, not yet.

803
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,880
 I'm saying I'm waiting for 2027.

804
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,400
 We've got an outrage of the week, but it's all in this personal experience thing.

805
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,160
 Oh, have you guys thought of a name for the personal experience?

806
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
 No.

807
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
 No.

808
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,720
 Yeah, it's like a personal experience.

809
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
 It's not good.

810
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,600
 It's not good if a perch is kind of fish.

811
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
 Yeah, no.

812
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

813
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
 Exactly, right?

814
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
 Yeah.

815
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,400
 Anyway, outrage of the week, Lauren Philpot, my family and I were playing an interactive

816
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,240
 version of pointless during our Christmas celebrations.

817
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,920
 In real life, like real as in a...

818
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,960
 There we go.

819
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
 That's it.

820
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
 Real life.

821
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
 Real life, real life.

822
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
 Yeah.

823
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
 Lovely.

824
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,320
 Lauren Philpot writes, "My family and I were playing an interactive version of pointless

825
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,640
 during our Christmas celebrations.

826
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,320
 And I managed to get through to the final part due to my random trivia knowledge, thanks

827
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 to your podcast."

828
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
 Right.

829
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 Okay.

830
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,080
 The final topic was history and the category was gunpowderplot conspirators.

831
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
 I guess.

832
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
 And I couldn't believe my luck.

833
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
 Yeah.

834
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,160
 I, of course, went with friend of the podcast, knowing in my soul that it would be pointless

835
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,680
 and win me eternal glory over my family.

836
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,600
 Imagine my heartbreak when I was told that I was wrong.

837
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 What?

838
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,280
 The makers of the game clearly don't listen to your podcast.

839
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
 So it wasn't even an option?

840
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,600
 It wasn't even listed as an option.

841
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:58,040
 I got to say, I mean, it's a tricky question for 99.99% of the...

842
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,120
 Anyone, anyone other than Guy Fawkes is going to be a pointless answer, right?

843
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
 Yeah.

844
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
 Yeah.

845
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
 But it just...

846
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
 Isn't that outrageous?

847
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
 Who else was there?

848
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
 That you wouldn't...

849
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
 No, I'm sorry for the other.

850
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
 No, no, no, no.

851
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
 It's not the top guy Fawkes.

852
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
 And that's sort of...

853
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
 Who else is there, you know?

854
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
 Everyone did me.

855
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
 Everyone did me.

856
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,000
 It feels like it's a joke from the people who made the game, knowing that people only know

857
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,160
 one of those things.

858
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
 Yeah.

859
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,400
 They just didn't bank on Lauren being able to get another one.

860
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
 Yeah.

861
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
 Didn't even bother to look it up.

862
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,080
 Anyway, that's my outrage of the week.

863
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
 Yeah.

864
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
 Good.

865
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
 Let's get on to Osmond.

866
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
 Yeah.

867
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
 Let's get on to Osmond.

868
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
 I mean, he doesn't do any modesty.

869
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
 Do you reckon it's because of this?

870
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
 Yeah.

871
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
 When they made this game, he probably saw that question and thought, "This is an outrage."

872
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
 That's it for me.

873
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
 Yeah.

874
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

875
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:47,280
 shocking. Jennifer Sokolov writes, "One of you mentioned that in 1935, a rabbi was

876
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,160
 privy to the secret ingredient of Coca-Cola for the purpose of making it kosher. I have a rabbi

877
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:59,160
 friend who works at the orthodox union, which is what they give Coca-Cola the kosher, Coca-Cosher.

878
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,200
 Could we say that again? No. Kosher Cola? No, we didn't say either of those. Do you know what?

879
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,960
 We did the first time. That's a little inside. We lost that episode and we had to do the whole

880
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,840
 thing again. John Lloyd actually made that gag in the first one, but no one made it in the

881
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:25,360
 second one. There we go. Anyway, Jennifer writes, "My friend told me once how Coca-certified

882
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,160
 now so they don't have to reveal the secret ingredient to the certifying rabbi, which

883
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,200
 I thought you might find interesting. This is so interesting. What they do is they put

884
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,400
 a lot of ingredients in a room and the certifying rabbi checks every ingredient to make sure

885
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,040
 it is kosher and can be included in the final product. But they put extra ingredients in

886
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,360
 the room that aren't actually part of the Coke formula. That's so good. That's really clever.

887
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:54,400
 I would love to taste what that Coca-Cola is if all of those things. Just out of curiosity.

888
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,840
 But you can put in some bananas stuff, which is bananas. I'm guessing bananas are kosher.

889
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,640
 There was actually, I said on that podcast, I think that we know you can basically work

890
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,200
 out the ingredients of Coca-Cola. But actually, I think literally this week there was a YouTube

891
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,280
 clip of some YouTuber had done probably the best ever version of Coca-Cola, where they'd

892
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,520
 worked it out and this is completely indistinguishable. Amazing. Can you tell the difference in that

893
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,520
 and Diet Coke? Well, yeah. Because I don't like to boast, but that's a little skill. That

894
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,920
 is a callback and a half, isn't it? That's another of my, would I like to you, fun, crazy

895
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,960
 stories about me? Samantha Jo. A lot of two named people we've had

896
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,840
 writing in today. So Jim Dennis, Dennis Jim and Dan James. And there have been several

897
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,360
 more. Right. Anyway, rights. There was a thing about breach babies. You said about breach

898
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,520
 baby being massaged? Yeah. We had someone write in telling us about the massaging that can

899
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,480
 happen, yeah, with a breach baby. Yes. That was the same person, though, who claimed

900
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,780
 that they'd seen a big, giving another B or all sex. Yeah. Anyway, Samantha Jo hasn't

901
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:14,560
 add on to the breach baby bit, which is that your organs can be moved into place via massage.

902
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:20,040
 Okay. A family member had their gall bladder removed several years ago through laparoscopic

903
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,720
 surgery, keyholes, isn't it? This family member also went to see a massage therapist regularly

904
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,360
 at the time. On one visit after surgery, the massage therapist could feel that my family

905
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,680
 members' organs were not with, they should be because the surgery requires extra room to

906
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:42,360
 be made. So the organs had slipped out of place. Luckily, the therapist was able to massage

907
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:49,240
 their organs back to their proper positions. I mean, this is what the masseur told them,

908
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,920
 right? Yep. That's wild. But apparently your organs are not stitched into place. But

909
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:01,280
 so could could arguably a masseuse completely rearrange you? Yeah, of course. I don't think

910
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:09,120
 that's possible. And have you checked this? I feel like most of your organs are generally

911
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,880
 speaking held in place. Yeah. That's a good shout. All right. Samantha, we'll need internal

912
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,400
 photos. I'm afraid. But I know I don't have Google in front of me. So maybe it's true.

913
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,440
 I think it's quite nice thing about this format is we're largely flying completely blind.

914
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,280
 You know, we're flying on own. We're off instruments. Yeah. We're only using horizons.

915
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,640
 I'm going to change your wife's. Is this absolutely she does. And the one thing that you

916
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,360
 should never do is ignore your instruments. Oh, dear. Even if what you're looking at

917
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,920
 doesn't look right, always trust your instruments. Okay. Well, let's see if you believe the email

918
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:52,400
 I've had from Tom Brockington, because we're on, you know, just loving your new podcast,

919
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:59,400
 Tom says, it's to be going for 11 years. How long is it taking you to get through these

920
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:12,320
 emails, Addy? Horrible. That person who let themselves be stung all over by bees. Oh, yeah.

921
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,160
 Michael Smith. Is that so? Schmidt. Schmidt. There's a couple of them, I think. However, they

922
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,160
 missed the area. I got stung by a beyond. Oh, can we guess when was the big giving him

923
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,600
 all those little sex at the time? You can have a guess, but I'll be surprised if you get

924
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,280
 it, but please. Well, my first thought is this a seat. Is it right up there? Oh, it's

925
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:44,400
 not below the belt. It's not below the belt. As tonsils. Oh, that would be so sore. Yeah,

926
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,600
 exactly. Right. That's going to be somewhere not quite accessible. It's on the head. It's

927
00:33:48,600 --> 00:34:00,520
 on the head. Okay. Well, after I had a massage, my gallblad is on my head now. Yeah, about 10

928
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:06,920
 years ago, I was walking through the park and a bee stung me on the ear drum. The pain was

929
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:12,000
 absolutely blinding and the ear drum ruptured, so I was also impaired with balance and movement.

930
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,640
 I did ask him how did the bee get in there? And he says, I do not know. Wow. The pain was

931
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,400
 indescribable. I could hardly even see the pain was everywhere. I ended up having a new

932
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,680
 ear drum part grown from taking skin from the side of my head. So I also had five years of

933
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:31,080
 incredible ear infections and pain. Oh, my blessed. I know. But luckily, I'm fine now and

934
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,100
 can still scuba dive. Oh, that's good. That's an important thing. However, there is a little

935
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,600
 hole left in the drum. So when I equalize the pressure while diving, bubbles come out of

936
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:47,940
 my ear. People who are like, when you do that, like ruptured your ear drum, this is obviously

937
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:53,040
 a datesit, but people used to like, they would smoke pipes and then blow smoke out. Really?

938
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,920
 Wow. James, I'm so glad you said that Tom finishes. I have tried to blow smoke out of the

939
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,760
 hole, but it has not been observed working. That is a pain. Like the description of that

940
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,200
 pain is unlike anything. Yeah, I feel like I've heard before. That's bad. That's bad.

941
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,560
 Okay. We'll do a couple more. Yeah. All right. Morris E. Corner. Ah, lovely. Alexander

942
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,000
 Andrews writes, I can confirm that not only with the audience frisked for meat, but venue

943
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,240
 staff were also searched. Wow. I worked in a college with someone who moonlighted at

944
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,320
 a venue he played and they were forewarned that they would be searched. However, I was

945
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,000
 also moonlighting as a chef. I happened to be working that weekend at the hotel he was

946
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,440
 staying at. We provided a full buffet breakfast, including a whole side of smoked salmon and

947
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,640
 me cooking every man out of pork product under the sun. The smell didn't seem to bother

948
00:35:49,640 --> 00:36:03,280
 him. Oh, more spicy celebrity meat. The spicy celebrity corn. Yeah, it's really exciting.

949
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:10,280
 Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah. Well, Thomas Patanoster Howe has more stuff. What a middle

950
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:17,320
 name. Oh, it's double-barrelled. Tom Patanoster Howe. Wow. Yeah. Hello, Andy or your minion.

951
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:24,080
 I dream. Tom of having a minion. On the subject of very veggie pop stars, Paul McCartney refuses

952
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,080
 to even sit on a leather chair. My sister used to manage a club that he came to and she

953
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,920
 had to get him a non-lether chair to sit on. Yeah, he's very. But apparently he wasn't

954
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,440
 being prissy about it. He was willing to stand, but he said no, we'll get you a chair.

955
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,280
 Okay. Well, I don't think we have a problem with people's beliefs in that respect.

956
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,680
 Yeah, exactly. Like Lisa Simpson is a veggie because of him, right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

957
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,520
 Like he's done a lot for promotion of that. Completely and I fully respect it. Willow writes.

958
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,960
 Okay. This is important. For a long time, fish has been telling the world digital rectal

959
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,280
 massage. It's the only scientifically proven method for stopping hiccups. Absolutely. Yeah.

960
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,800
 So the other day, when my spouse started hiccupsing, the path seemed clear. I hope it was

961
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,320
 a birthday. It was just another day in a typical nerdy lesbian house in Wellington as we prepared

962
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,200
 our supplies. Uh-huh. The insertion was textbook and the massage went well, but the hiccups

963
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,640
 did not cease. With my spouse still hiccuping, I went straight to the medical journals. It turns

964
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,160
 out that often the cases that it works on are considered the intractable hiccups rather

965
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,920
 than the pedestrian form that we all get. I was dismayed at the lack of research there

966
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,000
 is on this. And then I had my dear, the fish audience are a nerdy lot. And my guess is many

967
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,360
 of them are down for some digital rectal massage in the name of science. I'd like to propose

968
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,840
 a new segment, fish medical to be kicked off by asking the fans to give DRM a go for hiccups.

969
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,960
 No. No. I'm sorry. We will not be held responsible for any medical procedures that we mentioned

970
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,600
 on this show that I've then done by our listeners. I think that's really sensible, James. I think

971
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:11,000
 that was really, I had to even consider the legal bit. We look great. We're thinking that

972
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:21,120
 this person's partner didn't cure their hiccups. That's right. But perhaps they just liked

973
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,640
 the DRM. True. And then fake some hiccups afterwards and said we're going to have to try

974
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,400
 that again. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yes. That's a good point. It's a good way of doing that. Darling,

975
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:40,040
 I feel some hiccups coming on just a new netflix and chill, euphemism. I mean, the hiccups.

976
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:52,760
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. That's it from this episode. What? You normally get a bit further

977
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,920
 in than that. That's it for this episode of Drop us a line. Thank you so much for listening,

978
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,320
 for watching and for all your fantastic emails. Keep them flooding in. They're brilliant,

979
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:11,800
 podcast@ky.com. But for now, bye. But for now, bye.

980
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:25,360
 Better? Warmer? But for now, bye, bye. It's goodbye from these guys. Bye. When can

981
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:33,000
 you buy from me? Bye everybody. See you next time. Here on Drop us a line. It's always

982
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,280
 good to have 16 possible endings.
