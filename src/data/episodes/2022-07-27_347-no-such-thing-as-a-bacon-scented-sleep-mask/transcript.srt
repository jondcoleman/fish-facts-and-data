00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,560
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,880
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,640
 and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,360
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,080
 Starting with fact number one and that is James."

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,880
 Okay my fact this week is that in 1978 chess player Victor Kochnoy accused Anatoly Karpov

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,280
 of cheating using an elaborate yoghurt based code.

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,840
 Was it an elaborate yoghurt or an elaborate code?

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,640
 I actually added that word elaborate to kind of make it feel a bit better than it actually

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
 is.

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,200
 No it isn't elaborate yoghurt, it was blueberry wasn't it?

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,960
 How basic are the yoghurt's that you're using today?

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,800
 You think blueberry is elaborate.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,200
 Anything about standard Greek is elaborate.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,080
 I've read some places that it's blueberry but some places that it might be the even

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,120
 more elaborate bilberry yoghurt.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,560
 Okay that actually that really is top tier.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,640
 But basically what had happened was we'll get onto everything that was happening around

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,600
 there at the time because it was an extremely controversial match but Karpov was just playing

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,960
 chess and then suddenly someone brought him a yoghurt and no one knew that they were going

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 to bring a yoghurt.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,280
 Normally you would have your snacks at very specific times but suddenly they just brought

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,840
 him this blueberry or blueberry yoghurt and then he made a really good move and Kochnoy

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,400
 who for various reasons was quite suspicious thought that this must have been a code and

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,240
 whatever the flavour of the yoghurt was going to be that was telling him what kind of move

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
 he had to make.

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,560
 And then Kochnoy later on he did say that it was a joke and he was trying to parody

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,320
 the fact that people are always blaming each other of cheating but the truth is that he

30
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,800
 definitely did make the accusation, the officials took it seriously and they changed the rules

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
 to say that everyone had to decide what snacks they were going to have before the game started

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,880
 and they had to have them at certain times so.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,880
 So it's not the idea that maybe he wrote something in the yoghurt, in Bill Briggs.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,600
 Oh if you drizzle it in in honey, that would be clever.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,800
 So basically this was 1978 this guy Kochnoy he's a great great chess player possibly the

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,960
 best chess player never to become world champion but he had defected from the Soviet Union

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,920
 and the reason he defected is because the Soviets had decided to give other people a

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,720
 chance as their main challengers and not let him do it so he decided fuck this I'm getting

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,960
 out of there and so he went to live in Europe eventually in Switzerland but because he was

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,640
 so good he was still like the main challenger to Karpov and so they had this game but the

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,000
 Soviets were trying every trick in the book to stop him from winning so at first they

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,760
 said that he wasn't allowed to take place because he didn't have a state as in he wasn't

43
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,280
 Soviet anymore he wasn't Swiss yet he didn't have a country and then when eventually the

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,680
 chess authority said well you know he has he's the best he just beaten a guy called

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,200
 Petrosian who was previously thought to be the best so they thought okay well he's got

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,600
 to take part but the Moscow newspapers refused to name him they just called him the opponent

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,640
 or the challenger they wouldn't say what he was called and his family was still in the

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,240
 Soviet Union and the Soviet authorities refused to let them leave so they kind of kept them

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,800
 hostage because they were so upset about this guy who defected and was possibly about to

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
 become the world champion.

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 Wow.

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
 God.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,120
 So with the family pissed off when he was just lounging around eating blueberry yoghurt

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,520
 mid-match that's a bit casual for someone whose family's got a gun held at them.

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,600
 Yeah no I see that point I see that point but he thought that possibly I think that by becoming

56
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,320
 the world champion they wouldn't be able to get at him because he'd be world famous you

57
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
 know.

58
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
 Yes.

59
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,400
 There were other the match had other accusations as well didn't it so Korshnoi brought his

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,240
 own personal chair which he'd like to play chess in fair enough you're sitting down for

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,440
 several hours you want to be comfortable but Karpov's team they were the ones who were

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,080
 suspicious now and they requested the chair be dismantled an x-rayed.

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
 Wow.

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
 Really?

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
 Yeah.

66
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,560
 What would be expected to find in there you wonder.

67
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
 An extra chess piece?

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
 Oh it doesn't work like Monopoly does it?

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,440
 You can't just bring an extra bishop on them.

70
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,200
 Theoretically if no one noticed you could accidentally drop an extra bishop on there.

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,600
 I'm sure I took both your bishops no you're misremembering it yeah no you only took one.

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,840
 But this one is a it's a different design to the other bishops from afar.

73
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,960
 Well it looks like a bit of a chair leg to be honest the paranoia looking into this of

74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,480
 chess players and what they must go through I mean if you were playing a game it feels

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,600
 like half the game is just looking out for ways in which the other player is cheating.

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,560
 There's a yogurt there's a man standing over there there's a chair like you know which

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,480
 one of these are giving him the details.

78
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,700
 The man standing over there is a really good one are you talking about the French team

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
 in 2012.

80
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,200
 Yes that's right yeah.

81
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,680
 2012 there's an Olympiad in Russia and there were accusations that the French team were

82
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,520
 managing to get the messages to the actual player and by standing in pre-arranged spots

83
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,000
 behind the board so I'm not sure of the exact code but it's like if I'm standing over here

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,720
 then use your knight or if I'm standing over here there's a great move that you can't

85
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,920
 see in Russia or whatever.

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,760
 Did they not all stand in the exact order of which the chess pieces are on the board?

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
 Or you don't know if they were on a horse.

88
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,520
 Yeah one of them had a little mitre that would be really fun one of them is really poor and

89
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,160
 is why is your manager only walking diagonally just for a while?

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,200
 Why is the queen here?

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,720
 And they never proved that did they?

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,640
 They often don't sort of prove it so that's still an accusation we should say.

93
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,880
 I don't think the French team were found guilty of doing that but it does make you think is

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,320
 it not after a point easier to just play the game well than to memorise this very presumably

95
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,400
 quite complicated code of standing formations?

96
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,520
 The problem is that computers are better than humans now right and so if you can somehow

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,160
 get a computer to tell you what to do then you're going to be able to be even the best

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,160
 human and so that's why cheating now is even more of a problem than it ever has been before.

99
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,960
 So I listened to a more or less podcast the radio foreshad more or less and they interviewed

100
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,240
 the head of research at chess.com who was saying it's so it's quite interesting now

101
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,480
 spotting cheaters who are cheating with computers because computers play in a completely different

102
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,480
 way to people so he was acting like anyone could tell the difference straight away which

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,520
 I imagine we couldn't but he was saying you know you can tell after a few moves if someone

104
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,600
 is suddenly using a computer and the key difference is that computers don't plan they don't have

105
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,760
 a memory of the move that preceded and they don't have a long term strategy and so when

106
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,000
 it comes to a move they act like they've never ever seen the board before and they just do

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,960
 what's the exactly perfect move for that moment whereas human beings we have a plan and then

108
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,000
 we want to stick to it even if sometimes circumstances happen that mess with the plan.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,600
 So for instance it's very unusual for a human to willingly take back a move in chess because

110
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,880
 if you've made a move you don't want to attract it a computer got no compunction about that

111
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,400
 just do it when it wants to when it sees it's the best move.

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,760
 The thing about retracting your moves with computers that's like where you almost go

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,400
 back to your previous position right because the retracting moves that you or I might have

114
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,640
 a problem with if we were playing chess would be if I moved my knight to a place and then

115
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,680
 I took my finger off it and then I go no no I want to take that back.

116
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,200
 And that actually did happen with the one of the greatest chess players of all time

117
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,280
 which was Kasparov, Gary Kasparov when he was playing against a woman called Judith

118
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,760
 Polgar and she is probably the greatest female she almost definitely is the greatest female

119
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,120
 chess player that's ever played and if she'd have beaten Kasparov in this game it would

120
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,320
 have been the first time that a woman had ever beaten a world champion in a game of

121
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,660
 chess and he moved his knight into what would be a bad position and then he took his face

122
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,400
 off it and he went no no I didn't take my finger off it and he put it back and then

123
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,600
 he ended up I'm not sure if he won or tied the game eventually she carried on she became

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,840
 the 10th best player in the entire world anyway but that could have been such a big moment

125
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,960
 of the first woman beating a grandmaster but yeah did you guys read about her Judith Polgar

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,240
 she's amazing so no she was her father was called Lashlo Polgar and he had three daughters

127
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,940
 and he trained them all to be chess players and it's one of those stories which kind

128
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,140
 of half sounds a little bit like you know he's really forcing them to do this and it's

129
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,300
 quite bad but then on the other hand they all loved it and whenever you interview them

130
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,380
 they were all like oh this is what brought our family together we all absolutely loved

131
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:14,140
 it and so his daughters Sousa, Sophia and Judith all became grandmasters eventually

132
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,020
 Judith could beat her father by the time she was five years old at 15 she was the youngest

133
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,200
 person male or female to be awarded a grandmaster title and then eventually she played against

134
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,360
 Kasparov and should have beaten him but wasn't allowed to because of that and there was a

135
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,000
 great interview with Sousa when they asked her about playing against men and she said

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,380
 that she'd won loads of matches but she'd never won against a healthy man after every

137
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,680
 game there was always an excuse I had a headache I had stomach ache there was always something

138
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,360
 well I think that's a bit eggs in one basket training all three daughters to play chess

139
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,020
 if it was up to me I would train one to play chess, one to play drafts and one to play

140
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,540
 snakes and ladders and I would hope that one of them in the field would become the world

141
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,500
 champion yeah the problem with snakes and ladders is it is literally all down to luck

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,860
 of the dice isn't it there's literally no strategy there at all a lot of a lot of people

143
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,140
 say that it's just luck and there's no strategy but I would say actually I do remember when

144
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,700
 I played against you there's that guy stood in the corner with a ladder in front of him

145
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:21,360
 don't you say that about snakes and ladders I was reading this article that really annoyed

146
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,720
 me because what you've said so about cheating and games it was in the LA Times it was about

147
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,400
 whether you should let your kids cheat in board games and it was written by this guy

148
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,720
 who's four-year-old daughter cheats at snakes and ladders by like climbing up the snakes

149
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,640
 or jumping forward to the ladder and the gist of the article was you should let kids cheat

150
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,700
 because they don't really get a sense of fairness and ethics so they're seven or eight and before

151
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,540
 that they're just developing their creativity but the question was framed at the top as

152
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,660
 you know you're playing snakes and ladders she's cheating do you insist that your children

153
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,580
 play by the rules and then trounce them every single time or do you let them cheat and I

154
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,980
 was like snakes and ladders is the one game where a five-year-old does have a chance of

155
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,020
 beating you it sounds like the dad is cheating all the time that's why I never let my little

156
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,520
 sister play me at snakes and ladders because she would have a chance of beating me actually

157
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:21,840
 I'm like no we're going bowling so we're doing the test your strength machine again

158
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,600
 that was until she was about seven years old chest.com they have chest detectives which

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,680
 I love so they've got six chest detectives and I didn't realise how big chest.com is

160
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,460
 I mean it's absolutely massive this global site since March the number of accounts they

161
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,780
 have closed for cheating specifically is 85,000 now obviously that might be some people setting

162
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,460
 up new accounts after the first time but that is a lot of people cheating around the world

163
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:55,980
 well apparently it's 30% of chest masters again according to this exactly the people

164
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,540
 you'd thought should really be a profit but they quite often play matches on there for

165
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,880
 money or tournaments and 30% of them he says he's had to give a warning to and he says

166
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,920
 there's a system where you give them one warning and you say our computers have seen that you're

167
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,720
 cheating and using a computer and then he says the vast majority of them don't do it

168
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,480
 again which he said is so they're really being noble and realising they've done wrong but

169
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,200
 presumably they just think oh shit they've got detectives on this one in 2013 there was

170
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,100
 a Bulgarian player called Berislav Ivanov and he was forced into retirement due to a

171
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,500
 scandal he walked into the arena and they wanted to search him for an electronic device

172
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,100
 and they said can you take off your shoes and he said no my socks are too smelly so

173
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,020
 I refuse to take off my shoes and they said right okay well you're disqualified and basically

174
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,980
 you won't be able to play in any international competitions anymore wow Jesus has he stuck

175
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:56,480
 with that? He does a play anymore and that's maybe because he has such smelly feet it's

176
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,800
 possible that he has such smelly feet you know he also I think in that same tournament

177
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,160
 that he had a few suspicious moments and another one was where a competitor spotted a suspicious

178
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,920
 bump under his shirt and grabbed it which seems like an incredibly awkward moment if

179
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,040
 you've got that wrong but said it was indeed an oblong object similar to an mp3 player but

180
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,800
 then somehow didn't catch it I don't know if you ran away into the crowd or something

181
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,400
 my torso he said is so smelly that's a...

182
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,080
 Well that was that story in 1993 at the World Open where there was a guy called John von

183
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,940
 Newman and he came in and he was playing he was an unrated newcomer and he was wearing

184
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,900
 headphones the whole time suspicious already and he drew with a grandmaster in this tournament

185
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,900
 this is an unrated player and everyone kept pointing out that he had a suspicious bulge

186
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,240
 in one of his pockets which appeared to make soft humming noises and buzzing sounds at

187
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,760
 real pivotal points in the match and so they got him afterwards and said listen we think

188
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,520
 there's a bit something dodgy going on here and one of the tournament directors quizzed

189
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,960
 him about chess and it turns out he didn't even have the basic fundamental knowledge

190
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,040
 of how to play chess when asked the basic questions yeah so he was sent in he had someone

191
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,620
 on the headphones just telling him what to do the knobbly one no not that one no no the

192
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:23,300
 one with five nubs on the end don't take your finger off it once you touch that I want

193
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:34,540
 to see the Michael Spicer the man in the other room you tit

194
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,860
 okay it's time for fact number two and that is Andy my fact is that imitators of Harry

195
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:51,500
 Houdini included Howdyny, Boudini, Houdini, Houdini, Houdini, Houdini, Bernadie and cunning

196
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,440
 the jailbreaker oh my goodness yeah there's a footballer called Troy Dini I wonder if

197
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,620
 he was originally a Houdini probably probably it's very good in the box that's a Houdini

198
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,780
 joke about him getting out of the box there we go so this is this is from a great article

199
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,900
 on Gini magazine which is a kind of magic Wikipedia a Wikipedia about magic that is

200
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,220
 and it's just about all the people who Dini was so successful that just everyone started

201
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,100
 imitating him there was another guy called Kola who obviously didn't get into the main

202
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,200
 fact because it doesn't sound enough like Houdini but his his catchphrase was give my

203
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,120
 regards to the chief of police which is just such a great thing to shout as you're escaping

204
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,840
 yeah yeah and often these people would advertise in a way that you would definitely think it

205
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,960
 was Houdini right yeah so like there was a guy who was called the great Alexander that

206
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,000
 you would think well that sounds often like Houdini he's fine right but then I saw on

207
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,500
 wildabouthoudini.com which is like a blog all about Houdini there was a flyer from this

208
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,580
 guy called the great Alexander and it just said in massive letters Houdini and you would

209
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,780
 think by walking past that Houdini would be there but it actually if you read the small

210
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:17,180
 print it said Houdini the great escape artist would be outdone by the great Alexander which

211
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,180
 I think we should give a shout out to wildabouthoudini.com cause it is unbelievable it's made by this

212
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,640
 guy called John Cox and he's collated I think it must be every single primary source about

213
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,440
 Houdini ever like every newspaper clipping every diary entry of everyone who ever met

214
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,600
 him it's so good you can just disappear into it.

215
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,720
 Well it's really nice isn't it because you get the article and often you then have to

216
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,560
 do extra digging but he's he's put the picture of the newspaper where it was originally mentioned

217
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,400
 like for example Houdini didn't start off as Houdini when he got into the world of of

218
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,940
 performance he was originally a trapeze artist and he was billed as Eric Prince of the air

219
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,500
 and he you read that but next to it he's tracked down the original citation for it in an advert

220
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,780
 in a newspaper to show that this existed as a real thing so he's really done his research

221
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,020
 for the website.

222
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,980
 Yeah he's got the Houdini source of why he left one of his very first jobs as Projea the

223
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,300
 wild man of Mexico or Projea maybe which I think we've mentioned before that he played

224
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:24,040
 this role and his job was to snarl madly as raw meat was thrown at him and so this is

225
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,440
 one of his early performance acts and he quit when he ended up being hit in the eye with

226
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:36,120
 a slab of meat and indeed he recalls this himself there's a 1902 newspaper article what's also

227
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,240
 great about him is that he wrote prolifically columns for newspapers and he was writing

228
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,680
 while he was in Berlin for Oktoberfest in fact and he said I couldn't look at my trainer

229
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,980
 for three weeks because my eyes were closed that caused me to become tame because of this

230
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,600
 meat slab in the face.

231
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,100
 He had his own magazine.

232
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
 Who did Houdini?

233
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,780
 Houdini had his own magazine called Conjurer's Monthly Magazine and it wasn't explicitly

234
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,540
 his magazine but if you read any single edition of it you would notice that it was plugging

235
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,020
 Houdini it was writing malicious gossip about other magicians Houdini didn't like and criticising

236
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,740
 all the people imitating him it only lasts for about a year but yeah.

237
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,920
 He did like to sort of have a go at other magicians because he did find himself constantly having

238
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,560
 his ideas and his inventions stolen and he desperately wanted to make sure that people

239
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,080
 couldn't use them but that was really hard because if you were to patent your invention

240
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,200
 as part of the patent you would need to reveal what the trick was so he could never do that.

241
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,040
 He did get around it slightly there was one loophole that he managed to find which was

242
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,000
 he had the Chinese water torture cell and that was one that he prized a lot and what

243
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,180
 he did was he put on a play where that was in the play this act that you would escape

244
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,860
 but he only put the play on to one person sitting in the audience and then he was able

245
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,740
 to copyright the act as opposed to patent it so that no one could then do it because

246
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,740
 it was copyrighted as a play.

247
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,700
 When he died he gave his tricks to his brother didn't he so his brother was also a magician

248
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,380
 or an escape artist which I didn't know he was called Theo but he went under the name

249
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,240
 Hardeen which is almost like one of these rip-off names isn't it?

250
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,960
 Yeah in fact it's just about the only sound that is not made by those imitators.

251
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,360
 And when Theo died in 1945 the props went up for sale and they were eventually bought

252
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,760
 by David Copperfield and they're currently in storage in Las Vegas and the way to get

253
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,280
 through them they're in a big room that's next door to a sex shop and you have to go

254
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,060
 through the sex shop to get to the warehouse and there was an interview with Hugh Jackman

255
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,180
 who'd went to see them and he said that the way you get to this warehouse is that there's

256
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,540
 a mannequin in the sex shop and you have to press the nipple on the mannequin and when

257
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,820
 you press the nipple a special door opens and you can go in and see all of Houdini's

258
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,820
 tricks.

259
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
 Oh my god.

260
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
 That is so good.

261
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,580
 Would he be happy about that?

262
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,800
 Those tricks should never, they shouldn't exist really still should they because when Houdini

263
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,620
 died he gave them to his brother to Hardin and the stipulation was that once his brother

264
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:17,220
 had died that all of his stuff, all of his magical effects and physical things had to

265
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,900
 be burnt and destroyed so that's how that was meant to end.

266
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,740
 However Houdini sold a lot of it during his lifetime in the 40s to a guy who was a Houdini

267
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,580
 enthusiast called Sidney Hollis Radner and Radner then put it in a magical museum the

268
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,040
 Houdini Magical Hall of Fame at Niagara Falls.

269
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,880
 Now in 1995 a fire broke out in the museum and completely destroyed the museum however

270
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,400
 all of Houdini's stuff survived despite the whole building going down so it feels like

271
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,800
 it doesn't want to disappear, feels like it wants to continue on.

272
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,640
 Who really was escaping all that time?

273
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,840
 Was it Houdini or his equipment because he escaped a fire?

274
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,780
 Maybe he was a patsy to them.

275
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,300
 His tricks were quite interesting weren't they?

276
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,020
 Especially the escaping things.

277
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:12,420
 He escaped from piano boxes, from coffins, from ladders that he was locked to, from glass

278
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,420
 boxes.

279
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,300
 He once escaped from the belly of a whale.

280
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
 Is that living or dead?

281
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
 The whale?

282
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,300
 It was dead, the dead whale.

283
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
 Okay, still good.

284
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,700
 And when he was in Leeds he got into a big barrel of beer.

285
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,180
 You guys read about this one, it's pretty cool.

286
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,420
 It was the Tetley Brewery and they put him in a massive barrel of beer and said okay

287
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:37,560
 you have to escape but Houdini was teetotal and he became overcome by the alcohol and

288
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,520
 lost consciousness and had to be hauled out by his assistant.

289
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,240
 That is so good.

290
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
 Wow.

291
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,960
 He used to do that by the way, there was a level of PR about that where the beer keg in

292
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,720
 particular would be if it was a town that's centered around a beer industry he would use

293
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,900
 that as a way of promoting and appealing to everyone there.

294
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,980
 But if you're somewhere that doesn't do beer, let's say he's going to the home of Melton

295
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
 Mowberry pork pies.

296
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,300
 Does he have to escape from an enormous pie?

297
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,220
 You mean the home of Melton Mowberry pork pies?

298
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
 You mean Melton Mowberry?

299
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,220
 Yeah, exactly.

300
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,860
 I had a momentary loss of confidence thinking is that an actual town?

301
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,720
 But yeah, imagine that because actually the pastry case of a pork pie is technically known

302
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,180
 as a coffin, isn't it?

303
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,700
 So he is escaping from a coffin.

304
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,560
 And actually, what you do is you put him in the pie and you put the pie on a conveyor

305
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,920
 belt going towards a massive oven and if he can't escape the pie in time, he'll be cooked.

306
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,480
 He has a connection to the first ever episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

307
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,240
 Can you guess what that is?

308
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,920
 Okay, what did we talk about?

309
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,960
 We talked about CERN and the - Yeah, Large Hadron Collider.

310
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,320
 Oh, we talked about the Philippa Langley finding Richard III under a car park.

311
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,600
 I cannot believe you guys have not mentioned the most obvious facts from episode one.

312
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,100
 We recorded the whole thing locked inside a cave with 17 catalogues on it, suspended

313
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
 above.

314
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
 Yep, that's what I'm talking about.

315
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
 That's right.

316
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,780
 Before Andy came here, we had an Andrew Hunter Flurry, an Andrew Hunter Mowry, an Andrew

317
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,700
 Hunter Flurry.

318
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,340
 Does he have something to do with President Garfield Anus?

319
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,300
 Yes, he does.

320
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,700
 Did he escape from President Garfield Anus?

321
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,500
 No, he did not.

322
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,340
 He never went in in the first place.

323
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,040
 He was obsessed with murderers, so he bought all this paraphernalia.

324
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,960
 He had this massive collection, and he was obsessed with John Wilkes Booth, who shot

325
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,800
 Lincoln, of course, and he was also obsessed with Charles Guto, the man who killed President

326
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
 Garfield.

327
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,760
 He bought all of these things to do with him, like his phrenological analysis.

328
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,500
 He was locked in Guto's death row cell and escaped, and that was one of the famous tricks.

329
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,580
 In the process, he freed all the other prisoners on the same death row as him, and apparently

330
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,740
 he freed them, and then he locked them up again in the wrong cells.

331
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,540
 I've one more thing about Houdini's habits at home, because he and his wife were extremely

332
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:04,020
 close, not as close as he was with his mother, which is another story for another time.

333
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,460
 When Houdini and his wife had an argument, he would leave, he'd walk around the block,

334
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,300
 and then he'd come back, and he would open the door of the room where his wife was and

335
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,820
 throw his hat into the room.

336
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,520
 If it was thrown out again, she was still angry, and I guess he would do it again.

337
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,540
 And if the hat remained in the room, she'd come down and they'd go in and resolve it.

338
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:30,940
 What if the argument was about him leaving his clothes hanging around the house all the

339
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,700
 time, like a lot of the arguments in my house are about?

340
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,840
 You keep throwing your things all over the floor.

341
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,380
 He was actually one of the things he was as famous for as his escaping, apparently, and

342
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,020
 this is according to the Wild About Houdini website, was his needle trick.

343
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,760
 And the East India needle trick involved him basically swallowing a whole load of needles

344
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,560
 and some thread, and then he'd vomit it all back up again, but the thread would be threaded

345
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,920
 perfectly through all the needles with a little knot before each one, very impressive, yada-yada-yada.

346
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,700
 But the weird thing about that is, talking of how close he was to his wife, she died

347
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,920
 in a place called Needles.

348
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
 Oh.

349
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
 Dun-dun-dun.

350
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
 Needles, California.

351
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
 Did he?

352
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,640
 That is the least spooky thing I've ever heard.

353
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,560
 It's like I spent days searching for a Houdini-based coincidence.

354
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:33,020
 That is the least impressive coincidence since Geoffrey the cat and that mongoose that time.

355
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,520
 I have one last Houdini imitator to mention.

356
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:43,600
 This Houdini impersonator was dubbed Harry Houdini, and it was an orangutan from Borneo

357
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,760
 who lived in San Diego Zoo and whose real name was Ken Allen.

358
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,480
 That was the name of the orangutan.

359
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
 His real name.

360
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
 Real name.

361
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
 Real name.

362
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
 Real name, isn't it?

363
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
 Yeah.

364
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,680
 His real name was something in orangutan language, probably.

365
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,240
 It's what the zoo called him.

366
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
 He was called Ken Allen.

367
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,960
 But Ken Allen was quite a famous orangutan, I think.

368
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
 Very famous.

369
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
 Yeah.

370
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,080
 And the fact that he was constantly successfully escaping from his enclosure and no one could

371
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,320
 work out why.

372
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,600
 So he got, given the name, Harry Houdini, and they eventually had to bring in mountaineer

373
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,880
 experts to look at the wall to see if it was the crags in the wall that he was somehow

374
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,680
 gripping onto to getting out.

375
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,840
 And it turns out that that's what it was in the end, and they had to spend $40,000 eliminating

376
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,880
 all the holes in the wall so that Ken Allen couldn't escape anymore.

377
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,680
 And yeah, Time Magazine listed it in 2011 as one of the top 11 zoo escapes of all time.

378
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,280
 And I refuse for this podcast to ever end until we cover the other 10.

379
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:49,480
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

380
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,080
 My fact this week is that when the gates at Surman Lena Prison in Finland are locked,

381
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,120
 it's to keep tourists out, not to keep prisoners in.

382
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,680
 This is his prison on an island just off Helsinki, just really near Helsinki.

383
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,440
 And it's an open prison, but I was reading an article in the New Statesman, an article

384
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,440
 written by Helen Lewis, a journalist who went and visited.

385
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,360
 And she wanted to go and check out the prison because it's quite famous.

386
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,240
 And they'd have to close the gates because tourists keep on wandering to the island,

387
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,520
 which is a tourist destination in its own right and trying to get in.

388
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,680
 So prisoners are allowed to wander out, people are not allowed to wander in, but it's an

389
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,680
 amazing place.

390
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,600
 Finland is one of these places that has lots of open prisons, so it's got 13 open prisons.

391
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,400
 I think about a third of their prisoners are in these prisons, and they can do things like

392
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,720
 they have like therapy horses, and they have saunas, they have their own little houses like

393
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
 huts that are sort of like hostels that they stay in with shared cooking facilities, nice

394
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,160
 little sitting room with a big widescreen TV.

395
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,360
 You can stay, you can go to the mainland if you want, stay with your family overnight

396
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,040
 if you ask for permission.

397
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,360
 It's a good sitch.

398
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,800
 And as a result, it has practically no recidivism.

399
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,680
 So it's really interesting because it seems like it's for people often nearing the end

400
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,660
 of sentences where they might have been in higher security prisons for the early part

401
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,660
 of their sentence.

402
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,480
 This is a way of slowly acclimatising them to life on the outside.

403
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,920
 So you're not just going straight from maximum big house, you know, 23 hours a day in a room

404
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,560
 to the open world again, because that's a really juddering change.

405
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,320
 I did read though that, and I'm quoting exactly here, attempts to escape are limited to a

406
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,080
 few dozen a year, which sounds like a lot to me.

407
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
 It does sound like a lot.

408
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,200
 That sounds like an enormous amount.

409
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,300
 I think there are only about 100 prisoners in there, that is a large percentage of them.

410
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,360
 In 2013, they had doubled the number of attempted prison escapes in any other country in the

411
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
 world.

412
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
 Wow.

413
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,720
 But the idea is why would you try and escape if you're getting towards the end of your

414
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,360
 time and you know that if you try and escape, then you're going to get put back in the

415
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
 big house again.

416
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,600
 Then that's the idea, right?

417
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,840
 That's why you would never, in theory, make sense that you would never try and escape.

418
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
 Yeah.

419
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
 Yeah.

420
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 Yeah.

421
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,920
 Maybe it gets you more time, more jail time in that same place, because that sounds like

422
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,320
 a pretty cushy deal, sadly, I think you get sent back to one of the normal prisons

423
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
 if you try and get out.

424
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,760
 So it's not a good plan, but I mean, the conclusion of most people who look into it is that the

425
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,560
 disadvantages of the odd escapes, not too dangerous prisoner are outweighed by the advantages

426
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,440
 of the fact that places like Finland and Norway is another one like this have a recidivism

427
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
 rate of 20%.

428
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,200
 So only 20% of prisoners after like, I think it's 10 years, end up back in prison, whereas

429
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,880
 here 75% in the US is 83%.

430
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
 Wow.

431
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,920
 So it seems to be working.

432
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,480
 And also there's no challenge in an escape because you literally get given a key to your

433
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
 cell.

434
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
 Yes.

435
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,360
 The Harry Houdini of Finland is not very impressive at all, is he?

436
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,060
 Opens the door, wanders on to the ferry, saves loads of money as well.

437
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,760
 I don't know how our prisons, which are very kind of unpleasant situations, manage to be

438
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,320
 also so expensive, but I think it costs, whereas these ones are quite cheap.

439
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,880
 So cost the equivalent of 160 euros a day compared with 205 euros for a closed jail.

440
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,440
 I guess maybe those locks, those locks cost money.

441
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
 Yeah.

442
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,640
 It'll be tiny things, won't it?

443
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,400
 Remember that fact James told us about when they took a single olive out of the meals

444
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,240
 on airplanes that they saved?

445
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,680
 If you take a single bar out of a prison gate over the year, that actually leads to huge

446
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,320
 savings.

447
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,320
 We used to have rotating prisons, which I did not know.

448
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
 That sounds fun.

449
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
 Like a carousel.

450
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
 It's unbelievable.

451
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,160
 It's basically, there's a central pole and there's a cylinder of cells all the way around

452
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
 it.

453
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,920
 And if the warden turns a crank, I've no idea the mechanism that powers this, must have

454
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
 been pretty big.

455
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
 The prison rotates and you get locked away.

456
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,720
 You basically don't have a door to escape through once the prison has been rotated.

457
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
 Oh, that's clever.

458
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,920
 A bit like an escape room.

459
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,320
 It's exactly like an escape room.

460
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
 Yeah.

461
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
 Yeah.

462
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
 There are only a couple left.

463
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,720
 It's an old squirrel cage and it's an Iowa and that was three stories tall.

464
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,320
 But that's not a functioning.

465
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,680
 That's now a sort of museum heritage thing, isn't it?

466
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,080
 There are no rotating prisons currently operating in America.

467
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
 Yeah.

468
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
 That would be too much like fun.

469
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,320
 Because they were really dangerous.

470
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,220
 The, it was too dangerous for the prisoners as well because let's, well, let's say a fire

471
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:31,000
 broke out in the prison or if the mechanism broke down and it took ages to fix, you would

472
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 have people dehydrated, not being able to eat, not being able to escape.

473
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Yeah.

474
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Absolutely.

475
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,160
 So they eventually had to abandon it.

476
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,640
 I assumed you were saying that people got squished as the rotating happened.

477
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
 Well, they did.

478
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
 Like a revolving door.

479
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
 Oh, no.

480
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
 Oh, okay.

481
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,840
 Some, your hand could be caught as if it's suddenly, if you were putting your hand outside

482
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,040
 the bar and they suddenly very quickly rotated it, they were saying that hands would get

483
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,600
 lobbed off and and arms.

484
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
 What?

485
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
 Yeah.

486
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
 So it was, it was a very dangerous mechanism.

487
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
 Jesus.

488
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,640
 You just need a recording that you get at the theme parks, keep your hands and arms inside

489
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:09,080
 the vehicle slash prison cell at all times and they won't get lopped off.

490
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
 Wow.

491
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
 Boy.

492
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,000
 Well, that turned horrific very quickly.

493
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,600
 Another very dangerous prison that is also a kind of open prison is this extraordinary

494
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,920
 place, San Pedro prison in Bolivia.

495
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:29,720
 It's the largest prison in La Paz and it basically is its own town and but sort of not deliberately

496
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,840
 it's through corruption really.

497
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,000
 So the inmates all have jobs within the prison walls and the only way in which it's now a

498
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,360
 prison is that it's surrounded by guards who won't let you out, but the inmates all have

499
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
 these jobs.

500
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
 They rent accommodation.

501
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,440
 They live in there with their families quite often.

502
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,800
 They get their money mostly from working in the cocaine factory inside the prison and

503
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,120
 then they sell the cocaine to tourists to come and visit the prison and in the nineties,

504
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,800
 I don't know if any listeners were backpacking in the nineties, but apparently it was a backpacker

505
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,200
 hotspot.

506
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,440
 It was this unwritten rule that if you went to La Paz, the backpacker, you could get let

507
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,120
 into this prison and hang out in this really quite dangerous environment, just lapping

508
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,480
 up the local culture and the only reason they cracked down is because they used to offer

509
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,360
 tours around the prison and the government cracked down on this because they thought

510
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,240
 the police were big stalking the money from the illegal tours and they had politicians

511
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
 and stuff inside.

512
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,280
 They have elected leaders in the prison who apparently enforce the laws of the community,

513
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,720
 mainly by stabbing people.

514
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
 Wow.

515
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,920
 That's like only in the hand or something, you know, you steal an apple, you get stabbed

516
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,120
 in the hand because you can't just send someone to prison within a prison, I guess.

517
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
 No.

518
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
 No.

519
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,080
 It sounds like you're an advocate for this place, Anna.

520
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,880
 It does a little bit, especially when you said it's where you get the cocaine and then

521
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,120
 you're like, oh, and this is also the place where you lap up the local culture, which sounded

522
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,960
 like the most obvious euphemism for drug taking I'd ever heard in my life.

523
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,400
 You can lap it up, you can sniff up the local culture, rub the local culture into your gums

524
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
 if you want to.

525
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,800
 It's just, it's the backpacking experience.

526
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,960
 Oh, my word.

527
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,240
 You guys, of course, know Eamon de Valera, the hero of Irish politics, right?

528
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,680
 Sure, but why don't you just, for the listeners at home, why don't you quickly explain to

529
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
 them?

530
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,680
 Well, just Eamon de Valera, great hero of the Irish independence movement.

531
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,520
 He was locked up in, oh, I think it was about 1917 or 18, right?

532
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
 That's right.

533
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,720
 And the story, he escaped, right?

534
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,880
 But the story of how he escaped is absolutely insane.

535
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,240
 He was in for possibly conspiring with Germany.

536
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
 That was the charge.

537
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,520
 So he stole a key from the prison chaplain, impressive.

538
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,400
 He got some candles from the chapel and he pressed the key into the candles, right?

539
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,640
 So now he's got an impression of the key.

540
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,640
 But the problem is you need someone to make the key, you know, he didn't have the facility

541
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
 to do that.

542
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,160
 So metal to pour into the thing, right?

543
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
 Exactly.

544
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:01,200
 So what they did was, he and a couple of, I think, fellow prisoners, they sent the IRA

545
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,320
 a Christmas card on which they had got someone to draw a cartoon of a drunk man holding a

546
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,400
 big key.

547
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,760
 And the key that they drew on the card was an exact copy of the impression he had taken

548
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,960
 from the chaplain's key, right?

549
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,520
 So basically it was a code saying make a key that looks like this and it'll get me out.

550
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,840
 The guards didn't notice.

551
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,320
 They made the key to the dimensions on the card.

552
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,960
 They sent it inside a cake, genuinely inside a cake.

553
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
 Christmas cake.

554
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
 Probably.

555
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
 Probably.

556
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
 It got through.

557
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,120
 It didn't fit the lock.

558
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
 They made it too small.

559
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,160
 As soon as he got out of the cake, he thought, oh, this doesn't fit.

560
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,040
 Did they make it the size of the drawing on the card?

561
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,880
 Well, they had to do it again.

562
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,200
 They had to send another amusing cartoon this time with a kind of Celtic symbol in the middle

563
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
 of which was a key.

564
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,480
 I was going to say, did they have to wait till next Christmas or did they do it like

565
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,040
 maybe as a Valentine's card or an Epiphany card?

566
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,440
 They were like, oh, in Ireland, this is a thing we do every year.

567
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,120
 So then basically they sent the second cartoon.

568
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,760
 They sent it back another key.

569
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,480
 That also did not work.

570
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,680
 So this time it was too big.

571
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
 The Goldilocks.

572
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,200
 The Goldilocks key is coming up.

573
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
 Very nice.

574
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,040
 Eventually they just sent a third cake to the prison and inside that cake was just a blank

575
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:30,280
 key and a set of files saying, "Make your own bloody key" and it worked.

576
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,640
 Just one weird thing on prison, like living within a prison, is that women don't have

577
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,400
 to wear prison issue clothing in British jails and men do.

578
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,960
 And that's been the case since 1971 and it's because research finds that people had

579
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,880
 heard of the rules better if they're not actually wearing uniform.

580
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,880
 And I think the idea is that it sort of humanises you and it's like, I'm more willing to obey

581
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
 the rules.

582
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,080
 In America, famously quite strict penal system, the inmates often do have to wear orange.

583
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,640
 Or in fact, when oranges, the new black came out, some prisons stopped their female inmates

584
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,440
 from wearing orange and made them go back to stripes because orange had become cool.

585
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
 Really?

586
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,400
 Not allowed to be cool.

587
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,360
 There is, in Norway as well, at the Bastøy rehabilitation centre, I don't know if it's

588
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,680
 the pronunciation of that, it's got an O with a line through it.

589
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
 Bastøy.

590
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,680
 I think it is.

591
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
 Bastøy.

592
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,360
 They have a similar thing where the guards don't wear uniforms and they don't wear uniforms

593
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,840
 because they say they don't want to create sort of unnecessary division between them and

594
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,720
 the prisoners there, who they don't call prisoners, they call residents, because it just feels

595
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
 more friendly.

596
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,000
 It feels like a cool dad, really, in that prison, just trying a bit too hard.

597
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,480
 Speaking of words that begin with B-A-S-T, as we just learned, that your Bastøy place

598
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
 or whatever it was.

599
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,800
 Segway incoming.

600
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,920
 The place in Finland, which is called Suomenlinna, is it, Anna?

601
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
 Suomenlinna.

602
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,560
 Yeah, Suomenlinna.

603
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,120
 That is, like you said, a famous tourist attraction and it's because it's a bastion

604
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,120
 fort.

605
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
 It's a bastion fort.

606
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
 You guys might have seen these.

607
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,120
 It's where you have a fortress, but instead of being a normal castle, it's in a star

608
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
 shape.

609
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,120
 Have you ever seen those?

610
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,680
 You get them around Europe, don't you?

611
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,440
 Do you know why you have star-shaped castles or why you used to have star-shaped castles?

612
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,000
 Is it something defensive?

613
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,360
 Is it to confuse aeroplanes because they'll look at the castle and think that that's up

614
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,360
 because it's a star, so they'll fly in the opposite direction?

615
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
 Brilliant.

616
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
 Brilliant.

617
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
 That's such a good idea.

618
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,720
 Oh, my God, that's so genius, but no, it was a time before playing some PogChalli.

619
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
 OK.

620
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,800
 But Andy was pretty much there.

621
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,720
 So basically, it was in a time of cannonballs.

622
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,960
 And if you fire a cannonball at a normal castle, it's going to hit the wall and it might make

623
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,440
 some damage.

624
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,960
 But if you fire the cannonball at a surface which is not straight on, which is not perpendicular,

625
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,160
 it's actually slightly slanted, then the cannonball might just kind of hit the edge of it and skid

626
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,480
 off the side of it.

627
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,280
 And so the idea was to make these star-shaped forts where if anyone was firing cannons at

628
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,480
 you, then it wouldn't initially do as much damage.

629
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
 So that's why they have it.

630
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
 So clever.

631
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
 So clever.

632
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,760
 Is that a thing called, I want to say a ravelin, or it might be connected to a ravelin?

633
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,900
 I think it is that, yeah.

634
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,400
 I remember reading that word while I was reading this fact, but yeah.

635
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,760
 Because I went to one of them in Kronborg when we were all on tour in Denmark.

636
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
 Oh, yeah.

637
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,320
 Kronborg, which is the setting for Hamlet.

638
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
 Oh, yeah.

639
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,920
 And they have got these star-shaped fortifications outside and it makes it, yeah, as James said.

640
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,800
 And that's a ravelin, useless as for a javelin at a ravelin, right?

641
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
 Yeah.

642
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
 That's the same.

643
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
 That's the catchphrase.

644
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,800
 They got that painted above the gates.

645
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,680
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

646
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,280
 My fact this week is that one of Hawaii's biggest annual festivals is devoted entirely

647
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,680
 to spam.

648
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,680
 That's spam the food.

649
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,640
 So when they invite you to the spam festival, do they send you 5,000 emails telling you

650
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,520
 it's on every year?

651
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,480
 Extend your penis at the Hawaii Spam Festival.

652
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,320
 Yeah, I love this fact.

653
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,920
 It was given to me in a conversation I had with a mutual friend of ours, Jason Haseley.

654
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,640
 We were chatting about it and he said, by the way, did you know that they have the Waikiki

655
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,440
 Spam Jam, which is this annual spam festival that takes place in Hawaii.

656
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,440
 And it is a massively popular festival there.

657
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,440
 35,000 people attend according to their website.

658
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,600
 They have live bands playing.

659
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
 They have merch.

660
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,560
 You can get spam t-shirts, shorts, slippers.

661
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
 They have craft boots.

662
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
 Can I just check?

663
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,040
 Sorry, the t-shirt, shorts, and slippers, they're not all made of spam, are they?

664
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,800
 No, they just feature a picture of spam, I'm guessing.

665
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,480
 Right, because that would be absolutely disgusting and not survive a wash.

666
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,200
 I've got to say, Dan, when you sent round this fact, I thought that it was a massive

667
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,360
 exaggeration and I've been to Hawaii and they have lots of festivals all the time.

668
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,280
 And I was like, there's no way that the spam one is one of the biggest, which is what you

669
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,920
 say, but it so is.

670
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,520
 It's absolutely huge.

671
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,160
 Yeah, and they are obsessed.

672
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,320
 Hawaii is obsessed with spam and they have spam in places that I've never heard of or

673
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
 dreamt of thinking they would appear.

674
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,280
 Okay, I need to get into personal details.

675
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,960
 Well, okay, maybe I'll dig that up too much, but you know, McDonald's has spam burgers

676
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,440
 and so does Burger King.

677
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,720
 They have a spam burger and yeah, you can get them in all the local dishes.

678
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,880
 Everything spam is just integrated all over Hawaii.

679
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,320
 I think the most common way in Hawaii that it's served is quite nice because it's a

680
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,160
 sushi spam and that's kind of a nod to they've got a big Japanese population actually.

681
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,360
 And also, I think it's quite nice because Hawaii obviously has quite a difficult history

682
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,040
 with Japan and now they serve spam sushi and it's spam on top of sushi rice wrapped in

683
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,280
 seaweed and it's called Spam Musubi and that's where you'll usually sit.

684
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,320
 I think the reason that spam is so popular not just in Hawaii but also throughout the

685
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,400
 whole of the Pacific is due to the war, isn't it?

686
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,640
 It's due to the Second World War because basically the Japanese soldiers took over a lot of these

687
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,120
 islands and the people, whenever they grew food, they had to give it to the Japanese soldiers

688
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,320
 and they were forced to do all this stuff.

689
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,240
 And then when the Americans came and sort of liberated them, they didn't have any food.

690
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,000
 They were just kind of searching for any kind of food they could eat but the American soldiers

691
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,360
 had tons of this stuff like they had spam coming out of their ears, the American soldiers

692
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,040
 during the Second World War, so they gave it to the locals and that's where the kind

693
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,680
 of love of spam came from.

694
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,200
 Yeah, I listened to a podcast all about spam which was great.

695
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,680
 It's actually the Business Insider podcast.

696
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,920
 It's called Brought to You By and it's about the kind of the stories behind big old brands.

697
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,920
 And anyway, it was like places that have had a US military presence around that time because

698
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,080
 spam was just kind of taking off and places that have rice-based dishes because apparently

699
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,720
 it goes very well with rice and then places with very hot climates because it's canned

700
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,040
 and so it's like a canned meat that you don't even need to put in the fridge.

701
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,720
 So it's like Korea, Guam, the Philippines, it's massive.

702
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,600
 The founder was a man called Hormel and the firm that still makes it is called Hormel.

703
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,920
 So his son took over the family firm J. Hormel and he was interviewed by the New Yorker in

704
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,400
 1945 just as the war was ending and he said that there was a file called the Scurrilous

705
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,960
 File which contained hundreds of letters of abuse sent to him by soldiers all over the

706
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,840
 world saying, "I have to eat this spam and it's disgusting," right?

707
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,960
 And he said in this interview, "Maybe the verb 'to spam' will come out of this war.

708
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,040
 Something would surprise me anymore," i.e. he was saying that sending random letters

709
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,760
 or communications to someone who hasn't asked for it is to spam.

710
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,760
 Now that is not where the word spam as a verb for email comes from, but it is an earlier

711
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,840
 link between the two concepts.

712
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
 Isn't that weird?

713
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
 That's so good.

714
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
 That is so good.

715
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,960
 We should say what the sort of received acknowledged fact of where it comes from is which is it

716
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,680
 was a Monty Python sketch where Terry Jones was running a restaurant where the only thing

717
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,280
 that you could have was spam and would you like spam, spam, spam, it was always different.

718
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,080
 And that's where the people who gave it its name took it from that.

719
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
 But I think you're right, Andy.

720
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,280
 I think that's more of a direct...

721
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
 Is that weird?

722
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
 Yeah.

723
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,280
 Yeah.

724
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
 Yeah.

725
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
 Be cool.

726
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,280
 Monty Python's sort of ruined spam for a while.

727
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,480
 For a while, Hallwell was really angry about it.

728
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
 Just getting popular again.

729
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,840
 I think people hated it in the Second World War and then they started to enjoy it in the

730
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,840
 '40s and '50s.

731
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,880
 There were these spam girls, weren't there, these Hallwell girls who the company employed

732
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,240
 and they were a band.

733
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,440
 They were this musical group and they were worried because after World War II, 90% of

734
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,360
 sales had been to the army and they thought, oh my God, we're going to stop selling it.

735
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,600
 And so the Hallwell girls traveled around the U.S. in 35 white Chevy's doing sort of

736
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,000
 singing, dancing, parades.

737
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,200
 They had their own radio show and sales shot up.

738
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,700
 They made spam cool.

739
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,640
 They were known as the Spamettes, sometimes this band.

740
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
 Nice.

741
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:37,360
 And they were all dressed in like soldiers, not soldiers uniform, but like soldiers band

742
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
 uniform, weren't they?

743
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,080
 And it was kind of to remind you of the wartime effort, really.

744
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,280
 Yeah.

745
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,320
 But then also, Hallwell sold chili con carne.

746
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,080
 So he saw this thing with the Hallwell girls, working so well in America.

747
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,240
 So he thought, okay, I'm going to try and do it with chili con carne.

748
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:01,660
 So he created a mariachi band, which went round Mexico, trying to sell Hallwell chili

749
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
 con carne.

750
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,660
 How did that go?

751
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,460
 It sounds like it was less successful.

752
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,580
 It was less successful.

753
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,660
 Hormel's grandson was also in the arts.

754
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,660
 He still is.

755
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,820
 He's a guitarist and we all will have heard his work.

756
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,220
 He's called Smoky Hormel and Smoky is his birth name.

757
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,220
 That's not a nickname.

758
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,220
 He was called Smoky.

759
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:26,740
 It sounds like the company was too used to naming hams by that point.

760
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,280
 And he's a he's a guitarist.

761
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:35,600
 He plays blues and country, but he also appears on albums by Adele and by Beck and by, yeah,

762
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
 Mick Jagger.

763
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,560
 And he's the main guitarist on what was Johnny Cash's big final major hit, Hurt, the Nine

764
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,160
 Itch Nails cover, Kid Rock, Joe Strummer, I mean, he's done them all.

765
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,260
 Hormel have a new innovation.

766
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:54,860
 They've got a thing that they've just announced this October.

767
00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:00,540
 It's bacon scented face masks in a very 2020 story.

768
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,820
 They say it has...

769
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,460
 Is that to wear when you're asleep?

770
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,740
 No, it's to wear when you're going out and about and you want to smell bacon constantly.

771
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,940
 Not like a face mask that covers your eyes.

772
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,940
 Not a sleep mask.

773
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,100
 I mean, a COVID face mask.

774
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,180
 You've been going around in these COVID times just wearing a sleep mask.

775
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,180
 It's terrible.

776
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,180
 I keep walking into people.

777
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:25,120
 How are you supposed to keep two meters away from people when you can't even see them?

778
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:30,480
 Because I was thinking like a sleep mask that smells of bacon is completely pointless because

779
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,200
 the smell of bacon famously wakes you up, doesn't it?

780
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,000
 Oh, no, this is a this is a thing that they claim it has, and I'm quoting here, the latest

781
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,920
 in pork scented technology.

782
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,080
 I don't know what the last thing in pork scented technology was, but it says keep the delicious

783
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,100
 smell of bacon always wrapped around your nose.

784
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,100
 Not sure.

785
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:58,420
 You can get a Spamurita along a similar vein, which is a Spam flavoured cocktail and Soho

786
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,220
 here in this very capital.

787
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,220
 Wow.

788
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,220
 Yeah.

789
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:08,100
 Get it a Jinju Korean restaurant in Soho and it's made of tequila, mezcal, agave nectar,

790
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,700
 pineapple and fresh lime.

791
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:14,860
 Sounds absolutely delicious until you add the Spam.

792
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,560
 One more member of the Hormel family, which we'll talk about a few minutes ago, is James

793
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,760
 Hormel, and he is the main donor of the Hormel Center of San Francisco Public Library, which

794
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:32,680
 collects all the importance of LGBTQ books from the last 20, 30, 40 years of American

795
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,680
 history.

796
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:39,200
 And he also was the first openly gay man to represent the U.S. as an ambassador.

797
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:46,220
 So this was under Clinton's administration, and they needed a new ambassador for Luxembourg,

798
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,220
 and they chose this guy.

799
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,020
 James Hormel obviously done a lot of philanthropy and stuff, and so he's a really good person

800
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,020
 to have to do this, but the Republicans were just not having it.

801
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:00,300
 They were like, we cannot have an openly gay man representing the United States as an ambassador.

802
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,660
 So there's a massive, massive argument.

803
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:09,160
 And to support their argument, the Republicans went to the Hormel Library and then looked

804
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,380
 through all of their history and then found a load of what they regarded as very pornographic

805
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,620
 things.

806
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,300
 And they said, look, this man supports pornography.

807
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,140
 He shouldn't be representing the United States.

808
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,640
 And it got really, really high up this argument until it was pointed out that all of the works

809
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,840
 that they pointed out were in his library, were also in the Library of Congress.

810
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
 And then he became--

811
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,840
 In your face.

812
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,840
 Yeah.

813
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
 Spam on your face.

814
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:42,240
 Have you heard of Mark Benson?

815
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
 No.

816
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,000
 Andy, you don't mean Mark Benson, do you?

817
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 I do.

818
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,520
 Give it his full name.

819
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,400
 Mark, I love spam, Benson.

820
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:59,560
 And we're going from one grateful anthropist to another here out there.

821
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,560
 Absolutely.

822
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
 Absolutely.

823
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,080
 And what links them, a single can of spam?

824
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,120
 This is a spam lover called Mark Benson.

825
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,120
 He's from the UK.

826
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:16,040
 And in 2017, he and his wife went to the festival in T-shirt saying, "Mr and Mrs, I love spam

827
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,040
 Benson."

828
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,280
 So his wife's on it too.

829
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,280
 And he has changed his name.

830
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,280
 So this is the Hawaiian festival they went to.

831
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,280
 Yeah.

832
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,280
 Yes, they did.

833
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,280
 Wow.

834
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,320
 And not only that, and not only has he legally changed his middle name to I Love Spam.

835
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,320
 But they went--

836
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,320
 I think if Mark Benson really likes spam, he changes first name to I Love Spam.

837
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,520
 Actually, I think you can hide your middle name, can't you?

838
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,000
 That's a good point.

839
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,480
 I mean, he does have a T-shirt saying his name.

840
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,560
 He's not gone very far to hide it.

841
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,960
 But they went to Hawaii after they went to the Spam Museum, which is-- where's that?

842
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
 Is it Minnesota?

843
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,960
 It's at the headquarters.

844
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,960
 They call it the--

845
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,960
 Yes.

846
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
 They call it the Guggenham.

847
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,960
 Very clever.

848
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,080
 But they went to the museum and they got married there.

849
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,840
 They got married at the Spam Museum.

850
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:08,000
 Spam's brand manager got themselves ordained in order to officiate at this wedding.

851
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 So--

852
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 So good.

853
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 It's the most spam-themed wedding ever.

854
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 So good.

855
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,040
 You are now spam in life.

856
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
 What on earth?

857
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:22,960
 He said, you know why he said he changed-- he loves Spam so much, or he said he changed

858
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:29,120
 his name as a tribute to Spam to his grandpa who worked in the Spam factory in Liverpool

859
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,840
 and to the war effort.

860
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
 OK.

861
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,840
 Quite right.

862
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,220
 It's one way to remember the war, I think.

863
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,760
 That museum that's-- oh, go on, Andy.

864
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,760
 You about to say something.

865
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,480
 Well, they've got some lovely children as well.

866
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,680
 So we know at least they didn't need a Spam donor.

867
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,680
 OK.

868
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,760
 I'm glad I let you talk there.

869
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,000
 That museum is in Austin in Minnesota and it sounds quite interesting.

870
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,920
 They have volunteer guides that are known as Spambaciders and they walk around the Spam

871
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:05,400
 Museum with little bits of Spam on toothpicks, which they call Spumples.

872
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,120
 Oh, my gosh.

873
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:11,600
 Did you guys hear about the 1990s Spam carving contest in Seattle?

874
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
 No.

875
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,600
 This was amazing.

876
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,160
 It ran for 10 years before being shut down, or maybe people lost interest, I don't know.

877
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,960
 But you were given two cans of Spam, one plastic knife and 15 minutes, right?

878
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,440
 You were allowed to bring your own extra tools if you wanted to, but power tools and chainsaws

879
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,400
 were explicitly banned by your--

880
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,400
 Sorry.

881
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,440
 Two cans of Spam and you might want to use power tools.

882
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,040
 Well, you're absolutely right.

883
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,320
 You would have gone on very well with the organizers, James, because they said that's overkill.

884
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,040
 Well, sometimes it's hard to open those tins, isn't it?

885
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,800
 So you might need a sort of pneumatic drill to get in there.

886
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,040
 I think they're ringpools, aren't they?

887
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,040
 They are ringpools.

888
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,040
 They are ringpools.

889
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,040
 Yeah.

890
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,040
 I'm looking at them upside down.

891
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,240
 But there were so many good sounding winners.

892
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,240
 In 1994, the winner was Nude Descending a Staircase.

893
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,880
 So I'm going to carve that in Spam in a quarter of an hour.

894
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,040
 Are you sure that wasn't just a description of the person who'd won?

895
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:16,240
 I've not done a very good sculpture, but I am Nude and I am walking down the staircase.

896
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:23,640
 Other winners included Jurassic Pork, Spamhenge, very good, and my favorite, a model of singer

897
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,440
 Spammy Winnet singing Spam by Your Man.

898
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,440
 Okay, that's it.

899
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,440
 That is all of our facts.

900
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,940

 All of our previous episodes are up there.

909
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,800

 Go check it out.

911
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,600
 Anyway, we'll be back again next week.

912
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,440
 We'll see you then with another episode.

913
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,280
 Goodbye.

914
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,280
 Bye.

915
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
 Bye.

916
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
 Bye.

917
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
 Bye.

918
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
 Bye.

919
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,280
 Bye.

920
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,280
 Bye.

921
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,280
 Bye.

922
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,280
 Bye.

923
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,280
 Bye.
