 "Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.880
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.120
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.640
 and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.360
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.080
 Starting with fact number one and that is James."

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.880
 Okay my fact this week is that in 1978 chess player Victor Kochnoy accused Anatoly Karpov

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.280
 of cheating using an elaborate yoghurt based code.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.840
 Was it an elaborate yoghurt or an elaborate code?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.640
 I actually added that word elaborate to kind of make it feel a bit better than it actually

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.640
 is.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.200
 No it isn't elaborate yoghurt, it was blueberry wasn't it?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.960
 How basic are the yoghurt's that you're using today?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.800
 You think blueberry is elaborate.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.200
 Anything about standard Greek is elaborate.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.080
 I've read some places that it's blueberry but some places that it might be the even

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.120
 more elaborate bilberry yoghurt.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.560
 Okay that actually that really is top tier.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.640
 But basically what had happened was we'll get onto everything that was happening around

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.600
 there at the time because it was an extremely controversial match but Karpov was just playing

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.960
 chess and then suddenly someone brought him a yoghurt and no one knew that they were going

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 to bring a yoghurt.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 Normally you would have your snacks at very specific times but suddenly they just brought

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 him this blueberry or blueberry yoghurt and then he made a really good move and Kochnoy

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.400
 who for various reasons was quite suspicious thought that this must have been a code and

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.240
 whatever the flavour of the yoghurt was going to be that was telling him what kind of move

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.920
 he had to make.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.560
 And then Kochnoy later on he did say that it was a joke and he was trying to parody

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.320
 the fact that people are always blaming each other of cheating but the truth is that he

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.800
 definitely did make the accusation, the officials took it seriously and they changed the rules

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.440
 to say that everyone had to decide what snacks they were going to have before the game started

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.880
 and they had to have them at certain times so.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 So it's not the idea that maybe he wrote something in the yoghurt, in Bill Briggs.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.600
 Oh if you drizzle it in in honey, that would be clever.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.800
 So basically this was 1978 this guy Kochnoy he's a great great chess player possibly the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.960
 best chess player never to become world champion but he had defected from the Soviet Union

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.920
 and the reason he defected is because the Soviets had decided to give other people a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.720
 chance as their main challengers and not let him do it so he decided fuck this I'm getting

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.960
 out of there and so he went to live in Europe eventually in Switzerland but because he was

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.640
 so good he was still like the main challenger to Karpov and so they had this game but the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.000
 Soviets were trying every trick in the book to stop him from winning so at first they

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.760
 said that he wasn't allowed to take place because he didn't have a state as in he wasn't

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.280
 Soviet anymore he wasn't Swiss yet he didn't have a country and then when eventually the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.680
 chess authority said well you know he has he's the best he just beaten a guy called

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.200
 Petrosian who was previously thought to be the best so they thought okay well he's got

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.600
 to take part but the Moscow newspapers refused to name him they just called him the opponent

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.640
 or the challenger they wouldn't say what he was called and his family was still in the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.240
 Soviet Union and the Soviet authorities refused to let them leave so they kind of kept them

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.800
 hostage because they were so upset about this guy who defected and was possibly about to

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
 become the world champion.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800
 Wow.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.800
 God.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.120
 So with the family pissed off when he was just lounging around eating blueberry yoghurt

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.520
 mid-match that's a bit casual for someone whose family's got a gun held at them.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.600
 Yeah no I see that point I see that point but he thought that possibly I think that by becoming

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.320
 the world champion they wouldn't be able to get at him because he'd be world famous you

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320
 know.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320
 Yes.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.400
 There were other the match had other accusations as well didn't it so Korshnoi brought his

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.240
 own personal chair which he'd like to play chess in fair enough you're sitting down for

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.440
 several hours you want to be comfortable but Karpov's team they were the ones who were

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.080
 suspicious now and they requested the chair be dismantled an x-rayed.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080
 Wow.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080
 Really?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080
 Yeah.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.560
 What would be expected to find in there you wonder.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560
 An extra chess piece?

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.120
 Oh it doesn't work like Monopoly does it?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.440
 You can't just bring an extra bishop on them.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.200
 Theoretically if no one noticed you could accidentally drop an extra bishop on there.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.600
 I'm sure I took both your bishops no you're misremembering it yeah no you only took one.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.840
 But this one is a it's a different design to the other bishops from afar.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.960
 Well it looks like a bit of a chair leg to be honest the paranoia looking into this of

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.480
 chess players and what they must go through I mean if you were playing a game it feels

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.600
 like half the game is just looking out for ways in which the other player is cheating.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.560
 There's a yogurt there's a man standing over there there's a chair like you know which

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.480
 one of these are giving him the details.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.700
 The man standing over there is a really good one are you talking about the French team

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.700
 in 2012.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.200
 Yes that's right yeah.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.680
 2012 there's an Olympiad in Russia and there were accusations that the French team were

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.520
 managing to get the messages to the actual player and by standing in pre-arranged spots

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.000
 behind the board so I'm not sure of the exact code but it's like if I'm standing over here

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.720
 then use your knight or if I'm standing over here there's a great move that you can't

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.920
 see in Russia or whatever.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.760
 Did they not all stand in the exact order of which the chess pieces are on the board?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.760
 Or you don't know if they were on a horse.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.520
 Yeah one of them had a little mitre that would be really fun one of them is really poor and

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.160
 is why is your manager only walking diagonally just for a while?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.200
 Why is the queen here?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.720
 And they never proved that did they?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.640
 They often don't sort of prove it so that's still an accusation we should say.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.880
 I don't think the French team were found guilty of doing that but it does make you think is

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.320
 it not after a point easier to just play the game well than to memorise this very presumably

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.400
 quite complicated code of standing formations?

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.520
 The problem is that computers are better than humans now right and so if you can somehow

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.160
 get a computer to tell you what to do then you're going to be able to be even the best

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.160
 human and so that's why cheating now is even more of a problem than it ever has been before.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.960
 So I listened to a more or less podcast the radio foreshad more or less and they interviewed

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.240
 the head of research at chess.com who was saying it's so it's quite interesting now

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.480
 spotting cheaters who are cheating with computers because computers play in a completely different

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.480
 way to people so he was acting like anyone could tell the difference straight away which

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.520
 I imagine we couldn't but he was saying you know you can tell after a few moves if someone

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.600
 is suddenly using a computer and the key difference is that computers don't plan they don't have

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.760
 a memory of the move that preceded and they don't have a long term strategy and so when

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.000
 it comes to a move they act like they've never ever seen the board before and they just do

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.960
 what's the exactly perfect move for that moment whereas human beings we have a plan and then

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.000
 we want to stick to it even if sometimes circumstances happen that mess with the plan.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.600
 So for instance it's very unusual for a human to willingly take back a move in chess because

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.880
 if you've made a move you don't want to attract it a computer got no compunction about that

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.400
 just do it when it wants to when it sees it's the best move.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.760
 The thing about retracting your moves with computers that's like where you almost go

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.400
 back to your previous position right because the retracting moves that you or I might have

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.640
 a problem with if we were playing chess would be if I moved my knight to a place and then

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.680
 I took my finger off it and then I go no no I want to take that back.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.200
 And that actually did happen with the one of the greatest chess players of all time

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.280
 which was Kasparov, Gary Kasparov when he was playing against a woman called Judith

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.760
 Polgar and she is probably the greatest female she almost definitely is the greatest female

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.120
 chess player that's ever played and if she'd have beaten Kasparov in this game it would

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.320
 have been the first time that a woman had ever beaten a world champion in a game of

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.660
 chess and he moved his knight into what would be a bad position and then he took his face

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.400
 off it and he went no no I didn't take my finger off it and he put it back and then

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.600
 he ended up I'm not sure if he won or tied the game eventually she carried on she became

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.840
 the 10th best player in the entire world anyway but that could have been such a big moment

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.960
 of the first woman beating a grandmaster but yeah did you guys read about her Judith Polgar

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:50.240
 she's amazing so no she was her father was called Lashlo Polgar and he had three daughters

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.940
 and he trained them all to be chess players and it's one of those stories which kind

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.140
 of half sounds a little bit like you know he's really forcing them to do this and it's

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.300
 quite bad but then on the other hand they all loved it and whenever you interview them

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.380
 they were all like oh this is what brought our family together we all absolutely loved

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:14.140
 it and so his daughters Sousa, Sophia and Judith all became grandmasters eventually

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.020
 Judith could beat her father by the time she was five years old at 15 she was the youngest

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:24.200
 person male or female to be awarded a grandmaster title and then eventually she played against

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.360
 Kasparov and should have beaten him but wasn't allowed to because of that and there was a

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.000
 great interview with Sousa when they asked her about playing against men and she said

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.380
 that she'd won loads of matches but she'd never won against a healthy man after every

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.680
 game there was always an excuse I had a headache I had stomach ache there was always something

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:48.360
 well I think that's a bit eggs in one basket training all three daughters to play chess

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.020
 if it was up to me I would train one to play chess, one to play drafts and one to play

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.540
 snakes and ladders and I would hope that one of them in the field would become the world

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.500
 champion yeah the problem with snakes and ladders is it is literally all down to luck

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.860
 of the dice isn't it there's literally no strategy there at all a lot of a lot of people

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.140
 say that it's just luck and there's no strategy but I would say actually I do remember when

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.700
 I played against you there's that guy stood in the corner with a ladder in front of him

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:21.360
 don't you say that about snakes and ladders I was reading this article that really annoyed

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.720
 me because what you've said so about cheating and games it was in the LA Times it was about

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.400
 whether you should let your kids cheat in board games and it was written by this guy

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.720
 who's four-year-old daughter cheats at snakes and ladders by like climbing up the snakes

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.640
 or jumping forward to the ladder and the gist of the article was you should let kids cheat

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.700
 because they don't really get a sense of fairness and ethics so they're seven or eight and before

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.540
 that they're just developing their creativity but the question was framed at the top as

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.660
 you know you're playing snakes and ladders she's cheating do you insist that your children

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.580
 play by the rules and then trounce them every single time or do you let them cheat and I

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.980
 was like snakes and ladders is the one game where a five-year-old does have a chance of

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:08.020
 beating you it sounds like the dad is cheating all the time that's why I never let my little

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.520
 sister play me at snakes and ladders because she would have a chance of beating me actually

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:21.840
 I'm like no we're going bowling so we're doing the test your strength machine again

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.600
 that was until she was about seven years old chest.com they have chest detectives which

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.680
 I love so they've got six chest detectives and I didn't realise how big chest.com is

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.460
 I mean it's absolutely massive this global site since March the number of accounts they

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:44.780
 have closed for cheating specifically is 85,000 now obviously that might be some people setting

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.460
 up new accounts after the first time but that is a lot of people cheating around the world

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:55.980
 well apparently it's 30% of chest masters again according to this exactly the people

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.540
 you'd thought should really be a profit but they quite often play matches on there for

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:05.880
 money or tournaments and 30% of them he says he's had to give a warning to and he says

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.920
 there's a system where you give them one warning and you say our computers have seen that you're

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.720
 cheating and using a computer and then he says the vast majority of them don't do it

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.480
 again which he said is so they're really being noble and realising they've done wrong but

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.200
 presumably they just think oh shit they've got detectives on this one in 2013 there was

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:30.100
 a Bulgarian player called Berislav Ivanov and he was forced into retirement due to a

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.500
 scandal he walked into the arena and they wanted to search him for an electronic device

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.100
 and they said can you take off your shoes and he said no my socks are too smelly so

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.020
 I refuse to take off my shoes and they said right okay well you're disqualified and basically

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.980
 you won't be able to play in any international competitions anymore wow Jesus has he stuck

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:56.480
 with that? He does a play anymore and that's maybe because he has such smelly feet it's

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.800
 possible that he has such smelly feet you know he also I think in that same tournament

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.160
 that he had a few suspicious moments and another one was where a competitor spotted a suspicious

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.920
 bump under his shirt and grabbed it which seems like an incredibly awkward moment if

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.040
 you've got that wrong but said it was indeed an oblong object similar to an mp3 player but

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.800
 then somehow didn't catch it I don't know if you ran away into the crowd or something

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.400
 my torso he said is so smelly that's a...

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.080
 Well that was that story in 1993 at the World Open where there was a guy called John von

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.940
 Newman and he came in and he was playing he was an unrated newcomer and he was wearing

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.900
 headphones the whole time suspicious already and he drew with a grandmaster in this tournament

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.900
 this is an unrated player and everyone kept pointing out that he had a suspicious bulge

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.240
 in one of his pockets which appeared to make soft humming noises and buzzing sounds at

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:56.760
 real pivotal points in the match and so they got him afterwards and said listen we think

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.520
 there's a bit something dodgy going on here and one of the tournament directors quizzed

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.960
 him about chess and it turns out he didn't even have the basic fundamental knowledge

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.040
 of how to play chess when asked the basic questions yeah so he was sent in he had someone

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:16.620
 on the headphones just telling him what to do the knobbly one no not that one no no the

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:23.300
 one with five nubs on the end don't take your finger off it once you touch that I want

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:34.540
 to see the Michael Spicer the man in the other room you tit

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:40.860
 okay it's time for fact number two and that is Andy my fact is that imitators of Harry

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:51.500
 Houdini included Howdyny, Boudini, Houdini, Houdini, Houdini, Houdini, Bernadie and cunning

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:59.440
 the jailbreaker oh my goodness yeah there's a footballer called Troy Dini I wonder if

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.620
 he was originally a Houdini probably probably it's very good in the box that's a Houdini

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:11.780
 joke about him getting out of the box there we go so this is this is from a great article

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.900
 on Gini magazine which is a kind of magic Wikipedia a Wikipedia about magic that is

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.220
 and it's just about all the people who Dini was so successful that just everyone started

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.100
 imitating him there was another guy called Kola who obviously didn't get into the main

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.200
 fact because it doesn't sound enough like Houdini but his his catchphrase was give my

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:36.120
 regards to the chief of police which is just such a great thing to shout as you're escaping

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:43.840
 yeah yeah and often these people would advertise in a way that you would definitely think it

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.960
 was Houdini right yeah so like there was a guy who was called the great Alexander that

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.000
 you would think well that sounds often like Houdini he's fine right but then I saw on

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.500
 wildabouthoudini.com which is like a blog all about Houdini there was a flyer from this

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.580
 guy called the great Alexander and it just said in massive letters Houdini and you would

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.780
 think by walking past that Houdini would be there but it actually if you read the small

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:17.180
 print it said Houdini the great escape artist would be outdone by the great Alexander which

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:23.180
 I think we should give a shout out to wildabouthoudini.com cause it is unbelievable it's made by this

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.640
 guy called John Cox and he's collated I think it must be every single primary source about

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.440
 Houdini ever like every newspaper clipping every diary entry of everyone who ever met

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.600
 him it's so good you can just disappear into it.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.720
 Well it's really nice isn't it because you get the article and often you then have to

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:45.560
 do extra digging but he's he's put the picture of the newspaper where it was originally mentioned

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.400
 like for example Houdini didn't start off as Houdini when he got into the world of of

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.940
 performance he was originally a trapeze artist and he was billed as Eric Prince of the air

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:01.500
 and he you read that but next to it he's tracked down the original citation for it in an advert

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.780
 in a newspaper to show that this existed as a real thing so he's really done his research

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.020
 for the website.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.980
 Yeah he's got the Houdini source of why he left one of his very first jobs as Projea the

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:18.300
 wild man of Mexico or Projea maybe which I think we've mentioned before that he played

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:24.040
 this role and his job was to snarl madly as raw meat was thrown at him and so this is

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.440
 one of his early performance acts and he quit when he ended up being hit in the eye with

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:36.120
 a slab of meat and indeed he recalls this himself there's a 1902 newspaper article what's also

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.240
 great about him is that he wrote prolifically columns for newspapers and he was writing

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.680
 while he was in Berlin for Oktoberfest in fact and he said I couldn't look at my trainer

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.980
 for three weeks because my eyes were closed that caused me to become tame because of this

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.600
 meat slab in the face.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.100
 He had his own magazine.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.100
 Who did Houdini?

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.780
 Houdini had his own magazine called Conjurer's Monthly Magazine and it wasn't explicitly

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.540
 his magazine but if you read any single edition of it you would notice that it was plugging

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:12.020
 Houdini it was writing malicious gossip about other magicians Houdini didn't like and criticising

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.740
 all the people imitating him it only lasts for about a year but yeah.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.920
 He did like to sort of have a go at other magicians because he did find himself constantly having

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.560
 his ideas and his inventions stolen and he desperately wanted to make sure that people

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.080
 couldn't use them but that was really hard because if you were to patent your invention

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.200
 as part of the patent you would need to reveal what the trick was so he could never do that.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.040
 He did get around it slightly there was one loophole that he managed to find which was

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.000
 he had the Chinese water torture cell and that was one that he prized a lot and what

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.180
 he did was he put on a play where that was in the play this act that you would escape

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.860
 but he only put the play on to one person sitting in the audience and then he was able

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.740
 to copyright the act as opposed to patent it so that no one could then do it because

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.740
 it was copyrighted as a play.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.700
 When he died he gave his tricks to his brother didn't he so his brother was also a magician

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.380
 or an escape artist which I didn't know he was called Theo but he went under the name

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.240
 Hardeen which is almost like one of these rip-off names isn't it?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.960
 Yeah in fact it's just about the only sound that is not made by those imitators.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.360
 And when Theo died in 1945 the props went up for sale and they were eventually bought

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.760
 by David Copperfield and they're currently in storage in Las Vegas and the way to get

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.280
 through them they're in a big room that's next door to a sex shop and you have to go

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.060
 through the sex shop to get to the warehouse and there was an interview with Hugh Jackman

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.180
 who'd went to see them and he said that the way you get to this warehouse is that there's

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.540
 a mannequin in the sex shop and you have to press the nipple on the mannequin and when

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.820
 you press the nipple a special door opens and you can go in and see all of Houdini's

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.820
 tricks.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.820
 Oh my god.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.820
 That is so good.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.580
 Would he be happy about that?

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.800
 Those tricks should never, they shouldn't exist really still should they because when Houdini

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.620
 died he gave them to his brother to Hardin and the stipulation was that once his brother

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:17.220
 had died that all of his stuff, all of his magical effects and physical things had to

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.900
 be burnt and destroyed so that's how that was meant to end.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.740
 However Houdini sold a lot of it during his lifetime in the 40s to a guy who was a Houdini

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:31.580
 enthusiast called Sidney Hollis Radner and Radner then put it in a magical museum the

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.040
 Houdini Magical Hall of Fame at Niagara Falls.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.880
 Now in 1995 a fire broke out in the museum and completely destroyed the museum however

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:47.400
 all of Houdini's stuff survived despite the whole building going down so it feels like

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.800
 it doesn't want to disappear, feels like it wants to continue on.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.640
 Who really was escaping all that time?

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.840
 Was it Houdini or his equipment because he escaped a fire?

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.780
 Maybe he was a patsy to them.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.300
 His tricks were quite interesting weren't they?

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.020
 Especially the escaping things.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:12.420
 He escaped from piano boxes, from coffins, from ladders that he was locked to, from glass

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.420
 boxes.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.300
 He once escaped from the belly of a whale.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.300
 Is that living or dead?

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.300
 The whale?

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.300
 It was dead, the dead whale.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.300
 Okay, still good.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.700
 And when he was in Leeds he got into a big barrel of beer.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.180
 You guys read about this one, it's pretty cool.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.420
 It was the Tetley Brewery and they put him in a massive barrel of beer and said okay

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:37.560
 you have to escape but Houdini was teetotal and he became overcome by the alcohol and

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.520
 lost consciousness and had to be hauled out by his assistant.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.240
 That is so good.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240
 Wow.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.960
 He used to do that by the way, there was a level of PR about that where the beer keg in

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.720
 particular would be if it was a town that's centered around a beer industry he would use

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.900
 that as a way of promoting and appealing to everyone there.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.980
 But if you're somewhere that doesn't do beer, let's say he's going to the home of Melton

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:02.980
 Mowberry pork pies.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.300
 Does he have to escape from an enormous pie?

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.220
 You mean the home of Melton Mowberry pork pies?

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.220
 You mean Melton Mowberry?

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.220
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.860
 I had a momentary loss of confidence thinking is that an actual town?

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.720
 But yeah, imagine that because actually the pastry case of a pork pie is technically known

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.180
 as a coffin, isn't it?

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.700
 So he is escaping from a coffin.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.560
 And actually, what you do is you put him in the pie and you put the pie on a conveyor

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:31.920
 belt going towards a massive oven and if he can't escape the pie in time, he'll be cooked.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.480
 He has a connection to the first ever episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.240
 Can you guess what that is?

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.920
 Okay, what did we talk about?

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.960
 We talked about CERN and the - Yeah, Large Hadron Collider.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.320
 Oh, we talked about the Philippa Langley finding Richard III under a car park.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.600
 I cannot believe you guys have not mentioned the most obvious facts from episode one.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.100
 We recorded the whole thing locked inside a cave with 17 catalogues on it, suspended

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.100
 above.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.100
 Yep, that's what I'm talking about.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.100
 That's right.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.780
 Before Andy came here, we had an Andrew Hunter Flurry, an Andrew Hunter Mowry, an Andrew

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.700
 Hunter Flurry.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.340
 Does he have something to do with President Garfield Anus?

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.300
 Yes, he does.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.700
 Did he escape from President Garfield Anus?

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.500
 No, he did not.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.340
 He never went in in the first place.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:25.040
 He was obsessed with murderers, so he bought all this paraphernalia.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.960
 He had this massive collection, and he was obsessed with John Wilkes Booth, who shot

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.800
 Lincoln, of course, and he was also obsessed with Charles Guto, the man who killed President

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.800
 Garfield.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.760
 He bought all of these things to do with him, like his phrenological analysis.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.500
 He was locked in Guto's death row cell and escaped, and that was one of the famous tricks.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.580
 In the process, he freed all the other prisoners on the same death row as him, and apparently

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.740
 he freed them, and then he locked them up again in the wrong cells.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.540
 I've one more thing about Houdini's habits at home, because he and his wife were extremely

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:04.020
 close, not as close as he was with his mother, which is another story for another time.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.460
 When Houdini and his wife had an argument, he would leave, he'd walk around the block,

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.300
 and then he'd come back, and he would open the door of the room where his wife was and

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.820
 throw his hat into the room.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:20.520
 If it was thrown out again, she was still angry, and I guess he would do it again.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.540
 And if the hat remained in the room, she'd come down and they'd go in and resolve it.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.940
 What if the argument was about him leaving his clothes hanging around the house all the

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.700
 time, like a lot of the arguments in my house are about?

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.840
 You keep throwing your things all over the floor.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.380
 He was actually one of the things he was as famous for as his escaping, apparently, and

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.020
 this is according to the Wild About Houdini website, was his needle trick.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.760
 And the East India needle trick involved him basically swallowing a whole load of needles

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.560
 and some thread, and then he'd vomit it all back up again, but the thread would be threaded

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.920
 perfectly through all the needles with a little knot before each one, very impressive, yada-yada-yada.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.700
 But the weird thing about that is, talking of how close he was to his wife, she died

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.920
 in a place called Needles.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.920
 Oh.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.920
 Dun-dun-dun.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920
 Needles, California.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920
 Did he?

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.640
 That is the least spooky thing I've ever heard.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.560
 It's like I spent days searching for a Houdini-based coincidence.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:33.020
 That is the least impressive coincidence since Geoffrey the cat and that mongoose that time.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.520
 I have one last Houdini imitator to mention.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:43.600
 This Houdini impersonator was dubbed Harry Houdini, and it was an orangutan from Borneo

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.760
 who lived in San Diego Zoo and whose real name was Ken Allen.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.480
 That was the name of the orangutan.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.480
 His real name.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.480
 Real name.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.480
 Real name.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.480
 Real name, isn't it?

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.480
 Yeah.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.680
 His real name was something in orangutan language, probably.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.240
 It's what the zoo called him.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.240
 He was called Ken Allen.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.960
 But Ken Allen was quite a famous orangutan, I think.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960
 Very famous.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.960
 Yeah.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.080
 And the fact that he was constantly successfully escaping from his enclosure and no one could

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.320
 work out why.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.600
 So he got, given the name, Harry Houdini, and they eventually had to bring in mountaineer

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.880
 experts to look at the wall to see if it was the crags in the wall that he was somehow

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.680
 gripping onto to getting out.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.840
 And it turns out that that's what it was in the end, and they had to spend $40,000 eliminating

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.880
 all the holes in the wall so that Ken Allen couldn't escape anymore.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:34.680
 And yeah, Time Magazine listed it in 2011 as one of the top 11 zoo escapes of all time.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.280
 And I refuse for this podcast to ever end until we cover the other 10.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:49.480
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:55.080
 My fact this week is that when the gates at Surman Lena Prison in Finland are locked,

00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:01.120
 it's to keep tourists out, not to keep prisoners in.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.680
 This is his prison on an island just off Helsinki, just really near Helsinki.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.440
 And it's an open prison, but I was reading an article in the New Statesman, an article

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.440
 written by Helen Lewis, a journalist who went and visited.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.360
 And she wanted to go and check out the prison because it's quite famous.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.240
 And they'd have to close the gates because tourists keep on wandering to the island,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.520
 which is a tourist destination in its own right and trying to get in.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.680
 So prisoners are allowed to wander out, people are not allowed to wander in, but it's an

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680
 amazing place.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.600
 Finland is one of these places that has lots of open prisons, so it's got 13 open prisons.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:40.400
 I think about a third of their prisoners are in these prisons, and they can do things like

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.720
 they have like therapy horses, and they have saunas, they have their own little houses like

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.120
 huts that are sort of like hostels that they stay in with shared cooking facilities, nice

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.160
 little sitting room with a big widescreen TV.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.360
 You can stay, you can go to the mainland if you want, stay with your family overnight

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.040
 if you ask for permission.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.360
 It's a good sitch.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.800
 And as a result, it has practically no recidivism.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.680
 So it's really interesting because it seems like it's for people often nearing the end

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.660
 of sentences where they might have been in higher security prisons for the early part

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.660
 of their sentence.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.480
 This is a way of slowly acclimatising them to life on the outside.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.920
 So you're not just going straight from maximum big house, you know, 23 hours a day in a room

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.560
 to the open world again, because that's a really juddering change.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.320
 I did read though that, and I'm quoting exactly here, attempts to escape are limited to a

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.080
 few dozen a year, which sounds like a lot to me.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.080
 It does sound like a lot.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.200
 That sounds like an enormous amount.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.300
 I think there are only about 100 prisoners in there, that is a large percentage of them.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:48.360
 In 2013, they had doubled the number of attempted prison escapes in any other country in the

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.360
 world.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.360
 Wow.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.720
 But the idea is why would you try and escape if you're getting towards the end of your

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.360
 time and you know that if you try and escape, then you're going to get put back in the

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.360
 big house again.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.600
 Then that's the idea, right?

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.840
 That's why you would never, in theory, make sense that you would never try and escape.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.840
 Yeah.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.840
 Yeah.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.840
 Yeah.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.920
 Maybe it gets you more time, more jail time in that same place, because that sounds like

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:18.320
 a pretty cushy deal, sadly, I think you get sent back to one of the normal prisons

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320
 if you try and get out.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.760
 So it's not a good plan, but I mean, the conclusion of most people who look into it is that the

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.560
 disadvantages of the odd escapes, not too dangerous prisoner are outweighed by the advantages

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.440
 of the fact that places like Finland and Norway is another one like this have a recidivism

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440
 rate of 20%.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.200
 So only 20% of prisoners after like, I think it's 10 years, end up back in prison, whereas

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.880
 here 75% in the US is 83%.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.880
 Wow.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.920
 So it seems to be working.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.480
 And also there's no challenge in an escape because you literally get given a key to your

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480
 cell.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.480
 Yes.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:58.360
 The Harry Houdini of Finland is not very impressive at all, is he?

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:03.060
 Opens the door, wanders on to the ferry, saves loads of money as well.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.760
 I don't know how our prisons, which are very kind of unpleasant situations, manage to be

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:12.320
 also so expensive, but I think it costs, whereas these ones are quite cheap.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:17.880
 So cost the equivalent of 160 euros a day compared with 205 euros for a closed jail.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.440
 I guess maybe those locks, those locks cost money.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440
 Yeah.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.640
 It'll be tiny things, won't it?

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.400
 Remember that fact James told us about when they took a single olive out of the meals

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.240
 on airplanes that they saved?

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.680
 If you take a single bar out of a prison gate over the year, that actually leads to huge

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.320
 savings.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.320
 We used to have rotating prisons, which I did not know.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.320
 That sounds fun.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320
 Like a carousel.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.320
 It's unbelievable.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.160
 It's basically, there's a central pole and there's a cylinder of cells all the way around

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160
 it.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.920
 And if the warden turns a crank, I've no idea the mechanism that powers this, must have

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.920
 been pretty big.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.920
 The prison rotates and you get locked away.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.720
 You basically don't have a door to escape through once the prison has been rotated.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720
 Oh, that's clever.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.920
 A bit like an escape room.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.320
 It's exactly like an escape room.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.320
 Yeah.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.320
 Yeah.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320
 There are only a couple left.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.720
 It's an old squirrel cage and it's an Iowa and that was three stories tall.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.320
 But that's not a functioning.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.680
 That's now a sort of museum heritage thing, isn't it?

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.080
 There are no rotating prisons currently operating in America.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.080
 Yeah.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.080
 That would be too much like fun.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.320
 Because they were really dangerous.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.220
 The, it was too dangerous for the prisoners as well because let's, well, let's say a fire

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:31.000
 broke out in the prison or if the mechanism broke down and it took ages to fix, you would

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 have people dehydrated, not being able to eat, not being able to escape.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Yeah.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 Absolutely.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.160
 So they eventually had to abandon it.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.640
 I assumed you were saying that people got squished as the rotating happened.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.640
 Well, they did.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640
 Like a revolving door.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.640
 Oh, no.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.640
 Oh, okay.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.840
 Some, your hand could be caught as if it's suddenly, if you were putting your hand outside

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.040
 the bar and they suddenly very quickly rotated it, they were saying that hands would get

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.600
 lobbed off and and arms.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600
 What?

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.600
 Yeah.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.600
 So it was, it was a very dangerous mechanism.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600
 Jesus.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.640
 You just need a recording that you get at the theme parks, keep your hands and arms inside

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.080
 the vehicle slash prison cell at all times and they won't get lopped off.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.080
 Wow.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.080
 Boy.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.000
 Well, that turned horrific very quickly.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.600
 Another very dangerous prison that is also a kind of open prison is this extraordinary

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.920
 place, San Pedro prison in Bolivia.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:29.720
 It's the largest prison in La Paz and it basically is its own town and but sort of not deliberately

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.840
 it's through corruption really.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.000
 So the inmates all have jobs within the prison walls and the only way in which it's now a

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.360
 prison is that it's surrounded by guards who won't let you out, but the inmates all have

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.360
 these jobs.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.360
 They rent accommodation.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.440
 They live in there with their families quite often.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.800
 They get their money mostly from working in the cocaine factory inside the prison and

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:56.120
 then they sell the cocaine to tourists to come and visit the prison and in the nineties,

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.800
 I don't know if any listeners were backpacking in the nineties, but apparently it was a backpacker

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.200
 hotspot.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.440
 It was this unwritten rule that if you went to La Paz, the backpacker, you could get let

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:11.120
 into this prison and hang out in this really quite dangerous environment, just lapping

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.480
 up the local culture and the only reason they cracked down is because they used to offer

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.360
 tours around the prison and the government cracked down on this because they thought

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.240
 the police were big stalking the money from the illegal tours and they had politicians

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.240
 and stuff inside.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.280
 They have elected leaders in the prison who apparently enforce the laws of the community,

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.720
 mainly by stabbing people.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720
 Wow.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.920
 That's like only in the hand or something, you know, you steal an apple, you get stabbed

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.120
 in the hand because you can't just send someone to prison within a prison, I guess.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120
 No.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.120
 No.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.080
 It sounds like you're an advocate for this place, Anna.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.880
 It does a little bit, especially when you said it's where you get the cocaine and then

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.120
 you're like, oh, and this is also the place where you lap up the local culture, which sounded

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.960
 like the most obvious euphemism for drug taking I'd ever heard in my life.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:02.400
 You can lap it up, you can sniff up the local culture, rub the local culture into your gums

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.400
 if you want to.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.800
 It's just, it's the backpacking experience.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.960
 Oh, my word.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.240
 You guys, of course, know Eamon de Valera, the hero of Irish politics, right?

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.680
 Sure, but why don't you just, for the listeners at home, why don't you quickly explain to

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680
 them?

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.680
 Well, just Eamon de Valera, great hero of the Irish independence movement.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:27.520
 He was locked up in, oh, I think it was about 1917 or 18, right?

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.520
 That's right.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.720
 And the story, he escaped, right?

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.880
 But the story of how he escaped is absolutely insane.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.240
 He was in for possibly conspiring with Germany.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.240
 That was the charge.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.520
 So he stole a key from the prison chaplain, impressive.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.400
 He got some candles from the chapel and he pressed the key into the candles, right?

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.640
 So now he's got an impression of the key.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.640
 But the problem is you need someone to make the key, you know, he didn't have the facility

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640
 to do that.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.160
 So metal to pour into the thing, right?

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.160
 Exactly.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.200
 So what they did was, he and a couple of, I think, fellow prisoners, they sent the IRA

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.320
 a Christmas card on which they had got someone to draw a cartoon of a drunk man holding a

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.400
 big key.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:13.760
 And the key that they drew on the card was an exact copy of the impression he had taken

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.960
 from the chaplain's key, right?

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.520
 So basically it was a code saying make a key that looks like this and it'll get me out.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.840
 The guards didn't notice.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.320
 They made the key to the dimensions on the card.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.960
 They sent it inside a cake, genuinely inside a cake.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.960
 Christmas cake.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.960
 Probably.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960
 Probably.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960
 It got through.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.120
 It didn't fit the lock.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.120
 They made it too small.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.160
 As soon as he got out of the cake, he thought, oh, this doesn't fit.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.040
 Did they make it the size of the drawing on the card?

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.880
 Well, they had to do it again.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.200
 They had to send another amusing cartoon this time with a kind of Celtic symbol in the middle

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.200
 of which was a key.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.480
 I was going to say, did they have to wait till next Christmas or did they do it like

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.040
 maybe as a Valentine's card or an Epiphany card?

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.440
 They were like, oh, in Ireland, this is a thing we do every year.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.120
 So then basically they sent the second cartoon.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.760
 They sent it back another key.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.480
 That also did not work.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.680
 So this time it was too big.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.680
 The Goldilocks.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.200
 The Goldilocks key is coming up.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200
 Very nice.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.040
 Eventually they just sent a third cake to the prison and inside that cake was just a blank

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:30.280
 key and a set of files saying, "Make your own bloody key" and it worked.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:35.640
 Just one weird thing on prison, like living within a prison, is that women don't have

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.400
 to wear prison issue clothing in British jails and men do.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.960
 And that's been the case since 1971 and it's because research finds that people had

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.880
 heard of the rules better if they're not actually wearing uniform.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.880
 And I think the idea is that it sort of humanises you and it's like, I'm more willing to obey

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.880
 the rules.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:59.080
 In America, famously quite strict penal system, the inmates often do have to wear orange.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.640
 Or in fact, when oranges, the new black came out, some prisons stopped their female inmates

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.440
 from wearing orange and made them go back to stripes because orange had become cool.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.440
 Really?

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.400
 Not allowed to be cool.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.360
 There is, in Norway as well, at the Bastøy rehabilitation centre, I don't know if it's

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.680
 the pronunciation of that, it's got an O with a line through it.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.680
 Bastøy.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.680
 I think it is.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680
 Bastøy.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.360
 They have a similar thing where the guards don't wear uniforms and they don't wear uniforms

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:31.840
 because they say they don't want to create sort of unnecessary division between them and

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.720
 the prisoners there, who they don't call prisoners, they call residents, because it just feels

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720
 more friendly.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:43.000
 It feels like a cool dad, really, in that prison, just trying a bit too hard.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.480
 Speaking of words that begin with B-A-S-T, as we just learned, that your Bastøy place

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.480
 or whatever it was.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.800
 Segway incoming.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.920
 The place in Finland, which is called Suomenlinna, is it, Anna?

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.920
 Suomenlinna.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.560
 Yeah, Suomenlinna.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.120
 That is, like you said, a famous tourist attraction and it's because it's a bastion

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.120
 fort.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.120
 It's a bastion fort.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.120
 You guys might have seen these.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.120
 It's where you have a fortress, but instead of being a normal castle, it's in a star

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.120
 shape.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120
 Have you ever seen those?

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.680
 You get them around Europe, don't you?

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.440
 Do you know why you have star-shaped castles or why you used to have star-shaped castles?

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.000
 Is it something defensive?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.360
 Is it to confuse aeroplanes because they'll look at the castle and think that that's up

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.360
 because it's a star, so they'll fly in the opposite direction?

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360
 Brilliant.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360
 Brilliant.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360
 That's such a good idea.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:37.720
 Oh, my God, that's so genius, but no, it was a time before playing some PogChalli.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.720
 OK.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.800
 But Andy was pretty much there.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.720
 So basically, it was in a time of cannonballs.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.960
 And if you fire a cannonball at a normal castle, it's going to hit the wall and it might make

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.440
 some damage.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.960
 But if you fire the cannonball at a surface which is not straight on, which is not perpendicular,

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.160
 it's actually slightly slanted, then the cannonball might just kind of hit the edge of it and skid

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.480
 off the side of it.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.280
 And so the idea was to make these star-shaped forts where if anyone was firing cannons at

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.480
 you, then it wouldn't initially do as much damage.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.480
 So that's why they have it.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.480
 So clever.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.480
 So clever.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.760
 Is that a thing called, I want to say a ravelin, or it might be connected to a ravelin?

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.900
 I think it is that, yeah.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.400
 I remember reading that word while I was reading this fact, but yeah.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.760
 Because I went to one of them in Kronborg when we were all on tour in Denmark.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:29.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.320
 Kronborg, which is the setting for Hamlet.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.920
 And they have got these star-shaped fortifications outside and it makes it, yeah, as James said.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.800
 And that's a ravelin, useless as for a javelin at a ravelin, right?

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.800
 Yeah.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.800
 That's the same.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.800
 That's the catchphrase.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.800
 They got that painted above the gates.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:58.680
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:04.280
 My fact this week is that one of Hawaii's biggest annual festivals is devoted entirely

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.680
 to spam.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.680
 That's spam the food.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:14.640
 So when they invite you to the spam festival, do they send you 5,000 emails telling you

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.520
 it's on every year?

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.480
 Extend your penis at the Hawaii Spam Festival.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.320
 Yeah, I love this fact.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.920
 It was given to me in a conversation I had with a mutual friend of ours, Jason Haseley.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.640
 We were chatting about it and he said, by the way, did you know that they have the Waikiki

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.440
 Spam Jam, which is this annual spam festival that takes place in Hawaii.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.440
 And it is a massively popular festival there.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.440
 35,000 people attend according to their website.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.600
 They have live bands playing.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.600
 They have merch.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.560
 You can get spam t-shirts, shorts, slippers.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560
 They have craft boots.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.560
 Can I just check?

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.040
 Sorry, the t-shirt, shorts, and slippers, they're not all made of spam, are they?

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.800
 No, they just feature a picture of spam, I'm guessing.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.480
 Right, because that would be absolutely disgusting and not survive a wash.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.200
 I've got to say, Dan, when you sent round this fact, I thought that it was a massive

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:13.360
 exaggeration and I've been to Hawaii and they have lots of festivals all the time.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.280
 And I was like, there's no way that the spam one is one of the biggest, which is what you

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.920
 say, but it so is.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.520
 It's absolutely huge.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.160
 Yeah, and they are obsessed.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.320
 Hawaii is obsessed with spam and they have spam in places that I've never heard of or

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.320
 dreamt of thinking they would appear.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.280
 Okay, I need to get into personal details.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.960
 Well, okay, maybe I'll dig that up too much, but you know, McDonald's has spam burgers

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.440
 and so does Burger King.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.720
 They have a spam burger and yeah, you can get them in all the local dishes.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.880
 Everything spam is just integrated all over Hawaii.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:52.320
 I think the most common way in Hawaii that it's served is quite nice because it's a

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:58.160
 sushi spam and that's kind of a nod to they've got a big Japanese population actually.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.360
 And also, I think it's quite nice because Hawaii obviously has quite a difficult history

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:07.040
 with Japan and now they serve spam sushi and it's spam on top of sushi rice wrapped in

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.280
 seaweed and it's called Spam Musubi and that's where you'll usually sit.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:17.320
 I think the reason that spam is so popular not just in Hawaii but also throughout the

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:21.400
 whole of the Pacific is due to the war, isn't it?

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:26.640
 It's due to the Second World War because basically the Japanese soldiers took over a lot of these

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.120
 islands and the people, whenever they grew food, they had to give it to the Japanese soldiers

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.320
 and they were forced to do all this stuff.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.240
 And then when the Americans came and sort of liberated them, they didn't have any food.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.000
 They were just kind of searching for any kind of food they could eat but the American soldiers

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.360
 had tons of this stuff like they had spam coming out of their ears, the American soldiers

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.040
 during the Second World War, so they gave it to the locals and that's where the kind

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.680
 of love of spam came from.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.200
 Yeah, I listened to a podcast all about spam which was great.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.680
 It's actually the Business Insider podcast.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.920
 It's called Brought to You By and it's about the kind of the stories behind big old brands.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.920
 And anyway, it was like places that have had a US military presence around that time because

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:14.080
 spam was just kind of taking off and places that have rice-based dishes because apparently

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.720
 it goes very well with rice and then places with very hot climates because it's canned

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.040
 and so it's like a canned meat that you don't even need to put in the fridge.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.720
 So it's like Korea, Guam, the Philippines, it's massive.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:33.600
 The founder was a man called Hormel and the firm that still makes it is called Hormel.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.920
 So his son took over the family firm J. Hormel and he was interviewed by the New Yorker in

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:44.400
 1945 just as the war was ending and he said that there was a file called the Scurrilous

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.960
 File which contained hundreds of letters of abuse sent to him by soldiers all over the

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.840
 world saying, "I have to eat this spam and it's disgusting," right?

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.960
 And he said in this interview, "Maybe the verb 'to spam' will come out of this war.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:04.040
 Something would surprise me anymore," i.e. he was saying that sending random letters

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.760
 or communications to someone who hasn't asked for it is to spam.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:13.760
 Now that is not where the word spam as a verb for email comes from, but it is an earlier

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.840
 link between the two concepts.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.840
 Isn't that weird?

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.840
 That's so good.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.840
 That is so good.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.960
 We should say what the sort of received acknowledged fact of where it comes from is which is it

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:28.680
 was a Monty Python sketch where Terry Jones was running a restaurant where the only thing

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:35.280
 that you could have was spam and would you like spam, spam, spam, it was always different.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.080
 And that's where the people who gave it its name took it from that.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.080
 But I think you're right, Andy.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.280
 I think that's more of a direct...

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280
 Is that weird?

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280
 Yeah.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280
 Yeah.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280
 Yeah.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280
 Be cool.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.280
 Monty Python's sort of ruined spam for a while.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.480
 For a while, Hallwell was really angry about it.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480
 Just getting popular again.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.840
 I think people hated it in the Second World War and then they started to enjoy it in the

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.840
 '40s and '50s.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:03.880
 There were these spam girls, weren't there, these Hallwell girls who the company employed

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.240
 and they were a band.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.440
 They were this musical group and they were worried because after World War II, 90% of

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.360
 sales had been to the army and they thought, oh my God, we're going to stop selling it.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.600
 And so the Hallwell girls traveled around the U.S. in 35 white Chevy's doing sort of

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.000
 singing, dancing, parades.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.200
 They had their own radio show and sales shot up.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.700
 They made spam cool.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:29.640
 They were known as the Spamettes, sometimes this band.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.640
 Nice.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:37.360
 And they were all dressed in like soldiers, not soldiers uniform, but like soldiers band

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.360
 uniform, weren't they?

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:43.080
 And it was kind of to remind you of the wartime effort, really.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.280
 Yeah.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.320
 But then also, Hallwell sold chili con carne.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.080
 So he saw this thing with the Hallwell girls, working so well in America.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.240
 So he thought, okay, I'm going to try and do it with chili con carne.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:01.660
 So he created a mariachi band, which went round Mexico, trying to sell Hallwell chili

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.660
 con carne.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.660
 How did that go?

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.460
 It sounds like it was less successful.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.580
 It was less successful.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.660
 Hormel's grandson was also in the arts.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:11.660
 He still is.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.820
 He's a guitarist and we all will have heard his work.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:19.220
 He's called Smoky Hormel and Smoky is his birth name.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.220
 That's not a nickname.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.220
 He was called Smoky.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:26.740
 It sounds like the company was too used to naming hams by that point.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.280
 And he's a he's a guitarist.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:35.600
 He plays blues and country, but he also appears on albums by Adele and by Beck and by, yeah,

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600
 Mick Jagger.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:42.560
 And he's the main guitarist on what was Johnny Cash's big final major hit, Hurt, the Nine

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:48.160
 Itch Nails cover, Kid Rock, Joe Strummer, I mean, he's done them all.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.260
 Hormel have a new innovation.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:54.860
 They've got a thing that they've just announced this October.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:00.540
 It's bacon scented face masks in a very 2020 story.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:01.820
 They say it has...

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.460
 Is that to wear when you're asleep?

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:07.740
 No, it's to wear when you're going out and about and you want to smell bacon constantly.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.940
 Not like a face mask that covers your eyes.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.940
 Not a sleep mask.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.100
 I mean, a COVID face mask.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.180
 You've been going around in these COVID times just wearing a sleep mask.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:18.180
 It's terrible.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.180
 I keep walking into people.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:25.120
 How are you supposed to keep two meters away from people when you can't even see them?

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:30.480
 Because I was thinking like a sleep mask that smells of bacon is completely pointless because

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.200
 the smell of bacon famously wakes you up, doesn't it?

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:39.000
 Oh, no, this is a this is a thing that they claim it has, and I'm quoting here, the latest

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.920
 in pork scented technology.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:46.080
 I don't know what the last thing in pork scented technology was, but it says keep the delicious

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.100
 smell of bacon always wrapped around your nose.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.100
 Not sure.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:58.420
 You can get a Spamurita along a similar vein, which is a Spam flavoured cocktail and Soho

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.220
 here in this very capital.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.220
 Wow.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.220
 Yeah.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:08.100
 Get it a Jinju Korean restaurant in Soho and it's made of tequila, mezcal, agave nectar,

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.700
 pineapple and fresh lime.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:14.860
 Sounds absolutely delicious until you add the Spam.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.560
 One more member of the Hormel family, which we'll talk about a few minutes ago, is James

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:24.760
 Hormel, and he is the main donor of the Hormel Center of San Francisco Public Library, which

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:32.680
 collects all the importance of LGBTQ books from the last 20, 30, 40 years of American

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.680
 history.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:39.200
 And he also was the first openly gay man to represent the U.S. as an ambassador.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:46.220
 So this was under Clinton's administration, and they needed a new ambassador for Luxembourg,

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.220
 and they chose this guy.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.020
 James Hormel obviously done a lot of philanthropy and stuff, and so he's a really good person

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:55.020
 to have to do this, but the Republicans were just not having it.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:00.300
 They were like, we cannot have an openly gay man representing the United States as an ambassador.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.660
 So there's a massive, massive argument.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:09.160
 And to support their argument, the Republicans went to the Hormel Library and then looked

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:14.380
 through all of their history and then found a load of what they regarded as very pornographic

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.620
 things.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.300
 And they said, look, this man supports pornography.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.140
 He shouldn't be representing the United States.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.640
 And it got really, really high up this argument until it was pointed out that all of the works

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:31.840
 that they pointed out were in his library, were also in the Library of Congress.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.840
 And then he became--

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:33.840
 In your face.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.840
 Yeah.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.840
 Spam on your face.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:42.240
 Have you heard of Mark Benson?

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.240
 No.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.000
 Andy, you don't mean Mark Benson, do you?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 I do.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.520
 Give it his full name.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.400
 Mark, I love spam, Benson.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:59.560
 And we're going from one grateful anthropist to another here out there.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560
 Absolutely.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.560
 Absolutely.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:05.080
 And what links them, a single can of spam?

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.120
 This is a spam lover called Mark Benson.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.120
 He's from the UK.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:16.040
 And in 2017, he and his wife went to the festival in T-shirt saying, "Mr and Mrs, I love spam

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.040
 Benson."

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.280
 So his wife's on it too.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.280
 And he has changed his name.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.280
 So this is the Hawaiian festival they went to.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280
 Yeah.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280
 Yes, they did.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.280
 Wow.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:29.320
 And not only that, and not only has he legally changed his middle name to I Love Spam.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.320
 But they went--

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.320
 I think if Mark Benson really likes spam, he changes first name to I Love Spam.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.520
 Actually, I think you can hide your middle name, can't you?

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.000
 That's a good point.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.480
 I mean, he does have a T-shirt saying his name.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.560
 He's not gone very far to hide it.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.960
 But they went to Hawaii after they went to the Spam Museum, which is-- where's that?

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.960
 Is it Minnesota?

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.960
 It's at the headquarters.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:53.960
 They call it the--

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:54.960
 Yes.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.960
 They call it the Guggenham.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:56.960
 Very clever.

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.080
 But they went to the museum and they got married there.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.840
 They got married at the Spam Museum.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:08.000
 Spam's brand manager got themselves ordained in order to officiate at this wedding.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 So--

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 So good.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 It's the most spam-themed wedding ever.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 So good.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.040
 You are now spam in life.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.040
 What on earth?

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:22.960
 He said, you know why he said he changed-- he loves Spam so much, or he said he changed

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:29.120
 his name as a tribute to Spam to his grandpa who worked in the Spam factory in Liverpool

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.840
 and to the war effort.

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.840
 OK.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.840
 Quite right.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.220
 It's one way to remember the war, I think.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.760
 That museum that's-- oh, go on, Andy.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.760
 You about to say something.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.480
 Well, they've got some lovely children as well.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.680
 So we know at least they didn't need a Spam donor.

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680
 OK.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.760
 I'm glad I let you talk there.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:53.000
 That museum is in Austin in Minnesota and it sounds quite interesting.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.920
 They have volunteer guides that are known as Spambaciders and they walk around the Spam

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:05.400
 Museum with little bits of Spam on toothpicks, which they call Spumples.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.120
 Oh, my gosh.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.600
 Did you guys hear about the 1990s Spam carving contest in Seattle?

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.600
 No.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.600
 This was amazing.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:18.160
 It ran for 10 years before being shut down, or maybe people lost interest, I don't know.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.960
 But you were given two cans of Spam, one plastic knife and 15 minutes, right?

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.440
 You were allowed to bring your own extra tools if you wanted to, but power tools and chainsaws

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.400
 were explicitly banned by your--

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.400
 Sorry.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:34.440
 Two cans of Spam and you might want to use power tools.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.040
 Well, you're absolutely right.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.320
 You would have gone on very well with the organizers, James, because they said that's overkill.

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.040
 Well, sometimes it's hard to open those tins, isn't it?

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.800
 So you might need a sort of pneumatic drill to get in there.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.040
 I think they're ringpools, aren't they?

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.040
 They are ringpools.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.040
 They are ringpools.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.040
 Yeah.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.040
 I'm looking at them upside down.

00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:00.240
 But there were so many good sounding winners.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.240
 In 1994, the winner was Nude Descending a Staircase.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.880
 So I'm going to carve that in Spam in a quarter of an hour.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:10.040
 Are you sure that wasn't just a description of the person who'd won?

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:16.240
 I've not done a very good sculpture, but I am Nude and I am walking down the staircase.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:23.640
 Other winners included Jurassic Pork, Spamhenge, very good, and my favorite, a model of singer

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:27.440
 Spammy Winnet singing Spam by Your Man.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.440
 Okay, that's it.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.440
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.940
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:37.080
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.280
 the course of this podcast, we can all be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:45.880
 I'm on @Shriberland, James, @JamesHarken, Andy, @AndrewHunterM, and Anna.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880
 Yep.

 Well, you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or our website.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.600
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.240
 All of our previous episodes are up there.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.800
 Bits of merchandise are up there as well.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.800
 Go check it out.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.600
 Anyway, we'll be back again next week.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.440
 We'll see you then with another episode.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.280
 Goodbye.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.280
 Bye.
