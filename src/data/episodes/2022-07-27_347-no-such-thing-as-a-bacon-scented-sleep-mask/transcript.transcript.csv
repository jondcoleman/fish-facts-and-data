00:00:00,00:00:19,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:27,00:00:31,and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite
00:00:31,00:00:37,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one and that is James."""
00:00:40,00:00:47,Okay my fact this week is that in 1978 chess player Victor Kochnoy accused Anatoly Karpov
00:00:47,00:00:53,of cheating using an elaborate yoghurt based code.
00:00:53,00:00:57,Was it an elaborate yoghurt or an elaborate code?
00:00:57,00:01:02,I actually added that word elaborate to kind of make it feel a bit better than it actually
00:01:02,00:01:03,is.
00:01:03,00:01:06,"No it isn't elaborate yoghurt, it was blueberry wasn't it?"
00:01:06,00:01:08,How basic are the yoghurt's that you're using today?
00:01:08,00:01:10,You think blueberry is elaborate.
00:01:10,00:01:13,Anything about standard Greek is elaborate.
00:01:13,00:01:17,I've read some places that it's blueberry but some places that it might be the even
00:01:17,00:01:19,more elaborate bilberry yoghurt.
00:01:19,00:01:22,Okay that actually that really is top tier.
00:01:22,00:01:27,But basically what had happened was we'll get onto everything that was happening around
00:01:27,00:01:32,there at the time because it was an extremely controversial match but Karpov was just playing
00:01:32,00:01:35,chess and then suddenly someone brought him a yoghurt and no one knew that they were going
00:01:35,00:01:36,to bring a yoghurt.
00:01:36,00:01:41,Normally you would have your snacks at very specific times but suddenly they just brought
00:01:41,00:01:45,him this blueberry or blueberry yoghurt and then he made a really good move and Kochnoy
00:01:45,00:01:51,who for various reasons was quite suspicious thought that this must have been a code and
00:01:51,00:01:56,whatever the flavour of the yoghurt was going to be that was telling him what kind of move
00:01:56,00:01:57,he had to make.
00:01:57,00:02:03,And then Kochnoy later on he did say that it was a joke and he was trying to parody
00:02:03,00:02:08,the fact that people are always blaming each other of cheating but the truth is that he
00:02:08,00:02:12,"definitely did make the accusation, the officials took it seriously and they changed the rules"
00:02:12,00:02:17,to say that everyone had to decide what snacks they were going to have before the game started
00:02:17,00:02:21,and they had to have them at certain times so.
00:02:21,00:02:26,"So it's not the idea that maybe he wrote something in the yoghurt, in Bill Briggs."
00:02:26,00:02:33,"Oh if you drizzle it in in honey, that would be clever."
00:02:33,00:02:39,So basically this was 1978 this guy Kochnoy he's a great great chess player possibly the
00:02:39,00:02:45,best chess player never to become world champion but he had defected from the Soviet Union
00:02:45,00:02:50,and the reason he defected is because the Soviets had decided to give other people a
00:02:50,00:02:55,chance as their main challengers and not let him do it so he decided fuck this I'm getting
00:02:55,00:03:00,out of there and so he went to live in Europe eventually in Switzerland but because he was
00:03:00,00:03:06,so good he was still like the main challenger to Karpov and so they had this game but the
00:03:06,00:03:12,Soviets were trying every trick in the book to stop him from winning so at first they
00:03:12,00:03:15,said that he wasn't allowed to take place because he didn't have a state as in he wasn't
00:03:15,00:03:21,Soviet anymore he wasn't Swiss yet he didn't have a country and then when eventually the
00:03:21,00:03:25,chess authority said well you know he has he's the best he just beaten a guy called
00:03:25,00:03:30,Petrosian who was previously thought to be the best so they thought okay well he's got
00:03:30,00:03:35,to take part but the Moscow newspapers refused to name him they just called him the opponent
00:03:35,00:03:39,or the challenger they wouldn't say what he was called and his family was still in the
00:03:39,00:03:44,Soviet Union and the Soviet authorities refused to let them leave so they kind of kept them
00:03:44,00:03:49,hostage because they were so upset about this guy who defected and was possibly about to
00:03:49,00:03:50,become the world champion.
00:03:50,00:03:51,Wow.
00:03:51,00:03:52,God.
00:03:52,00:03:56,So with the family pissed off when he was just lounging around eating blueberry yoghurt
00:03:56,00:04:01,mid-match that's a bit casual for someone whose family's got a gun held at them.
00:04:01,00:04:07,Yeah no I see that point I see that point but he thought that possibly I think that by becoming
00:04:07,00:04:11,the world champion they wouldn't be able to get at him because he'd be world famous you
00:04:11,00:04:12,know.
00:04:12,00:04:13,Yes.
00:04:13,00:04:16,There were other the match had other accusations as well didn't it so Korshnoi brought his
00:04:16,00:04:20,own personal chair which he'd like to play chess in fair enough you're sitting down for
00:04:20,00:04:25,several hours you want to be comfortable but Karpov's team they were the ones who were
00:04:25,00:04:29,suspicious now and they requested the chair be dismantled an x-rayed.
00:04:29,00:04:30,Wow.
00:04:30,00:04:31,Really?
00:04:31,00:04:32,Yeah.
00:04:32,00:04:33,What would be expected to find in there you wonder.
00:04:33,00:04:34,An extra chess piece?
00:04:34,00:04:36,Oh it doesn't work like Monopoly does it?
00:04:36,00:04:38,You can't just bring an extra bishop on them.
00:04:38,00:04:43,Theoretically if no one noticed you could accidentally drop an extra bishop on there.
00:04:43,00:04:49,I'm sure I took both your bishops no you're misremembering it yeah no you only took one.
00:04:49,00:04:53,But this one is a it's a different design to the other bishops from afar.
00:04:53,00:04:59,Well it looks like a bit of a chair leg to be honest the paranoia looking into this of
00:04:59,00:05:04,chess players and what they must go through I mean if you were playing a game it feels
00:05:04,00:05:08,like half the game is just looking out for ways in which the other player is cheating.
00:05:08,00:05:12,There's a yogurt there's a man standing over there there's a chair like you know which
00:05:12,00:05:14,one of these are giving him the details.
00:05:14,00:05:17,The man standing over there is a really good one are you talking about the French team
00:05:17,00:05:18,in 2012.
00:05:18,00:05:20,Yes that's right yeah.
00:05:20,00:05:24,2012 there's an Olympiad in Russia and there were accusations that the French team were
00:05:24,00:05:29,managing to get the messages to the actual player and by standing in pre-arranged spots
00:05:29,00:05:34,behind the board so I'm not sure of the exact code but it's like if I'm standing over here
00:05:34,00:05:37,then use your knight or if I'm standing over here there's a great move that you can't
00:05:37,00:05:38,see in Russia or whatever.
00:05:38,00:05:42,Did they not all stand in the exact order of which the chess pieces are on the board?
00:05:42,00:05:45,Or you don't know if they were on a horse.
00:05:45,00:05:50,Yeah one of them had a little mitre that would be really fun one of them is really poor and
00:05:50,00:05:55,is why is your manager only walking diagonally just for a while?
00:05:55,00:05:58,Why is the queen here?
00:05:58,00:05:59,And they never proved that did they?
00:05:59,00:06:03,They often don't sort of prove it so that's still an accusation we should say.
00:06:03,00:06:07,I don't think the French team were found guilty of doing that but it does make you think is
00:06:07,00:06:14,it not after a point easier to just play the game well than to memorise this very presumably
00:06:14,00:06:17,quite complicated code of standing formations?
00:06:17,00:06:22,The problem is that computers are better than humans now right and so if you can somehow
00:06:22,00:06:26,get a computer to tell you what to do then you're going to be able to be even the best
00:06:26,00:06:32,human and so that's why cheating now is even more of a problem than it ever has been before.
00:06:32,00:06:35,So I listened to a more or less podcast the radio foreshad more or less and they interviewed
00:06:35,00:06:41,the head of research at chess.com who was saying it's so it's quite interesting now
00:06:41,00:06:46,spotting cheaters who are cheating with computers because computers play in a completely different
00:06:46,00:06:50,way to people so he was acting like anyone could tell the difference straight away which
00:06:50,00:06:54,I imagine we couldn't but he was saying you know you can tell after a few moves if someone
00:06:54,00:07:00,is suddenly using a computer and the key difference is that computers don't plan they don't have
00:07:00,00:07:06,a memory of the move that preceded and they don't have a long term strategy and so when
00:07:06,00:07:11,it comes to a move they act like they've never ever seen the board before and they just do
00:07:11,00:07:15,what's the exactly perfect move for that moment whereas human beings we have a plan and then
00:07:15,00:07:21,we want to stick to it even if sometimes circumstances happen that mess with the plan.
00:07:21,00:07:25,So for instance it's very unusual for a human to willingly take back a move in chess because
00:07:25,00:07:29,if you've made a move you don't want to attract it a computer got no compunction about that
00:07:29,00:07:33,just do it when it wants to when it sees it's the best move.
00:07:33,00:07:38,The thing about retracting your moves with computers that's like where you almost go
00:07:38,00:07:44,back to your previous position right because the retracting moves that you or I might have
00:07:44,00:07:49,a problem with if we were playing chess would be if I moved my knight to a place and then
00:07:49,00:07:54,I took my finger off it and then I go no no I want to take that back.
00:07:54,00:07:59,And that actually did happen with the one of the greatest chess players of all time
00:07:59,00:08:04,"which was Kasparov, Gary Kasparov when he was playing against a woman called Judith"
00:08:04,00:08:10,Polgar and she is probably the greatest female she almost definitely is the greatest female
00:08:10,00:08:15,chess player that's ever played and if she'd have beaten Kasparov in this game it would
00:08:15,00:08:19,have been the first time that a woman had ever beaten a world champion in a game of
00:08:19,00:08:24,chess and he moved his knight into what would be a bad position and then he took his face
00:08:24,00:08:28,off it and he went no no I didn't take my finger off it and he put it back and then
00:08:28,00:08:32,he ended up I'm not sure if he won or tied the game eventually she carried on she became
00:08:32,00:08:37,the 10th best player in the entire world anyway but that could have been such a big moment
00:08:37,00:08:42,of the first woman beating a grandmaster but yeah did you guys read about her Judith Polgar
00:08:42,00:08:50,she's amazing so no she was her father was called Lashlo Polgar and he had three daughters
00:08:50,00:08:54,and he trained them all to be chess players and it's one of those stories which kind
00:08:54,00:08:59,of half sounds a little bit like you know he's really forcing them to do this and it's
00:08:59,00:09:03,quite bad but then on the other hand they all loved it and whenever you interview them
00:09:03,00:09:06,they were all like oh this is what brought our family together we all absolutely loved
00:09:06,00:09:14,"it and so his daughters Sousa, Sophia and Judith all became grandmasters eventually"
00:09:14,00:09:19,Judith could beat her father by the time she was five years old at 15 she was the youngest
00:09:19,00:09:24,person male or female to be awarded a grandmaster title and then eventually she played against
00:09:24,00:09:28,Kasparov and should have beaten him but wasn't allowed to because of that and there was a
00:09:28,00:09:33,great interview with Sousa when they asked her about playing against men and she said
00:09:33,00:09:37,that she'd won loads of matches but she'd never won against a healthy man after every
00:09:37,00:09:42,game there was always an excuse I had a headache I had stomach ache there was always something
00:09:42,00:09:48,well I think that's a bit eggs in one basket training all three daughters to play chess
00:09:48,00:09:53,"if it was up to me I would train one to play chess, one to play drafts and one to play"
00:09:53,00:09:57,snakes and ladders and I would hope that one of them in the field would become the world
00:09:57,00:10:01,champion yeah the problem with snakes and ladders is it is literally all down to luck
00:10:01,00:10:05,of the dice isn't it there's literally no strategy there at all a lot of a lot of people
00:10:05,00:10:10,say that it's just luck and there's no strategy but I would say actually I do remember when
00:10:10,00:10:14,I played against you there's that guy stood in the corner with a ladder in front of him
00:10:14,00:10:21,don't you say that about snakes and ladders I was reading this article that really annoyed
00:10:21,00:10:25,me because what you've said so about cheating and games it was in the LA Times it was about
00:10:25,00:10:30,whether you should let your kids cheat in board games and it was written by this guy
00:10:30,00:10:34,who's four-year-old daughter cheats at snakes and ladders by like climbing up the snakes
00:10:34,00:10:39,or jumping forward to the ladder and the gist of the article was you should let kids cheat
00:10:39,00:10:44,because they don't really get a sense of fairness and ethics so they're seven or eight and before
00:10:44,00:10:49,that they're just developing their creativity but the question was framed at the top as
00:10:49,00:10:53,you know you're playing snakes and ladders she's cheating do you insist that your children
00:10:53,00:10:58,play by the rules and then trounce them every single time or do you let them cheat and I
00:10:58,00:11:02,was like snakes and ladders is the one game where a five-year-old does have a chance of
00:11:02,00:11:08,beating you it sounds like the dad is cheating all the time that's why I never let my little
00:11:08,00:11:12,sister play me at snakes and ladders because she would have a chance of beating me actually
00:11:12,00:11:21,I'm like no we're going bowling so we're doing the test your strength machine again
00:11:21,00:11:27,that was until she was about seven years old chest.com they have chest detectives which
00:11:27,00:11:33,I love so they've got six chest detectives and I didn't realise how big chest.com is
00:11:33,00:11:38,I mean it's absolutely massive this global site since March the number of accounts they
00:11:38,00:11:44,"have closed for cheating specifically is 85,000 now obviously that might be some people setting"
00:11:44,00:11:49,up new accounts after the first time but that is a lot of people cheating around the world
00:11:49,00:11:55,well apparently it's 30% of chest masters again according to this exactly the people
00:11:55,00:11:59,you'd thought should really be a profit but they quite often play matches on there for
00:11:59,00:12:05,money or tournaments and 30% of them he says he's had to give a warning to and he says
00:12:05,00:12:09,there's a system where you give them one warning and you say our computers have seen that you're
00:12:09,00:12:14,cheating and using a computer and then he says the vast majority of them don't do it
00:12:14,00:12:18,again which he said is so they're really being noble and realising they've done wrong but
00:12:18,00:12:23,presumably they just think oh shit they've got detectives on this one in 2013 there was
00:12:23,00:12:30,a Bulgarian player called Berislav Ivanov and he was forced into retirement due to a
00:12:30,00:12:35,scandal he walked into the arena and they wanted to search him for an electronic device
00:12:35,00:12:40,and they said can you take off your shoes and he said no my socks are too smelly so
00:12:40,00:12:45,I refuse to take off my shoes and they said right okay well you're disqualified and basically
00:12:45,00:12:49,you won't be able to play in any international competitions anymore wow Jesus has he stuck
00:12:49,00:12:56,with that? He does a play anymore and that's maybe because he has such smelly feet it's
00:12:56,00:13:00,possible that he has such smelly feet you know he also I think in that same tournament
00:13:00,00:13:05,that he had a few suspicious moments and another one was where a competitor spotted a suspicious
00:13:05,00:13:09,bump under his shirt and grabbed it which seems like an incredibly awkward moment if
00:13:09,00:13:15,you've got that wrong but said it was indeed an oblong object similar to an mp3 player but
00:13:15,00:13:18,then somehow didn't catch it I don't know if you ran away into the crowd or something
00:13:18,00:13:24,my torso he said is so smelly that's a...
00:13:24,00:13:30,Well that was that story in 1993 at the World Open where there was a guy called John von
00:13:30,00:13:35,Newman and he came in and he was playing he was an unrated newcomer and he was wearing
00:13:35,00:13:40,headphones the whole time suspicious already and he drew with a grandmaster in this tournament
00:13:40,00:13:45,this is an unrated player and everyone kept pointing out that he had a suspicious bulge
00:13:45,00:13:50,in one of his pockets which appeared to make soft humming noises and buzzing sounds at
00:13:50,00:13:56,real pivotal points in the match and so they got him afterwards and said listen we think
00:13:56,00:14:00,there's a bit something dodgy going on here and one of the tournament directors quizzed
00:14:00,00:14:05,him about chess and it turns out he didn't even have the basic fundamental knowledge
00:14:05,00:14:11,of how to play chess when asked the basic questions yeah so he was sent in he had someone
00:14:11,00:14:16,on the headphones just telling him what to do the knobbly one no not that one no no the
00:14:16,00:14:23,one with five nubs on the end don't take your finger off it once you touch that I want
00:14:23,00:14:34,to see the Michael Spicer the man in the other room you tit
00:14:34,00:14:40,okay it's time for fact number two and that is Andy my fact is that imitators of Harry
00:14:40,00:14:51,"Houdini included Howdyny, Boudini, Houdini, Houdini, Houdini, Houdini, Bernadie and cunning"
00:14:51,00:14:59,the jailbreaker oh my goodness yeah there's a footballer called Troy Dini I wonder if
00:14:59,00:15:05,he was originally a Houdini probably probably it's very good in the box that's a Houdini
00:15:05,00:15:11,joke about him getting out of the box there we go so this is this is from a great article
00:15:11,00:15:16,on Gini magazine which is a kind of magic Wikipedia a Wikipedia about magic that is
00:15:16,00:15:21,and it's just about all the people who Dini was so successful that just everyone started
00:15:21,00:15:25,imitating him there was another guy called Kola who obviously didn't get into the main
00:15:25,00:15:30,fact because it doesn't sound enough like Houdini but his his catchphrase was give my
00:15:30,00:15:36,regards to the chief of police which is just such a great thing to shout as you're escaping
00:15:36,00:15:43,yeah yeah and often these people would advertise in a way that you would definitely think it
00:15:43,00:15:48,was Houdini right yeah so like there was a guy who was called the great Alexander that
00:15:48,00:15:54,you would think well that sounds often like Houdini he's fine right but then I saw on
00:15:54,00:15:59,wildabouthoudini.com which is like a blog all about Houdini there was a flyer from this
00:15:59,00:16:04,guy called the great Alexander and it just said in massive letters Houdini and you would
00:16:04,00:16:07,think by walking past that Houdini would be there but it actually if you read the small
00:16:07,00:16:17,print it said Houdini the great escape artist would be outdone by the great Alexander which
00:16:17,00:16:23,I think we should give a shout out to wildabouthoudini.com cause it is unbelievable it's made by this
00:16:23,00:16:27,guy called John Cox and he's collated I think it must be every single primary source about
00:16:27,00:16:32,Houdini ever like every newspaper clipping every diary entry of everyone who ever met
00:16:32,00:16:35,him it's so good you can just disappear into it.
00:16:35,00:16:39,Well it's really nice isn't it because you get the article and often you then have to
00:16:39,00:16:45,do extra digging but he's he's put the picture of the newspaper where it was originally mentioned
00:16:45,00:16:50,like for example Houdini didn't start off as Houdini when he got into the world of of
00:16:50,00:16:55,performance he was originally a trapeze artist and he was billed as Eric Prince of the air
00:16:55,00:17:01,and he you read that but next to it he's tracked down the original citation for it in an advert
00:17:01,00:17:05,in a newspaper to show that this existed as a real thing so he's really done his research
00:17:05,00:17:07,for the website.
00:17:07,00:17:12,Yeah he's got the Houdini source of why he left one of his very first jobs as Projea the
00:17:12,00:17:18,wild man of Mexico or Projea maybe which I think we've mentioned before that he played
00:17:18,00:17:24,this role and his job was to snarl madly as raw meat was thrown at him and so this is
00:17:24,00:17:28,one of his early performance acts and he quit when he ended up being hit in the eye with
00:17:28,00:17:36,a slab of meat and indeed he recalls this himself there's a 1902 newspaper article what's also
00:17:36,00:17:41,great about him is that he wrote prolifically columns for newspapers and he was writing
00:17:41,00:17:46,while he was in Berlin for Oktoberfest in fact and he said I couldn't look at my trainer
00:17:46,00:17:50,for three weeks because my eyes were closed that caused me to become tame because of this
00:17:50,00:17:54,meat slab in the face.
00:17:54,00:17:56,He had his own magazine.
00:17:56,00:17:57,Who did Houdini?
00:17:57,00:18:01,Houdini had his own magazine called Conjurer's Monthly Magazine and it wasn't explicitly
00:18:01,00:18:06,his magazine but if you read any single edition of it you would notice that it was plugging
00:18:06,00:18:12,Houdini it was writing malicious gossip about other magicians Houdini didn't like and criticising
00:18:12,00:18:15,all the people imitating him it only lasts for about a year but yeah.
00:18:15,00:18:19,He did like to sort of have a go at other magicians because he did find himself constantly having
00:18:19,00:18:24,his ideas and his inventions stolen and he desperately wanted to make sure that people
00:18:24,00:18:29,couldn't use them but that was really hard because if you were to patent your invention
00:18:29,00:18:34,as part of the patent you would need to reveal what the trick was so he could never do that.
00:18:34,00:18:38,He did get around it slightly there was one loophole that he managed to find which was
00:18:38,00:18:43,he had the Chinese water torture cell and that was one that he prized a lot and what
00:18:43,00:18:48,he did was he put on a play where that was in the play this act that you would escape
00:18:48,00:18:52,but he only put the play on to one person sitting in the audience and then he was able
00:18:52,00:18:57,to copyright the act as opposed to patent it so that no one could then do it because
00:18:57,00:19:00,it was copyrighted as a play.
00:19:00,00:19:05,When he died he gave his tricks to his brother didn't he so his brother was also a magician
00:19:05,00:19:10,or an escape artist which I didn't know he was called Theo but he went under the name
00:19:10,00:19:14,Hardeen which is almost like one of these rip-off names isn't it?
00:19:14,00:19:19,Yeah in fact it's just about the only sound that is not made by those imitators.
00:19:19,00:19:25,And when Theo died in 1945 the props went up for sale and they were eventually bought
00:19:25,00:19:31,by David Copperfield and they're currently in storage in Las Vegas and the way to get
00:19:31,00:19:36,through them they're in a big room that's next door to a sex shop and you have to go
00:19:36,00:19:41,through the sex shop to get to the warehouse and there was an interview with Hugh Jackman
00:19:41,00:19:45,who'd went to see them and he said that the way you get to this warehouse is that there's
00:19:45,00:19:49,a mannequin in the sex shop and you have to press the nipple on the mannequin and when
00:19:49,00:19:53,you press the nipple a special door opens and you can go in and see all of Houdini's
00:19:53,00:19:54,tricks.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Oh my god.
00:19:55,00:19:56,That is so good.
00:19:56,00:19:59,Would he be happy about that?
00:19:59,00:20:04,"Those tricks should never, they shouldn't exist really still should they because when Houdini"
00:20:04,00:20:10,died he gave them to his brother to Hardin and the stipulation was that once his brother
00:20:10,00:20:17,"had died that all of his stuff, all of his magical effects and physical things had to"
00:20:17,00:20:20,be burnt and destroyed so that's how that was meant to end.
00:20:20,00:20:25,However Houdini sold a lot of it during his lifetime in the 40s to a guy who was a Houdini
00:20:25,00:20:31,enthusiast called Sidney Hollis Radner and Radner then put it in a magical museum the
00:20:31,00:20:35,Houdini Magical Hall of Fame at Niagara Falls.
00:20:35,00:20:41,Now in 1995 a fire broke out in the museum and completely destroyed the museum however
00:20:41,00:20:47,all of Houdini's stuff survived despite the whole building going down so it feels like
00:20:47,00:20:51,"it doesn't want to disappear, feels like it wants to continue on."
00:20:51,00:20:53,Who really was escaping all that time?
00:20:53,00:20:58,Was it Houdini or his equipment because he escaped a fire?
00:20:58,00:21:01,Maybe he was a patsy to them.
00:21:01,00:21:04,His tricks were quite interesting weren't they?
00:21:04,00:21:06,Especially the escaping things.
00:21:06,00:21:12,"He escaped from piano boxes, from coffins, from ladders that he was locked to, from glass"
00:21:12,00:21:13,boxes.
00:21:13,00:21:15,He once escaped from the belly of a whale.
00:21:15,00:21:16,Is that living or dead?
00:21:16,00:21:17,The whale?
00:21:17,00:21:18,"It was dead, the dead whale."
00:21:18,00:21:19,"Okay, still good."
00:21:19,00:21:23,And when he was in Leeds he got into a big barrel of beer.
00:21:23,00:21:26,"You guys read about this one, it's pretty cool."
00:21:26,00:21:31,It was the Tetley Brewery and they put him in a massive barrel of beer and said okay
00:21:31,00:21:37,you have to escape but Houdini was teetotal and he became overcome by the alcohol and
00:21:37,00:21:41,lost consciousness and had to be hauled out by his assistant.
00:21:41,00:21:43,That is so good.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Wow.
00:21:44,00:21:48,"He used to do that by the way, there was a level of PR about that where the beer keg in"
00:21:48,00:21:53,particular would be if it was a town that's centered around a beer industry he would use
00:21:53,00:21:56,that as a way of promoting and appealing to everyone there.
00:21:56,00:22:01,"But if you're somewhere that doesn't do beer, let's say he's going to the home of Melton"
00:22:01,00:22:02,Mowberry pork pies.
00:22:02,00:22:05,Does he have to escape from an enormous pie?
00:22:05,00:22:07,You mean the home of Melton Mowberry pork pies?
00:22:07,00:22:08,You mean Melton Mowberry?
00:22:08,00:22:09,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:09,00:22:13,I had a momentary loss of confidence thinking is that an actual town?
00:22:13,00:22:18,"But yeah, imagine that because actually the pastry case of a pork pie is technically known"
00:22:18,00:22:20,"as a coffin, isn't it?"
00:22:20,00:22:22,So he is escaping from a coffin.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"And actually, what you do is you put him in the pie and you put the pie on a conveyor"
00:22:25,00:22:31,"belt going towards a massive oven and if he can't escape the pie in time, he'll be cooked."
00:22:31,00:22:35,He has a connection to the first ever episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:22:35,00:22:37,Can you guess what that is?
00:22:37,00:22:39,"Okay, what did we talk about?"
00:22:39,00:22:42,"We talked about CERN and the - Yeah, Large Hadron Collider."
00:22:42,00:22:47,"Oh, we talked about the Philippa Langley finding Richard III under a car park."
00:22:47,00:22:50,I cannot believe you guys have not mentioned the most obvious facts from episode one.
00:22:50,00:22:56,"We recorded the whole thing locked inside a cave with 17 catalogues on it, suspended"
00:22:56,00:22:57,above.
00:22:57,00:22:58,"Yep, that's what I'm talking about."
00:22:58,00:22:59,That's right.
00:22:59,00:23:03,"Before Andy came here, we had an Andrew Hunter Flurry, an Andrew Hunter Mowry, an Andrew"
00:23:03,00:23:07,Hunter Flurry.
00:23:07,00:23:10,Does he have something to do with President Garfield Anus?
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Yes, he does."
00:23:12,00:23:14,Did he escape from President Garfield Anus?
00:23:14,00:23:16,"No, he did not."
00:23:16,00:23:20,He never went in in the first place.
00:23:20,00:23:25,"He was obsessed with murderers, so he bought all this paraphernalia."
00:23:25,00:23:28,"He had this massive collection, and he was obsessed with John Wilkes Booth, who shot"
00:23:28,00:23:32,"Lincoln, of course, and he was also obsessed with Charles Guto, the man who killed President"
00:23:32,00:23:33,Garfield.
00:23:33,00:23:39,"He bought all of these things to do with him, like his phrenological analysis."
00:23:39,00:23:45,"He was locked in Guto's death row cell and escaped, and that was one of the famous tricks."
00:23:45,00:23:50,"In the process, he freed all the other prisoners on the same death row as him, and apparently"
00:23:50,00:23:53,"he freed them, and then he locked them up again in the wrong cells."
00:23:53,00:23:58,"I've one more thing about Houdini's habits at home, because he and his wife were extremely"
00:23:58,00:24:04,"close, not as close as he was with his mother, which is another story for another time."
00:24:04,00:24:08,"When Houdini and his wife had an argument, he would leave, he'd walk around the block,"
00:24:08,00:24:12,"and then he'd come back, and he would open the door of the room where his wife was and"
00:24:12,00:24:14,throw his hat into the room.
00:24:14,00:24:20,"If it was thrown out again, she was still angry, and I guess he would do it again."
00:24:20,00:24:25,"And if the hat remained in the room, she'd come down and they'd go in and resolve it."
00:24:25,00:24:30,What if the argument was about him leaving his clothes hanging around the house all the
00:24:30,00:24:35,"time, like a lot of the arguments in my house are about?"
00:24:35,00:24:40,You keep throwing your things all over the floor.
00:24:40,00:24:45,"He was actually one of the things he was as famous for as his escaping, apparently, and"
00:24:45,00:24:50,"this is according to the Wild About Houdini website, was his needle trick."
00:24:50,00:24:53,And the East India needle trick involved him basically swallowing a whole load of needles
00:24:53,00:24:57,"and some thread, and then he'd vomit it all back up again, but the thread would be threaded"
00:24:57,00:25:02,"perfectly through all the needles with a little knot before each one, very impressive, yada-yada-yada."
00:25:02,00:25:07,"But the weird thing about that is, talking of how close he was to his wife, she died"
00:25:07,00:25:09,in a place called Needles.
00:25:09,00:25:10,Oh.
00:25:10,00:25:11,Dun-dun-dun.
00:25:11,00:25:12,"Needles, California."
00:25:12,00:25:13,Did he?
00:25:13,00:25:17,That is the least spooky thing I've ever heard.
00:25:17,00:25:21,It's like I spent days searching for a Houdini-based coincidence.
00:25:21,00:25:33,That is the least impressive coincidence since Geoffrey the cat and that mongoose that time.
00:25:33,00:25:36,I have one last Houdini imitator to mention.
00:25:36,00:25:43,"This Houdini impersonator was dubbed Harry Houdini, and it was an orangutan from Borneo"
00:25:43,00:25:47,who lived in San Diego Zoo and whose real name was Ken Allen.
00:25:47,00:25:49,That was the name of the orangutan.
00:25:49,00:25:50,His real name.
00:25:50,00:25:51,Real name.
00:25:51,00:25:52,Real name.
00:25:52,00:25:53,"Real name, isn't it?"
00:25:53,00:25:54,Yeah.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"His real name was something in orangutan language, probably."
00:25:56,00:25:58,It's what the zoo called him.
00:25:58,00:25:59,He was called Ken Allen.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"But Ken Allen was quite a famous orangutan, I think."
00:26:01,00:26:02,Very famous.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Yeah.
00:26:03,00:26:08,And the fact that he was constantly successfully escaping from his enclosure and no one could
00:26:08,00:26:09,work out why.
00:26:09,00:26:13,"So he got, given the name, Harry Houdini, and they eventually had to bring in mountaineer"
00:26:13,00:26:17,experts to look at the wall to see if it was the crags in the wall that he was somehow
00:26:17,00:26:19,gripping onto to getting out.
00:26:19,00:26:23,"And it turns out that that's what it was in the end, and they had to spend $40,000 eliminating"
00:26:23,00:26:27,all the holes in the wall so that Ken Allen couldn't escape anymore.
00:26:27,00:26:34,"And yeah, Time Magazine listed it in 2011 as one of the top 11 zoo escapes of all time."
00:26:34,00:26:39,And I refuse for this podcast to ever end until we cover the other 10.
00:26:39,00:26:49,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:26:49,00:26:55,"My fact this week is that when the gates at Surman Lena Prison in Finland are locked,"
00:26:55,00:27:01,"it's to keep tourists out, not to keep prisoners in."
00:27:01,00:27:06,"This is his prison on an island just off Helsinki, just really near Helsinki."
00:27:06,00:27:11,"And it's an open prison, but I was reading an article in the New Statesman, an article"
00:27:11,00:27:14,"written by Helen Lewis, a journalist who went and visited."
00:27:14,00:27:18,And she wanted to go and check out the prison because it's quite famous.
00:27:18,00:27:21,"And they'd have to close the gates because tourists keep on wandering to the island,"
00:27:21,00:27:24,which is a tourist destination in its own right and trying to get in.
00:27:24,00:27:28,"So prisoners are allowed to wander out, people are not allowed to wander in, but it's an"
00:27:28,00:27:29,amazing place.
00:27:29,00:27:33,"Finland is one of these places that has lots of open prisons, so it's got 13 open prisons."
00:27:33,00:27:40,"I think about a third of their prisoners are in these prisons, and they can do things like"
00:27:40,00:27:46,"they have like therapy horses, and they have saunas, they have their own little houses like"
00:27:46,00:27:51,"huts that are sort of like hostels that they stay in with shared cooking facilities, nice"
00:27:51,00:27:54,little sitting room with a big widescreen TV.
00:27:54,00:27:57,"You can stay, you can go to the mainland if you want, stay with your family overnight"
00:27:57,00:28:00,if you ask for permission.
00:28:00,00:28:01,It's a good sitch.
00:28:01,00:28:04,"And as a result, it has practically no recidivism."
00:28:04,00:28:09,So it's really interesting because it seems like it's for people often nearing the end
00:28:09,00:28:13,of sentences where they might have been in higher security prisons for the early part
00:28:13,00:28:14,of their sentence.
00:28:14,00:28:18,This is a way of slowly acclimatising them to life on the outside.
00:28:18,00:28:22,"So you're not just going straight from maximum big house, you know, 23 hours a day in a room"
00:28:22,00:28:26,"to the open world again, because that's a really juddering change."
00:28:26,00:28:31,"I did read though that, and I'm quoting exactly here, attempts to escape are limited to a"
00:28:31,00:28:34,"few dozen a year, which sounds like a lot to me."
00:28:34,00:28:35,It does sound like a lot.
00:28:35,00:28:37,That sounds like an enormous amount.
00:28:37,00:28:42,"I think there are only about 100 prisoners in there, that is a large percentage of them."
00:28:42,00:28:48,"In 2013, they had doubled the number of attempted prison escapes in any other country in the"
00:28:48,00:28:49,world.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Wow.
00:28:50,00:28:54,But the idea is why would you try and escape if you're getting towards the end of your
00:28:54,00:28:59,"time and you know that if you try and escape, then you're going to get put back in the"
00:28:59,00:29:00,big house again.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"Then that's the idea, right?"
00:29:02,00:29:06,"That's why you would never, in theory, make sense that you would never try and escape."
00:29:06,00:29:07,Yeah.
00:29:07,00:29:08,Yeah.
00:29:08,00:29:09,Yeah.
00:29:09,00:29:12,"Maybe it gets you more time, more jail time in that same place, because that sounds like"
00:29:12,00:29:18,"a pretty cushy deal, sadly, I think you get sent back to one of the normal prisons"
00:29:18,00:29:19,if you try and get out.
00:29:19,00:29:24,"So it's not a good plan, but I mean, the conclusion of most people who look into it is that the"
00:29:24,00:29:29,"disadvantages of the odd escapes, not too dangerous prisoner are outweighed by the advantages"
00:29:29,00:29:34,of the fact that places like Finland and Norway is another one like this have a recidivism
00:29:34,00:29:35,rate of 20%.
00:29:35,00:29:40,"So only 20% of prisoners after like, I think it's 10 years, end up back in prison, whereas"
00:29:40,00:29:43,here 75% in the US is 83%.
00:29:43,00:29:44,Wow.
00:29:44,00:29:46,So it seems to be working.
00:29:46,00:29:50,And also there's no challenge in an escape because you literally get given a key to your
00:29:50,00:29:51,cell.
00:29:51,00:29:52,Yes.
00:29:52,00:29:58,"The Harry Houdini of Finland is not very impressive at all, is he?"
00:29:58,00:30:03,"Opens the door, wanders on to the ferry, saves loads of money as well."
00:30:03,00:30:06,"I don't know how our prisons, which are very kind of unpleasant situations, manage to be"
00:30:06,00:30:12,"also so expensive, but I think it costs, whereas these ones are quite cheap."
00:30:12,00:30:17,So cost the equivalent of 160 euros a day compared with 205 euros for a closed jail.
00:30:17,00:30:21,"I guess maybe those locks, those locks cost money."
00:30:21,00:30:22,Yeah.
00:30:22,00:30:24,"It'll be tiny things, won't it?"
00:30:24,00:30:28,Remember that fact James told us about when they took a single olive out of the meals
00:30:28,00:30:30,on airplanes that they saved?
00:30:30,00:30:35,"If you take a single bar out of a prison gate over the year, that actually leads to huge"
00:30:35,00:30:39,savings.
00:30:39,00:30:42,"We used to have rotating prisons, which I did not know."
00:30:42,00:30:43,That sounds fun.
00:30:43,00:30:44,Like a carousel.
00:30:44,00:30:45,It's unbelievable.
00:30:45,00:30:49,"It's basically, there's a central pole and there's a cylinder of cells all the way around"
00:30:49,00:30:50,it.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"And if the warden turns a crank, I've no idea the mechanism that powers this, must have"
00:30:52,00:30:53,been pretty big.
00:30:53,00:30:55,The prison rotates and you get locked away.
00:30:55,00:30:59,You basically don't have a door to escape through once the prison has been rotated.
00:30:59,00:31:00,"Oh, that's clever."
00:31:00,00:31:02,A bit like an escape room.
00:31:02,00:31:04,It's exactly like an escape room.
00:31:04,00:31:05,Yeah.
00:31:05,00:31:06,Yeah.
00:31:06,00:31:07,There are only a couple left.
00:31:07,00:31:10,It's an old squirrel cage and it's an Iowa and that was three stories tall.
00:31:10,00:31:12,But that's not a functioning.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"That's now a sort of museum heritage thing, isn't it?"
00:31:14,00:31:17,There are no rotating prisons currently operating in America.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Yeah.
00:31:18,00:31:19,That would be too much like fun.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Because they were really dangerous.
00:31:20,00:31:25,"The, it was too dangerous for the prisoners as well because let's, well, let's say a fire"
00:31:25,00:31:31,"broke out in the prison or if the mechanism broke down and it took ages to fix, you would"
00:31:31,00:31:35,"have people dehydrated, not being able to eat, not being able to escape."
00:31:35,00:31:36,Yeah.
00:31:36,00:31:37,Absolutely.
00:31:37,00:31:39,So they eventually had to abandon it.
00:31:39,00:31:42,I assumed you were saying that people got squished as the rotating happened.
00:31:42,00:31:43,"Well, they did."
00:31:43,00:31:44,Like a revolving door.
00:31:44,00:31:45,"Oh, no."
00:31:45,00:31:46,"Oh, okay."
00:31:46,00:31:49,"Some, your hand could be caught as if it's suddenly, if you were putting your hand outside"
00:31:49,00:31:54,"the bar and they suddenly very quickly rotated it, they were saying that hands would get"
00:31:54,00:31:55,lobbed off and and arms.
00:31:55,00:31:56,What?
00:31:56,00:31:57,Yeah.
00:31:57,00:31:58,"So it was, it was a very dangerous mechanism."
00:31:58,00:31:59,Jesus.
00:31:59,00:32:03,"You just need a recording that you get at the theme parks, keep your hands and arms inside"
00:32:03,00:32:09,the vehicle slash prison cell at all times and they won't get lopped off.
00:32:09,00:32:10,Wow.
00:32:10,00:32:11,Boy.
00:32:11,00:32:14,"Well, that turned horrific very quickly."
00:32:14,00:32:20,Another very dangerous prison that is also a kind of open prison is this extraordinary
00:32:20,00:32:22,"place, San Pedro prison in Bolivia."
00:32:22,00:32:29,It's the largest prison in La Paz and it basically is its own town and but sort of not deliberately
00:32:29,00:32:31,it's through corruption really.
00:32:31,00:32:36,So the inmates all have jobs within the prison walls and the only way in which it's now a
00:32:36,00:32:41,"prison is that it's surrounded by guards who won't let you out, but the inmates all have"
00:32:41,00:32:42,these jobs.
00:32:42,00:32:43,They rent accommodation.
00:32:43,00:32:45,They live in there with their families quite often.
00:32:45,00:32:50,They get their money mostly from working in the cocaine factory inside the prison and
00:32:50,00:32:56,"then they sell the cocaine to tourists to come and visit the prison and in the nineties,"
00:32:56,00:32:59,"I don't know if any listeners were backpacking in the nineties, but apparently it was a backpacker"
00:32:59,00:33:01,hotspot.
00:33:01,00:33:05,"It was this unwritten rule that if you went to La Paz, the backpacker, you could get let"
00:33:05,00:33:11,"into this prison and hang out in this really quite dangerous environment, just lapping"
00:33:11,00:33:15,up the local culture and the only reason they cracked down is because they used to offer
00:33:15,00:33:19,tours around the prison and the government cracked down on this because they thought
00:33:19,00:33:24,the police were big stalking the money from the illegal tours and they had politicians
00:33:24,00:33:25,and stuff inside.
00:33:25,00:33:29,"They have elected leaders in the prison who apparently enforce the laws of the community,"
00:33:29,00:33:30,mainly by stabbing people.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Wow.
00:33:31,00:33:35,"That's like only in the hand or something, you know, you steal an apple, you get stabbed"
00:33:35,00:33:40,"in the hand because you can't just send someone to prison within a prison, I guess."
00:33:40,00:33:41,No.
00:33:41,00:33:42,No.
00:33:42,00:33:44,"It sounds like you're an advocate for this place, Anna."
00:33:44,00:33:47,"It does a little bit, especially when you said it's where you get the cocaine and then"
00:33:47,00:33:52,"you're like, oh, and this is also the place where you lap up the local culture, which sounded"
00:33:52,00:33:56,like the most obvious euphemism for drug taking I'd ever heard in my life.
00:33:56,00:34:02,"You can lap it up, you can sniff up the local culture, rub the local culture into your gums"
00:34:02,00:34:03,if you want to.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"It's just, it's the backpacking experience."
00:34:05,00:34:07,"Oh, my word."
00:34:07,00:34:13,"You guys, of course, know Eamon de Valera, the hero of Irish politics, right?"
00:34:13,00:34:17,"Sure, but why don't you just, for the listeners at home, why don't you quickly explain to"
00:34:17,00:34:18,them?
00:34:18,00:34:21,"Well, just Eamon de Valera, great hero of the Irish independence movement."
00:34:21,00:34:27,"He was locked up in, oh, I think it was about 1917 or 18, right?"
00:34:27,00:34:28,That's right.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"And the story, he escaped, right?"
00:34:30,00:34:32,But the story of how he escaped is absolutely insane.
00:34:32,00:34:35,He was in for possibly conspiring with Germany.
00:34:35,00:34:36,That was the charge.
00:34:36,00:34:39,"So he stole a key from the prison chaplain, impressive."
00:34:39,00:34:43,"He got some candles from the chapel and he pressed the key into the candles, right?"
00:34:43,00:34:45,So now he's got an impression of the key.
00:34:45,00:34:50,"But the problem is you need someone to make the key, you know, he didn't have the facility"
00:34:50,00:34:51,to do that.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"So metal to pour into the thing, right?"
00:34:54,00:34:55,Exactly.
00:34:55,00:35:01,"So what they did was, he and a couple of, I think, fellow prisoners, they sent the IRA"
00:35:01,00:35:06,a Christmas card on which they had got someone to draw a cartoon of a drunk man holding a
00:35:06,00:35:07,big key.
00:35:07,00:35:13,And the key that they drew on the card was an exact copy of the impression he had taken
00:35:13,00:35:15,"from the chaplain's key, right?"
00:35:15,00:35:20,So basically it was a code saying make a key that looks like this and it'll get me out.
00:35:20,00:35:21,The guards didn't notice.
00:35:21,00:35:24,They made the key to the dimensions on the card.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"They sent it inside a cake, genuinely inside a cake."
00:35:26,00:35:27,Christmas cake.
00:35:27,00:35:28,Probably.
00:35:28,00:35:29,Probably.
00:35:29,00:35:30,It got through.
00:35:30,00:35:32,It didn't fit the lock.
00:35:32,00:35:33,They made it too small.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"As soon as he got out of the cake, he thought, oh, this doesn't fit."
00:35:36,00:35:39,Did they make it the size of the drawing on the card?
00:35:39,00:35:43,"Well, they had to do it again."
00:35:43,00:35:48,They had to send another amusing cartoon this time with a kind of Celtic symbol in the middle
00:35:48,00:35:49,of which was a key.
00:35:49,00:35:52,"I was going to say, did they have to wait till next Christmas or did they do it like"
00:35:52,00:35:56,maybe as a Valentine's card or an Epiphany card?
00:35:56,00:36:00,"They were like, oh, in Ireland, this is a thing we do every year."
00:36:00,00:36:03,So then basically they sent the second cartoon.
00:36:03,00:36:04,They sent it back another key.
00:36:04,00:36:06,That also did not work.
00:36:06,00:36:10,So this time it was too big.
00:36:10,00:36:11,The Goldilocks.
00:36:11,00:36:14,The Goldilocks key is coming up.
00:36:14,00:36:15,Very nice.
00:36:15,00:36:21,Eventually they just sent a third cake to the prison and inside that cake was just a blank
00:36:21,00:36:30,"key and a set of files saying, ""Make your own bloody key"" and it worked."
00:36:30,00:36:35,"Just one weird thing on prison, like living within a prison, is that women don't have"
00:36:35,00:36:40,to wear prison issue clothing in British jails and men do.
00:36:40,00:36:44,And that's been the case since 1971 and it's because research finds that people had
00:36:44,00:36:47,heard of the rules better if they're not actually wearing uniform.
00:36:47,00:36:51,"And I think the idea is that it sort of humanises you and it's like, I'm more willing to obey"
00:36:51,00:36:52,the rules.
00:36:52,00:36:59,"In America, famously quite strict penal system, the inmates often do have to wear orange."
00:36:59,00:37:03,"Or in fact, when oranges, the new black came out, some prisons stopped their female inmates"
00:37:03,00:37:07,from wearing orange and made them go back to stripes because orange had become cool.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Really?
00:37:08,00:37:11,Not allowed to be cool.
00:37:11,00:37:16,"There is, in Norway as well, at the Bastøy rehabilitation centre, I don't know if it's"
00:37:16,00:37:19,"the pronunciation of that, it's got an O with a line through it."
00:37:19,00:37:20,Bastøy.
00:37:20,00:37:21,I think it is.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Bastøy.
00:37:22,00:37:26,They have a similar thing where the guards don't wear uniforms and they don't wear uniforms
00:37:26,00:37:31,because they say they don't want to create sort of unnecessary division between them and
00:37:31,00:37:36,"the prisoners there, who they don't call prisoners, they call residents, because it just feels"
00:37:36,00:37:37,more friendly.
00:37:37,00:37:43,"It feels like a cool dad, really, in that prison, just trying a bit too hard."
00:37:43,00:37:49,"Speaking of words that begin with B-A-S-T, as we just learned, that your Bastøy place"
00:37:49,00:37:50,or whatever it was.
00:37:50,00:37:52,Segway incoming.
00:37:52,00:37:57,"The place in Finland, which is called Suomenlinna, is it, Anna?"
00:37:57,00:37:58,Suomenlinna.
00:37:58,00:38:00,"Yeah, Suomenlinna."
00:38:00,00:38:05,"That is, like you said, a famous tourist attraction and it's because it's a bastion"
00:38:05,00:38:06,fort.
00:38:06,00:38:07,It's a bastion fort.
00:38:07,00:38:08,You guys might have seen these.
00:38:08,00:38:12,"It's where you have a fortress, but instead of being a normal castle, it's in a star"
00:38:12,00:38:13,shape.
00:38:13,00:38:14,Have you ever seen those?
00:38:14,00:38:15,"You get them around Europe, don't you?"
00:38:15,00:38:20,Do you know why you have star-shaped castles or why you used to have star-shaped castles?
00:38:20,00:38:22,Is it something defensive?
00:38:22,00:38:26,Is it to confuse aeroplanes because they'll look at the castle and think that that's up
00:38:26,00:38:29,"because it's a star, so they'll fly in the opposite direction?"
00:38:29,00:38:30,Brilliant.
00:38:30,00:38:31,Brilliant.
00:38:31,00:38:32,That's such a good idea.
00:38:32,00:38:37,"Oh, my God, that's so genius, but no, it was a time before playing some PogChalli."
00:38:37,00:38:38,OK.
00:38:38,00:38:40,But Andy was pretty much there.
00:38:40,00:38:45,"So basically, it was in a time of cannonballs."
00:38:45,00:38:49,"And if you fire a cannonball at a normal castle, it's going to hit the wall and it might make"
00:38:49,00:38:51,some damage.
00:38:51,00:38:56,"But if you fire the cannonball at a surface which is not straight on, which is not perpendicular,"
00:38:56,00:39:02,"it's actually slightly slanted, then the cannonball might just kind of hit the edge of it and skid"
00:39:02,00:39:03,off the side of it.
00:39:03,00:39:08,And so the idea was to make these star-shaped forts where if anyone was firing cannons at
00:39:08,00:39:12,"you, then it wouldn't initially do as much damage."
00:39:12,00:39:13,So that's why they have it.
00:39:13,00:39:14,So clever.
00:39:14,00:39:15,So clever.
00:39:15,00:39:19,"Is that a thing called, I want to say a ravelin, or it might be connected to a ravelin?"
00:39:19,00:39:20,"I think it is that, yeah."
00:39:20,00:39:24,"I remember reading that word while I was reading this fact, but yeah."
00:39:24,00:39:28,Because I went to one of them in Kronborg when we were all on tour in Denmark.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:29,00:39:32,"Kronborg, which is the setting for Hamlet."
00:39:32,00:39:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:33,00:39:38,"And they have got these star-shaped fortifications outside and it makes it, yeah, as James said."
00:39:38,00:39:43,"And that's a ravelin, useless as for a javelin at a ravelin, right?"
00:39:43,00:39:44,Yeah.
00:39:44,00:39:45,That's the same.
00:39:45,00:39:46,That's the catchphrase.
00:39:46,00:39:51,They got that painted above the gates.
00:39:51,00:39:58,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:39:58,00:40:04,My fact this week is that one of Hawaii's biggest annual festivals is devoted entirely
00:40:04,00:40:05,to spam.
00:40:05,00:40:08,That's spam the food.
00:40:08,00:40:14,"So when they invite you to the spam festival, do they send you 5,000 emails telling you"
00:40:14,00:40:17,it's on every year?
00:40:17,00:40:20,Extend your penis at the Hawaii Spam Festival.
00:40:20,00:40:24,"Yeah, I love this fact."
00:40:24,00:40:28,"It was given to me in a conversation I had with a mutual friend of ours, Jason Haseley."
00:40:28,00:40:32,"We were chatting about it and he said, by the way, did you know that they have the Waikiki"
00:40:32,00:40:38,"Spam Jam, which is this annual spam festival that takes place in Hawaii."
00:40:38,00:40:41,And it is a massively popular festival there.
00:40:41,00:40:44,"35,000 people attend according to their website."
00:40:44,00:40:46,They have live bands playing.
00:40:46,00:40:47,They have merch.
00:40:47,00:40:50,"You can get spam t-shirts, shorts, slippers."
00:40:50,00:40:51,They have craft boots.
00:40:51,00:40:52,Can I just check?
00:40:52,00:40:56,"Sorry, the t-shirt, shorts, and slippers, they're not all made of spam, are they?"
00:40:56,00:40:59,"No, they just feature a picture of spam, I'm guessing."
00:40:59,00:41:03,"Right, because that would be absolutely disgusting and not survive a wash."
00:41:03,00:41:08,"I've got to say, Dan, when you sent round this fact, I thought that it was a massive"
00:41:08,00:41:13,exaggeration and I've been to Hawaii and they have lots of festivals all the time.
00:41:13,00:41:17,"And I was like, there's no way that the spam one is one of the biggest, which is what you"
00:41:17,00:41:18,"say, but it so is."
00:41:18,00:41:21,It's absolutely huge.
00:41:21,00:41:23,"Yeah, and they are obsessed."
00:41:23,00:41:27,Hawaii is obsessed with spam and they have spam in places that I've never heard of or
00:41:27,00:41:29,dreamt of thinking they would appear.
00:41:29,00:41:32,"Okay, I need to get into personal details."
00:41:32,00:41:37,"Well, okay, maybe I'll dig that up too much, but you know, McDonald's has spam burgers"
00:41:37,00:41:39,and so does Burger King.
00:41:39,00:41:43,"They have a spam burger and yeah, you can get them in all the local dishes."
00:41:43,00:41:46,Everything spam is just integrated all over Hawaii.
00:41:46,00:41:52,I think the most common way in Hawaii that it's served is quite nice because it's a
00:41:52,00:41:58,sushi spam and that's kind of a nod to they've got a big Japanese population actually.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"And also, I think it's quite nice because Hawaii obviously has quite a difficult history"
00:42:01,00:42:07,with Japan and now they serve spam sushi and it's spam on top of sushi rice wrapped in
00:42:07,00:42:12,seaweed and it's called Spam Musubi and that's where you'll usually sit.
00:42:12,00:42:17,I think the reason that spam is so popular not just in Hawaii but also throughout the
00:42:17,00:42:21,"whole of the Pacific is due to the war, isn't it?"
00:42:21,00:42:26,It's due to the Second World War because basically the Japanese soldiers took over a lot of these
00:42:26,00:42:32,"islands and the people, whenever they grew food, they had to give it to the Japanese soldiers"
00:42:32,00:42:34,and they were forced to do all this stuff.
00:42:34,00:42:39,"And then when the Americans came and sort of liberated them, they didn't have any food."
00:42:39,00:42:43,They were just kind of searching for any kind of food they could eat but the American soldiers
00:42:43,00:42:48,"had tons of this stuff like they had spam coming out of their ears, the American soldiers"
00:42:48,00:42:53,"during the Second World War, so they gave it to the locals and that's where the kind"
00:42:53,00:42:54,of love of spam came from.
00:42:54,00:42:59,"Yeah, I listened to a podcast all about spam which was great."
00:42:59,00:43:00,It's actually the Business Insider podcast.
00:43:00,00:43:04,It's called Brought to You By and it's about the kind of the stories behind big old brands.
00:43:04,00:43:08,"And anyway, it was like places that have had a US military presence around that time because"
00:43:08,00:43:14,spam was just kind of taking off and places that have rice-based dishes because apparently
00:43:14,00:43:18,it goes very well with rice and then places with very hot climates because it's canned
00:43:18,00:43:21,and so it's like a canned meat that you don't even need to put in the fridge.
00:43:21,00:43:27,"So it's like Korea, Guam, the Philippines, it's massive."
00:43:27,00:43:33,The founder was a man called Hormel and the firm that still makes it is called Hormel.
00:43:33,00:43:38,So his son took over the family firm J. Hormel and he was interviewed by the New Yorker in
00:43:38,00:43:44,1945 just as the war was ending and he said that there was a file called the Scurrilous
00:43:44,00:43:48,File which contained hundreds of letters of abuse sent to him by soldiers all over the
00:43:48,00:43:53,"world saying, ""I have to eat this spam and it's disgusting,"" right?"
00:43:53,00:43:58,"And he said in this interview, ""Maybe the verb 'to spam' will come out of this war."
00:43:58,00:44:04,"Something would surprise me anymore,"" i.e. he was saying that sending random letters"
00:44:04,00:44:08,or communications to someone who hasn't asked for it is to spam.
00:44:08,00:44:13,"Now that is not where the word spam as a verb for email comes from, but it is an earlier"
00:44:13,00:44:15,link between the two concepts.
00:44:15,00:44:16,Isn't that weird?
00:44:16,00:44:17,That's so good.
00:44:17,00:44:18,That is so good.
00:44:18,00:44:22,We should say what the sort of received acknowledged fact of where it comes from is which is it
00:44:22,00:44:28,was a Monty Python sketch where Terry Jones was running a restaurant where the only thing
00:44:28,00:44:35,"that you could have was spam and would you like spam, spam, spam, it was always different."
00:44:35,00:44:39,And that's where the people who gave it its name took it from that.
00:44:39,00:44:40,"But I think you're right, Andy."
00:44:40,00:44:42,I think that's more of a direct...
00:44:42,00:44:43,Is that weird?
00:44:43,00:44:44,Yeah.
00:44:44,00:44:45,Yeah.
00:44:45,00:44:46,Yeah.
00:44:46,00:44:47,Be cool.
00:44:47,00:44:48,Monty Python's sort of ruined spam for a while.
00:44:48,00:44:51,"For a while, Hallwell was really angry about it."
00:44:51,00:44:52,Just getting popular again.
00:44:52,00:44:56,I think people hated it in the Second World War and then they started to enjoy it in the
00:44:56,00:44:57,'40s and '50s.
00:44:57,00:45:03,"There were these spam girls, weren't there, these Hallwell girls who the company employed"
00:45:03,00:45:05,and they were a band.
00:45:05,00:45:09,"They were this musical group and they were worried because after World War II, 90% of"
00:45:09,00:45:13,"sales had been to the army and they thought, oh my God, we're going to stop selling it."
00:45:13,00:45:18,And so the Hallwell girls traveled around the U.S. in 35 white Chevy's doing sort of
00:45:18,00:45:21,"singing, dancing, parades."
00:45:21,00:45:24,They had their own radio show and sales shot up.
00:45:24,00:45:25,They made spam cool.
00:45:25,00:45:29,"They were known as the Spamettes, sometimes this band."
00:45:29,00:45:30,Nice.
00:45:30,00:45:37,"And they were all dressed in like soldiers, not soldiers uniform, but like soldiers band"
00:45:37,00:45:38,"uniform, weren't they?"
00:45:38,00:45:43,"And it was kind of to remind you of the wartime effort, really."
00:45:43,00:45:44,Yeah.
00:45:44,00:45:47,"But then also, Hallwell sold chili con carne."
00:45:47,00:45:51,"So he saw this thing with the Hallwell girls, working so well in America."
00:45:51,00:45:54,"So he thought, okay, I'm going to try and do it with chili con carne."
00:45:54,00:46:01,"So he created a mariachi band, which went round Mexico, trying to sell Hallwell chili"
00:46:01,00:46:02,con carne.
00:46:02,00:46:03,How did that go?
00:46:03,00:46:05,It sounds like it was less successful.
00:46:05,00:46:08,It was less successful.
00:46:08,00:46:10,Hormel's grandson was also in the arts.
00:46:10,00:46:11,He still is.
00:46:11,00:46:14,He's a guitarist and we all will have heard his work.
00:46:14,00:46:19,He's called Smoky Hormel and Smoky is his birth name.
00:46:19,00:46:20,That's not a nickname.
00:46:20,00:46:21,He was called Smoky.
00:46:21,00:46:26,It sounds like the company was too used to naming hams by that point.
00:46:26,00:46:28,And he's a he's a guitarist.
00:46:28,00:46:35,"He plays blues and country, but he also appears on albums by Adele and by Beck and by, yeah,"
00:46:35,00:46:36,Mick Jagger.
00:46:36,00:46:42,"And he's the main guitarist on what was Johnny Cash's big final major hit, Hurt, the Nine"
00:46:42,00:46:48,"Itch Nails cover, Kid Rock, Joe Strummer, I mean, he's done them all."
00:46:48,00:46:50,Hormel have a new innovation.
00:46:50,00:46:54,They've got a thing that they've just announced this October.
00:46:54,00:47:00,It's bacon scented face masks in a very 2020 story.
00:47:00,00:47:01,They say it has...
00:47:01,00:47:03,Is that to wear when you're asleep?
00:47:03,00:47:07,"No, it's to wear when you're going out and about and you want to smell bacon constantly."
00:47:07,00:47:09,Not like a face mask that covers your eyes.
00:47:09,00:47:10,Not a sleep mask.
00:47:10,00:47:13,"I mean, a COVID face mask."
00:47:13,00:47:17,You've been going around in these COVID times just wearing a sleep mask.
00:47:17,00:47:18,It's terrible.
00:47:18,00:47:19,I keep walking into people.
00:47:19,00:47:25,How are you supposed to keep two meters away from people when you can't even see them?
00:47:25,00:47:30,Because I was thinking like a sleep mask that smells of bacon is completely pointless because
00:47:30,00:47:33,"the smell of bacon famously wakes you up, doesn't it?"
00:47:33,00:47:39,"Oh, no, this is a this is a thing that they claim it has, and I'm quoting here, the latest"
00:47:39,00:47:40,in pork scented technology.
00:47:40,00:47:46,"I don't know what the last thing in pork scented technology was, but it says keep the delicious"
00:47:46,00:47:50,smell of bacon always wrapped around your nose.
00:47:50,00:47:51,Not sure.
00:47:51,00:47:58,"You can get a Spamurita along a similar vein, which is a Spam flavoured cocktail and Soho"
00:47:58,00:48:00,here in this very capital.
00:48:00,00:48:01,Wow.
00:48:01,00:48:02,Yeah.
00:48:02,00:48:08,"Get it a Jinju Korean restaurant in Soho and it's made of tequila, mezcal, agave nectar,"
00:48:08,00:48:09,pineapple and fresh lime.
00:48:09,00:48:14,Sounds absolutely delicious until you add the Spam.
00:48:14,00:48:18,"One more member of the Hormel family, which we'll talk about a few minutes ago, is James"
00:48:18,00:48:24,"Hormel, and he is the main donor of the Hormel Center of San Francisco Public Library, which"
00:48:24,00:48:32,"collects all the importance of LGBTQ books from the last 20, 30, 40 years of American"
00:48:32,00:48:33,history.
00:48:33,00:48:39,And he also was the first openly gay man to represent the U.S. as an ambassador.
00:48:39,00:48:46,"So this was under Clinton's administration, and they needed a new ambassador for Luxembourg,"
00:48:46,00:48:47,and they chose this guy.
00:48:47,00:48:51,"James Hormel obviously done a lot of philanthropy and stuff, and so he's a really good person"
00:48:51,00:48:55,"to have to do this, but the Republicans were just not having it."
00:48:55,00:49:00,"They were like, we cannot have an openly gay man representing the United States as an ambassador."
00:49:00,00:49:02,"So there's a massive, massive argument."
00:49:02,00:49:09,"And to support their argument, the Republicans went to the Hormel Library and then looked"
00:49:09,00:49:14,through all of their history and then found a load of what they regarded as very pornographic
00:49:14,00:49:15,things.
00:49:15,00:49:18,"And they said, look, this man supports pornography."
00:49:18,00:49:21,He shouldn't be representing the United States.
00:49:21,00:49:25,"And it got really, really high up this argument until it was pointed out that all of the works"
00:49:25,00:49:31,"that they pointed out were in his library, were also in the Library of Congress."
00:49:31,00:49:32,And then he became--
00:49:32,00:49:33,In your face.
00:49:33,00:49:34,Yeah.
00:49:34,00:49:35,Spam on your face.
00:49:35,00:49:42,Have you heard of Mark Benson?
00:49:42,00:49:43,No.
00:49:43,00:49:46,"Andy, you don't mean Mark Benson, do you?"
00:49:46,00:49:47,I do.
00:49:47,00:49:48,Give it his full name.
00:49:48,00:49:52,"Mark, I love spam, Benson."
00:49:52,00:49:59,And we're going from one grateful anthropist to another here out there.
00:49:59,00:50:00,Absolutely.
00:50:00,00:50:01,Absolutely.
00:50:01,00:50:05,"And what links them, a single can of spam?"
00:50:05,00:50:08,This is a spam lover called Mark Benson.
00:50:08,00:50:10,He's from the UK.
00:50:10,00:50:16,"And in 2017, he and his wife went to the festival in T-shirt saying, ""Mr and Mrs, I love spam"
00:50:16,00:50:17,"Benson."""
00:50:17,00:50:18,So his wife's on it too.
00:50:18,00:50:19,And he has changed his name.
00:50:19,00:50:21,So this is the Hawaiian festival they went to.
00:50:21,00:50:22,Yeah.
00:50:22,00:50:23,"Yes, they did."
00:50:23,00:50:24,Wow.
00:50:24,00:50:29,"And not only that, and not only has he legally changed his middle name to I Love Spam."
00:50:29,00:50:30,But they went--
00:50:30,00:50:34,"I think if Mark Benson really likes spam, he changes first name to I Love Spam."
00:50:34,00:50:38,"Actually, I think you can hide your middle name, can't you?"
00:50:38,00:50:40,That's a good point.
00:50:40,00:50:43,"I mean, he does have a T-shirt saying his name."
00:50:43,00:50:45,He's not gone very far to hide it.
00:50:45,00:50:49,"But they went to Hawaii after they went to the Spam Museum, which is-- where's that?"
00:50:49,00:50:50,Is it Minnesota?
00:50:50,00:50:52,It's at the headquarters.
00:50:52,00:50:53,They call it the--
00:50:53,00:50:54,Yes.
00:50:54,00:50:55,They call it the Guggenham.
00:50:55,00:50:56,Very clever.
00:50:56,00:51:01,But they went to the museum and they got married there.
00:51:01,00:51:02,They got married at the Spam Museum.
00:51:02,00:51:08,Spam's brand manager got themselves ordained in order to officiate at this wedding.
00:51:08,00:51:09,So--
00:51:09,00:51:10,So good.
00:51:10,00:51:11,It's the most spam-themed wedding ever.
00:51:11,00:51:12,So good.
00:51:12,00:51:13,You are now spam in life.
00:51:13,00:51:14,What on earth?
00:51:14,00:51:22,"He said, you know why he said he changed-- he loves Spam so much, or he said he changed"
00:51:22,00:51:29,his name as a tribute to Spam to his grandpa who worked in the Spam factory in Liverpool
00:51:29,00:51:31,and to the war effort.
00:51:31,00:51:32,OK.
00:51:32,00:51:34,Quite right.
00:51:34,00:51:37,"It's one way to remember the war, I think."
00:51:37,00:51:38,"That museum that's-- oh, go on, Andy."
00:51:38,00:51:39,You about to say something.
00:51:39,00:51:41,"Well, they've got some lovely children as well."
00:51:41,00:51:43,So we know at least they didn't need a Spam donor.
00:51:43,00:51:44,OK.
00:51:44,00:51:47,I'm glad I let you talk there.
00:51:47,00:51:53,That museum is in Austin in Minnesota and it sounds quite interesting.
00:51:53,00:51:58,They have volunteer guides that are known as Spambaciders and they walk around the Spam
00:51:58,00:52:05,"Museum with little bits of Spam on toothpicks, which they call Spumples."
00:52:05,00:52:07,"Oh, my gosh."
00:52:07,00:52:11,Did you guys hear about the 1990s Spam carving contest in Seattle?
00:52:11,00:52:12,No.
00:52:12,00:52:13,This was amazing.
00:52:13,00:52:18,"It ran for 10 years before being shut down, or maybe people lost interest, I don't know."
00:52:18,00:52:22,"But you were given two cans of Spam, one plastic knife and 15 minutes, right?"
00:52:22,00:52:27,"You were allowed to bring your own extra tools if you wanted to, but power tools and chainsaws"
00:52:27,00:52:29,were explicitly banned by your--
00:52:29,00:52:30,Sorry.
00:52:30,00:52:34,Two cans of Spam and you might want to use power tools.
00:52:34,00:52:37,"Well, you're absolutely right."
00:52:37,00:52:41,"You would have gone on very well with the organizers, James, because they said that's overkill."
00:52:41,00:52:44,"Well, sometimes it's hard to open those tins, isn't it?"
00:52:44,00:52:47,So you might need a sort of pneumatic drill to get in there.
00:52:47,00:52:51,"I think they're ringpools, aren't they?"
00:52:51,00:52:52,They are ringpools.
00:52:52,00:52:53,They are ringpools.
00:52:53,00:52:54,Yeah.
00:52:54,00:52:55,I'm looking at them upside down.
00:52:55,00:53:00,But there were so many good sounding winners.
00:53:00,00:53:03,"In 1994, the winner was Nude Descending a Staircase."
00:53:03,00:53:05,So I'm going to carve that in Spam in a quarter of an hour.
00:53:05,00:53:10,Are you sure that wasn't just a description of the person who'd won?
00:53:10,00:53:16,"I've not done a very good sculpture, but I am Nude and I am walking down the staircase."
00:53:16,00:53:23,"Other winners included Jurassic Pork, Spamhenge, very good, and my favorite, a model of singer"
00:53:23,00:53:27,Spammy Winnet singing Spam by Your Man.
00:53:27,00:53:31,"Okay, that's it."
00:53:31,00:53:32,That is all of our facts.
