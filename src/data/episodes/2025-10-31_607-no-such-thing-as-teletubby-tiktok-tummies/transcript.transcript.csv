00:00:02,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Nosy's Things of Fish, where we were"
00:00:05,00:00:08,"joined by the legend, Dan Shriver."
00:00:08,00:00:13,"Another legend, Adju Hotsamari, but the biggest legend of all, Ben Elton."
00:00:13,00:00:18,"Yeah, long-time listeners of the show will understand what a big deal this was for me in particular."
00:00:18,00:00:22,"He's my big, big hero, and he didn't this point. You guys are going to absolutely love him."
00:00:22,00:00:26,The reason he was on the show is because he's just ridden his autobiography.
00:00:26,00:00:30,"It's out now to Sunday Times bestseller this week. It's called ""What Have I Done?"""
00:00:30,00:00:33,"And it's the full story, you know, as you do in an autobiography."
00:00:33,00:00:35,Childhood through to current day.
00:00:35,00:00:36,"That's a typo, isn't it? It should be called ""What I Have Done."""
00:00:36,00:00:38,Is it too late to change?
00:00:38,00:00:40,I'll email you.
00:00:40,00:00:42,"There is a phrase, ""What have I done?"""
00:00:42,00:00:45,That's what he's going for. I understand now.
00:00:45,00:00:46,That's right now.
00:00:46,00:00:52,One interesting thing about Ben when he was on the show is he went on so many amazing big
00:00:52,00:00:59,"rambles, especially one a bit about his journey to having a new child, which was extremely"
00:00:59,00:01:04,"explicit, unbelievably funny. But you will not hear it if you listen to this episode because it"
00:01:04,00:01:07,goes in the XL version. There was a little bit rude for this episode.
00:01:07,00:01:10,"If you want to hear that, you're going to have to go to Club Fish."
00:01:10,00:01:13,That's right. You may have heard on last week's show. We have just gussied up Club Fish.
00:01:13,00:01:17,"And if you want and free episodes and bonus content and all kinds of extra stuff,"
00:01:17,00:01:22,you can go to patreon.com/nosuchthingasaffish and see what kind of extra stuff you
00:01:22,00:01:25,can get. And also see how you can support the show. That's right.
00:01:25,00:01:30,"But for now, enjoy Fish and one of the greatest sitcom riders in British comedy history,"
00:01:30,00:01:34,"the guy behind the young ones, the black adder, upstart crow,"
00:01:34,00:01:42,"books like popcorn, maybe baby. And again, his latest book, ""What Have I Done?"" on with the show."
00:01:42,00:01:50,[Imitation]
00:01:50,00:01:59,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:59,00:02:04,to you from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew
00:02:04,00:02:10,"Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Ben Elton. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:10,00:02:15,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:15,00:02:22,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Ben. My fact for this week is the actor who played"
00:02:22,00:02:29,Tinky Winky was removed from his role because his interpretation of the role was not acceptable.
00:02:29,00:02:37,"I mean, how would they tell? I don't know. Well, yeah, this was Dave Thompson."
00:02:37,00:02:42,"Yes, I mean, I'm bringing that out of my fact. It concerns a very dear friend of mine. But I think,"
00:02:42,00:02:50,"you know, my second oldest friend, not to go into abstract detail. My oldest friend is Gabby Glaster,"
00:02:50,00:02:59,who played Bob in Black Adder and my second oldest friend played Tinky Winky. I really only befriended
00:02:59,00:03:06,"people who would like to play pretty famous characters. Dave Thompson has a very, very great"
00:03:06,00:03:12,"stand-up comic, a very interesting comic muse in general. And he got a great break at one point"
00:03:12,00:03:17,in his career in the E audition for Ann was cast as Tinky Winky because he did an enormous
00:03:17,00:03:23,"amount of physical theatre in his day. He did a, he was originally, I did a lot of teaching. I'm"
00:03:23,00:03:30,"working with kids with special needs using theatre, etc. So very good with his tall, wonderful body."
00:03:30,00:03:34,"He got the job as Tinky Winky and gave a lot of thought to it. I mean, it isn't actually a"
00:03:34,00:03:38,"simple as you think. Well, surely they just all kind of go around these enormous costumes."
00:03:38,00:03:42,"I think the reason it was a success was because there was character. But for some reason,"
00:03:42,00:03:48,"they sacked him. And I don't, I think somebody was, because I think it was Dave's idea to give Tinky"
00:03:48,00:03:54,"Winky a handbag. And I think in those days, I don't know if that's a fact or not, but I think it"
00:03:54,00:03:59,might be. I think that's about as far as you get with facts these days. It might be. And I think
00:03:59,00:04:03,there was some sort of weird idea that that might suggest you was gay and a weird idea that
00:04:03,00:04:08,"that was a bad thing. It was a numerous things. The handbag was one, which I read in one interview,"
00:04:08,00:04:12,Dave says it wasn't a handbag. It was like a magic bag. It could do magical things. So that's why Tinky
00:04:12,00:04:20,"Winky had it. It was a handbag. It was a handbag. And Dave, come on. I think Dave's had decades to"
00:04:20,00:04:25,"talk about this now, right? So he's probably adding a little bit. Purple supposedly was a colour to"
00:04:25,00:04:30,"suggest this. This is all man. Yeah, it's all man. Fake controversy. It sounds really ice cold."
00:04:30,00:04:35,"The way he got his, like, tubby vibe eyes. He was on his way to a rap party and he was just drawn"
00:04:35,00:04:40,to one side and handed a letter from the company. You mean end of series rather than they were all
00:04:40,00:04:46,"going to get down and something. But one of them was a Jamaican, through a lot of Jamaican dance moves."
00:04:46,00:04:51,"I believe it's the guy who played Dipsy, through a lot of dancehall stuff in interpretation. Anyway,"
00:04:51,00:04:56,"no, but the rap end of series party and he just got told that's it. But he has said since then,"
00:04:56,00:05:01,I'm proud of my work for them. I was always the one to test out the limitations of the costume. I
00:05:01,00:05:09,"was the first to fall off my chair. I took all the risks. He's a big physical comedian fan as well,"
00:05:09,00:05:13,right? Laurel and Hardy were his big influencers and so on. That's what he thought he was doing inside.
00:05:13,00:05:18,"I don't, I have no idea what I said. I know he was, he has a say, he's a friend of mine and I know"
00:05:18,00:05:23,"he was deeply upset. He was devastated. I think since then, the notoriety, you know, he's,"
00:05:23,00:05:30,"it's in interest. I don't know whether you do better in a comedy career, playing Tinky Winky or"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"having been sacked from playing Tinky Winky. I can't believe maybe the latter. I don't know, but at the"
00:05:34,00:05:40,"time, because he actually did invest as he does in all his work, a great deal of his, you know,"
00:05:40,00:05:47,"artistry and, you know, he took it very seriously. I think he felt, you know, very undermined. What is his"
00:05:47,00:05:51,voice like? Because I read he said that one of the reasons that he left might have been because
00:05:51,00:05:57,they didn't use his voice. They dubbed him over with another actor. He doesn't have a very strong
00:05:57,00:06:04,"accent. Well, I don't think I'll kind of go. But he was, and he's, he's Darth Vader. Yeah, it's David"
00:06:04,00:06:09,"Prouse all over. It's one guy in the suit. Yeah. Some of them did their own voices, but the other three"
00:06:09,00:06:14,did their own voices. That I didn't know. And he was the only one redone. I didn't really care until
00:06:14,00:06:21,"now, but then his voice was done by a guy called Mark Heenahan, who his other big role was playing"
00:06:21,00:06:27,"Wyndham B. Johnson in a TV series called Fox. I literally, the man who's known really now"
00:06:27,00:06:32,"finally for hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids to kill today with a Vietnam war. It was actually the voice of"
00:06:32,00:06:39,"one of a children's favourite. There's a, there's a kind of irony stretching across the decades there."
00:06:39,00:06:43,"There's got another one. I'm Ditsy, John Symmet. He was a comedian as well. So it's great knowing"
00:06:43,00:06:48,"that there were comedians inside. He's also a charmander on a Pikachu and friends cartoon. Yeah, they've"
00:06:48,00:06:53,"all got amazing credits. This is all after our time. Yeah, I mean, the TeleTab, is it? Are they still going?"
00:06:53,00:06:58,"Is that all? Yeah, I watched it this morning. Have you got kids or are you just... I have a three-year-old."
00:06:58,00:07:03,"It was after she'd gone to the earth three then I put it up. Yeah, you just skinned up Adobe in it,"
00:07:03,00:07:08,because apparently that's what was originally the big thing was students sort of like getting started.
00:07:08,00:07:13,"When it started, I was a student and we used to get up at like 11 o'clock in the morning,"
00:07:13,00:07:17,"like students do and just put TeleTab, he's on and watch that. Yeah, every morning we used to do that."
00:07:17,00:07:24,"Well, you know what they say, don't you? It was a number one single. We actually pastished that in"
00:07:24,00:07:31,"we will rock you, my Queen musical, because it's about the future of the world in which rock and"
00:07:31,00:07:37,"roll has been forgotten and all music is kind of electro. It's pop, you know, computerised pop"
00:07:37,00:07:42,"created and streamed directly from the sort of conglomerate, whatever. Anyway, one of the things"
00:07:42,00:07:46,"was that people are trying to remember back to the age of rock, but they really don't get it,"
00:07:46,00:07:50,"so they discover that, you know, this song was a number one. TeleTab is say, oh,"
00:07:50,00:07:55,and they treat it with the same reverence as sort of satisfaction and I want to hold your hand.
00:07:55,00:08:00,"Anyway, anyway, that's amazing. You know, it was created by a guy called Andrew Davenport,"
00:08:00,00:08:04,"and the whole, I didn't actually know that trippiness and spoken splits was associated with"
00:08:04,00:08:09,"TeleTab is because the one I associate that with, which is actually more LSD, is in the night"
00:08:09,00:08:14,"garden, which is the trippiest of shows. And it's got eagle piggle and same creatures. Same"
00:08:14,00:08:22,creators as well as me. Lala in the reboot of TeleTab is the same actor plays up to Daisy.
00:08:22,00:08:27,"Oh, my God, and so there is. There's the same universe. It's a sort of universe that was"
00:08:27,00:08:32,"TeleTab is rebooted. I mean, what was the? Yeah. The one that I watched this morning was very"
00:08:32,00:08:36,"different than the one I watched when I was a student. Right. Okay. And I mean, I don't want to"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"bore your listeners, but I mean, I'm quite interested. What difference, I mean, was the"
00:08:39,00:08:44,"hill a different color? No, the hill was the same. I think they just get into a few more scrapes"
00:08:44,00:08:50,"and also the plot. Yeah, there's how could there? I mean, literally tension pack. The"
00:08:50,00:08:54,"B.O. is different as well. The voiceover is different. Like, immediately I was like, this isn't"
00:08:54,00:08:59,what I grew up on. Do the screens in their tummies? Are they now vertical for the age of
00:08:59,00:09:05,"virtual video? Yeah, they're all tech talks. Yeah. It's funny how you don't like change. One"
00:09:05,00:09:10,"doesn't like change. I remember having, you know, watched an awful lot of dumbass the dang engine"
00:09:10,00:09:15,"goes round and round and round when my kids were very small. I happen to see one with, I don't know,"
00:09:15,00:09:20,"it's a nephew or something. And they've gone all CGI. So they're not real, they're not real"
00:09:20,00:09:26,"models anymore. And I just, I wanted to write to someone. I bid over the times. There also run by"
00:09:26,00:09:32,Italian and French companies these days. Do you see what he did? A little bit of politics because
00:09:32,00:09:40,"it's gracious. HS2 across Sodor is very, very slow. Can I tell you guys about Lala? Yeah. So Lala"
00:09:40,00:09:46,"was Nikki Smedley. She has since done a one woman show, Confessions of a Telly Tubby. And she found,"
00:09:46,00:09:49,you couldn't say you were a Telly Tubby at the time. I think in the early days when she'd just been
00:09:49,00:09:54,"cast and the first things were going out, they all signed NDAs. So you couldn't confess it."
00:09:54,00:09:59,"But she had originally, her previous job as far as I can tell, was fronting the garage rock girl"
00:09:59,00:10:07,group Psychopussy. And that doesn't get you sang for the sit. And all they did was fall off his chair.
00:10:07,00:10:14,Oh my goodness. That's amazing. That is a brilliant fact. That's amazing. But that doesn't seem to
00:10:14,00:10:19,matter in children's entertainment. There's the biggest children's entertainer. It's called Blippi.
00:10:19,00:10:24,"And it's a huge character in America. It's sold, I think, for like a billion dollars in the states"
00:10:24,00:10:28,"as a brand. The guy who plays Blippi, that's not his first career. Similar sort of"
00:10:28,00:10:32,alternative career to begin with. Yeah. He was a prankster. There's a video online that you can see
00:10:32,00:10:38,of Blippi taking a poo on his friend's chest. Just the people. That would make any child laugh.
00:10:38,00:10:44,"I think that probably the best kids gaggy ever did. But the Barney character, he's now, he does"
00:10:44,00:10:51,"tantric sex massage. Yeah. He's so interesting. They've joined us. I read about, yeah, they've joined us."
00:10:51,00:10:56,"So he wasn't the original Barney. He took over his Barney. And then, and he supposedly,"
00:10:56,00:11:00,"to get into the suit itself, he said, he used tantric. He used a lube."
00:11:00,00:11:08,What is a tantric sex massage? I think so. I think so. Is this where you thought today was
00:11:08,00:11:11,going when he came into the office? I don't know. I have to bring out my personal stories. But
00:11:11,00:11:17,I'll tell you what it is. It's they effectively put you in a headspace where you can start feeling your
00:11:17,00:11:22,your energy growing to the point of culminating in an orgasm. So you don't necessarily have to have
00:11:22,00:11:27,"someone touching you. So it might be a verbal massage. Somebody's saying, you know, I mean, we all"
00:11:27,00:11:33,got the entire world learnt the phrase tantric sex at exactly the same moment when sting and
00:11:33,00:11:40,"trudy announced that they spent a year shacking or something without, without pause. And everybody kind"
00:11:40,00:11:44,of heard this and everybody had a giggle about sting and trudy. And I don't think anybody ever really
00:11:44,00:11:49,"asked, well, I said, what, I mean, what is tantric sex? I mean, is it, is it a different position?"
00:11:49,00:11:53,"Is it? No, it's a slow process. I think we're stinging trudy. It was them sitting across from each"
00:11:53,00:11:57,"other, staring at each other's eyes for about four hours and slowly getting it. Tantric is really"
00:11:57,00:12:05,"terrible boring. I mean, I think it's so much better when you shag. I mean, five minutes is fine. I mean,"
00:12:05,00:12:10,"anyway, I as a tantric sex is something mystery. I must look it up. So you're saying about people sort"
00:12:10,00:12:17,of all learning things at the same time. Do you know toy story? Does this bit and toy story
00:12:17,00:12:23,"where Andy, the child walks in and all the toys flop down? Yeah. Okay. So in, which toy stories?"
00:12:23,00:12:27,Is this the first one? I believe it's in all of them that this happens. All right. I must have
00:12:27,00:12:33,"met, I haven't seen any of them, but I have read the transcripts of all of them. That is true."
00:12:33,00:12:42,"Sounds like tantric watching the two stories. It's just not as good. Yeah, they do. We'll never"
00:12:42,00:12:47,"trouble or an animal. Yeah. So in Disney theme parks, they had all these toy story characters. So"
00:12:47,00:12:53,"there's people in costumes. And then whenever anyone shouted ""Andy's coming,"" all the actors"
00:12:53,00:12:58,would just fall to the floor. Is it like a cool little... Safe to eat Thompson would be great
00:12:58,00:13:05,"in when I was character. Amazing. It was like a little sort of hidden thing, but then it went viral"
00:13:05,00:13:10,on the internet and suddenly everyone learned it at the same time. And so there was one day when every
00:13:10,00:13:14,"single person who walked into the theme park just shouted ""Andy's coming,"" and all the actors had"
00:13:14,00:13:19,to the floor to the floor. And it lasted one more day and they just stopped doing the whole thing.
00:13:19,00:13:24,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's so funny. So people can't be trusted with a global fact, you know?"
00:13:24,00:13:30,They just kind of spoil it for everyone by overdoing it. I read this amazing story. I was reading about
00:13:30,00:13:34,people trapped inside big costumes trying to see if there was anything else. And I came across a
00:13:34,00:13:40,"kind of different story about a kid, a 12-year-old called Martin's Pistorius. He had a mystery illness"
00:13:40,00:13:45,"where he fell into a coma for years and years, but he was conscious inside the coma. So he was completely"
00:13:45,00:13:49,aware of what was going on. Yeah. And he kept trying as hard as he could to break out of it. Nothing
00:13:49,00:13:54,"could happen. And he is now out of it. In fact, he's like a wheelchair racer. He's got kids. He's got"
00:13:54,00:13:59,"family. And the thing that broke him out is that when he was 12, they put him into a hospital and they"
00:13:59,00:14:06,"played non-stop reruns of Barney to him. And he got so annoyed with the song. I love you. That he went,"
00:14:06,00:14:10,"I can't, I can't be in this coma anymore. And he decided to train himself. And it took him years,"
00:14:10,00:14:15,"but through anger of Barney, he trained himself to know when it was daytime, to know how to move the"
00:14:15,00:14:19,muscles of his lips when he was trying to smile at someone. And they slowly recognized it and they
00:14:19,00:14:25,"helped him coach him out of it. I had to say one of, you know, I'm sure everyone shares it. I mean,"
00:14:25,00:14:30,"the terror, I think it's called locked-in syndrome. Yes. I remember reading about one person. Is it"
00:14:30,00:14:36,"something that butterflies or something? The story, a French bloke. And he, you know, he was there,"
00:14:36,00:14:42,"a sports game on. And the nurse just turned the tele off at night and, you know, he'd been watching it."
00:14:42,00:14:46,"And in the anger, I'm afraid it didn't pop him out. But he also somehow managed to, because he's"
00:14:46,00:14:52,"obviously told that story since. But goodness gracious. I mean, the idea, and you can't even ask"
00:14:52,00:14:58,them to kill you. You literally can't do anything. Yeah. Barney took a lot of flak. Barney took a lot
00:14:58,00:15:02,of flak. People hated Barney. I think this is that repetitive song and all of this. But the guy who
00:15:02,00:15:06,"played Barney, as we say, David Joyner, he is a very interesting guy. Do you know what his previous"
00:15:06,00:15:13,"job was? Got him. He was a mannequin in shop windows. Oh, what's a live mannequin? A live mannequin."
00:15:13,00:15:17,"He did it for a few dollars an hour. Right. And he claimed that after a year, he was so good at it that"
00:15:17,00:15:23,he was charging a hundred dollars an hour. A hundred dollars. You can buy a mannequin. I would have
00:15:23,00:15:30,thought I know why would I. I just don't believe this story. He said he changed his clothes every
00:15:30,00:15:34,"hour. You know, so you got a little fashion show. So as you walk to work, the mannequin is wearing"
00:15:34,00:15:39,something and then he's you walk back. Is he just holding? Is he holding still the whole time?
00:15:39,00:15:43,"I believe so. I mean, there's there's there's the Covent Garden is literally full of people with"
00:15:43,00:15:49,this skill. They paint themselves silver and and stand there. I'm afraid you obviously do facts
00:15:49,00:15:55,"at UI, but I don't think that's a fact. No, he claims it. Yeah, he claims it, right?"
00:15:55,00:15:58,"It's from him. Yeah. I think there was some political control. I mean, I don't know. It's an"
00:15:58,00:16:03,"American thing. I know I wouldn't even know what Barney looked like, but certainly not this irritating"
00:16:03,00:16:07,"song, but I think there was something to do. Did it go woke or something? Did it? Did it? Did it"
00:16:07,00:16:12,always? I was always worried. Did it annoy the the people who like don't like things going
00:16:12,00:16:15,work? I think it's been canceled too long to have gone work. Barney's not have been around for a
00:16:15,00:16:20,"long time. Not canceled. So it was canceled the whole time. In the original song. Yes, imagine that,"
00:16:20,00:16:24,"like we look back now. We say, oh, you know, what is shaming? I think they canceled play for the day."
00:16:24,00:16:29,"Oh, what did they say? Did they say something mean about it?"
00:16:29,00:16:40,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is that the British Army used"
00:16:40,00:16:51,"lances until 1927. Wow. I'm surprised it was that early that they got rid of it. Really? I mean,"
00:16:51,00:16:56,"if you think about it, we got what the nuclear bomb 20 years later. In 20 years before that,"
00:16:56,00:17:00,"we were just using big sticks. Yeah, but it's insane. I don't think they were using. What do you"
00:17:00,00:17:06,"think about it? In fact, after that, I mean, the poor Polish cavalry would slaughter in 1939,"
00:17:06,00:17:15,"because they also used lances, right? It took a long time for armies to get over, you know,"
00:17:15,00:17:21,the old ways. Who knew that soldiers might be reactionary old dickheads or some of them at least.
00:17:21,00:17:26,"Can I just say, Ben, that Andy is very, very excited to talk about lances. I'm so excited. I"
00:17:26,00:17:31,"could just see as you were talking, he was like, yeah, yeah, right? Well, I mean, let's, but as I say,"
00:17:31,00:17:36,"I don't think the British Army was certainly wasn't the last, because the polls, you know,"
00:17:36,00:17:44,"were you seeing which it alas is a very sharp poll, but they were very sharp. I'm listening. I mean,"
00:17:44,00:17:50,"we're actually talking about a military disaster and a human disaster, of course, but it is true to say,"
00:17:50,00:17:56,"I mean, I think the last British charge, since you've got me honest, I like history, was Churchill"
00:17:56,00:18:02,"was involved in. So we got lots of interesting links here. Was it 189, Omderman? Or so it was,"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"say cartoon? Yes, I think that was the last, well, it was one of the last. This is the thing. I can't"
00:18:06,00:18:10,"believe the man who wrote black adr is saying, well, this was actually a military, a human disaster."
00:18:10,00:18:16,"I know, we've got to get some comedy out of there. Well, exactly. I mean, my grandfather got"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"annoyed with me because he thought we were laughing at the expense of the British Army and my,"
00:18:20,00:18:24,"my grandfather, my uncle, who was a historian, but also had served in the British Army in the second"
00:18:24,00:18:31,"world war, but was also saved by the British Army because my uncle and my father's family were Jewish"
00:18:31,00:18:36,"refugees from the Nazis. So they were, they were very conscious of what we owed to Britain and also what"
00:18:36,00:18:41,"we owed to the armed forces who, in 1944, just by what the Americans might like to tell you,"
00:18:41,00:18:46,"that they won the second world war on their own. There was a year during which Britain stood alone,"
00:18:46,00:18:51,"after which most of the BMR was involved with the Russian. But anyway, let's not get on to"
00:18:51,00:18:56,get on to that whole of the second world war. We're going to stick on this quick. Go Andy.
00:18:56,00:19:02,"Sorry, I didn't even finish about what my uncle thought and now you've moved on it. So you're like"
00:19:02,00:19:07,mountain goats leaping from crag to crag. I can't possibly follow that. I want to hear what your
00:19:07,00:19:12,"uncle thought, first of all? Well, very briefly, he wrote to me when black ad ad goes forth came out."
00:19:12,00:19:19,"He was a little sort of guy. He had a slightly German accent in he wrote. Obviously, it wasn't a voicemail,"
00:19:19,00:19:24,"but I could hear his voice in the letter. He said, I'm very disappointed here that you're making"
00:19:24,00:19:30,"easy swipes at the army. Your father, who scoured you? That's the phrase he used for."
00:19:30,00:19:37,"That's come to my study, boy. It's a totaletry, really, in it, because your father obviously"
00:19:37,00:19:43,"scoured you. But anyway, he said, owed his freedom as do I to the British army, etc. You did"
00:19:43,00:19:49,"very well with black ad ad to, but I don't approve. I wrote back and I said, this is just not the case."
00:19:49,00:19:56,"I think it's a very respectful, but obviously the humour that Thomas themselves had, anyway,"
00:19:56,00:20:03,"watched a bit more of it and said, he said, what an old bastard. He said, I've watched it since and"
00:20:03,00:20:08,"I've decided perhaps I was too hasty with my criticism, but you shouldn't be so sensitive to it."
00:20:08,00:20:14,"I thought, bloody hell, he's having it both ways, isn't he? Anyway, back to lances."
00:20:16,00:20:20,He must be the oldie person in history who thinks that the fourth black ad was the worst one.
00:20:20,00:20:25,"Oh no, he, as I say, he didn't. He left a bit quick. He said jokes about idiotic officers and"
00:20:25,00:20:30,"things. It wasn't that, it's not that cut and dry, etc. Although actually, the bloody"
00:20:30,00:20:39,"mindiness that hags inability to think outside the box, Churchill again, in trying to develop the"
00:20:39,00:20:44,"tank, thinking outside the box, Gallipoli for all that it was a disaster, the idea to break the"
00:20:44,00:20:49,"deadlock in the Western Front. Look, I'm auditioning for the rest is history. I want everybody to know"
00:20:49,00:20:56,that this podcast is just a leap for me to an even bigger podcast. And that's really the only reason I'm here.
00:20:56,00:21:04,"So please, back to lances. Now, now, I'm afraid we've run out of time. I've got this."
00:21:04,00:21:09,"Cavalry Lance. Okay, I'll tell you where I got this first of all. I went recently to the Royal"
00:21:09,00:21:14,"Armories in Leeds, which is a ginormous museum of arms and armor and armaments. It's absolutely"
00:21:14,00:21:17,"unbelievable. All the way from I think they're having a sort of Roman exhibition at the moment,"
00:21:17,00:21:22,all the way to I would like to live there. It's so good. Oh my god. I'm going. It's incredible.
00:21:22,00:21:27,"And basically, I met some of the curators there. I just want to give a shout out to Henry Yalop."
00:21:27,00:21:33,He is the keeper of edged weapons. What a title. It's so cool. I wish we'd had that when we were
00:21:33,00:21:41,"very black at it. Every weapon has an edge. Well, that's true. Yeah. They got some blunt. Look, I"
00:21:41,00:21:46,"talk. There's a mathematician. Sorry. Lances. Lances. You have a round age. I mean, as a club,"
00:21:46,00:21:50,"got an age, as a circle got an edge. Back to lances. Thank you."
00:21:50,00:21:55,"Basically, the point. So he told me this amazing thing that the British Army kept them in service"
00:21:55,00:22:01,until 1927. And it was common among European armies as someone that's actually very amazing.
00:22:01,00:22:05,"But anyway, carry on. All right. Yeah. I don't know if I'm having a go at your fight."
00:22:05,00:22:13,"But basically, most European armies had it in service because this is the thing I love about it,"
00:22:13,00:22:18,is I think it might be the ancient world weapon that lasted the longest into modern militaries.
00:22:18,00:22:22,"As in, both and arrows were not used in any mass way. One of the other ones, swords were not"
00:22:22,00:22:28,used in a mass way this late. Lances stayed in service. And it's basically because one of the most
00:22:28,00:22:33,"effective things you can do is have a very long stick and poke it into someone else. I mean, the Romans"
00:22:33,00:22:37,"had a version of the lance called the Contos or the Iranian cavalry. Sorry. 20th century,"
00:22:37,00:22:41,it lasted to. That was the first century to the 20th century. I read another couple of theories
00:22:41,00:22:46,"as to why they lasted. Number one, that people in the army sort of fancised of these cavalry"
00:22:46,00:22:51,charges. Absolutely. And then another thing is that they like pig sticking. So just it's like
00:22:51,00:22:57,a sport. That was like a boring race. That was really popular in the army. So people pet
00:22:57,00:23:03,them for that reason. But it wasn't basically just a really successful thing as well. And it kind
00:23:03,00:23:08,"of we should say, a lance is just for anyone who not familiar with it, a lance is a spear that you"
00:23:08,00:23:12,"don't throw. You know, it's held mostly by heavy cavalry if you're trying to break up an enemy"
00:23:12,00:23:17,"formation or charge or sort of, it's a really disruptive weapon, you know. Imagine it in like a"
00:23:17,00:23:25,"joust in competition, you hold it. It was a successful weapon, but with the emergence of the"
00:23:25,00:23:32,"machine gun, it became instantly a not successful weapon and it took them very much too long a time"
00:23:32,00:23:39,"to notice. I mean, the fact that the military hierarchies worldwide were unable to sort of think"
00:23:39,00:23:46,"beyond the horse because it had been so, you know, 2003,000 years. I mean, I think it's more the"
00:23:46,00:23:52,horse that they couldn't bear to get rid of because the idea of a cavalry charge remains such an
00:23:52,00:23:57,exciting thing if you're of a military turn of mind. And militaries were still hugely reliant on horses
00:23:57,00:24:02,"for transport in general, you know, millions of horses in both one wars. Absolutely. But the lance"
00:24:02,00:24:06,"had this really good thing where it went out of fashion in about the 17th and 18th century,"
00:24:06,00:24:11,"when pistols came in. And then it came back. Yeah, what was the, I saw that that it went gone"
00:24:11,00:24:15,around that time. What brought it back? It basically poled and hungry had amazingly effective
00:24:15,00:24:20,"cavalry. Right. And guns were not very good at the time. You know, they weren't, you know,"
00:24:20,00:24:23,"they were slow to reload and they were, they were not very accurate over very long distances."
00:24:23,00:24:28,"And, and it went so well for the Polish and Hungarian cavalry that Napoleon adopted it and then"
00:24:28,00:24:33,the British army. So the whole of the 19th century was this huge renaissance for the lance.
00:24:33,00:24:38,"I think it's more to do with colonialism. I think battles between Western armies, the lance may"
00:24:38,00:24:42,"have, they may have used it, but I don't, I mean, if you, if you've only got to read the charge of"
00:24:42,00:24:48,"the light brigade, I mean, lance is against cannon. Even before the invention of the Gatling gun,"
00:24:48,00:24:53,"what's that? The end of the 19th century. For me, the cavalry charges, you know, they were,"
00:24:53,00:24:56,they were useful against an army that didn't have guns. It's against infantry. And there was a
00:24:56,00:25:01,"loop. Waterloo was a hugely used, as in Napoleon's use. Again, yeah, no, you're right. I mean, as long"
00:25:01,00:25:06,"as you couldn't reload very quickly, although we famously know the British square with three ranks,"
00:25:06,00:25:11,"each reloading and firing in, in, in order. Anyway, back to the light. And the Anne Wunderin, like,"
00:25:11,00:25:16,"drones, like knocking a drone out with a big stick. Maybe they're going to come back."
00:25:16,00:25:22,"I don't, don't tease me. In, in, it's sort of in, it's sort of around the crumb million times. Did"
00:25:22,00:25:26,"they have very, very long launches? I got this idea. There was a, a time when they got longer."
00:25:26,00:25:32,"They did get longer when they, they became impractically long. Yeah. Well, you know, pikes, which are"
00:25:32,00:25:37,the basically spears you stick in the ground to prevent enemy cavalry. Those are about five meters long.
00:25:37,00:25:41,"I mean, they're really, really long. They almost wheeled that. No, no, no, no, that's to stick in the"
00:25:41,00:25:45,"ground and prevent a cavalry. But they, they almost had an exciting comeback of their own back in"
00:25:45,00:25:50,"World War II. Because Churchill, yeah, Churchill wrote things saying, every man must have a weapon of"
00:25:50,00:25:56,"some sort, be it only a mace or a pike. They took him at his word. They produced 250,000 of them"
00:25:56,00:26:00,"to give out to all the soldiers. Yeah. And someone said, we can't give them pikes. What are you doing?"
00:26:00,00:26:06,They've got machine guns out there. Wow. I want to know the provenance of this fact. I've read
00:26:06,00:26:10,"an awful lot of books on World War II. Okay. Never come across that one. Well, it was, it was"
00:26:10,00:26:16,"discussed by Godfrey Nicholson, the MP. We all know how much sense and how much truth."
00:26:16,00:26:22,"Nicholson, though, he was a man of honor, wasn't he? It was known as Croft's Pike, because he was"
00:26:22,00:26:29,"sure. We sure were not thinking of Lawrence Gortwald Pike. I get all sounds, all my facts for British"
00:26:29,00:26:38,psychology. It sounds to me like Nicholson was a very stupid boy. Can I tell you about Mrs.
00:26:38,00:26:44,"Hertha Ayrton. I love her. She was a citizen scientist, and she was aware that there was a problem"
00:26:44,00:26:49,"with gas. First of all, war first, big use of poison gas on the Western front. So she invented"
00:26:49,00:26:57,the anti-gas fan. And it's just a large fan. It's a handheld fan. It's one of those where you can't
00:26:57,00:27:03,"snap it out and flirt with it. It's just like an open fan. Oh, sure. It wasn't an electric"
00:27:03,00:27:08,"fan. It was a panic. This was the first world war. It was just a handheld and they made 100,000 of"
00:27:08,00:27:13,"these and distributed them along the Western front. It's not a weird idea, though. Like soldiers with"
00:27:13,00:27:18,"their fans. Do we call it an invention? I mean, surely. She just, she came up with a good use"
00:27:18,00:27:23,"for something which already existed. I mean, she said, why don't we fan gas away? Nobody said,"
00:27:23,00:27:28,"""My goodness, what shall we use?"" I'm a gas away. Ben, I like to acknowledge female inventors,"
00:27:28,00:27:34,"actually, and so can you. Well, I'm with you on that. You know, as we all know, Mrs. Allwell wrote"
00:27:34,00:27:41,"1984, apparently, according to a new biography. She wrote another thing called 1984, which she might"
00:27:41,00:27:47,"have based her slightly on. Well, it's just the title, I think. It was a poem. Anyway, let's not start"
00:27:47,00:27:54,"to bunking history debunkers. It's a very good thing to find the influences of women in history,"
00:27:54,00:27:58,"so we certainly don't want to be poop-pooping that. It's like a children's entertainer on a,"
00:27:58,00:28:03,on a chest. On a chest. Just looping back.
00:28:03,00:28:15,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that in 1962,"
00:28:15,00:28:20,a baby was successfully conceived thanks to a new fertility drug that contained
00:28:20,00:28:28,"Pope approved nuns urine. Yeah, this is, so this is the story of Perginol. Perginol is a drug that has"
00:28:28,00:28:34,"been used for decades and decades to help people who have got fertility problems. Back in the 1940s,"
00:28:34,00:28:40,there was a guy called Pierre Donini. He was a scientist who was working on extracting and purifying
00:28:40,00:28:46,FSH and LH. So these are hormones that we produce in our body to stimulate production of sperm and
00:28:46,00:28:51,produce testosterone in men. They use for women to grow and function their ovaries to produce a
00:28:51,00:28:55,trigger ovulation. They're really important. He's the person who isolated them and tried to work out
00:28:55,00:29:01,what to do with them. So another guy comes along who is studying the exact same thing and finds out
00:29:01,00:29:06,about Donini's discovery and says we could change the whole system of people trying to get pregnant.
00:29:06,00:29:12,"And this was Bruno Luninfeld. Yeah, exactly. Bruno Luninfeld. And so they approached this company,"
00:29:12,00:29:18,"Serrano, where Donini worked. They said, could we try this out? In order to try this out, we need"
00:29:18,00:29:23,"gallons and gallons of urine. And we need to find out where to get that from. And they said, it's a"
00:29:23,00:29:27,"great idea, but we don't want to put our stuff into this. We can't do this. There was a guy on the"
00:29:27,00:29:34,"board who happened to be the nephew of the current Pope. Okay. And he said, the Pope has approved that"
00:29:34,00:29:38,the nuns that the Pope has access to will be the providers. Not that he has access.
00:29:38,00:29:48,Not direct. It's not a tantric besides sort of situation. No. He has access to
00:29:48,00:29:53,"influence. He has influence. And he's approved the fact that if you ask them, they the Pope says he's"
00:29:53,00:30:01,"okay. Because his postman of paurs or large groups of older women, yeah. And they can't be"
00:30:01,00:30:06,pregnant either. And they can't be pregnant. That would spoil it. Medieval nuns wouldn't have done.
00:30:06,00:30:12,"No naughty nuns. In the modern. Well, that is very interesting. You say Pope approved,"
00:30:12,00:30:18,"because if that's kind of the big fact, it's like, you know, a Pope approved nuns urine,"
00:30:18,00:30:24,"where it's actually, I think, nuns urine is probably the more interesting part of that sentence,"
00:30:24,00:30:29,but which because it really is that that way of what is sort of interesting way they arrived at
00:30:29,00:30:34,"finding the stuff they needed. But I mean, did he have to approve it like we by we or"
00:30:34,00:30:41,was it just a general? Did a purple bull that he said you can anyone can use nuns we it's fine by me.
00:30:41,00:30:47,"I don't think he was project manager. No, I think he allowed it to just get on with it. Let's each"
00:30:47,00:30:54,trickle. Okay. It took 10 nuns 10 days to produce enough urine for one treatment. It's 10 nuns
00:30:54,00:31:00,spend 10 days to get a gallon of urine. How long does it take five nuns for something?
00:31:00,00:31:06,"GCSE Italian magic. 10 nuns 10 days to produce it. I mean, they weren't obviously spending all day."
00:31:06,00:31:10,"They basically, when they had a weed, they kept it and it, you know, they needed that much of it. I know."
00:31:10,00:31:16,I think it's it's less dramatic when you unpack that sentence. It's coming for you. He's coming for
00:31:16,00:31:22,you. I saw it covered. So do worry. It's it's 100 nun days. It's 100 nun weeks. It's not a day. It's
00:31:22,00:31:26,"going to be the day. You don't need to have one we a day. Well, you're right. No, you're right. You"
00:31:26,00:31:30,"probably five. Actually, you're absolutely right. Well, well done. I probably have these days. I'm"
00:31:30,00:31:36,66. I have one we a minute. So you're right. I have to knot it just to get through lunch. You know.
00:31:36,00:31:44,But one part of this that you're missing out there is that the Vatican owned 25% of Serrano
00:31:44,00:31:50,this company. So that was the reason they were so interested in going for this. The Pope had a
00:31:50,00:31:56,"dog in the game. It's a stunning. So the collection is insane. I mean, just because that was one"
00:31:56,00:32:02,"treatment was 10 nuns, 10 days worth of urine for 10 nuns. So, but that's one treatment. And then"
00:32:02,00:32:08,the drug took off and it became successful. And they started off with 100 nuns all donating
00:32:08,00:32:14,"there urine. And that gave them 30,000 litres a year. And so that was enough for 450 treatments,"
00:32:14,00:32:20,"right? And then that took off. But they had to fit special lose in the convents, obviously, because"
00:32:20,00:32:26,"you need to push it away. And so the first baby girl was born in 1962, thanks to this treatment."
00:32:26,00:32:32,"There was specifically this one. And it took off and by the 1980s, they needed 30,000 litres"
00:32:32,00:32:38,"of urine a day. So they had to expand beyond nuns. Yeah, they had to synthesise it. Well, no,"
00:32:38,00:32:44,that took them a while to synthesise it. So they looked for other groups of older and non-pregnant
00:32:44,00:32:48,men and girls of women. Where did they find them? They did prisons? They didn't do prisons. I don't
00:32:48,00:32:53,think. There were urine collectors working for this company who did door to door door locking campaigns
00:32:53,00:32:59,"saying, ""Wow, can we bring out your purse, basically?"" And they had hundreds of that. They had"
00:32:59,00:33:04,"100,000 donors by the mid-90s. You would certainly. Because, of course, religion is kind of shrinking."
00:33:04,00:33:09,"I mean, I bet there's a lot less nuns around now than there were 50 years ago. Yeah, that's true."
00:33:09,00:33:17,"Peaked with the sound of music and I think it's down ever since. So, gosh, but they did eventually"
00:33:17,00:33:23,"learn how to, like, man-made, non-pissed person, but human. They weren't synthetic. Yeah, synthetic."
00:33:23,00:33:27,"But it was 1995 when they came up with that. That's the name. It was called ""Gonnell F."""
00:33:27,00:33:34,"""Gonnell F?"" Yeah. And actually, per-gonnell is similar word and they both come from the word"
00:33:34,00:33:40,"""Fagot ass."" ""Gonnell F."" I did two. Yes, well, I did two with my wife and I. We had our"
00:33:40,00:33:47,infertility journey and we did three cycles before we wonderfully got our beautiful twins.
00:33:47,00:33:52,And no one ever mentioned nuns-pissed synthetic or real. There was literature. I don't know whether
00:33:52,00:33:56,"they were trying to slip it past us. Maybe they thought, ""I'm sort of relatively publicly known as"
00:33:56,00:34:01,"an atheist. Maybe they would have thought I wouldn't have wanted nuns-piss involved."" Would you"
00:34:01,00:34:07,"with my- Would you have mined it? No, I wouldn't have mined it, actually. Of course, I wouldn't. We"
00:34:07,00:34:13,"were what's called ""non-specifically infertile,"" which is medical jargon for. We do not have a clue."
00:34:13,00:34:19,"And I think a lot of people are. And you know, everything seemed fine. They couldn't find a reason."
00:34:19,00:34:26,"And yet, they say, in terms of facts, they do save if you're a couple trying to conceive."
00:34:26,00:34:33,"In the first year, 9 out of 10, we'll conceive. And by the second year, 9 out of 10 of the 10 who"
00:34:33,00:34:37,"10% who didn't will have conceived. So by the time you get your third year, you really are either"
00:34:37,00:34:42,"infertile or fantastically unlucky. And we never found out. And it turned out we were infertile,"
00:34:42,00:34:48,"because our third and last child came as a very big surprise. Not born off the wrist, but in the"
00:34:48,00:34:57,"conventional sense. Sired. Sired. You're absolutely right. There's a really cool fact, which is,"
00:34:57,00:35:02,"so you wrote this into a book, ""Inconceivable,"" which I absolutely love. And then made that into a"
00:35:02,00:35:08,"movie called ""Maybe Baby."" In ""Maybe Baby,"" Hugh Laurie, who's a lead role, is a TV maker. And he's"
00:35:08,00:35:15,in charge of this children's program. And it's at the BBC. And there's a lead character who's
00:35:15,00:35:21,"a children's entertainer who wears a costume, who's called ""Mr. Furblob"" in it. Guess he was inside that."
00:35:21,00:35:30,"Thompson is in my movie, ""Maybe Baby."" He's a very funny, physical comedian and a very good comic."
00:35:30,00:35:38,"Yeah, I got a lot of good material out of that, because that's what I do. I like to create"
00:35:38,00:35:42,comedy from what I know and what I feel and what I think. And obviously that was a massive part
00:35:42,00:35:47,"of our lives. And we, over the years, read many lovely letters saying, you know, it was all very grim"
00:35:47,00:35:53,"in our house and your book or your movie was helpful, because it is funny. People are funny. And the"
00:35:53,00:35:59,"nuns we story is enough to prove that a thousandfold. Yeah, I always thought, because, you know, in the"
00:35:59,00:36:03,"movie, the two people are constantly. I'm ovulating, ""Come home now."" There's always like a rush,"
00:36:03,00:36:07,"and I always thought, ""Oh, that's just a good comic conceit. Cut to us on tour in Europe,"
00:36:07,00:36:14,"where I'm finding myself on my day off, flying back to the UK."" Yeah, because my life is obvious. Exactly."
00:36:14,00:36:20,"It is a part of it. You know, there are certain times when you're more fertile in you. And honestly,"
00:36:20,00:36:25,"it's not easy. You need a bit of tantric to get you going, because, you know, like,"
00:36:25,00:36:30,"to order, I mean, I'm sure there are some, but, you know, you suddenly, ""Oh, no."" Anyway,"
00:36:30,00:36:34,"this, we did it long before any Viagra. So, you know, anyway, we're going into tea by territory."
00:36:34,00:36:40,"By the Vatican, for instance. Yes, yes, of course. So, the Vatican owned 25% of this company,"
00:36:40,00:36:46,"and I was looking into the Vatican's finances, because I'm a former accountant. And"
00:36:46,00:36:57,"in World War II, they had a bank called the, and it's actually helping bank. Effectively, yes. It was"
00:36:57,00:37:02,"the Institute for Religious Works, and they brought it in as like a national bank, which wouldn't"
00:37:02,00:37:07,have to be overseen by any authority. And they were known as the world's best offshore bank.
00:37:07,00:37:13,"And indeed, they are alleged to have hidden billions of pounds from Nazi sources. They were"
00:37:13,00:37:19,"investigated by the Bank of Italy in 2010, and found that they were non-compliant in seven of the"
00:37:19,00:37:25,16 core standards of the Italian banking industry. But is that related to the Second World War?
00:37:25,00:37:28,"That's how it began. It began, actually, it began pre-Second World War, so."
00:37:28,00:37:34,"But the investigation. No, the investigation is current. Oh, wow, okay. I say current is 2010,"
00:37:34,00:37:37,so it's 50 years ago. Are they going to have to give some of the weebec?
00:37:37,00:37:45,"We've all not made a taking the piss track there, and I think that's very good of us."
00:37:45,00:37:51,The other thing they have in Rome is they have a tax break for any chapel. So if they own a chapel
00:37:51,00:37:57,"in Rome, they don't have to pay tax on it. And a chapel counts as any building that has a three meter"
00:37:57,00:38:03,"square place where you can pray. And so they own all these buildings in Rome, and they just put a tiny"
00:38:03,00:38:08,"little corner and put a little statue of the Virgin Mary or something, call it a chapel if they"
00:38:08,00:38:13,don't have to pay tax on it. It's all according to a book called God's Bankers by Gerald Posner.
00:38:13,00:38:23,"Well, it doesn't surprise us that money in religion can produce corruption. There's no doubt about that."
00:38:23,00:38:29,"But the Pope in question on this one was Pius. Pius XII. So he's a friend of the podcast. Yeah,"
00:38:29,00:38:34,"we mentioned him a couple of weeks ago. A couple of weeks ago. So he had this doctor, this really"
00:38:34,00:38:39,"strange doctor called Paul Nehance, who was a Swiss surgeon, and he'd offered this rejuvenation"
00:38:39,00:38:44,treatment. So we're kind of in the realm of that already with the fertility and the essence
00:38:44,00:38:50,"and all of this stuff. But Nehance injected the buttocks of his famous patients, like supposedly"
00:38:50,00:38:57,"King George VI, with the cells of fetal lambs and calves, and it was a kind of jujup, butcute uphage"
00:38:57,00:39:04,"treatment. And this is the Pope, who's embalming, went disastrously wrong. And he ended up being,"
00:39:04,00:39:09,"you know, his other, he was very unlucky with his doctors. The other doctor embalmed him supposedly"
00:39:09,00:39:14,"in the traditional Aramaic style, and it went awfully, awfully wrong. And the other reason he's a"
00:39:14,00:39:18,friend of the podcast is he was the one who ruled in 1954 that anyone mentioning Jesus'
00:39:18,00:39:24,"Foskin will be automatically excommunicated, which is why I've been technically excommunicated."
00:39:24,00:39:30,"Jesus was, was Jewish. So is this some read that I mean, is he thought of had one or not?"
00:39:30,00:39:36,"Well, he was thought to have had it removed as a child, and they're absolutely, and there are relics"
00:39:36,00:39:43,around the world of this supposed Holy Foskin. Just get back this embalming. I didn't know about
00:39:43,00:39:48,"Pope embalming. Do they keep all the popes? Yeah, yeah. There's been thousand, I mean, well, I know about"
00:39:48,00:39:52,"thousand, but an awful lot of post. Where are they then? Is that backed up? They're on a hard drive."
00:39:52,00:39:59,"Is there a big on camera? There is a big on camera. If you go to the Vatican, there's like the"
00:39:59,00:40:03,"catacombs underneath and they have loads of, they're not all on display, I have to say, so I don't know"
00:40:03,00:40:07,"if they're all still there, but definitely you can what past loads of popes. How many popes do you think"
00:40:07,00:40:14,"they've been? Oh, that's a good question. Can't be triple figures. What? You mean more than a hundred?"
00:40:14,00:40:19,"Yeah, I think so. I mean, they've been post for two thousand years. For the A.D.? Yeah, and I think"
00:40:19,00:40:22,"they've, yeah, let's have a, let's have a guy, let's have a guy. Okay, let's do a long time."
00:40:22,00:40:28,"Let's say Peter, right? Yes. I mean, I think there's pious, if there's about a hundred piousies,"
00:40:28,00:40:34,"I mean, there's certainly a lot of X's and ones. He was pious the 12th. Yeah, I'm saying double figures."
00:40:34,00:40:38,"I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying, I've got the answer. I've got one, two, three. This is according to"
00:40:38,00:40:43,"the pontifical yearbook, so that's a call yearbook. No, three hundred and sixty-five."
00:40:43,00:40:49,"There's two hundred and sixty-six. All right. So, according to this, there's two. You've seen"
00:40:49,00:40:53,"they've got them all. I mean, they cut, obviously, I haven't got the really early ones. I mean, when"
00:40:53,00:41:00,"how many popes can barmed popes? Are they? How many popes are still in physical? We don't, we don't"
00:41:00,00:41:04,"fully know, apparently. There's lots of bits of popes that we have. We've got lots of hard skins and"
00:41:04,00:41:15,"lots of poor skins. Don't mention them. Don't bring out the horse. Okay, it's time for a final"
00:41:15,00:41:21,"fact of the show, and that is James. Okay. Ben, you've had a go at the other fact so far, but I think"
00:41:21,00:41:26,you'll be fine with this one. My fact this week is that Shakespeare's parents and his children
00:41:26,00:41:32,"were probably illiterate. Well, that's not a fact, is it? He strikes again."
00:41:32,00:41:35,It's really out of three. It's one yet. Right out the gates.
00:41:35,00:41:43,"The word probably does a lot of work. It's a lot of damage. I mean, the fact that someone was"
00:41:43,00:41:48,"probably something is about as far from being a fact as you can get. Okay, let me give you a"
00:41:48,00:41:54,"prompt level fact. So, let me give you a little bit of evidence, but it is scant because what we"
00:41:54,00:41:59,"know about them is very little, but Shakespeare's father and mother couldn't sign their names. Like,"
00:41:59,00:42:07,"when they signed, they signed with images. So, his father chose to sign their names. That's absolutely"
00:42:07,00:42:12,"and actually now, if you want to sign something now with an image rather than your name, you are"
00:42:12,00:42:16,"allowed to do that by law. So, you are allowed, and actually in those days, it was relatively common."
00:42:16,00:42:21,"So, crafts people, trades people, guild members would often like draw things. So, John, his father,"
00:42:21,00:42:26,"drew a picture of a pair of Glover's compasses instead of his name. And so, some people point"
00:42:26,00:42:34,"this as evidence that he couldn't write. And William Shakespeare had three kids, I think, but"
00:42:34,00:42:40,"one of them, Hamlet, his son died very young. But then he had two daughters. And in those days,"
00:42:40,00:42:45,"girls would typically not be taught how to read and write, or not how to write anyway."
00:42:45,00:42:51,"And we have one sort of very quite scruffy signature of one of his daughters. So, it seems like she could"
00:42:51,00:42:57,"write her name, but this implication is maybe not much else. But again, like, the evidence is really,"
00:42:57,00:43:03,"really scary. It's really, so there's actually, we know more about Shakespeare than we do about any"
00:43:03,00:43:07,of the other great English poets of the English Reformation considerably more.
00:43:07,00:43:12,"There are a lot of known facts, which is why it's particularly galling that idiot conspiracy"
00:43:12,00:43:18,"theorist used to say, well, maybe it wasn't him, because they think of, oh, don't look at it as"
00:43:18,00:43:24,"notes though. But let's just look at the issue, rather than the Shakespeare conspiracies. Firstly,"
00:43:24,00:43:30,Shakespeare's own signatures are generally varied. He spelled his name differently. The whole
00:43:30,00:43:36,"idea of what a signature was and what it meant. And indeed, what correct spelling was, was viewed"
00:43:36,00:43:41,very differently in those days. Think about the evidence. Mary was a daughter of the aristocracy.
00:43:41,00:43:47,"Her mother. Absolutely. Now, her husband, there's no doubt about it. John Shakespeare came up."
00:43:47,00:43:55,He was lower class to her. But he eventually was in court for cooking books for various bits of
00:43:55,00:44:00,"dodgy accounting and things. So clearly, he certainly was mathematically literate. There's no doubt"
00:44:00,00:44:07,about that. He became mayor of Stratford on Aven. It seems unlikely that he wasn't able to read.
00:44:07,00:44:10,"Don't forget reading and writing was separate in those days. I think that's another thing,"
00:44:10,00:44:15,"isn't it? In those days, a lot of people could read but couldn't write. Yeah. Susanna Shakespeare,"
00:44:15,00:44:21,"the elder daughter, was married to a very learning apothecary. She unquestionably worked within"
00:44:21,00:44:27,in his business. She was a very considerable herbalist and a gardener. It just seems unlikely
00:44:27,00:44:32,"that human curiosity, particularly if your father is the greatest dramatist of the age, they didn't"
00:44:32,00:44:38,realize he would become the greatest dramatist in English letters. It seems unlikely to me that they
00:44:38,00:44:43,"wouldn't have taught themselves to read, been taught to read. I know women were treated entirely"
00:44:43,00:44:48,differently. I personally think it more likely that they could read and probably write to a certain
00:44:48,00:44:54,"extent. It seems unlikely that little Hamlet, 11 years old running home from school, his twin sister,"
00:44:54,00:44:58,didn't take some interest in what he'd learnt. I think they could read. But neither is a fact. This is
00:44:58,00:45:06,"a kid called Hamlet. Hamlet. But this is all irrelevant anyway because it was all Franz's bacon, so it doesn't... Exactly."
00:45:06,00:45:12,Or some other Portuguese name Shakespeare did not. Do you want to know what is a fact? Gone. Because of
00:45:12,00:45:19,"course, it's a popular conspiracy, particularly amongst lovers and posh boys, that Shakespeare didn't"
00:45:19,00:45:23,"write Shakespeare. My father had a good joke on that. He said, of course, Shakespeare didn't write his"
00:45:23,00:45:29,"plays. It was another fellow with the same name because obviously, in a way, does it really matter. But of"
00:45:29,00:45:34,"course, it is evidence of a corrosive snobbery in British culture because, of course, Shakespeare was"
00:45:34,00:45:38,"famously the only poet of the English Renaissance who didn't go to either Oxford or Cambridge. I mean,"
00:45:38,00:45:44,"the grip of those institutions had on British arts, as indeed politics and sciences, was as strong"
00:45:44,00:45:50,"then as it is now. So I think it's a very unfortunate thing to say. Well, he was educated. He was"
00:45:50,00:45:55,"chucked out of school when he was 13. Would he really... Well, you know, McCartney was a working class"
00:45:55,00:46:01,"lad, as with George Harrison, you know, Len and slightly lesser. The idea that you, if you come from"
00:46:01,00:46:06,"Ruff and Ready Roots, I mean, you can't have the finest brain in the country is, I think... I've got to"
00:46:06,00:46:11,"say, Ben, coming from Bolton myself, I do agree with that. But anyway, just to get into my fact,"
00:46:11,00:46:16,because I'm waffling on and I can see you all want to get your face. No one questioned Shakespeare's
00:46:16,00:46:24,"provenance, his reality, the reality of Shakespeare. Starting with Ben Johnson, who wrote his obituary"
00:46:24,00:46:29,"as his friends, the Hemmings, who put together the first folio, nobody mentioned. There is no recorded"
00:46:29,00:46:36,mention of doubts about Shakespeare until the middle of the 19th century. So 300 years past before
00:46:36,00:46:41,"anybody decided, well, nearly interesting, if I could start this, to me, they're just like Moon landing"
00:46:41,00:46:47,"an eyelist, which is one step from Q and on. I think conspiracy theories are anti-science, anti-facts,"
00:46:47,00:46:52,and Shakespeare definitely wrote Shakespeare. I find it so interesting how this arose more than
00:46:52,00:47:00,"200 years later. 300. So, Delia Bacon was one of the... Ah, the name, the clue. I think no relation."
00:47:00,00:47:05,The American woman. She was the first person to raise the possibility. She was clearly very
00:47:05,00:47:10,"intelligent in a lot of ways, but I think she was also quite unstable in other ways, and she traveled"
00:47:10,00:47:16,"to England to do research on the fact that Francis Bacon, who was a scientist, and very"
00:47:16,00:47:22,"learned guy, and very gifted in lots of ways, probably quite busy, though. Probably too busy to write"
00:47:22,00:47:28,"37 plays, as well, anyway. And so lacking in any ego is all of the boys from Cambridge"
00:47:28,00:47:33,are that he didn't want any credit for them. How strange it was. Or did any of that cash?
00:47:33,00:47:38,And he allowed this bloke from Stratford to buy a lot of houses on the proceeds. But I think she
00:47:38,00:47:43,"traveled to England, and she didn't really... She mostly stayed in her room when she was here, though,"
00:47:43,00:47:50,"just sort of... And... Regained room, which she absorbed the atmospheres of the country,"
00:47:50,00:47:54,"and then she wrote this 700-page book arguing in the case. Anyway, I think it was Bill Bryson,"
00:47:54,00:47:59,"who wrote a lovely short biography, Bill Bryson, finding various anti-stratfordians,"
00:47:59,00:48:05,"who've included Jay Thomas-Luney, Sherwood E. Sillyman, and George Batty. And faux of the podcast,"
00:48:05,00:48:12,"Mark Twain. Oh, is it? Yeah. Mark Twain, he said. So far as anybody actually knows and can prove,"
00:48:12,00:48:17,Shakespeare never wrote a play in his life. All the rest of his history is built up course upon
00:48:17,00:48:21,"course of guesses, inferences, theories, conjectures, classic Twain, classic Twain, I'm afraid."
00:48:21,00:48:28,That's all. I find it genuinely mad that otherwise intelligent people continue to love... And of
00:48:28,00:48:32,"course, it's because people love a conspiracy theory. But sadly, conspiracy theories are the"
00:48:32,00:48:40,"enemy of the Enlightenment. We're already moving into a post-truth age, where we're going back to"
00:48:40,00:48:47,an age of faith and superstition and anti-imperial evidence. And I think it's really dangerous.
00:48:47,00:48:51,"And it might seem harmless for a bunch of old love is to assemble every now and then in gay,"
00:48:51,00:48:56,"say, ""Well, I think it was the Duke of Buckingham."" But I actually think it's the thin end of an"
00:48:56,00:49:02,"anti-science, anti-evidence wedge, which leads to, you know, vaccination, conspiracy theories,"
00:49:02,00:49:07,and a whole world of where the president could say we like to choose alternative facts.
00:49:07,00:49:14,"Well, you might like this then, Ben. Have you read the Shakespeare play that he wrote in the year 1853?"
00:49:14,00:49:22,"That he collaborated with another famous writer, which is Victor Hugo. Once he was exiled from"
00:49:22,00:49:26,France to Jersey. He lived in Jersey for a while. Someone came around to the house and showed him
00:49:26,00:49:30,table-tapping about the spirit world. He became obsessed with it. He spent a couple of years talking
00:49:30,00:49:38,"to amongst others, Lord Byron Jesus Christ, Joan of Arc, Mozart, Plato, two years. And Mozart"
00:49:38,00:49:43,was using the table to make original compositions that they wrote down. And one of the things that happened
00:49:43,00:49:49,in those two years is that Victor Hugo and his son sat and channeled through Shakespeare a
00:49:49,00:49:54,"brand new Shakespeare play. They got the first act of a new comedy. It's in French because Shakespeare said,"
00:49:54,00:50:02,"Shakespeare said to them, ""That is the superior language."" And so that's out there. I don't think"
00:50:02,00:50:06,"it's ever been performed. There's a one of them. Isn't that sad? Because obviously he was a great,"
00:50:06,00:50:11,"you know, wrote those. Isn't it sad when you discover the feat of clay that everyone has considered?"
00:50:11,00:50:17,"You know, I'm apparently Newton, dabbled in Alchemy. You weren't more likely to be the physics."
00:50:17,00:50:23,"Yeah. He was very into it. But from the off, just quickly, you mentioned anti-facts theories"
00:50:23,00:50:28,"as a result of this thin end of the wedge. Riddle me this, Ben. The second man who ever got the"
00:50:28,00:50:36,Pfizer jab in the UK against COVID was called Bill Shakespeare. No. That's a loop. You've brought
00:50:36,00:50:42,"us all the way back. You've stitched together so much. That's the famous image of what's he called,"
00:50:42,00:50:48,"Matt Hancock, sort of pretending to cry, when someone told him that. There were a lot of unbelievably"
00:50:48,00:50:55,"good jokes as a result. Two gentlemen of Corona, came of the flu. Is this a jabber I see before me?"
00:50:55,00:50:59,"I mean, there was some very good things. Yeah, but one of the most amazing things is that"
00:50:59,00:51:04,"that Bill Shakespeare eventually died, not of COVID, of something else, not long after. And in"
00:51:04,00:51:09,"Argentina, when the news announced his death, they said we have lost one of the most important"
00:51:09,00:51:18,"pointers in the English language. To me, he is the master is what she said on TV. And she had to"
00:51:18,00:51:23,"come back on to the apologise and say, oh, no, no, that's not what I know. Well, linking vaccination back,"
00:51:23,00:51:29,"I bet that newsreader felt a bit of a prick. One really good fact is about Shakespeare,"
00:51:29,00:51:34,"because we talked about his daughters before is he had four grandchildren. Unfortunately, none of them"
00:51:34,00:51:38,"had children afterwards, so that's where the line died out. But one of his grandchildren was called"
00:51:38,00:51:44,"Shakespeare, as in the first name was Shakespeare. Oh, really? Isn't that cool? Yeah, it wasn't a surname,"
00:51:44,00:51:50,"no, surname was Quini or Quini. So, they wanted to pay tribute to the famous grandfather Hussiah"
00:51:50,00:51:55,"and wrote the canon of Shakespeare. But his lineage died out right with the grand autumn, except"
00:51:55,00:52:01,"there were few people who claim that it went on, including an American footballer who's called William"
00:52:01,00:52:08,"Shakespeare. Oh, yeah. Yeah, died in 1974, also known as the Merchant of Menace. Yeah, he was part"
00:52:08,00:52:13,"of the Notre Dame fighting Irish football team. And they claimed lineage, direct lineage from"
00:52:13,00:52:18,"Shakespeare, despite having no evidence. It was pointed out that he failed at English at college."
00:52:18,00:52:25,"But there is a descent from, I think Shakespeare's father or grandfather. I think that these days there"
00:52:25,00:52:32,"is a baronette of, I think it's called Thomas, maybe Shakespeare. So the line, the Shakespeare family"
00:52:32,00:52:36,"do have direct, is that a claim that he's connected? Well, I think it's not a claim. I think he's"
00:52:36,00:52:40,"descended from dad or the grandfather. But there are, I mean, it is a surname. I mean, there are other"
00:52:40,00:52:45,"Shakespeare's. Well, we know from the bloke who got the second five of that thing. There are other"
00:52:45,00:52:50,"Shakespeare's and they're obviously always cursed with that name, you know, and like poor, we're"
00:52:50,00:52:58,causing it letters from black adders who hate Richard and name forever. And the other thing about
00:52:58,00:53:02,"Shakespeare the surname is we don't know what it means, but it might have been someone who uses a"
00:53:02,00:53:11,"lats. Oh, yes, honestly, there are some degrees of separation of drinking. We're literally, we're"
00:53:11,00:53:16,"huddling around these subjects. Wait a second. Stratford is Warwickshire, right? Yeah. Do you know what"
00:53:16,00:53:23,"else was filmed in Warwickshire? Telly tobes? Telly tobes. And, and, and isn't a needle? A very small"
00:53:23,00:53:36,"lump. I'm gonna wrap it up. We do actually do wrap up. Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts."
