 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Nosy's Things of Fish, where we were

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.960
 joined by the legend, Dan Shriver.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.600
 Another legend, Adju Hotsamari, but the biggest legend of all, Ben Elton.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.800
 Yeah, long-time listeners of the show will understand what a big deal this was for me in particular.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.640
 He's my big, big hero, and he didn't this point. You guys are going to absolutely love him.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.480
 The reason he was on the show is because he's just ridden his autobiography.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.320
 It's out now to Sunday Times bestseller this week. It's called "What Have I Done?"

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.200
 And it's the full story, you know, as you do in an autobiography.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.040
 Childhood through to current day.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.800
 That's a typo, isn't it? It should be called "What I Have Done."

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.400
 Is it too late to change?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.960
 I'll email you.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.560
 There is a phrase, "What have I done?"

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.760
 That's what he's going for. I understand now.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.560
 That's right now.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.720
 One interesting thing about Ben when he was on the show is he went on so many amazing big

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.440
 rambles, especially one a bit about his journey to having a new child, which was extremely

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.480
 explicit, unbelievably funny. But you will not hear it if you listen to this episode because it

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.760
 goes in the XL version. There was a little bit rude for this episode.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.640
 If you want to hear that, you're going to have to go to Club Fish.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 That's right. You may have heard on last week's show. We have just gussied up Club Fish.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.680
 And if you want and free episodes and bonus content and all kinds of extra stuff,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.520
 can get. And also see how you can support the show. That's right.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.560
 But for now, enjoy Fish and one of the greatest sitcom riders in British comedy history,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.320
 the guy behind the young ones, the black adder, upstart crow,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.080
 books like popcorn, maybe baby. And again, his latest book, "What Have I Done?" on with the show.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.720
 [Imitation]

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.880
 to you from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.160
 Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Ben Elton. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.720
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Ben. My fact for this week is the actor who played

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 Tinky Winky was removed from his role because his interpretation of the role was not acceptable.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.200
 I mean, how would they tell? I don't know. Well, yeah, this was Dave Thompson.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.560
 Yes, I mean, I'm bringing that out of my fact. It concerns a very dear friend of mine. But I think,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.160
 you know, my second oldest friend, not to go into abstract detail. My oldest friend is Gabby Glaster,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:59.040
 who played Bob in Black Adder and my second oldest friend played Tinky Winky. I really only befriended

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.720
 people who would like to play pretty famous characters. Dave Thompson has a very, very great

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.880
 stand-up comic, a very interesting comic muse in general. And he got a great break at one point

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.600
 in his career in the E audition for Ann was cast as Tinky Winky because he did an enormous

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.280
 amount of physical theatre in his day. He did a, he was originally, I did a lot of teaching. I'm

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.160
 working with kids with special needs using theatre, etc. So very good with his tall, wonderful body.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.640
 He got the job as Tinky Winky and gave a lot of thought to it. I mean, it isn't actually a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.320
 simple as you think. Well, surely they just all kind of go around these enormous costumes.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.480
 I think the reason it was a success was because there was character. But for some reason,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.400
 they sacked him. And I don't, I think somebody was, because I think it was Dave's idea to give Tinky

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.000
 Winky a handbag. And I think in those days, I don't know if that's a fact or not, but I think it

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.360
 might be. I think that's about as far as you get with facts these days. It might be. And I think

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.360
 there was some sort of weird idea that that might suggest you was gay and a weird idea that

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.400
 that was a bad thing. It was a numerous things. The handbag was one, which I read in one interview,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.720
 Dave says it wasn't a handbag. It was like a magic bag. It could do magical things. So that's why Tinky

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.560
 Winky had it. It was a handbag. It was a handbag. And Dave, come on. I think Dave's had decades to

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.120
 talk about this now, right? So he's probably adding a little bit. Purple supposedly was a colour to

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.400
 suggest this. This is all man. Yeah, it's all man. Fake controversy. It sounds really ice cold.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.680
 The way he got his, like, tubby vibe eyes. He was on his way to a rap party and he was just drawn

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.560
 to one side and handed a letter from the company. You mean end of series rather than they were all

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.400
 going to get down and something. But one of them was a Jamaican, through a lot of Jamaican dance moves.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.520
 I believe it's the guy who played Dipsy, through a lot of dancehall stuff in interpretation. Anyway,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.400
 no, but the rap end of series party and he just got told that's it. But he has said since then,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.600
 I'm proud of my work for them. I was always the one to test out the limitations of the costume. I

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:09.280
 was the first to fall off my chair. I took all the risks. He's a big physical comedian fan as well,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.120
 right? Laurel and Hardy were his big influencers and so on. That's what he thought he was doing inside.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.240
 I don't, I have no idea what I said. I know he was, he has a say, he's a friend of mine and I know

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.440
 he was deeply upset. He was devastated. I think since then, the notoriety, you know, he's,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.320
 it's in interest. I don't know whether you do better in a comedy career, playing Tinky Winky or

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.880
 having been sacked from playing Tinky Winky. I can't believe maybe the latter. I don't know, but at the

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.560
 time, because he actually did invest as he does in all his work, a great deal of his, you know,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.360
 artistry and, you know, he took it very seriously. I think he felt, you know, very undermined. What is his

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.680
 voice like? Because I read he said that one of the reasons that he left might have been because

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.520
 they didn't use his voice. They dubbed him over with another actor. He doesn't have a very strong

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.480
 accent. Well, I don't think I'll kind of go. But he was, and he's, he's Darth Vader. Yeah, it's David

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.760
 Prouse all over. It's one guy in the suit. Yeah. Some of them did their own voices, but the other three

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.480
 did their own voices. That I didn't know. And he was the only one redone. I didn't really care until

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.120
 now, but then his voice was done by a guy called Mark Heenahan, who his other big role was playing

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.520
 Wyndham B. Johnson in a TV series called Fox. I literally, the man who's known really now

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.880
 finally for hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids to kill today with a Vietnam war. It was actually the voice of

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.280
 one of a children's favourite. There's a, there's a kind of irony stretching across the decades there.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.120
 There's got another one. I'm Ditsy, John Symmet. He was a comedian as well. So it's great knowing

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.560
 that there were comedians inside. He's also a charmander on a Pikachu and friends cartoon. Yeah, they've

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.440
 all got amazing credits. This is all after our time. Yeah, I mean, the TeleTab, is it? Are they still going?

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.000
 Is that all? Yeah, I watched it this morning. Have you got kids or are you just... I have a three-year-old.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.200
 It was after she'd gone to the earth three then I put it up. Yeah, you just skinned up Adobe in it,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.640
 because apparently that's what was originally the big thing was students sort of like getting started.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.200
 When it started, I was a student and we used to get up at like 11 o'clock in the morning,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.440
 like students do and just put TeleTab, he's on and watch that. Yeah, every morning we used to do that.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.400
 Well, you know what they say, don't you? It was a number one single. We actually pastished that in

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.600
 we will rock you, my Queen musical, because it's about the future of the world in which rock and

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.280
 roll has been forgotten and all music is kind of electro. It's pop, you know, computerised pop

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.160
 created and streamed directly from the sort of conglomerate, whatever. Anyway, one of the things

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.720
 was that people are trying to remember back to the age of rock, but they really don't get it,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.640
 so they discover that, you know, this song was a number one. TeleTab is say, oh,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.920
 and they treat it with the same reverence as sort of satisfaction and I want to hold your hand.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.640
 Anyway, anyway, that's amazing. You know, it was created by a guy called Andrew Davenport,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.720
 and the whole, I didn't actually know that trippiness and spoken splits was associated with

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.040
 TeleTab is because the one I associate that with, which is actually more LSD, is in the night

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.240
 garden, which is the trippiest of shows. And it's got eagle piggle and same creatures. Same

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:22.320
 creators as well as me. Lala in the reboot of TeleTab is the same actor plays up to Daisy.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.680
 Oh, my God, and so there is. There's the same universe. It's a sort of universe that was

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.000
 TeleTab is rebooted. I mean, what was the? Yeah. The one that I watched this morning was very

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.560
 different than the one I watched when I was a student. Right. Okay. And I mean, I don't want to

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.920
 bore your listeners, but I mean, I'm quite interested. What difference, I mean, was the

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.960
 hill a different color? No, the hill was the same. I think they just get into a few more scrapes

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.400
 and also the plot. Yeah, there's how could there? I mean, literally tension pack. The

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.720
 B.O. is different as well. The voiceover is different. Like, immediately I was like, this isn't

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.920
 what I grew up on. Do the screens in their tummies? Are they now vertical for the age of

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.600
 virtual video? Yeah, they're all tech talks. Yeah. It's funny how you don't like change. One

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.880
 doesn't like change. I remember having, you know, watched an awful lot of dumbass the dang engine

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.840
 goes round and round and round when my kids were very small. I happen to see one with, I don't know,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.560
 it's a nephew or something. And they've gone all CGI. So they're not real, they're not real

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.240
 models anymore. And I just, I wanted to write to someone. I bid over the times. There also run by

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.320
 Italian and French companies these days. Do you see what he did? A little bit of politics because

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:40.560
 it's gracious. HS2 across Sodor is very, very slow. Can I tell you guys about Lala? Yeah. So Lala

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.240
 was Nikki Smedley. She has since done a one woman show, Confessions of a Telly Tubby. And she found,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.600
 you couldn't say you were a Telly Tubby at the time. I think in the early days when she'd just been

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.000
 cast and the first things were going out, they all signed NDAs. So you couldn't confess it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.280
 But she had originally, her previous job as far as I can tell, was fronting the garage rock girl

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:07.600
 group Psychopussy. And that doesn't get you sang for the sit. And all they did was fall off his chair.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:14.800
 Oh my goodness. That's amazing. That is a brilliant fact. That's amazing. But that doesn't seem to

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.120
 matter in children's entertainment. There's the biggest children's entertainer. It's called Blippi.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.160
 And it's a huge character in America. It's sold, I think, for like a billion dollars in the states

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.800
 as a brand. The guy who plays Blippi, that's not his first career. Similar sort of

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.640
 alternative career to begin with. Yeah. He was a prankster. There's a video online that you can see

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.480
 of Blippi taking a poo on his friend's chest. Just the people. That would make any child laugh.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:44.960
 I think that probably the best kids gaggy ever did. But the Barney character, he's now, he does

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.600
 tantric sex massage. Yeah. He's so interesting. They've joined us. I read about, yeah, they've joined us.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.080
 So he wasn't the original Barney. He took over his Barney. And then, and he supposedly,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.080
 to get into the suit itself, he said, he used tantric. He used a lube.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:08.400
 What is a tantric sex massage? I think so. I think so. Is this where you thought today was

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.600
 going when he came into the office? I don't know. I have to bring out my personal stories. But

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.360
 I'll tell you what it is. It's they effectively put you in a headspace where you can start feeling your

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.160
 your energy growing to the point of culminating in an orgasm. So you don't necessarily have to have

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.920
 someone touching you. So it might be a verbal massage. Somebody's saying, you know, I mean, we all

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.920
 got the entire world learnt the phrase tantric sex at exactly the same moment when sting and

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:40.160
 trudy announced that they spent a year shacking or something without, without pause. And everybody kind

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.240
 of heard this and everybody had a giggle about sting and trudy. And I don't think anybody ever really

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.120
 asked, well, I said, what, I mean, what is tantric sex? I mean, is it, is it a different position?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.280
 Is it? No, it's a slow process. I think we're stinging trudy. It was them sitting across from each

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.840
 other, staring at each other's eyes for about four hours and slowly getting it. Tantric is really

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:05.760
 terrible boring. I mean, I think it's so much better when you shag. I mean, five minutes is fine. I mean,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.800
 anyway, I as a tantric sex is something mystery. I must look it up. So you're saying about people sort

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.040
 of all learning things at the same time. Do you know toy story? Does this bit and toy story

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.760
 where Andy, the child walks in and all the toys flop down? Yeah. Okay. So in, which toy stories?

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.120
 Is this the first one? I believe it's in all of them that this happens. All right. I must have

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:33.200
 met, I haven't seen any of them, but I have read the transcripts of all of them. That is true.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:42.560
 Sounds like tantric watching the two stories. It's just not as good. Yeah, they do. We'll never

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.440
 trouble or an animal. Yeah. So in Disney theme parks, they had all these toy story characters. So

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.360
 there's people in costumes. And then whenever anyone shouted "Andy's coming," all the actors

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.480
 would just fall to the floor. Is it like a cool little... Safe to eat Thompson would be great

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:05.120
 in when I was character. Amazing. It was like a little sort of hidden thing, but then it went viral

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.640
 on the internet and suddenly everyone learned it at the same time. And so there was one day when every

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.800
 single person who walked into the theme park just shouted "Andy's coming," and all the actors had

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.360
 to the floor to the floor. And it lasted one more day and they just stopped doing the whole thing.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.800
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's so funny. So people can't be trusted with a global fact, you know?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.640
 They just kind of spoil it for everyone by overdoing it. I read this amazing story. I was reading about

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.800
 people trapped inside big costumes trying to see if there was anything else. And I came across a

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.560
 kind of different story about a kid, a 12-year-old called Martin's Pistorius. He had a mystery illness

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.200
 where he fell into a coma for years and years, but he was conscious inside the coma. So he was completely

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.840
 aware of what was going on. Yeah. And he kept trying as hard as he could to break out of it. Nothing

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.800
 could happen. And he is now out of it. In fact, he's like a wheelchair racer. He's got kids. He's got

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.120
 family. And the thing that broke him out is that when he was 12, they put him into a hospital and they

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.320
 played non-stop reruns of Barney to him. And he got so annoyed with the song. I love you. That he went,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.960
 I can't, I can't be in this coma anymore. And he decided to train himself. And it took him years,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.360
 but through anger of Barney, he trained himself to know when it was daytime, to know how to move the

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.920
 muscles of his lips when he was trying to smile at someone. And they slowly recognized it and they

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.600
 helped him coach him out of it. I had to say one of, you know, I'm sure everyone shares it. I mean,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.400
 the terror, I think it's called locked-in syndrome. Yes. I remember reading about one person. Is it

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.080
 something that butterflies or something? The story, a French bloke. And he, you know, he was there,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:42.320
 a sports game on. And the nurse just turned the tele off at night and, you know, he'd been watching it.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.880
 And in the anger, I'm afraid it didn't pop him out. But he also somehow managed to, because he's

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.000
 obviously told that story since. But goodness gracious. I mean, the idea, and you can't even ask

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.160
 them to kill you. You literally can't do anything. Yeah. Barney took a lot of flak. Barney took a lot

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.480
 of flak. People hated Barney. I think this is that repetitive song and all of this. But the guy who

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.400
 played Barney, as we say, David Joyner, he is a very interesting guy. Do you know what his previous

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:13.120
 job was? Got him. He was a mannequin in shop windows. Oh, what's a live mannequin? A live mannequin.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.520
 He did it for a few dollars an hour. Right. And he claimed that after a year, he was so good at it that

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:23.600
 he was charging a hundred dollars an hour. A hundred dollars. You can buy a mannequin. I would have

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:30.800
 thought I know why would I. I just don't believe this story. He said he changed his clothes every

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.400
 hour. You know, so you got a little fashion show. So as you walk to work, the mannequin is wearing

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.280
 something and then he's you walk back. Is he just holding? Is he holding still the whole time?

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.920
 I believe so. I mean, there's there's there's the Covent Garden is literally full of people with

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.520
 this skill. They paint themselves silver and and stand there. I'm afraid you obviously do facts

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.200
 at UI, but I don't think that's a fact. No, he claims it. Yeah, he claims it, right?

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.880
 It's from him. Yeah. I think there was some political control. I mean, I don't know. It's an

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.200
 American thing. I know I wouldn't even know what Barney looked like, but certainly not this irritating

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.760
 song, but I think there was something to do. Did it go woke or something? Did it? Did it? Did it

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.160
 always? I was always worried. Did it annoy the the people who like don't like things going

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.920
 work? I think it's been canceled too long to have gone work. Barney's not have been around for a

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.000
 long time. Not canceled. So it was canceled the whole time. In the original song. Yes, imagine that,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.400
 like we look back now. We say, oh, you know, what is shaming? I think they canceled play for the day.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.040
 Oh, what did they say? Did they say something mean about it?

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:40.720
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is that the British Army used

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:51.520
 lances until 1927. Wow. I'm surprised it was that early that they got rid of it. Really? I mean,

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.080
 if you think about it, we got what the nuclear bomb 20 years later. In 20 years before that,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.320
 we were just using big sticks. Yeah, but it's insane. I don't think they were using. What do you

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.880
 think about it? In fact, after that, I mean, the poor Polish cavalry would slaughter in 1939,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:15.120
 because they also used lances, right? It took a long time for armies to get over, you know,

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:21.360
 the old ways. Who knew that soldiers might be reactionary old dickheads or some of them at least.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.720
 Can I just say, Ben, that Andy is very, very excited to talk about lances. I'm so excited. I

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.760
 could just see as you were talking, he was like, yeah, yeah, right? Well, I mean, let's, but as I say,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.640
 I don't think the British Army was certainly wasn't the last, because the polls, you know,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:44.080
 were you seeing which it alas is a very sharp poll, but they were very sharp. I'm listening. I mean,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.800
 we're actually talking about a military disaster and a human disaster, of course, but it is true to say,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:56.560
 I mean, I think the last British charge, since you've got me honest, I like history, was Churchill

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.160
 was involved in. So we got lots of interesting links here. Was it 189, Omderman? Or so it was,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.800
 say cartoon? Yes, I think that was the last, well, it was one of the last. This is the thing. I can't

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.960
 believe the man who wrote black adr is saying, well, this was actually a military, a human disaster.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.000
 I know, we've got to get some comedy out of there. Well, exactly. I mean, my grandfather got

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.240
 annoyed with me because he thought we were laughing at the expense of the British Army and my,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.880
 my grandfather, my uncle, who was a historian, but also had served in the British Army in the second

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:31.200
 world war, but was also saved by the British Army because my uncle and my father's family were Jewish

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.720
 refugees from the Nazis. So they were, they were very conscious of what we owed to Britain and also what

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.600
 we owed to the armed forces who, in 1944, just by what the Americans might like to tell you,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.720
 that they won the second world war on their own. There was a year during which Britain stood alone,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.440
 after which most of the BMR was involved with the Russian. But anyway, let's not get on to

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.240
 get on to that whole of the second world war. We're going to stick on this quick. Go Andy.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:02.320
 Sorry, I didn't even finish about what my uncle thought and now you've moved on it. So you're like

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.760
 mountain goats leaping from crag to crag. I can't possibly follow that. I want to hear what your

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.880
 uncle thought, first of all? Well, very briefly, he wrote to me when black ad ad goes forth came out.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.120
 He was a little sort of guy. He had a slightly German accent in he wrote. Obviously, it wasn't a voicemail,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.000
 but I could hear his voice in the letter. He said, I'm very disappointed here that you're making

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.800
 easy swipes at the army. Your father, who scoured you? That's the phrase he used for.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.440
 That's come to my study, boy. It's a totaletry, really, in it, because your father obviously

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:43.440
 scoured you. But anyway, he said, owed his freedom as do I to the British army, etc. You did

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.520
 very well with black ad ad to, but I don't approve. I wrote back and I said, this is just not the case.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:56.560
 I think it's a very respectful, but obviously the humour that Thomas themselves had, anyway,

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:03.680
 watched a bit more of it and said, he said, what an old bastard. He said, I've watched it since and

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.960
 I've decided perhaps I was too hasty with my criticism, but you shouldn't be so sensitive to it.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.240
 I thought, bloody hell, he's having it both ways, isn't he? Anyway, back to lances.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.880
 He must be the oldie person in history who thinks that the fourth black ad was the worst one.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.840
 Oh no, he, as I say, he didn't. He left a bit quick. He said jokes about idiotic officers and

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.960
 things. It wasn't that, it's not that cut and dry, etc. Although actually, the bloody

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:39.440
 mindiness that hags inability to think outside the box, Churchill again, in trying to develop the

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.480
 tank, thinking outside the box, Gallipoli for all that it was a disaster, the idea to break the

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.840
 deadlock in the Western Front. Look, I'm auditioning for the rest is history. I want everybody to know

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:56.880
 that this podcast is just a leap for me to an even bigger podcast. And that's really the only reason I'm here.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:04.080
 So please, back to lances. Now, now, I'm afraid we've run out of time. I've got this.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.680
 Cavalry Lance. Okay, I'll tell you where I got this first of all. I went recently to the Royal

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.800
 Armories in Leeds, which is a ginormous museum of arms and armor and armaments. It's absolutely

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.760
 unbelievable. All the way from I think they're having a sort of Roman exhibition at the moment,

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.560
 all the way to I would like to live there. It's so good. Oh my god. I'm going. It's incredible.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.840
 And basically, I met some of the curators there. I just want to give a shout out to Henry Yalop.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.360
 He is the keeper of edged weapons. What a title. It's so cool. I wish we'd had that when we were

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:41.200
 very black at it. Every weapon has an edge. Well, that's true. Yeah. They got some blunt. Look, I

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.160
 talk. There's a mathematician. Sorry. Lances. Lances. You have a round age. I mean, as a club,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.080
 got an age, as a circle got an edge. Back to lances. Thank you.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.760
 Basically, the point. So he told me this amazing thing that the British Army kept them in service

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.200
 until 1927. And it was common among European armies as someone that's actually very amazing.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.600
 But anyway, carry on. All right. Yeah. I don't know if I'm having a go at your fight.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:13.360
 But basically, most European armies had it in service because this is the thing I love about it,

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.080
 is I think it might be the ancient world weapon that lasted the longest into modern militaries.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.800
 As in, both and arrows were not used in any mass way. One of the other ones, swords were not

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.080
 used in a mass way this late. Lances stayed in service. And it's basically because one of the most

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:33.280
 effective things you can do is have a very long stick and poke it into someone else. I mean, the Romans

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.840
 had a version of the lance called the Contos or the Iranian cavalry. Sorry. 20th century,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.760
 it lasted to. That was the first century to the 20th century. I read another couple of theories

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.160
 as to why they lasted. Number one, that people in the army sort of fancised of these cavalry

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.040
 charges. Absolutely. And then another thing is that they like pig sticking. So just it's like

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:57.760
 a sport. That was like a boring race. That was really popular in the army. So people pet

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.280
 them for that reason. But it wasn't basically just a really successful thing as well. And it kind

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.000
 of we should say, a lance is just for anyone who not familiar with it, a lance is a spear that you

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.400
 don't throw. You know, it's held mostly by heavy cavalry if you're trying to break up an enemy

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.520
 formation or charge or sort of, it's a really disruptive weapon, you know. Imagine it in like a

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:25.840
 joust in competition, you hold it. It was a successful weapon, but with the emergence of the

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:32.560
 machine gun, it became instantly a not successful weapon and it took them very much too long a time

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:39.360
 to notice. I mean, the fact that the military hierarchies worldwide were unable to sort of think

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:46.560
 beyond the horse because it had been so, you know, 2003,000 years. I mean, I think it's more the

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.560
 horse that they couldn't bear to get rid of because the idea of a cavalry charge remains such an

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.440
 exciting thing if you're of a military turn of mind. And militaries were still hugely reliant on horses

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.000
 for transport in general, you know, millions of horses in both one wars. Absolutely. But the lance

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.160
 had this really good thing where it went out of fashion in about the 17th and 18th century,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.600
 when pistols came in. And then it came back. Yeah, what was the, I saw that that it went gone

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.600
 around that time. What brought it back? It basically poled and hungry had amazingly effective

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.080
 cavalry. Right. And guns were not very good at the time. You know, they weren't, you know,

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.760
 they were slow to reload and they were, they were not very accurate over very long distances.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.080
 And, and it went so well for the Polish and Hungarian cavalry that Napoleon adopted it and then

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.120
 the British army. So the whole of the 19th century was this huge renaissance for the lance.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.880
 I think it's more to do with colonialism. I think battles between Western armies, the lance may

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.800
 have, they may have used it, but I don't, I mean, if you, if you've only got to read the charge of

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.160
 the light brigade, I mean, lance is against cannon. Even before the invention of the Gatling gun,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.200
 what's that? The end of the 19th century. For me, the cavalry charges, you know, they were,

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.560
 they were useful against an army that didn't have guns. It's against infantry. And there was a

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.040
 loop. Waterloo was a hugely used, as in Napoleon's use. Again, yeah, no, you're right. I mean, as long

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.240
 as you couldn't reload very quickly, although we famously know the British square with three ranks,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.360
 each reloading and firing in, in, in order. Anyway, back to the light. And the Anne Wunderin, like,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.320
 drones, like knocking a drone out with a big stick. Maybe they're going to come back.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.000
 I don't, don't tease me. In, in, it's sort of in, it's sort of around the crumb million times. Did

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.640
 they have very, very long launches? I got this idea. There was a, a time when they got longer.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.320
 They did get longer when they, they became impractically long. Yeah. Well, you know, pikes, which are

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.280
 the basically spears you stick in the ground to prevent enemy cavalry. Those are about five meters long.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.360
 I mean, they're really, really long. They almost wheeled that. No, no, no, no, that's to stick in the

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.440
 ground and prevent a cavalry. But they, they almost had an exciting comeback of their own back in

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.480
 World War II. Because Churchill, yeah, Churchill wrote things saying, every man must have a weapon of

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:56.000
 some sort, be it only a mace or a pike. They took him at his word. They produced 250,000 of them

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.640
 to give out to all the soldiers. Yeah. And someone said, we can't give them pikes. What are you doing?

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.320
 They've got machine guns out there. Wow. I want to know the provenance of this fact. I've read

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.720
 an awful lot of books on World War II. Okay. Never come across that one. Well, it was, it was

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.720
 discussed by Godfrey Nicholson, the MP. We all know how much sense and how much truth.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.960
 Nicholson, though, he was a man of honor, wasn't he? It was known as Croft's Pike, because he was

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:29.120
 sure. We sure were not thinking of Lawrence Gortwald Pike. I get all sounds, all my facts for British

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:38.080
 psychology. It sounds to me like Nicholson was a very stupid boy. Can I tell you about Mrs.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:44.080
 Hertha Ayrton. I love her. She was a citizen scientist, and she was aware that there was a problem

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.680
 with gas. First of all, war first, big use of poison gas on the Western front. So she invented

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:57.360
 the anti-gas fan. And it's just a large fan. It's a handheld fan. It's one of those where you can't

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:03.520
 snap it out and flirt with it. It's just like an open fan. Oh, sure. It wasn't an electric

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.960
 fan. It was a panic. This was the first world war. It was just a handheld and they made 100,000 of

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.280
 these and distributed them along the Western front. It's not a weird idea, though. Like soldiers with

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.080
 their fans. Do we call it an invention? I mean, surely. She just, she came up with a good use

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.600
 for something which already existed. I mean, she said, why don't we fan gas away? Nobody said,

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.240
 "My goodness, what shall we use?" I'm a gas away. Ben, I like to acknowledge female inventors,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:34.640
 actually, and so can you. Well, I'm with you on that. You know, as we all know, Mrs. Allwell wrote

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:41.520
 1984, apparently, according to a new biography. She wrote another thing called 1984, which she might

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.680
 have based her slightly on. Well, it's just the title, I think. It was a poem. Anyway, let's not start

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:54.320
 to bunking history debunkers. It's a very good thing to find the influences of women in history,

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.960
 so we certainly don't want to be poop-pooping that. It's like a children's entertainer on a,

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.840
 on a chest. On a chest. Just looping back.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:15.040
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that in 1962,

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.080
 a baby was successfully conceived thanks to a new fertility drug that contained

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:28.880
 Pope approved nuns urine. Yeah, this is, so this is the story of Perginol. Perginol is a drug that has

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.960
 been used for decades and decades to help people who have got fertility problems. Back in the 1940s,

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:40.640
 there was a guy called Pierre Donini. He was a scientist who was working on extracting and purifying

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:46.720
 FSH and LH. So these are hormones that we produce in our body to stimulate production of sperm and

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.760
 produce testosterone in men. They use for women to grow and function their ovaries to produce a

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.840
 trigger ovulation. They're really important. He's the person who isolated them and tried to work out

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:01.840
 what to do with them. So another guy comes along who is studying the exact same thing and finds out

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.720
 about Donini's discovery and says we could change the whole system of people trying to get pregnant.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.640
 And this was Bruno Luninfeld. Yeah, exactly. Bruno Luninfeld. And so they approached this company,

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.480
 Serrano, where Donini worked. They said, could we try this out? In order to try this out, we need

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.440
 gallons and gallons of urine. And we need to find out where to get that from. And they said, it's a

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.680
 great idea, but we don't want to put our stuff into this. We can't do this. There was a guy on the

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:34.320
 board who happened to be the nephew of the current Pope. Okay. And he said, the Pope has approved that

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.960
 the nuns that the Pope has access to will be the providers. Not that he has access.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:48.080
 Not direct. It's not a tantric besides sort of situation. No. He has access to

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:53.920
 influence. He has influence. And he's approved the fact that if you ask them, they the Pope says he's

00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:01.840
 okay. Because his postman of paurs or large groups of older women, yeah. And they can't be

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.960
 pregnant either. And they can't be pregnant. That would spoil it. Medieval nuns wouldn't have done.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.880
 No naughty nuns. In the modern. Well, that is very interesting. You say Pope approved,

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:18.880
 because if that's kind of the big fact, it's like, you know, a Pope approved nuns urine,

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:24.880
 where it's actually, I think, nuns urine is probably the more interesting part of that sentence,

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.440
 but which because it really is that that way of what is sort of interesting way they arrived at

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:34.480
 finding the stuff they needed. But I mean, did he have to approve it like we by we or

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:41.920
 was it just a general? Did a purple bull that he said you can anyone can use nuns we it's fine by me.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.280
 I don't think he was project manager. No, I think he allowed it to just get on with it. Let's each

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:54.720
 trickle. Okay. It took 10 nuns 10 days to produce enough urine for one treatment. It's 10 nuns

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.560
 spend 10 days to get a gallon of urine. How long does it take five nuns for something?

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.240
 GCSE Italian magic. 10 nuns 10 days to produce it. I mean, they weren't obviously spending all day.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.880
 They basically, when they had a weed, they kept it and it, you know, they needed that much of it. I know.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:16.320
 I think it's it's less dramatic when you unpack that sentence. It's coming for you. He's coming for

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.400
 you. I saw it covered. So do worry. It's it's 100 nun days. It's 100 nun weeks. It's not a day. It's

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.080
 going to be the day. You don't need to have one we a day. Well, you're right. No, you're right. You

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.560
 probably five. Actually, you're absolutely right. Well, well done. I probably have these days. I'm

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:36.480
 66. I have one we a minute. So you're right. I have to knot it just to get through lunch. You know.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:44.720
 But one part of this that you're missing out there is that the Vatican owned 25% of Serrano

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:50.240
 this company. So that was the reason they were so interested in going for this. The Pope had a

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.000
 dog in the game. It's a stunning. So the collection is insane. I mean, just because that was one

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.640
 treatment was 10 nuns, 10 days worth of urine for 10 nuns. So, but that's one treatment. And then

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:08.160
 the drug took off and it became successful. And they started off with 100 nuns all donating

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.640
 there urine. And that gave them 30,000 litres a year. And so that was enough for 450 treatments,

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:20.160
 right? And then that took off. But they had to fit special lose in the convents, obviously, because

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.640
 you need to push it away. And so the first baby girl was born in 1962, thanks to this treatment.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:32.480
 There was specifically this one. And it took off and by the 1980s, they needed 30,000 litres

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:38.000
 of urine a day. So they had to expand beyond nuns. Yeah, they had to synthesise it. Well, no,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.160
 that took them a while to synthesise it. So they looked for other groups of older and non-pregnant

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.480
 men and girls of women. Where did they find them? They did prisons? They didn't do prisons. I don't

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.520
 think. There were urine collectors working for this company who did door to door door locking campaigns

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:59.840
 saying, "Wow, can we bring out your purse, basically?" And they had hundreds of that. They had

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.480
 100,000 donors by the mid-90s. You would certainly. Because, of course, religion is kind of shrinking.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.920
 I mean, I bet there's a lot less nuns around now than there were 50 years ago. Yeah, that's true.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:17.120
 Peaked with the sound of music and I think it's down ever since. So, gosh, but they did eventually

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:23.520
 learn how to, like, man-made, non-pissed person, but human. They weren't synthetic. Yeah, synthetic.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.600
 But it was 1995 when they came up with that. That's the name. It was called "Gonnell F."

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:34.240
 "Gonnell F?" Yeah. And actually, per-gonnell is similar word and they both come from the word

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:40.480
 "Fagot ass." "Gonnell F." I did two. Yes, well, I did two with my wife and I. We had our

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:47.040
 infertility journey and we did three cycles before we wonderfully got our beautiful twins.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:52.080
 And no one ever mentioned nuns-pissed synthetic or real. There was literature. I don't know whether

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.960
 they were trying to slip it past us. Maybe they thought, "I'm sort of relatively publicly known as

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.840
 an atheist. Maybe they would have thought I wouldn't have wanted nuns-piss involved." Would you

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.360
 with my- Would you have mined it? No, I wouldn't have mined it, actually. Of course, I wouldn't. We

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:13.600
 were what's called "non-specifically infertile," which is medical jargon for. We do not have a clue.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.520
 And I think a lot of people are. And you know, everything seemed fine. They couldn't find a reason.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:26.240
 And yet, they say, in terms of facts, they do save if you're a couple trying to conceive.

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:33.520
 In the first year, 9 out of 10, we'll conceive. And by the second year, 9 out of 10 of the 10 who

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.600
 10% who didn't will have conceived. So by the time you get your third year, you really are either

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.400
 infertile or fantastically unlucky. And we never found out. And it turned out we were infertile,

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:48.720
 because our third and last child came as a very big surprise. Not born off the wrist, but in the

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:57.840
 conventional sense. Sired. Sired. You're absolutely right. There's a really cool fact, which is,

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.320
 so you wrote this into a book, "Inconceivable," which I absolutely love. And then made that into a

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.560
 movie called "Maybe Baby." In "Maybe Baby," Hugh Laurie, who's a lead role, is a TV maker. And he's

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:15.040
 in charge of this children's program. And it's at the BBC. And there's a lead character who's

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:21.600
 a children's entertainer who wears a costume, who's called "Mr. Furblob" in it. Guess he was inside that.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:30.000
 Thompson is in my movie, "Maybe Baby." He's a very funny, physical comedian and a very good comic.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Yeah, I got a lot of good material out of that, because that's what I do. I like to create

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.400
 comedy from what I know and what I feel and what I think. And obviously that was a massive part

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.520
 of our lives. And we, over the years, read many lovely letters saying, you know, it was all very grim

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.680
 in our house and your book or your movie was helpful, because it is funny. People are funny. And the

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.440
 nuns we story is enough to prove that a thousandfold. Yeah, I always thought, because, you know, in the

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.040
 movie, the two people are constantly. I'm ovulating, "Come home now." There's always like a rush,

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.920
 and I always thought, "Oh, that's just a good comic conceit. Cut to us on tour in Europe,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:14.080
 where I'm finding myself on my day off, flying back to the UK." Yeah, because my life is obvious. Exactly.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:20.400
 It is a part of it. You know, there are certain times when you're more fertile in you. And honestly,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.040
 it's not easy. You need a bit of tantric to get you going, because, you know, like,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:30.560
 to order, I mean, I'm sure there are some, but, you know, you suddenly, "Oh, no." Anyway,

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.880
 this, we did it long before any Viagra. So, you know, anyway, we're going into tea by territory.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.560
 By the Vatican, for instance. Yes, yes, of course. So, the Vatican owned 25% of this company,

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:46.000
 and I was looking into the Vatican's finances, because I'm a former accountant. And

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:57.360
 in World War II, they had a bank called the, and it's actually helping bank. Effectively, yes. It was

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.240
 the Institute for Religious Works, and they brought it in as like a national bank, which wouldn't

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.280
 have to be overseen by any authority. And they were known as the world's best offshore bank.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:13.680
 And indeed, they are alleged to have hidden billions of pounds from Nazi sources. They were

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:19.920
 investigated by the Bank of Italy in 2010, and found that they were non-compliant in seven of the

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:25.040
 16 core standards of the Italian banking industry. But is that related to the Second World War?

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.880
 That's how it began. It began, actually, it began pre-Second World War, so.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.400
 But the investigation. No, the investigation is current. Oh, wow, okay. I say current is 2010,

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.680
 so it's 50 years ago. Are they going to have to give some of the weebec?

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:45.440
 We've all not made a taking the piss track there, and I think that's very good of us.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:51.840
 The other thing they have in Rome is they have a tax break for any chapel. So if they own a chapel

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.520
 in Rome, they don't have to pay tax on it. And a chapel counts as any building that has a three meter

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:03.840
 square place where you can pray. And so they own all these buildings in Rome, and they just put a tiny

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.080
 little corner and put a little statue of the Virgin Mary or something, call it a chapel if they

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:13.600
 don't have to pay tax on it. It's all according to a book called God's Bankers by Gerald Posner.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:23.200
 Well, it doesn't surprise us that money in religion can produce corruption. There's no doubt about that.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.120
 But the Pope in question on this one was Pius. Pius XII. So he's a friend of the podcast. Yeah,

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.560
 we mentioned him a couple of weeks ago. A couple of weeks ago. So he had this doctor, this really

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.760
 strange doctor called Paul Nehance, who was a Swiss surgeon, and he'd offered this rejuvenation

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.880
 treatment. So we're kind of in the realm of that already with the fertility and the essence

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.560
 and all of this stuff. But Nehance injected the buttocks of his famous patients, like supposedly

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:57.920
 King George VI, with the cells of fetal lambs and calves, and it was a kind of jujup, butcute uphage

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:04.240
 treatment. And this is the Pope, who's embalming, went disastrously wrong. And he ended up being,

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.120
 you know, his other, he was very unlucky with his doctors. The other doctor embalmed him supposedly

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:14.000
 in the traditional Aramaic style, and it went awfully, awfully wrong. And the other reason he's a

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.880
 friend of the podcast is he was the one who ruled in 1954 that anyone mentioning Jesus'

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:24.800
 Foskin will be automatically excommunicated, which is why I've been technically excommunicated.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.400
 Jesus was, was Jewish. So is this some read that I mean, is he thought of had one or not?

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:36.320
 Well, he was thought to have had it removed as a child, and they're absolutely, and there are relics

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:43.120
 around the world of this supposed Holy Foskin. Just get back this embalming. I didn't know about

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.720
 Pope embalming. Do they keep all the popes? Yeah, yeah. There's been thousand, I mean, well, I know about

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.080
 thousand, but an awful lot of post. Where are they then? Is that backed up? They're on a hard drive.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:59.040
 Is there a big on camera? There is a big on camera. If you go to the Vatican, there's like the

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.600
 catacombs underneath and they have loads of, they're not all on display, I have to say, so I don't know

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.280
 if they're all still there, but definitely you can what past loads of popes. How many popes do you think

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:14.240
 they've been? Oh, that's a good question. Can't be triple figures. What? You mean more than a hundred?

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:19.600
 Yeah, I think so. I mean, they've been post for two thousand years. For the A.D.? Yeah, and I think

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.800
 they've, yeah, let's have a, let's have a guy, let's have a guy. Okay, let's do a long time.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:28.880
 Let's say Peter, right? Yes. I mean, I think there's pious, if there's about a hundred piousies,

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:34.000
 I mean, there's certainly a lot of X's and ones. He was pious the 12th. Yeah, I'm saying double figures.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.400
 I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying, I've got the answer. I've got one, two, three. This is according to

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.920
 the pontifical yearbook, so that's a call yearbook. No, three hundred and sixty-five.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:49.920
 There's two hundred and sixty-six. All right. So, according to this, there's two. You've seen

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.120
 they've got them all. I mean, they cut, obviously, I haven't got the really early ones. I mean, when

00:40:53.120 --> 00:41:00.400
 how many popes can barmed popes? Are they? How many popes are still in physical? We don't, we don't

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.960
 fully know, apparently. There's lots of bits of popes that we have. We've got lots of hard skins and

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:15.600
 lots of poor skins. Don't mention them. Don't bring out the horse. Okay, it's time for a final

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:21.120
 fact of the show, and that is James. Okay. Ben, you've had a go at the other fact so far, but I think

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:26.320
 you'll be fine with this one. My fact this week is that Shakespeare's parents and his children

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:32.000
 were probably illiterate. Well, that's not a fact, is it? He strikes again.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.520
 It's really out of three. It's one yet. Right out the gates.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:43.280
 The word probably does a lot of work. It's a lot of damage. I mean, the fact that someone was

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.000
 probably something is about as far from being a fact as you can get. Okay, let me give you a

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.800
 prompt level fact. So, let me give you a little bit of evidence, but it is scant because what we

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.120
 know about them is very little, but Shakespeare's father and mother couldn't sign their names. Like,

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:07.840
 when they signed, they signed with images. So, his father chose to sign their names. That's absolutely

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.080
 and actually now, if you want to sign something now with an image rather than your name, you are

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:16.480
 allowed to do that by law. So, you are allowed, and actually in those days, it was relatively common.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:21.280
 So, crafts people, trades people, guild members would often like draw things. So, John, his father,

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:26.080
 drew a picture of a pair of Glover's compasses instead of his name. And so, some people point

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:34.400
 this as evidence that he couldn't write. And William Shakespeare had three kids, I think, but

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:40.560
 one of them, Hamlet, his son died very young. But then he had two daughters. And in those days,

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.040
 girls would typically not be taught how to read and write, or not how to write anyway.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.840
 And we have one sort of very quite scruffy signature of one of his daughters. So, it seems like she could

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:57.760
 write her name, but this implication is maybe not much else. But again, like, the evidence is really,

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:03.680
 really scary. It's really, so there's actually, we know more about Shakespeare than we do about any

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.760
 of the other great English poets of the English Reformation considerably more.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.400
 There are a lot of known facts, which is why it's particularly galling that idiot conspiracy

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:18.160
 theorist used to say, well, maybe it wasn't him, because they think of, oh, don't look at it as

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:24.400
 notes though. But let's just look at the issue, rather than the Shakespeare conspiracies. Firstly,

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:30.880
 Shakespeare's own signatures are generally varied. He spelled his name differently. The whole

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:36.000
 idea of what a signature was and what it meant. And indeed, what correct spelling was, was viewed

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.680
 very differently in those days. Think about the evidence. Mary was a daughter of the aristocracy.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.040
 Her mother. Absolutely. Now, her husband, there's no doubt about it. John Shakespeare came up.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:55.440
 He was lower class to her. But he eventually was in court for cooking books for various bits of

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.080
 dodgy accounting and things. So clearly, he certainly was mathematically literate. There's no doubt

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:07.280
 about that. He became mayor of Stratford on Aven. It seems unlikely that he wasn't able to read.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.160
 Don't forget reading and writing was separate in those days. I think that's another thing,

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:15.840
 isn't it? In those days, a lot of people could read but couldn't write. Yeah. Susanna Shakespeare,

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:21.840
 the elder daughter, was married to a very learning apothecary. She unquestionably worked within

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:27.920
 in his business. She was a very considerable herbalist and a gardener. It just seems unlikely

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.160
 that human curiosity, particularly if your father is the greatest dramatist of the age, they didn't

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:38.000
 realize he would become the greatest dramatist in English letters. It seems unlikely to me that they

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.440
 wouldn't have taught themselves to read, been taught to read. I know women were treated entirely

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.960
 differently. I personally think it more likely that they could read and probably write to a certain

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.320
 extent. It seems unlikely that little Hamlet, 11 years old running home from school, his twin sister,

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.880
 didn't take some interest in what he'd learnt. I think they could read. But neither is a fact. This is

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:06.720
 a kid called Hamlet. Hamlet. But this is all irrelevant anyway because it was all Franz's bacon, so it doesn't... Exactly.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:12.720
 Or some other Portuguese name Shakespeare did not. Do you want to know what is a fact? Gone. Because of

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:19.600
 course, it's a popular conspiracy, particularly amongst lovers and posh boys, that Shakespeare didn't

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.600
 write Shakespeare. My father had a good joke on that. He said, of course, Shakespeare didn't write his

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:29.200
 plays. It was another fellow with the same name because obviously, in a way, does it really matter. But of

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:34.080
 course, it is evidence of a corrosive snobbery in British culture because, of course, Shakespeare was

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.400
 famously the only poet of the English Renaissance who didn't go to either Oxford or Cambridge. I mean,

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:44.240
 the grip of those institutions had on British arts, as indeed politics and sciences, was as strong

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.960
 then as it is now. So I think it's a very unfortunate thing to say. Well, he was educated. He was

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.760
 chucked out of school when he was 13. Would he really... Well, you know, McCartney was a working class

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:01.920
 lad, as with George Harrison, you know, Len and slightly lesser. The idea that you, if you come from

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.720
 Ruff and Ready Roots, I mean, you can't have the finest brain in the country is, I think... I've got to

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.040
 say, Ben, coming from Bolton myself, I do agree with that. But anyway, just to get into my fact,

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:16.960
 because I'm waffling on and I can see you all want to get your face. No one questioned Shakespeare's

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:24.240
 provenance, his reality, the reality of Shakespeare. Starting with Ben Johnson, who wrote his obituary

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.840
 as his friends, the Hemmings, who put together the first folio, nobody mentioned. There is no recorded

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:36.320
 mention of doubts about Shakespeare until the middle of the 19th century. So 300 years past before

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.280
 anybody decided, well, nearly interesting, if I could start this, to me, they're just like Moon landing

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:47.040
 an eyelist, which is one step from Q and on. I think conspiracy theories are anti-science, anti-facts,

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:52.320
 and Shakespeare definitely wrote Shakespeare. I find it so interesting how this arose more than

00:46:52.320 --> 00:47:00.560
 200 years later. 300. So, Delia Bacon was one of the... Ah, the name, the clue. I think no relation.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.920
 The American woman. She was the first person to raise the possibility. She was clearly very

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.560
 intelligent in a lot of ways, but I think she was also quite unstable in other ways, and she traveled

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:16.720
 to England to do research on the fact that Francis Bacon, who was a scientist, and very

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:22.560
 learned guy, and very gifted in lots of ways, probably quite busy, though. Probably too busy to write

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:28.640
 37 plays, as well, anyway. And so lacking in any ego is all of the boys from Cambridge

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.040
 are that he didn't want any credit for them. How strange it was. Or did any of that cash?

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.320
 And he allowed this bloke from Stratford to buy a lot of houses on the proceeds. But I think she

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.120
 traveled to England, and she didn't really... She mostly stayed in her room when she was here, though,

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:50.000
 just sort of... And... Regained room, which she absorbed the atmospheres of the country,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.560
 and then she wrote this 700-page book arguing in the case. Anyway, I think it was Bill Bryson,

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.040
 who wrote a lovely short biography, Bill Bryson, finding various anti-stratfordians,

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:05.760
 who've included Jay Thomas-Luney, Sherwood E. Sillyman, and George Batty. And faux of the podcast,

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:12.400
 Mark Twain. Oh, is it? Yeah. Mark Twain, he said. So far as anybody actually knows and can prove,

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.040
 Shakespeare never wrote a play in his life. All the rest of his history is built up course upon

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.840
 course of guesses, inferences, theories, conjectures, classic Twain, classic Twain, I'm afraid.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:28.000
 That's all. I find it genuinely mad that otherwise intelligent people continue to love... And of

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.960
 course, it's because people love a conspiracy theory. But sadly, conspiracy theories are the

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:40.720
 enemy of the Enlightenment. We're already moving into a post-truth age, where we're going back to

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:47.520
 an age of faith and superstition and anti-imperial evidence. And I think it's really dangerous.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.440
 And it might seem harmless for a bunch of old love is to assemble every now and then in gay,

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.880
 say, "Well, I think it was the Duke of Buckingham." But I actually think it's the thin end of an

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:02.400
 anti-science, anti-evidence wedge, which leads to, you know, vaccination, conspiracy theories,

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:07.600
 and a whole world of where the president could say we like to choose alternative facts.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:14.320
 Well, you might like this then, Ben. Have you read the Shakespeare play that he wrote in the year 1853?

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:22.080
 That he collaborated with another famous writer, which is Victor Hugo. Once he was exiled from

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.400
 France to Jersey. He lived in Jersey for a while. Someone came around to the house and showed him

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.960
 table-tapping about the spirit world. He became obsessed with it. He spent a couple of years talking

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:38.640
 to amongst others, Lord Byron Jesus Christ, Joan of Arc, Mozart, Plato, two years. And Mozart

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.360
 was using the table to make original compositions that they wrote down. And one of the things that happened

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:49.280
 in those two years is that Victor Hugo and his son sat and channeled through Shakespeare a

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.880
 brand new Shakespeare play. They got the first act of a new comedy. It's in French because Shakespeare said,

00:49:54.880 --> 00:50:02.880
 Shakespeare said to them, "That is the superior language." And so that's out there. I don't think

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.160
 it's ever been performed. There's a one of them. Isn't that sad? Because obviously he was a great,

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.920
 you know, wrote those. Isn't it sad when you discover the feat of clay that everyone has considered?

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.840
 You know, I'm apparently Newton, dabbled in Alchemy. You weren't more likely to be the physics.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.600
 Yeah. He was very into it. But from the off, just quickly, you mentioned anti-facts theories

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.960
 as a result of this thin end of the wedge. Riddle me this, Ben. The second man who ever got the

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:36.560
 Pfizer jab in the UK against COVID was called Bill Shakespeare. No. That's a loop. You've brought

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:42.160
 us all the way back. You've stitched together so much. That's the famous image of what's he called,

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:48.080
 Matt Hancock, sort of pretending to cry, when someone told him that. There were a lot of unbelievably

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:55.600
 good jokes as a result. Two gentlemen of Corona, came of the flu. Is this a jabber I see before me?

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.840
 I mean, there was some very good things. Yeah, but one of the most amazing things is that

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.160
 that Bill Shakespeare eventually died, not of COVID, of something else, not long after. And in

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.440
 Argentina, when the news announced his death, they said we have lost one of the most important

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:18.880
 pointers in the English language. To me, he is the master is what she said on TV. And she had to

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:23.440
 come back on to the apologise and say, oh, no, no, that's not what I know. Well, linking vaccination back,

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:29.440
 I bet that newsreader felt a bit of a prick. One really good fact is about Shakespeare,

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.480
 because we talked about his daughters before is he had four grandchildren. Unfortunately, none of them

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.880
 had children afterwards, so that's where the line died out. But one of his grandchildren was called

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:44.000
 Shakespeare, as in the first name was Shakespeare. Oh, really? Isn't that cool? Yeah, it wasn't a surname,

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.400
 no, surname was Quini or Quini. So, they wanted to pay tribute to the famous grandfather Hussiah

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:55.680
 and wrote the canon of Shakespeare. But his lineage died out right with the grand autumn, except

00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:01.440
 there were few people who claim that it went on, including an American footballer who's called William

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:08.480
 Shakespeare. Oh, yeah. Yeah, died in 1974, also known as the Merchant of Menace. Yeah, he was part

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:13.120
 of the Notre Dame fighting Irish football team. And they claimed lineage, direct lineage from

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.160
 Shakespeare, despite having no evidence. It was pointed out that he failed at English at college.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:25.280
 But there is a descent from, I think Shakespeare's father or grandfather. I think that these days there

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:32.480
 is a baronette of, I think it's called Thomas, maybe Shakespeare. So the line, the Shakespeare family

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.560
 do have direct, is that a claim that he's connected? Well, I think it's not a claim. I think he's

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.560
 descended from dad or the grandfather. But there are, I mean, it is a surname. I mean, there are other

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.440
 Shakespeare's. Well, we know from the bloke who got the second five of that thing. There are other

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.720
 Shakespeare's and they're obviously always cursed with that name, you know, and like poor, we're

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:58.640
 causing it letters from black adders who hate Richard and name forever. And the other thing about

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.800
 Shakespeare the surname is we don't know what it means, but it might have been someone who uses a

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:11.360
 lats. Oh, yes, honestly, there are some degrees of separation of drinking. We're literally, we're

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.720
 huddling around these subjects. Wait a second. Stratford is Warwickshire, right? Yeah. Do you know what

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:23.760
 else was filmed in Warwickshire? Telly tobes? Telly tobes. And, and, and isn't a needle? A very small

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:36.720
 lump. I'm gonna wrap it up. We do actually do wrap up. Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.680
 what it says on the team. It's about what I've done. I've read it. I've read the whole thing. And it's
