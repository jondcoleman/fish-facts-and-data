00:00:17,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:29,"My name is Dad Shriver and I'm sitting here with Adju Huttamari, James Harkin and Alex"
00:00:29,00:00:33,Bell and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:33,00:00:40,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go starting with you, Alex."
00:00:40,00:00:46,My fact this week is that the Swiss flush about $2 million worth of gold down the toilet
00:00:46,00:00:47,every year.
00:00:47,00:00:51,Are they hiding it because it's Nazi gold and they're embarrassed about the fact they
00:00:51,00:00:52,have it?
00:00:52,00:00:59,"And time to mention the Nazis, like three seconds."
00:00:59,00:01:03,"No, this is, it's lots and lots of little tiny, tiny gold particles."
00:01:03,00:01:08,It's a waste result of the manufacturing process of watches that they think.
00:01:08,00:01:10,They're not entirely sure where it comes from.
00:01:10,00:01:15,All they know is that they've been analysing the content of sewage and it's got a really
00:01:15,00:01:16,weirdly high percentage of gold in it.
00:01:16,00:01:17,Can they collect it?
00:01:17,00:01:21,They're trying to come up with a way of getting it that's cost-effective but at the moment
00:01:21,00:01:23,it's too expensive.
00:01:23,00:01:28,How crazy that it's costing too much to get $1.8 million worth of gold.
00:01:28,00:01:32,"Yeah, except when you think it's tiny, tiny particles in the water so it's like panning"
00:01:32,00:01:33,for gold.
00:01:33,00:01:35,Can you go panning for gold there?
00:01:35,00:01:40,"I think they're way too small, it's not like panning for gold in like old times where you"
00:01:40,00:01:42,had a little nugget so you had the choice.
00:01:42,00:01:46,If you have the choice of panning for gold in a nice river in Scotland or maybe in a load
00:01:46,00:01:49,"of sewage in Switzerland, I know which one I choose."
00:01:49,00:01:51,"Yeah, but one definitely has gold at it."
00:01:51,00:01:54,One's got $1.8 million worth of gold.
00:01:54,00:01:56,There's gold in member mountains in Scotland.
00:01:56,00:01:57,Is it?
00:01:57,00:01:58,Did you not see that?
00:01:58,00:01:59,That was in the news about two weeks ago.
00:01:59,00:02:03,"Maybe a week ago where they found the largest gold nugget ever in Britain, I think."
00:02:03,00:02:04,"Oh, the guy who was sitting in the river."
00:02:04,00:02:10,"I think what he does is he lies down, face down in the water and he just kind of looks for"
00:02:10,00:02:11,it.
00:02:11,00:02:13,Like doesn't do that panning thing or whatever.
00:02:13,00:02:16,He just kind of lies there and waits and just tries to see it.
00:02:16,00:02:20,That's nice because it's like fishing but without the fish.
00:02:20,00:02:23,"You are the fish in a way, you're in the water."
00:02:23,00:02:25,In a way.
00:02:25,00:02:26,"What's it, do we know?"
00:02:26,00:02:29,Are you allowed to keep it if you find a big gold nugget in a river?
00:02:29,00:02:30,I can't remember.
00:02:30,00:02:33,I think what happens is the crown of states can claim it.
00:02:33,00:02:34,Oh.
00:02:34,00:02:37,So Queen's allowed to eat it.
00:02:37,00:02:40,"Is it, if you find it on crown of state land or is it just the Queen of?"
00:02:40,00:02:41,No.
00:02:41,00:02:42,I think Queen knows everything actually.
00:02:42,00:02:43,"Oh, man."
00:02:43,00:02:46,"If you find it downstairs in the, you know, let's say you're rooting"
00:02:46,00:02:50,around in the toilets of the QI office and there's no reason to say that.
00:02:50,00:02:52,And I don't know why you would look at me when you're saying that.
00:02:52,00:02:57,"Well, I would just say like we've already decided that that's a good place to find gold."
00:02:57,00:02:58,There's no rivers around here.
00:02:58,00:02:59,Right.
00:02:59,00:03:03,But if you did find some gold then technically I think you'd have to offer it to the Queen.
00:03:03,00:03:04,Really?
00:03:04,00:03:05,I think so.
00:03:05,00:03:08,I think the same goes for like bottle tops if you find them in a metal head.
00:03:08,00:03:09,She's just less interested.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"It's a crown made of bottle tops, isn't it?"
00:03:11,00:03:13,It's all of these rooms at Buckingham Palace.
00:03:13,00:03:15,They're just full of old bottle tops.
00:03:15,00:03:19,Do you know there's loads of gold in British sewers as well?
00:03:19,00:03:22,"But it's not from, because we don't have a luxury watch industry the same way that the"
00:03:22,00:03:27,"Swiss do, it's about seven parts per million which would make it economically feasible as"
00:03:27,00:03:28,a gold mine.
00:03:28,00:03:30,"As in, in a gold mine you get less than that."
00:03:30,00:03:34,"But the way you get, it gets into the water in Britain is from people doing the washing"
00:03:34,00:03:37,up while wearing wedding rings.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"So tiny bits of gold was a, and also get this."
00:03:39,00:03:44,"If you brush your teeth and you've got a gold tooth, tiny bits of gold will come off and"
00:03:44,00:03:45,make the way into the water.
00:03:45,00:03:50,How often would I have to do the washing up before my wedding ring completely disappeared
00:03:50,00:03:51,from my hand?
00:03:51,00:03:56,It sounds like you're really hoping to get out of something by doing the washing up.
00:03:56,00:04:01,"I can say to my wife, I can't do the washing up because that marriage will be an old one."
00:04:01,00:04:03,You've probably several hundred years of a phrase.
00:04:03,00:04:04,Okay.
00:04:04,00:04:08,It's a bit divorce and sounds like a loss of the wedding ring would happen much to you as
00:04:08,00:04:09,well.
00:04:09,00:04:13,"We've got in our upcoming book, we've got an article on the Fatberg that was displayed"
00:04:13,00:04:15,in the London Museum this year.
00:04:15,00:04:16,What is that book then?
00:04:16,00:04:18,It's going to be called the Book of the Year 2018.
00:04:18,00:04:19,Okay.
00:04:19,00:04:20,And where is it going to be available?
00:04:20,00:04:25,"You know, places like Waterstones and online retailers that Andy doesn't allow us to say"
00:04:25,00:04:26,anymore.
00:04:26,00:04:27,And I do.
00:04:27,00:04:29,It's going to be on Amazon.
00:04:29,00:04:31,I know you can't say that.
00:04:31,00:04:34,"Sorry, you were saying?"
00:04:34,00:04:35,Yeah.
00:04:35,00:04:39,So the Fatberg for anyone that doesn't know is just a giant lump of fat that they find
00:04:39,00:04:43,"in the sewers, mainly of London, but they've been found worldwide."
00:04:43,00:04:46,"And yeah, they're ginormous."
00:04:46,00:04:51,"It takes some days and days, in some cases, weeks to absolutely knock them apart."
00:04:51,00:04:54,They have to use pneumatic drills to get them down.
00:04:54,00:05:00,And it was made up 90% of cooking fat that we put down our drains.
00:05:00,00:05:05,"The others are wet wipes, which is all down to, it turns out, Colonel Sanders and KFC."
00:05:05,00:05:11,"KFC, effectively, with the first people to let the wet wipe out into the public."
00:05:11,00:05:14,"The man, the man who invented the wet wipe sold it to KFC."
00:05:14,00:05:16,"So KFC, we're the original wet wipe people."
00:05:16,00:05:19,"But now they're mostly used by parents and stuff, right?"
00:05:19,00:05:20,Exactly.
00:05:20,00:05:21,For children's mums.
00:05:21,00:05:22,Yeah.
00:05:22,00:05:26,"They weren't used to wipe the chickens, were they?"
00:05:26,00:05:30,"But yeah, what's interesting as well is that they found a higher concentration of banned"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"gym supplements in the Fatberg than they did, say, cocaine or MDMA."
00:05:34,00:05:35,What like steroids and things?
00:05:35,00:05:36,"Yeah, exactly."
00:05:36,00:05:39,So the Fatberg might become muscle burn.
00:05:39,00:05:43,That's a German city I want to go to sometime.
00:05:43,00:05:45,All German cities and muscle burn.
00:05:45,00:05:46,Yeah.
00:05:46,00:05:50,Very well developed people.
00:05:50,00:05:54,So I found a crime from this year where thieves used sewage to steal gold.
00:05:54,00:05:55,This is clever.
00:05:55,00:05:58,"So it's in Western Australia, where there are lots of gold mines."
00:05:58,00:06:01,"And what they did is they stole a sewage truck, and you remember sewage trucks, they have"
00:06:01,00:06:05,"those big hoses and nozzles, but they can suck up sewage with."
00:06:05,00:06:12,"And they stuck that into a gold mine site's big pit of gold-rich liquid, and they suck"
00:06:12,00:06:13,that all up.
00:06:13,00:06:14,Interesting.
00:06:14,00:06:16,And I didn't know they would have like gold-rich liquid.
00:06:16,00:06:19,I don't know how the mining process works.
00:06:19,00:06:22,"I guess maybe if they're blasting out of the liquid, they sort of had this gold-y soup"
00:06:22,00:06:23,which they could then refine.
00:06:23,00:06:27,"And if you're going to leave that lying around in a big, fat-labeled gold-rich liquid."
00:06:27,00:06:31,"You're all skinned to be robbed, really, aren't you? That's like putting it in a sort of bag with a dollar sign on it."
00:06:31,00:06:37,"It's very impressive though, to steal a sewage truck, to think of that, because I would have just gone along with a Henry Hoover and tried to take a little bit."
00:06:37,00:06:43,"I think that would be the great escape level way of doing it, going in as a keener every day and just like getting a little bit in your Hoover."
00:06:43,00:06:44,Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:51,"The largest nugget of gold ever found was called ""Welcome Stranger"", okay."
00:06:51,00:06:56,"And I say was, because as soon as it was found, it was melted down into gold fingers."
00:06:56,00:06:59,"The second largest was called ""Welcome"", ""Only Welcome""."
00:06:59,00:07:02,And that was also melted down into sovereigns.
00:07:02,00:07:08,But the good thing about that is it was found by one guy with a pickaxe who carried on mining after his fellow miners had gone to lunch.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"So they all went away and he thought, ""I'm going to carry on mining."""
00:07:11,00:07:13,"And as soon as he saw the nugget, he fainted."
00:07:13,00:07:19,"And then when the guys came back from lunch, they saw he was kind of faced down in the middle of the hole and they thought he was dead."
00:07:19,00:07:23,And so they climbed down to try and save him and they saw the nugget and they fainted as well.
00:07:23,00:07:30,So it turns out the way to find nuggets of gold is just to lay face down.
00:07:30,00:07:31,That's true.
00:07:31,00:07:34,"Why were they called ""Welcome and Welcome Stranger"", that's quite weird names for nuggets."
00:07:34,00:07:36,"Well, that's a really good question."
00:07:36,00:07:37,I don't know why they're called that.
00:07:37,00:07:44,"I suppose what you might say, if you found a nugget, you might, ""Oh, welcome Stranger."""
00:07:44,00:07:45,That's a bit.
00:07:45,00:07:50,That's a oddly predatory way of discovering something.
00:07:50,00:07:56,So the third largest is the largest extent nugget. It's called the Hand of Faith and it's on display in Las Vegas.
00:07:56,00:08:00,"Do you know what the Netherlands are doing with their old toilet paper, with their old toilet paper?"
00:08:00,00:08:01,"Yeah, use toilet paper."
00:08:01,00:08:04,They're making it into windmills.
00:08:04,00:08:05,Shitty windmills.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"Oh, I wish it was that."
00:08:07,00:08:09,"No, well, they're turning it into bike lanes."
00:08:09,00:08:15,"So it is a similarly green, it was a similarly kind of stereotypical dutch thing."
00:08:15,00:08:19,"Are they, do they collect their paper on the side and not flush it down, is that way?"
00:08:19,00:08:22,"I don't know how it's collected, actually, that's a really good point."
00:08:22,00:08:24,It must be that it's flushed down and then sort of scooped out.
00:08:24,00:08:26,I think it's scooped out.
00:08:26,00:08:31,"Because what they do, once they've got it, I don't know how they get it, but they extract the cellulose from it."
00:08:31,00:08:35,"So it's tree pulp and stuff, which has a lot of cellulose, which is this tough fiber."
00:08:35,00:08:36,"Then they sterilize it, obviously."
00:08:36,00:08:40,"And then they turn it into big pellets, which they can turn into asphalt."
00:08:40,00:08:46,"But also, bike lanes are usually colored brown, aren't they, to make them look different to the rest of the road."
00:08:46,00:08:46,Right.
00:08:46,00:08:48,So they probably don't have to use any coloring.
00:08:48,00:08:50,"Yeah, a lot of skid marks as well."
00:08:50,00:08:54,"And then the breaking of the bikes, guys, watch out for pooled desertions."
00:08:54,00:08:56,"Oh, yeah, me."
00:08:56,00:09:02,"I'm almost certain that they are, they must be flushing them when they're clashing the sewers."
00:09:02,00:09:05,"Because it's not like they'd be saying, ""Please, everyone put aside your used toilet paper, we'll come and get it."""
00:09:05,00:09:07,"No, that does happen, dude."
00:09:07,00:09:08,"That does happen, Alex."
00:09:08,00:09:08,That does happen.
00:09:08,00:09:09,"Yes, it does."
00:09:09,00:09:11,"Nothing that depends on people, like, no, no, no, no."
00:09:11,00:09:12,It happens in Greece.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"Yeah, it happens in Greece, really?"
00:09:14,00:09:15,"Yeah, I film."
00:09:15,00:09:17,I don't remember that song.
00:09:17,00:09:18,(Laughter)
00:09:18,00:09:27,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:09:27,00:09:31,"My factor is that Robert Burns made his own ink out of Old Beer,"
00:09:31,00:09:34,"Lard, Elephant Tusk, and Sulfuric Acid."
00:09:34,00:09:35,Wow.
00:09:35,00:09:36,Yeah.
00:09:36,00:09:37,It's very cool.
00:09:37,00:09:38,What a man.
00:09:38,00:09:42,"I read the source that you sent for this, and it noted that these were all things that were readily available in Scotland at the time."
00:09:42,00:09:43,(Laughter)
00:09:43,00:09:45,"Yeah, I mean, Old Beer and Lard, obviously."
00:09:45,00:09:47,But where did they get Elephant Tusk in Scotland?
00:09:47,00:09:48,"Library, I reckon."
00:09:48,00:09:49,Big ivory trade.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Sure.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Yeah.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"I mean, that's, I just said another word for the thing."
00:09:53,00:09:56,(Laughter)
00:09:56,00:09:58,"Capitalism, I guess."
00:09:58,00:09:59,(Laughter)
00:09:59,00:10:03,"Yeah, so I didn't know this, but writers basically had to make their own ink for centuries."
00:10:03,00:10:05,You couldn't just go down to the ink shop and buy some ink.
00:10:05,00:10:11,"So there were all these recipes around, and the researchers from the University of Glasgow have analysed."
00:10:11,00:10:12,It's really cool.
00:10:12,00:10:18,"They took original burns poems, and they lifted ink away in a way that didn't damage the original poems."
00:10:18,00:10:19,Wow.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Because obviously they're original manuscripts.
00:10:20,00:10:21,That's amazing.
00:10:21,00:10:22,I wonder how they do that.
00:10:22,00:10:23,I don't know.
00:10:23,00:10:24,I wish I did.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Because you wouldn't want to accidentally lift off a whole word.
00:10:25,00:10:26,No.
00:10:26,00:10:27,(Laughter)
00:10:27,00:10:28,And you forget what it is.
00:10:28,00:10:30,(Laughter)
00:10:30,00:10:37,And the really cool thing is they've found different recipes from different stages of his life.
00:10:37,00:10:45,"When he was a young and poor, he used a particular kind of iron gul ink, and then as he got richer, he used this thing called ivory black,"
00:10:45,00:10:49,"which involved treacle, and lard, and acid, and vinegar, and ivory."
00:10:49,00:10:52,And it's a way of telling the real poems from forgeries.
00:10:52,00:10:53,"Yeah, which is amazing, isn't it?"
00:10:53,00:10:57,They're starting to apply this now to all ancient manuscripts.
00:10:57,00:11:01,"Because if they see the recipe someone uses, and then someone else claims to have an original,"
00:11:01,00:11:08,"and it turns out it's made from, I don't know, mull and butter and sausages."
00:11:08,00:11:10,So he mull as in the animal.
00:11:10,00:11:11,"Yeah, the animal."
00:11:11,00:11:12,"No, mulls, human mulls."
00:11:12,00:11:13,(Laughter)
00:11:13,00:11:14,That's her in sausages.
00:11:14,00:11:15,Yeah.
00:11:15,00:11:19,Robert Burns used to have some really cool nicknames.
00:11:19,00:11:21,He used to refer to himself as spunky.
00:11:21,00:11:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:22,00:11:23,Yeah.
00:11:23,00:11:25,He used to call himself the rant and roven robin.
00:11:25,00:11:27,That was one of his personal favourites apparently.
00:11:27,00:11:30,"But he never called himself rabbi or roby, which is what?"
00:11:30,00:11:31,What?
00:11:31,00:11:35,"Rabbi Burns or Robby Burns is what many people in the UK would associate as his nickname,"
00:11:35,00:11:36,that we've given him.
00:11:36,00:11:38,"Yeah, never called himself that."
00:11:38,00:11:39,But he's calling himself these.
00:11:39,00:11:40,He's already nicknames.
00:11:40,00:11:42,"Yeah, they're not really nicknames if you call them yourself."
00:11:42,00:11:44,No one else is calling him spunky.
00:11:44,00:11:46,I don't think that counts as a nickname.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"Yeah, that's more like an online avatar."
00:11:48,00:11:49,(Laughter)
00:11:49,00:11:51,Just Twitter handle at rant and roven robin.
00:11:51,00:11:52,(Laughter)
00:11:52,00:11:55,"Oh, he would have been great on Twitter."
00:11:55,00:11:56,"Really funny, I think."
00:11:56,00:12:01,"Really, actually just for tweeting, really tedious things about making your own ink."
00:12:01,00:12:03,"Yeah, these recipes are really weird."
00:12:03,00:12:06,So there are lots of recipes that used to exist.
00:12:06,00:12:08,"Oh, do you know about a gall ink?"
00:12:08,00:12:10,"Ah, no."
00:12:10,00:12:11,Asterix?
00:12:11,00:12:12,A gall?
00:12:12,00:12:13,"Ah, sorry, G-A."
00:12:13,00:12:14,"A gall as in gall bladder, I guess."
00:12:14,00:12:15,Yes.
00:12:15,00:12:17,But not as in gall bladder.
00:12:17,00:12:18,Gall wasps.
00:12:18,00:12:19,Exactly.
00:12:19,00:12:23,"Yeah, so there are hundreds of species of wasps called gall wasps."
00:12:23,00:12:29,And what they do is they land on an oak tree and they lay their eggs inside the leaf buds.
00:12:29,00:12:32,And then that turns into this weird kind of tumor or lump on the tree.
00:12:32,00:12:35,And the little grub grows inside and it's all protected from the outside.
00:12:35,00:12:39,But those galls can be ground up and they're a massive ingredient for ink.
00:12:39,00:12:41,And they work for hundreds and hundreds of years.
00:12:41,00:12:45,There's only one kind of oak gall which makes the ink.
00:12:45,00:12:48,And it's basically the most important wasp in history.
00:12:48,00:12:54,"And so all of, you know, Mozart, Darwin, Magna Carta, Bayo of all of that was written in oak gall ink."
00:12:54,00:12:55,Wow.
00:12:55,00:12:58,It was for centuries and centuries it was the ink to use.
00:12:58,00:13:02,"So you could say that these wasps are responsible for all those great works, can't you really?"
00:13:02,00:13:03,I think you can.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:05,Wow.
00:13:05,00:13:09,"I mean, also the trees that you made the paper from and you know, the tables."
00:13:09,00:13:10,It's a group effort.
00:13:10,00:13:12,It's a laboratory.
00:13:12,00:13:14,It's just logic is flawed.
00:13:14,00:13:15,"You know, well done wasps."
00:13:15,00:13:16,Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:18,It's not going to be like a hidden figures movie.
00:13:18,00:13:19,Sorry.
00:13:19,00:13:21,I'm a recognized asset.
00:13:21,00:13:25,So what do we make it out of these days?
00:13:25,00:13:27,I don't actually know much about.
00:13:27,00:13:29,I don't know actually.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"I think it involves carbon, but I haven't looked it up properly."
00:13:32,00:13:34,Is it not made out of moles and sausages?
00:13:34,00:13:35,"A butter, I think."
00:13:35,00:13:36,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:36,00:13:38,I don't know.
00:13:38,00:13:43,It's probably made out of some kind of synthetic resin stuff.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Yeah.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Let's go with that.
00:13:45,00:13:46,Yeah.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Cool.
00:13:47,00:13:48,Capitalism.
00:13:48,00:13:53,Did you know that the Secret Service has an international ink library?
00:13:53,00:13:54,No.
00:13:54,00:14:00,"And they keep more than 11,000 specimens of ink and it's for identifying mystery inks when they get,"
00:14:00,00:14:02,"you know, like a poison pen battery or something like that."
00:14:02,00:14:04,They've got ink stating all.
00:14:04,00:14:05,So it was set up in a suit.
00:14:05,00:14:07,What does that do for them?
00:14:07,00:14:11,Or they can find out like when or where it was made and like tons of it.
00:14:11,00:14:17,They're looking for the author of the bail wolf.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Bring in the wasp.
00:14:18,00:14:24,"But yeah, they've got ink stating back always in 1920s."
00:14:24,00:14:25,And it's pretty cool.
00:14:25,00:14:29,So blood's used often in place of ink.
00:14:29,00:14:32,I was just looking into different types of methods of...
00:14:32,00:14:33,Where?
00:14:33,00:14:34,Where?
00:14:34,00:14:36,So did a sadam Hussein have a caran in his eye?
00:14:36,00:14:37,Yeah.
00:14:37,00:14:38,This is what I was going to say.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"No, no, but it's extraordinary."
00:14:40,00:14:41,I've not heard of this.
00:14:41,00:14:48,"So Sadam Hussein post a assassination attempt on his son, became a devout Muslim."
00:14:48,00:14:51,And so I read this in Atlas Obscura.
00:14:51,00:14:58,"He gave on his, after his 60th birthday, 27 liters of his own blood to a polygonal form."
00:14:58,00:15:03,So he must have needed a big biscuit after that.
00:15:03,00:15:09,So he gave it to this calligrapher who spent two years putting together a 600 page blood.
00:15:09,00:15:17,"Sadam Hussein blood-inked caran, which is now locked in a vault in a mosque in Baghdad."
00:15:17,00:15:18,But it sits there.
00:15:18,00:15:19,It's just bizarre.
00:15:19,00:15:20,Yeah.
00:15:20,00:15:24,"I mean, there's much more blood than you would need to make a new Sadam Hussein there."
00:15:24,00:15:26,You need more than blood to make a personan.
00:15:26,00:15:27,That's true.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Yeah.
00:15:28,00:15:29,No.
00:15:29,00:15:31,I'm just saying if someone else finds other ingredients.
00:15:31,00:15:32,I don't know.
00:15:32,00:15:34,I've watched Jurassic Park and I'm pretty sure they only had some blood.
00:15:34,00:15:35,"That's very true, actually."
00:15:35,00:15:38,But then the problem is that the dance was turned female.
00:15:38,00:15:42,So at some point Sadam Hussein might turn into a girl and start reproducing on the island.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:44,But I'll see.
00:15:44,00:15:45,We're keeping him on.
00:15:45,00:15:46,All right.
00:15:46,00:15:48,I don't want to go to the theme park also in the film to be honest.
00:15:48,00:15:51,I think it's a more sensible pitch than the New Jurassic World movie.
00:15:51,00:15:52,Okay.
00:15:52,00:15:59,Okay.
00:15:59,00:16:00,It is time for fact number three.
00:16:00,00:16:02,And that is James.
00:16:02,00:16:09,"Okay, my fact this week is that Sweden's highest point is now its second highest after the top of it melted."
00:16:09,00:16:10,Oh no.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"Poor, poor highest point."
00:16:12,00:16:14,"Oh, good for the second highest point."
00:16:14,00:16:15,"Yeah, that's true."
00:16:15,00:16:17,"Finally, that bastard's got what's coming to it."
00:16:17,00:16:20,So is the second highest one not covered in ice?
00:16:20,00:16:22,So you're right.
00:16:22,00:16:23,Exactly right.
00:16:23,00:16:24,So they're basically the same part.
00:16:24,00:16:25,They're the same mountain.
00:16:25,00:16:27,But they're two different peaks on the same mountain.
00:16:27,00:16:31,And the highest point in Sweden has a glacier on top of it.
00:16:31,00:16:37,"But due to the recent heat wave, the glacier has melted and now the second highest point is the highest."
00:16:37,00:16:40,But in the winter they expect them to swap places again.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Yeah.
00:16:41,00:16:46,So it must be really confusing for any sort of textbooks that they're going to publish between now and winter.
00:16:46,00:16:47,Because they don't know.
00:16:47,00:16:50,They can't confirm that it's definitely going to get cold enough.
00:16:50,00:16:51,The real victims.
00:16:51,00:16:55,"This is, I'll probably pronounce this wrong."
00:16:55,00:16:59,"But it's something like Kepp and the Kaiser mountain, which is in the north of Sweden."
00:16:59,00:17:00,Oh man.
00:17:00,00:17:02,So it's not a good news story in some ways.
00:17:02,00:17:05,"Well, I didn't put it forward as a good news story."
00:17:05,00:17:06,"No, no, no."
00:17:06,00:17:07,"No, you didn't."
00:17:07,00:17:09,I think it's just a thing that happened.
00:17:09,00:17:15,And I think it's interesting that a country can have two peaks that are the highest of different parts.
00:17:15,00:17:16,Yeah.
00:17:16,00:17:18,And there are even worse things about it actually.
00:17:18,00:17:24,"Because let's say you're Swedish or let's say you're any nationality, but you want to climb the highest point in Sweden."
00:17:24,00:17:30,"You've always been able to climb this kind of point, which is a north peak of Kepp and Kaiser."
00:17:30,00:17:33,And now you need to climb the other one.
00:17:33,00:17:35,And actually it's a much more difficult climb.
00:17:35,00:17:41,"So for a safety aspect, they think a lot more people might get injured or killed because they're trying to climb this really difficult peak."
00:17:41,00:17:43,Whereas before they could do the relatively easy one.
00:17:43,00:17:46,"Can you wait until, I guess you can wait until winter."
00:17:46,00:17:48,"I know it's bad climbing mountains and winter, isn't it?"
00:17:48,00:17:50,It's easier in spring and summer.
00:17:50,00:17:55,"Yeah, although it's snowy at the top anyway of the old one."
00:17:55,00:17:58,How much is it mounted by to make it a match of center?
00:17:58,00:18:03,Because you could just take like a calippo up if you really want the other one to be able to just stick it in the snow.
00:18:03,00:18:05,I don't think you're allowed to make your own highest point.
00:18:05,00:18:06,"Well, that did happen."
00:18:06,00:18:07,That's that movie.
00:18:07,00:18:08,I think we might have mentioned it before.
00:18:08,00:18:12,"The man who went up the hill and came down the mountain, which was a true story of the game."
00:18:12,00:18:16,"Wales, who they said that to be amounted, it had to be a certain height."
00:18:16,00:18:19,So we added a little bit on top of it to make it higher.
00:18:19,00:18:23,But I think he did that with grounds rather than calipos.
00:18:23,00:18:28,"I didn't actually, I thought that movie was going to be something sort of some tedious emotional journey."
00:18:28,00:18:29,And that was a metaphor.
00:18:29,00:18:30,I didn't realize that was literally the story.
00:18:30,00:18:32,I think it might also be a tedious emotional journey.
00:18:32,00:18:33,"Yeah, it was."
00:18:33,00:18:34,"Okay, so get this."
00:18:34,00:18:37,The lowest highest point.
00:18:37,00:18:38,"No, hang on, sorry."
00:18:38,00:18:39,There we go.
00:18:39,00:18:40,"No, down it."
00:18:40,00:18:44,The highest lowest point in the world in any country.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"Oh, okay."
00:18:45,00:18:46,"So is it, can I guess?"
00:18:46,00:18:47,Yeah.
00:18:47,00:18:49,I think is it in Swaziland?
00:18:49,00:18:51,"Oh, you're so close."
00:18:51,00:18:52,It's down there somewhere.
00:18:52,00:18:53,It's the other one.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Lesutu.
00:18:54,00:18:56,It's the other small country within South Africa.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"It's Lesutu, the enclave country, which is completely surrounded by South Africa."
00:18:59,00:19:00,Okay.
00:19:00,00:19:01,What is it?
00:19:01,00:19:03,Is it like a cave or is it supposed to be above ground?
00:19:03,00:19:05,"Yeah, it's just the lowest."
00:19:05,00:19:10,"So all of Lesutu is well over 1,000 metres above sea level."
00:19:10,00:19:14,"So the lowest point in Lesutu is 1,400 metres above sea level."
00:19:14,00:19:16,And everything else is even higher than that.
00:19:16,00:19:19,So in any countries that are entirely below that point.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"Oh, well, two value."
00:19:21,00:19:22,Two value.
00:19:22,00:19:25,"Yeah, all of those places that are going to get two value in the Maldives."
00:19:25,00:19:26,Yeah.
00:19:26,00:19:29,"So the lowest high point, as opposed to the highest low point."
00:19:29,00:19:30,The lowest high point.
00:19:30,00:19:31,Yeah.
00:19:31,00:19:34,"Is in the Maldives, which is 2.4 metres above sea level."
00:19:34,00:19:35,Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"So Maldives, obviously, lots of islands."
00:19:37,00:19:40,And 99% of the Maldives territory is open ocean.
00:19:40,00:19:44,"But there was this island called Villingale, which had an 8-foot rise on it,"
00:19:44,00:19:45,which was the highest point.
00:19:45,00:19:49,"However, in 2013, a golf course opened on that island,"
00:19:49,00:19:53,"and it has a small mound on it, which was 16 feet above sea level."
00:19:53,00:19:57,And the fifth hole teeing off point is the highest point now in the Maldives.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"Oh, good."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"And it's in a resort, and they do a daily tour."
00:20:00,00:20:03,And all guests who complete the ascend get a certificate.
00:20:03,00:20:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:06,00:20:07,Wow.
00:20:07,00:20:08,That's hilarious.
00:20:08,00:20:12,"That's be annoying, though, if you're playing golf and you've got a whole sort of expedition"
00:20:12,00:20:15,trying to mount a hole.
00:20:15,00:20:17,There's a flag there.
00:20:17,00:20:18,Someone's got here.
00:20:18,00:20:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:21,00:20:22,I've got a Swedish Mountains fact.
00:20:22,00:20:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:23,00:20:25,There is a massive bunker inside--
00:20:25,00:20:27,Is this another golf fact?
00:20:27,00:20:28,No.
00:20:28,00:20:33,So there's a sort of massive underground bunker inside the Swedish mountains.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"And it was built as sort of government protection facility for, you know,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,nuclear events and stuff.
00:20:38,00:20:41,And it's no longer used to that.
00:20:41,00:20:44,"And it was sold to a private data center, so they keep servers in there now."
00:20:44,00:20:48,And one of the things that's kept inside of the servers is WikiLeaks.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Huh?
00:20:49,00:20:50,A sunch?
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Yeah, actually, yeah."
00:20:51,00:20:54,The digital version of a sunch is kept in--
00:20:54,00:20:56,"It's kept in prison, in underground."
00:20:56,00:20:58,And you look at pictures.
00:20:58,00:21:00,It does actually look like an evil villain's layer.
00:21:00,00:21:01,It's crazy.
00:21:01,00:21:02,But it's inside a mountain.
00:21:02,00:21:03,It's made of glass.
00:21:03,00:21:03,Wow.
00:21:03,00:21:04,It's cool.
00:21:04,00:21:05,"That's where WikiLeaks is, guys."
00:21:05,00:21:06,It's inside a Swedish mountain.
00:21:06,00:21:07,Wow.
00:21:07,00:21:08,That is very cool.
00:21:08,00:21:12,"The highest point in the Netherlands is 4,000 miles from Amsterdam."
00:21:12,00:21:13,What?
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:18,"So there's the Caribbean Netherlands, which is a different hillies."
00:21:18,00:21:22,"Yeah, I think it was called the Dutch Antilles, and then recently they had a weird admin change."
00:21:22,00:21:26,"But there's an island called Saba, and it has a mount on it called Mount Scenery."
00:21:26,00:21:29,It's about three or four times higher than anywhere in the Netherlands.
00:21:29,00:21:30,"That's true, actually."
00:21:30,00:21:36,"If the highest point of Britain, I think, if we count everything that we claim is in the Antarctic--"
00:21:36,00:21:37,"Oh, that's good."
00:21:37,00:21:40,"--because we claim a little bit of the Antarctic, which has a massive mountain on it."
00:21:40,00:21:41,Nice.
00:21:41,00:21:43,"And the highest point in Australia is not, what does it say--"
00:21:43,00:21:44,Cozy Oscar.
00:21:44,00:21:50,"Yeah, it's actually an island off the coast of Australia, which has got a massive peak on it."
00:21:50,00:21:54,"And the highest point in Spain is in the Canary Islands, Mount Tiede."
00:21:54,00:21:58,"So loads of countries, the highest point, isn't really in that country at all."
00:21:58,00:21:59,Wow.
00:21:59,00:22:00,Who owns the moon?
00:22:00,00:22:01,I know.
00:22:01,00:22:02,I'm singing the moon.
00:22:02,00:22:03,What is the highest?
00:22:03,00:22:04,With the highest--
00:22:04,00:22:05,No one owns the moon.
00:22:05,00:22:06,"No, but there's the flag."
00:22:06,00:22:07,That's not true.
00:22:07,00:22:09,So I've got a certificate.
00:22:09,00:22:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:10,00:22:13,The highest point of Andy's house is actually on the moon.
00:22:13,00:22:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:15,00:22:20,I have a thing or two about the big heat wave that we've been going through.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:21,00:22:25,"So this is quite tied in, your fact, to the fact that globally there's been a heat wave."
00:22:25,00:22:31,"And Ireland, very recently, through the heat wave and through the drought,"
00:22:31,00:22:37,"has had exposed a sort of huge stone that says ""ire."""
00:22:37,00:22:38,So E-I-R-E.
00:22:38,00:22:42,"Sorry, I always pronounce that error, but I don't know how to pronounce it."
00:22:42,00:22:43,"Yeah, would you say error?"
00:22:43,00:22:44,Don't look at me.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Would you say it?
00:22:45,00:22:46,I don't know.
00:22:46,00:22:48,I'd say it is an error to say it.
00:22:48,00:22:49,What?
00:22:49,00:22:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:50,00:22:51,I think it is error.
00:22:51,00:22:52,"Error, so I'll just say that."
00:22:52,00:22:53,Yeah.
00:22:53,00:22:54,So it's exposed.
00:22:54,00:23:00,"This giant stone error, E-I-R-E, and it's along the Irish coast."
00:23:00,00:23:07,"And what it was is during the Second World War, they built this to show the enemies that were flying over"
00:23:07,00:23:10,"thinking that they were going to bomb, let's say, England."
00:23:10,00:23:11,Don't bomb us.
00:23:11,00:23:12,This is Ireland.
00:23:12,00:23:13,This is neutral grounds.
00:23:13,00:23:16,Wasn't it to differentiate Ireland from Northern Ireland?
00:23:16,00:23:17,"Oh, OK."
00:23:17,00:23:18,Was it Northern Ireland?
00:23:18,00:23:22,"Well, I'm just guessing, but I would have thought that pilots wouldn't know whether they were over Ireland or--"
00:23:22,00:23:23,"Why could be foggy, you know?"
00:23:23,00:23:24,If you were.
00:23:24,00:23:25,Yeah.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"Second World War, they actually have."
00:23:27,00:23:29,It's just assuming everyone in the war was an idiot.
00:23:29,00:23:33,It sounds like someone who's used the excuse to fog for making some pretty egregious errors in your life.
00:23:33,00:23:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:34,00:23:35,I don't mean to be in her house.
00:23:35,00:23:36,I don't know.
00:23:36,00:23:37,I didn't know.
00:23:37,00:23:38,I was 50 miles away.
00:23:38,00:23:39,I was foggy.
00:23:39,00:23:40,What could I say?
00:23:40,00:23:43,"Sorry, just to backtrack a tiny bit."
00:23:43,00:23:52,"There were huge fires as a result of this heat wave, and the fires knocked out all of the grass and the trees and so on, and it's exposed."
00:23:52,00:23:56,"This giant air, E-I-R-E, to mean Ireland."
00:23:56,00:23:59,"I've found it on the internet, so let's see how they pronounce it."
00:23:59,00:24:02,Air or air?
00:24:02,00:24:03,Brilliant.
00:24:03,00:24:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:04,00:24:06,Since that porn hub that you've not watched.
00:24:06,00:24:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:07,00:24:11,"I have a fact about Sweden, which I definitely know how to pronounce."
00:24:11,00:24:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:12,00:24:17,"So, in lots of Swedish mountains, there have been no worms since the ice age."
00:24:17,00:24:19,They were all wiped out.
00:24:19,00:24:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:21,00:24:22,It's true.
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Yeah, great."
00:24:23,00:24:24,"I mean, bad for the worms."
00:24:24,00:24:27,"It's bad for the worms, but they've got other places to live, so it's fine."
00:24:27,00:24:29,And bad for the soil in the mountains?
00:24:29,00:24:30,This is the thing.
00:24:30,00:24:33,"So, they change the vegetation, and they have very negative effects on particular trees."
00:24:33,00:24:35,I think even effect deer at life cycles.
00:24:35,00:24:36,I can't remember how.
00:24:36,00:24:44,"So, the thing is that they are definitely invasive, because world populations apparently are only capable of moving five to ten meters a year."
00:24:44,00:24:49,"So, for them to make their way all the way through northern Europe into the Swedish mountains, they wouldn't have done it for thousands of doubt."
00:24:49,00:24:50,It's not much of an invasion.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"It's not life for Germans going into Russia, is it?"
00:24:52,00:24:53,No.
00:24:53,00:24:57,"So, this is how we know that they're invasive."
00:24:57,00:25:00,And they're impossible to get rid of if they establish themselves.
00:25:00,00:25:04,"So, this could completely change the European landscape over the next few hundred years."
00:25:04,00:25:05,Yeah.
00:25:05,00:25:11,"Do you know that, due to the heat wave, bears in Dundee in the zoo."
00:25:11,00:25:14,I've got an 80 kilo ice lolly to keep them cool.
00:25:14,00:25:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:15,00:25:16,Wow.
00:25:16,00:25:17,What's it made of?
00:25:17,00:25:18,Ice.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"Oh, nice."
00:25:19,00:25:20,And fruit.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"Oh, lovely."
00:25:21,00:25:22,That's very nice.
00:25:22,00:25:23,That does sound good.
00:25:23,00:25:25,It sounds like one of those decoy healthy lollies.
00:25:25,00:25:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:27,00:25:31,"Yeah, like when the ice cream man used to come, and we weren't allowed to go,"
00:25:31,00:25:35,and my mom would instead freeze some orange juice to have that healthy thing.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Yeah.
00:25:36,00:25:41,"Would she then cut the carton open, as in, how would you get at the orange juice?"
00:25:41,00:25:42,Did you pour it into a glass?
00:25:42,00:25:44,"You do it in ice cube trays, right?"
00:25:44,00:25:48,"No. So, we had special ice lolly trays that like ice cube trays,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,but shaped like ice lollies.
00:25:50,00:25:51,"I remember those. So, you pour the, yeah, into the moulds."
00:25:51,00:25:53,Yeah. That is a better method.
00:25:53,00:25:54,And it was freezing the ice cube.
00:25:54,00:25:56,The orange could just cast a bit.
00:25:56,00:25:57,And then hacking it open.
00:25:57,00:25:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:58,00:26:00,Entire liter of ice orange juice.
00:26:00,00:26:04,What you do is you jab a pool cue into the orange juice cast and freeze that.
00:26:04,00:26:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:06,00:26:08,"And did the bears get, like, get it on sticks?"
00:26:08,00:26:10,"Or, I saw a photo of it, I think."
00:26:10,00:26:12,And I think it was hanging on a chain.
00:26:12,00:26:13,Wow.
00:26:13,00:26:14,And they could climb on it.
00:26:14,00:26:15,I believe it.
00:26:15,00:26:16,I believe it.
00:26:16,00:26:17,Yeah.
00:26:17,00:26:18,On a nice lolly.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Imagine a magnum.
00:26:19,00:26:22,A big magnum swinging from a chain and then you can just climb it on it.
00:26:22,00:26:23,Very grippable.
00:26:23,00:26:25,A nice lolly. It's a solid block of ice.
00:26:25,00:26:27,I think I've just discovered my fetish.
00:26:27,00:26:32,I would love to see that Miley Cyrus video where she's swinging down the magnum.
00:26:32,00:26:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:34,00:26:37,And the highest temperature ever recorded in Scotland.
00:26:37,00:26:38,Was it here?
00:26:38,00:26:39,This year.
00:26:39,00:26:42,But it was declared invalid because the thermometer was next to a vehicle with its engine running.
00:26:42,00:26:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:44,00:26:52,And the coldest temperature ever outside of Antarctica was measured in Siberia.
00:26:52,00:26:56,But no one knows if that's right because the thermometer broke due to the cold.
00:26:56,00:26:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:57,00:27:00,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:27:00,00:27:06,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:27:06,00:27:07,That is my fact.
00:27:07,00:27:13,"My fact this week is that when financier William C. Rollston modestly refused to allow a town to be named after him,"
00:27:13,00:27:16,the town instead called itself Modesto.
00:27:16,00:27:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:17,00:27:18,Modesto or Modesto?
00:27:18,00:27:19,Modesto.
00:27:19,00:27:20,Modesto.
00:27:20,00:27:21,Modesto.
00:27:21,00:27:22,I will check on the internet.
00:27:22,00:27:23,Yeah.
00:27:23,00:27:25,Modesto.
00:27:25,00:27:26,Modesto.
00:27:26,00:27:27,Modesto.
00:27:27,00:27:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:28,00:27:30,Absolutely nailed it.
00:27:30,00:27:31,Really awful.
00:27:31,00:27:32,Yeah.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Modesto.
00:27:33,00:27:35,It sounds like a very demure magician.
00:27:35,00:27:36,It does.
00:27:36,00:27:37,The great Modesto.
00:27:37,00:27:38,"Well, I would say great."
00:27:38,00:27:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:39,00:27:43,That would be good.
00:27:43,00:27:50,"But yeah, so this fact was sent to me by @Shutter_Butter on Twitter."
00:27:50,00:27:51,It's an amazing fact.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"So thank you, Shutter_Butter."
00:27:54,00:27:58,And so Modesto is in California.
00:27:58,00:28:04,It is a town that has had a bit of fame via the fact that it's the birthplace of George Lucas.
00:28:04,00:28:07,"And back in the day, he made a very famous movie called American Graffiti."
00:28:07,00:28:09,It was a...
00:28:09,00:28:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:10,00:28:12,It was a massive movie at the time.
00:28:12,00:28:13,I was pre-star wars.
00:28:13,00:28:16,It sounds like that's what I was going to say.
00:28:16,00:28:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:18,00:28:21,But I think what you're going to say is that might have been based on this.
00:28:21,00:28:22,It was.
00:28:22,00:28:24,The American Graffiti took place in Modesto.
00:28:24,00:28:27,"It was filmed elsewhere, but that's where it took place."
00:28:27,00:28:29,"Interestingly, George Lucas is so modest."
00:28:29,00:28:32,He only introduces himself as the director of American Graffiti.
00:28:32,00:28:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:33,00:28:35,"Jeremy Renner, the actor."
00:28:35,00:28:36,Yeah.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"From Modesto, he was born there as well."
00:28:38,00:28:39,This is a significant town.
00:28:39,00:28:40,It is.
00:28:40,00:28:43,And can I just quickly slip in my favorite Jeremy Renner fact from the year?
00:28:43,00:28:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:44,00:28:46,"Just he was like, ""God, he was born there."
00:28:46,00:28:47,"I've been dying to get this fact out."""
00:28:47,00:28:49,He's starring in the new movie Tag.
00:28:49,00:28:50,"Oh, right."
00:28:50,00:28:55,"So in Tag, it's only most of Jeremy Renner that appears in the movie."
00:28:55,00:28:57,His arms don't appear in the movie.
00:28:57,00:29:00,And the reason is he broke them just as they were filming.
00:29:00,00:29:02,And so they were in casts.
00:29:02,00:29:04,And so they had to CGI in his arms.
00:29:04,00:29:07,"Yeah, so when you watch the movie Tag, which is predominantly about, I think,"
00:29:07,00:29:08,using your arms.
00:29:08,00:29:09,Using your own tag.
00:29:09,00:29:10,"Yeah, they're not his arms."
00:29:10,00:29:11,They're CGI arms.
00:29:11,00:29:14,You're saying he was running around with two broken arms in casts?
00:29:14,00:29:15,"Yeah, he was in cast."
00:29:15,00:29:17,Does that mean technically he's still it?
00:29:17,00:29:18,Because he has a tag.
00:29:18,00:29:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:19,00:29:21,It's also a really confusing conversation tabloid.
00:29:21,00:29:23,We're going to recast his arms because he's been broken.
00:29:23,00:29:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:24,00:29:26,Get the casting director in here.
00:29:26,00:29:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:29,00:29:30,Very good.
00:29:30,00:29:32,It's one of this town's naming thing.
00:29:32,00:29:33,Yeah.
00:29:33,00:29:35,It's a huge trope of how towns get their name.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"So there's a town in Tennessee, which is called Difficult."
00:29:38,00:29:44,"And it all happens when they write to the post office saying, can we have this particular name?"
00:29:44,00:29:47,"And supposedly when they applied for the name, which was a really complicated name,"
00:29:47,00:29:49,they wanted to name the town.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"The US Postal Service replied, your name is Difficult."
00:29:51,00:29:55,"And the people in the town thought, oh, they've just renamed our town Difficult."
00:29:55,00:29:57,I never believe any of these stories.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"There's one in California called ""Likely."""
00:29:59,00:30:03,And the legend is always that all the residents got together to sign the name for their new town.
00:30:03,00:30:05,Because there's some reason they were all living there in a town with no name.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"And then they were like, oh, we're never going to grow in a name."
00:30:07,00:30:09,"And a guy went, yeah, likely."
00:30:09,00:30:11,"And then they were like, great name."
00:30:11,00:30:13,And the same happened for town you bet.
00:30:13,00:30:14,"Apparently there's a guy who went, oh, you bet."
00:30:14,00:30:16,And that's why the town called you bet.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Diculous.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"I mean, all of this stuff is on the internet."
00:30:19,00:30:20,And then you get more original stories.
00:30:20,00:30:21,Yeah.
00:30:21,00:30:22,Ding dong Texas.
00:30:22,00:30:23,Do you know that?
00:30:23,00:30:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:24,00:30:25,Ding dong Texas.
00:30:25,00:30:29,We did somebody ring the bell just as they were.
00:30:29,00:30:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:31,00:30:35,"No, it was named after for Governor Peter Bell."
00:30:35,00:30:38,"And the businessman, Zulis Bell, and his nephew, Bert."
00:30:38,00:30:42,But Zulis and Bert were not in any way related to Peter.
00:30:42,00:30:45,"So yeah, it was called Ding dong as a reference."
00:30:45,00:30:49,"And weirdly, it's in Central Texas' Bell County."
00:30:49,00:30:50,"Oh, that's good."
00:30:50,00:30:51,"Oh, that's good."
00:30:51,00:30:53,I thought it might have been named after Leslie Phillips.
00:30:53,00:30:55,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:55,00:30:56,Ding dong.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Yeah.
00:30:57,00:30:59,Blast the purse.
00:30:59,00:31:02,"And there's only one place in Earth that I've found,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,which is called Earth.
00:31:04,00:31:05,OK.
00:31:05,00:31:06,It's in Texas.
00:31:06,00:31:07,That's good.
00:31:07,00:31:10,"And there are various reasons as to why, as always,"
00:31:10,00:31:13,somebody suggested it because they have a lot of Earth there.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"But there's a really good article about it online,"
00:31:15,00:31:18,which points out there are at least two other places in America
00:31:18,00:31:20,named after every single other planet.
00:31:20,00:31:23,There's Venus and Mercury and Jupiter.
00:31:23,00:31:25,There are Saturn's guess which planet.
00:31:25,00:31:27,There are not two places named after.
00:31:27,00:31:28,Mercury.
00:31:28,00:31:29,It's Uranus.
00:31:29,00:31:33,"There is one place, but it's more of a tourist attraction than the town."
00:31:33,00:31:37,"It's a little tourist attraction, which contains the Uranus Brewing Company,"
00:31:37,00:31:38,Combat Uranus.
00:31:38,00:31:41,There's a guy who calls himself the Mayor of Uranus.
00:31:41,00:31:44,"They sell Fudge, which has a label on it saying Uranus Fudge."
00:31:44,00:31:45,That's great.
00:31:45,00:31:49,"There's a place called Nitro, which is named after the Explosive Powder,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,which was made there in the First World War.
00:31:51,00:31:52,That's so cool.
00:31:52,00:31:53,That seems like a proper etymology.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"There's a place in Russia called Asbestos,"
00:31:55,00:31:56,where a friend of mine was born.
00:31:56,00:31:57,Wow.
00:31:57,00:32:00,And it's where they make all the Asbestos and send it to America.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Very cool.
00:32:01,00:32:04,"I don't know how well this is known in Britain,"
00:32:04,00:32:09,"but in the UK, there was a place that had its name changed."
00:32:09,00:32:10,Stains.
00:32:10,00:32:12,"Well, there's still a place called Stains."
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Well, technically not just Stains."
00:32:14,00:32:17,It's now called Stains upon Thames.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"It's not much better, is it?"
00:32:19,00:32:21,I remember this.
00:32:21,00:32:22,I remember when they tried to do this.
00:32:22,00:32:23,Yeah.
00:32:23,00:32:25,So the reason that they did this is because
00:32:25,00:32:28,AlleyG internationally had given Stains.
00:32:28,00:32:29,The Stains massive.
00:32:29,00:32:30,Exactly.
00:32:30,00:32:32,Such a bad name that they were always associated.
00:32:32,00:32:35,I remember watching AlleyG in Australia
00:32:35,00:32:37,"and thinking, oh, Stains must be..."
00:32:37,00:32:38,"I could see there was laughter,"
00:32:38,00:32:41,but you just associated it sort of as this place where...
00:32:41,00:32:42,Stains is quite nice.
00:32:42,00:32:43,Yes.
00:32:43,00:32:44,That's the guy.
00:32:44,00:32:45,That's the guy.
00:32:45,00:32:46,Yeah.
00:32:46,00:32:49,"So they wanted to change it, but they didn't really change it."
00:32:49,00:32:51,They just added an extra belt on the end.
00:32:51,00:32:52,"Yeah, exactly."
00:32:52,00:32:54,"So on the 15th of December, 2011,"
00:32:54,00:32:59,the Spellthorn borough council resolved by 25 votes to four
00:32:59,00:33:02,to change the name of the town to Stains upon Thames
00:33:02,00:33:04,to try and boost the local economy
00:33:04,00:33:06,by promoting its Riverside location.
00:33:06,00:33:09,I'm quoting directly from the Wikipedia article
00:33:09,00:33:11,that I found this on.
00:33:11,00:33:14,I wonder if there's a calculation for how much adding upon Thames
00:33:14,00:33:16,adds to a town's net worth as it were.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"As in, Richmond upon Thames is quite sort of..."
00:33:19,00:33:20,Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:21,Or upon any river.
00:33:21,00:33:22,"I do sort of like Stains with waitros,"
00:33:22,00:33:24,and that would probably help because...
00:33:24,00:33:25,"Yes, Stains upon the waitros."
00:33:25,00:33:26,Yeah.
00:33:26,00:33:27,Yeah.
00:33:27,00:33:28,And...
00:33:28,00:33:30,"My uncle, when he was a counsellor in Bolton,"
00:33:30,00:33:33,tried to change the name of Bolton to Bolton Lemours.
00:33:33,00:33:34,Did you think?
00:33:34,00:33:37,"Yeah, because there are lots of other places called Bolton in the world"
00:33:37,00:33:40,and he thought it would distinguish our town from the other ones
00:33:40,00:33:42,and also we're on the Moors as in...
00:33:42,00:33:44,That's where all the fires were from.
00:33:44,00:33:46,Funny he was trying to bolt home an extra bit to the name.
00:33:46,00:33:47,Very good.
00:33:47,00:33:49,Was he successful?
00:33:49,00:33:51,"No, it's still called Bolton."
00:33:51,00:33:54,Surely Bolton is the most famous Bolton...
00:33:54,00:33:56,"I don't mean any disrespect to other Bolton's in the world,"
00:33:56,00:33:57,but...
00:33:57,00:33:59,I am Michael.
00:33:59,00:34:02,Famously people are always getting confused with the town.
00:34:02,00:34:05,And Mr. Eggton mailed from the entire town
00:34:05,00:34:07,to his house every day.
00:34:07,00:34:09,There's a city...
00:34:09,00:34:10,Topeka?
00:34:10,00:34:12,"Topeka, so it's in Kansas."
00:34:12,00:34:14,And it's the capital of the state.
00:34:14,00:34:16,It's no one...
00:34:16,00:34:17,It's no slouch.
00:34:17,00:34:18,It's no slouch.
00:34:18,00:34:20,It's no slouch.
00:34:20,00:34:24,But it changed its name to Google for a month.
00:34:24,00:34:25,Did it?
00:34:25,00:34:26,Legally and officially...
00:34:26,00:34:27,It's a peek at it.
00:34:27,00:34:28,Yeah.
00:34:28,00:34:30,And it was to win a Google high speed internet project
00:34:30,00:34:33,which would have given everyone internet 100 times faster than the national average.
00:34:33,00:34:34,At the time.
00:34:34,00:34:36,No one would ever be able to search for them online.
00:34:36,00:34:39,They would break the internet if you Google Google.
00:34:39,00:34:41,"Well, it didn't work."
00:34:41,00:34:44,"The Google went with Kansas City, Kansas instead."
00:34:44,00:34:46,"But the mayor, he said, he didn't really mind not winning."
00:34:46,00:34:48,"And he said, I've often wondered what difference does it make."
00:34:48,00:34:51,"If it takes you 10 seconds or one second to access information,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,my life goes a little slower than that.
00:34:53,00:34:54,Oh.
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Yeah, it's a very laid back guy."
00:34:55,00:34:57,But there's not the first time they've changed the name.
00:34:57,00:34:59,"In 1998, Topeka changed its name."
00:34:59,00:35:01,And one of you will really like this fact.
00:35:01,00:35:02,They've changed it to...
00:35:02,00:35:03,Topeka Chu.
00:35:03,00:35:07,He's a Pokemon arrived in the USA.
00:35:07,00:35:08,Yeah.
00:35:08,00:35:10,On Modesto.
00:35:10,00:35:11,Yeah.
00:35:11,00:35:15,It's the second unhappiest city in the United States of America.
00:35:15,00:35:16,What?
00:35:16,00:35:17,Yeah.
00:35:17,00:35:18,Wow.
00:35:18,00:35:22,The city's motto is water wealth contentment health.
00:35:22,00:35:26,"And that was selected in a contest in 1911,"
00:35:26,00:35:28,where the winner won three dollars as a prize.
00:35:28,00:35:29,Oh.
00:35:29,00:35:30,Yeah.
00:35:30,00:35:34,"And just to say, Ralston wasn't just this local banker."
00:35:34,00:35:36,All the men who the town was not named after.
00:35:36,00:35:37,Exactly.
00:35:37,00:35:39,Ralston was...
00:35:39,00:35:42,"He was one of the most rich people in California, actually."
00:35:42,00:35:45,And he founded the Bank of California.
00:35:45,00:35:47,So he was a very important guy in his day.
00:35:47,00:35:49,"Well, he didn't like to talk about it."
00:35:49,00:35:52,I really had to dig deep to find that.
00:35:52,00:35:55,There's a town in California called Secret Town.
00:35:55,00:35:56,Is that...
00:35:56,00:35:57,"And why is it called that, do we know?"
00:35:57,00:35:58,I can't tell you that.
00:35:58,00:36:01,I genuinely know nothing about it.
00:36:01,00:36:03,There's nothing in the Wikipedia page.
00:36:03,00:36:06,That's too long we can feed the page off.
00:36:06,00:36:07,That's it.
00:36:07,00:36:12,"Okay, that's it."
00:36:12,00:36:13,That is all of our facts.
00:36:13,00:36:14,Thank you so much for listening.

00:36:47,00:36:52,We also have our great documentary series that we put up on iTunes called Behind the Gills.
00:36:52,00:36:53,It's on a few other platforms.
00:36:53,00:36:54,There'll be a link there.
00:36:54,00:36:57,Follows us around on our last tour of the UK.
00:36:57,00:36:58,"You should get it in America, can't you?"
00:36:58,00:37:00,"Yeah, it's in America now as well, which is very exciting."
00:37:00,00:37:03,"If you're in Modesto, you can probably download it."
00:37:03,00:37:04,No.
00:37:04,00:37:06,We'll be back again next week.
00:37:06,00:37:07,We'll see you then.
