00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.860
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.040
 My name is Dad Shriver and I'm sitting here with Adju Huttamari, James Harkin and Alex

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.400
 Bell and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.240
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go starting with you, Alex.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.540
 My fact this week is that the Swiss flush about $2 million worth of gold down the toilet

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.540
 every year.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.500
 Are they hiding it because it's Nazi gold and they're embarrassed about the fact they

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 have it?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 And time to mention the Nazis, like three seconds.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.420
 No, this is, it's lots and lots of little tiny, tiny gold particles.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.200
 It's a waste result of the manufacturing process of watches that they think.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.380
 They're not entirely sure where it comes from.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.100
 All they know is that they've been analysing the content of sewage and it's got a really

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.900
 weirdly high percentage of gold in it.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 Can they collect it?

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.820
 They're trying to come up with a way of getting it that's cost-effective but at the moment

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.260
 it's too expensive.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.100
 How crazy that it's costing too much to get $1.8 million worth of gold.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.900
 Yeah, except when you think it's tiny, tiny particles in the water so it's like panning

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 for gold.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.740
 Can you go panning for gold there?

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.340
 I think they're way too small, it's not like panning for gold in like old times where you

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.180
 had a little nugget so you had the choice.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.580
 If you have the choice of panning for gold in a nice river in Scotland or maybe in a load

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.980
 of sewage in Switzerland, I know which one I choose.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.900
 Yeah, but one definitely has gold at it.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.500
 One's got $1.8 million worth of gold.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.060
 There's gold in member mountains in Scotland.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 Is it?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 Did you not see that?

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.060
 That was in the news about two weeks ago.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.180
 Maybe a week ago where they found the largest gold nugget ever in Britain, I think.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.940
 Oh, the guy who was sitting in the river.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.740
 I think what he does is he lies down, face down in the water and he just kind of looks for

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.740
 it.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.300
 Like doesn't do that panning thing or whatever.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.740
 He just kind of lies there and waits and just tries to see it.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.860
 That's nice because it's like fishing but without the fish.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.700
 You are the fish in a way, you're in the water.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.900
 In a way.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.900
 What's it, do we know?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.140
 Are you allowed to keep it if you find a big gold nugget in a river?

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.140
 I can't remember.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.780
 I think what happens is the crown of states can claim it.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.780
 Oh.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.780
 So Queen's allowed to eat it.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.700
 Is it, if you find it on crown of state land or is it just the Queen of?

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.700
 No.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.700
 I think Queen knows everything actually.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.860
 Oh, man.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.700
 If you find it downstairs in the, you know, let's say you're rooting

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.940
 around in the toilets of the QI office and there's no reason to say that.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940
 And I don't know why you would look at me when you're saying that.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.620
 Well, I would just say like we've already decided that that's a good place to find gold.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.620
 There's no rivers around here.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.620
 Right.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.220
 But if you did find some gold then technically I think you'd have to offer it to the Queen.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.220
 Really?

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.220
 I think so.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.540
 I think the same goes for like bottle tops if you find them in a metal head.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.540
 She's just less interested.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.820
 It's a crown made of bottle tops, isn't it?

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.220
 It's all of these rooms at Buckingham Palace.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.220
 They're just full of old bottle tops.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.420
 Do you know there's loads of gold in British sewers as well?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.660
 But it's not from, because we don't have a luxury watch industry the same way that the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.580
 Swiss do, it's about seven parts per million which would make it economically feasible as

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.580
 a gold mine.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.620
 As in, in a gold mine you get less than that.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.980
 But the way you get, it gets into the water in Britain is from people doing the washing

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.140
 up while wearing wedding rings.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.300
 So tiny bits of gold was a, and also get this.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.940
 If you brush your teeth and you've got a gold tooth, tiny bits of gold will come off and

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.940
 make the way into the water.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.540
 How often would I have to do the washing up before my wedding ring completely disappeared

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.540
 from my hand?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.020
 It sounds like you're really hoping to get out of something by doing the washing up.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.260
 I can say to my wife, I can't do the washing up because that marriage will be an old one.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.180
 You've probably several hundred years of a phrase.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.180
 Okay.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.220
 It's a bit divorce and sounds like a loss of the wedding ring would happen much to you as

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.220
 well.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.540
 We've got in our upcoming book, we've got an article on the Fatberg that was displayed

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.540
 in the London Museum this year.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.540
 What is that book then?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.620
 It's going to be called the Book of the Year 2018.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.620
 Okay.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.620
 And where is it going to be available?

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.860
 You know, places like Waterstones and online retailers that Andy doesn't allow us to say

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.860
 anymore.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.860
 And I do.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.860
 It's going to be on Amazon.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 I know you can't say that.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.860
 Sorry, you were saying?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.860
 Yeah.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.900
 So the Fatberg for anyone that doesn't know is just a giant lump of fat that they find

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.460
 in the sewers, mainly of London, but they've been found worldwide.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.020
 And yeah, they're ginormous.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.500
 It takes some days and days, in some cases, weeks to absolutely knock them apart.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.660
 They have to use pneumatic drills to get them down.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.820
 And it was made up 90% of cooking fat that we put down our drains.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.900
 The others are wet wipes, which is all down to, it turns out, Colonel Sanders and KFC.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.380
 KFC, effectively, with the first people to let the wet wipe out into the public.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.500
 The man, the man who invented the wet wipe sold it to KFC.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.580
 So KFC, we're the original wet wipe people.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.180
 But now they're mostly used by parents and stuff, right?

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.180
 Exactly.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.180
 For children's mums.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.180
 Yeah.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.180
 They weren't used to wipe the chickens, were they?

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.260
 But yeah, what's interesting as well is that they found a higher concentration of banned

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.060
 gym supplements in the Fatberg than they did, say, cocaine or MDMA.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.700
 What like steroids and things?

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.700
 Yeah, exactly.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.740
 So the Fatberg might become muscle burn.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.980
 That's a German city I want to go to sometime.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.860
 All German cities and muscle burn.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.860
 Yeah.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.180
 Very well developed people.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.140
 So I found a crime from this year where thieves used sewage to steal gold.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.140
 This is clever.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.420
 So it's in Western Australia, where there are lots of gold mines.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.300
 And what they did is they stole a sewage truck, and you remember sewage trucks, they have

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.620
 those big hoses and nozzles, but they can suck up sewage with.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.180
 And they stuck that into a gold mine site's big pit of gold-rich liquid, and they suck

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.180
 that all up.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.180
 Interesting.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.980
 And I didn't know they would have like gold-rich liquid.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.380
 I don't know how the mining process works.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.580
 I guess maybe if they're blasting out of the liquid, they sort of had this gold-y soup

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.580
 which they could then refine.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.140
 And if you're going to leave that lying around in a big, fat-labeled gold-rich liquid.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.620
 You're all skinned to be robbed, really, aren't you? That's like putting it in a sort of bag with a dollar sign on it.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.620
 It's very impressive though, to steal a sewage truck, to think of that, because I would have just gone along with a Henry Hoover and tried to take a little bit.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.740
 I think that would be the great escape level way of doing it, going in as a keener every day and just like getting a little bit in your Hoover.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.740
 Yeah.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:51.060
 The largest nugget of gold ever found was called "Welcome Stranger", okay.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.420
 And I say was, because as soon as it was found, it was melted down into gold fingers.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.940
 The second largest was called "Welcome", "Only Welcome".

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.020
 And that was also melted down into sovereigns.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.420
 But the good thing about that is it was found by one guy with a pickaxe who carried on mining after his fellow miners had gone to lunch.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.180
 So they all went away and he thought, "I'm going to carry on mining."

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.540
 And as soon as he saw the nugget, he fainted.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.380
 And then when the guys came back from lunch, they saw he was kind of faced down in the middle of the hole and they thought he was dead.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.380
 And so they climbed down to try and save him and they saw the nugget and they fainted as well.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:30.740
 So it turns out the way to find nuggets of gold is just to lay face down.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.740
 That's true.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.900
 Why were they called "Welcome and Welcome Stranger", that's quite weird names for nuggets.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.660
 Well, that's a really good question.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.980
 I don't know why they're called that.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:44.740
 I suppose what you might say, if you found a nugget, you might, "Oh, welcome Stranger."

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.980
 That's a bit.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.060
 That's a oddly predatory way of discovering something.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:56.140
 So the third largest is the largest extent nugget. It's called the Hand of Faith and it's on display in Las Vegas.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.780
 Do you know what the Netherlands are doing with their old toilet paper, with their old toilet paper?

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.940
 Yeah, use toilet paper.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.820
 They're making it into windmills.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.820
 Shitty windmills.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.540
 Oh, I wish it was that.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.300
 No, well, they're turning it into bike lanes.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.580
 So it is a similarly green, it was a similarly kind of stereotypical dutch thing.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.820
 Are they, do they collect their paper on the side and not flush it down, is that way?

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.140
 I don't know how it's collected, actually, that's a really good point.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.860
 It must be that it's flushed down and then sort of scooped out.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.700
 I think it's scooped out.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.100
 Because what they do, once they've got it, I don't know how they get it, but they extract the cellulose from it.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.100
 So it's tree pulp and stuff, which has a lot of cellulose, which is this tough fiber.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.900
 Then they sterilize it, obviously.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.660
 And then they turn it into big pellets, which they can turn into asphalt.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:46.340
 But also, bike lanes are usually colored brown, aren't they, to make them look different to the rest of the road.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:46.860
 Right.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.660
 So they probably don't have to use any coloring.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.460
 Yeah, a lot of skid marks as well.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.620
 And then the breaking of the bikes, guys, watch out for pooled desertions.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.060
 Oh, yeah, me.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:02.500
 I'm almost certain that they are, they must be flushing them when they're clashing the sewers.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.900
 Because it's not like they'd be saying, "Please, everyone put aside your used toilet paper, we'll come and get it."

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.100
 No, that does happen, dude.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.100
 That does happen, Alex.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.900
 That does happen.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.740
 Yes, it does.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.700
 Nothing that depends on people, like, no, no, no, no.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.860
 It happens in Greece.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.420
 Yeah, it happens in Greece, really?

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.260
 Yeah, I film.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.860
 I don't remember that song.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.860
 (Laughter)

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:27.860
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.620
 My factor is that Robert Burns made his own ink out of Old Beer,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.660
 Lard, Elephant Tusk, and Sulfuric Acid.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.660
 Wow.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.660
 Yeah.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.660
 It's very cool.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.660
 What a man.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.660
 I read the source that you sent for this, and it noted that these were all things that were readily available in Scotland at the time.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.660
 (Laughter)

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.660
 Yeah, I mean, Old Beer and Lard, obviously.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.660
 But where did they get Elephant Tusk in Scotland?

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.660
 Library, I reckon.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.660
 Big ivory trade.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.660
 Sure.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.660
 Yeah.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.660
 I mean, that's, I just said another word for the thing.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.660
 (Laughter)

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.660
 Capitalism, I guess.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.660
 (Laughter)

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.660
 Yeah, so I didn't know this, but writers basically had to make their own ink for centuries.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.660
 You couldn't just go down to the ink shop and buy some ink.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:11.660
 So there were all these recipes around, and the researchers from the University of Glasgow have analysed.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.660
 It's really cool.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:18.660
 They took original burns poems, and they lifted ink away in a way that didn't damage the original poems.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.660
 Wow.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.660
 Because obviously they're original manuscripts.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.660
 That's amazing.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.660
 I wonder how they do that.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.660
 I don't know.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.660
 I wish I did.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.660
 Because you wouldn't want to accidentally lift off a whole word.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.660
 No.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.660
 (Laughter)

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.660
 And you forget what it is.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.660
 (Laughter)

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:37.660
 And the really cool thing is they've found different recipes from different stages of his life.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:45.660
 When he was a young and poor, he used a particular kind of iron gul ink, and then as he got richer, he used this thing called ivory black,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.660
 which involved treacle, and lard, and acid, and vinegar, and ivory.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.660
 And it's a way of telling the real poems from forgeries.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.660
 Yeah, which is amazing, isn't it?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.660
 They're starting to apply this now to all ancient manuscripts.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.660
 Because if they see the recipe someone uses, and then someone else claims to have an original,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:08.660
 and it turns out it's made from, I don't know, mull and butter and sausages.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.660
 So he mull as in the animal.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.660
 Yeah, the animal.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.660
 No, mulls, human mulls.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.660
 (Laughter)

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.660
 That's her in sausages.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.660
 Yeah.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.660
 Robert Burns used to have some really cool nicknames.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.660
 He used to refer to himself as spunky.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.660
 Yeah.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.660
 He used to call himself the rant and roven robin.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.660
 That was one of his personal favourites apparently.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.660
 But he never called himself rabbi or roby, which is what?

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.660
 What?

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.660
 Rabbi Burns or Robby Burns is what many people in the UK would associate as his nickname,

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.660
 that we've given him.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.660
 Yeah, never called himself that.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.660
 But he's calling himself these.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.660
 He's already nicknames.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.660
 Yeah, they're not really nicknames if you call them yourself.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.660
 No one else is calling him spunky.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.660
 I don't think that counts as a nickname.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.660
 Yeah, that's more like an online avatar.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.660
 (Laughter)

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.660
 Just Twitter handle at rant and roven robin.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.660
 (Laughter)

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.660
 Oh, he would have been great on Twitter.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.660
 Really funny, I think.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.660
 Really, actually just for tweeting, really tedious things about making your own ink.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.660
 Yeah, these recipes are really weird.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.660
 So there are lots of recipes that used to exist.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.660
 Oh, do you know about a gall ink?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.660
 Ah, no.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.660
 Asterix?

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.660
 A gall?

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.660
 Ah, sorry, G-A.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.660
 A gall as in gall bladder, I guess.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.660
 Yes.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.660
 But not as in gall bladder.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.660
 Gall wasps.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.660
 Exactly.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.660
 Yeah, so there are hundreds of species of wasps called gall wasps.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:29.660
 And what they do is they land on an oak tree and they lay their eggs inside the leaf buds.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.660
 And then that turns into this weird kind of tumor or lump on the tree.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.660
 And the little grub grows inside and it's all protected from the outside.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.660
 But those galls can be ground up and they're a massive ingredient for ink.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.660
 And they work for hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.660
 There's only one kind of oak gall which makes the ink.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.660
 And it's basically the most important wasp in history.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:54.660
 And so all of, you know, Mozart, Darwin, Magna Carta, Bayo of all of that was written in oak gall ink.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.660
 Wow.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.660
 It was for centuries and centuries it was the ink to use.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.660
 So you could say that these wasps are responsible for all those great works, can't you really?

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.660
 I think you can.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.660
 Yeah.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.660
 Wow.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.660
 I mean, also the trees that you made the paper from and you know, the tables.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.660
 It's a group effort.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.660
 It's a laboratory.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.660
 It's just logic is flawed.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.660
 You know, well done wasps.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.660
 Yeah.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.660
 It's not going to be like a hidden figures movie.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.660
 Sorry.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.660
 I'm a recognized asset.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.660
 So what do we make it out of these days?

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.660
 I don't actually know much about.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.660
 I don't know actually.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.660
 I think it involves carbon, but I haven't looked it up properly.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.660
 Is it not made out of moles and sausages?

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.660
 A butter, I think.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.660
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.660
 I don't know.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.660
 It's probably made out of some kind of synthetic resin stuff.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.660
 Yeah.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.660
 Let's go with that.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.660
 Yeah.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.660
 Cool.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.660
 Capitalism.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.660
 Did you know that the Secret Service has an international ink library?

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.660
 No.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:00.660
 And they keep more than 11,000 specimens of ink and it's for identifying mystery inks when they get,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.660
 you know, like a poison pen battery or something like that.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.660
 They've got ink stating all.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.660
 So it was set up in a suit.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.660
 What does that do for them?

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.660
 Or they can find out like when or where it was made and like tons of it.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.660
 They're looking for the author of the bail wolf.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.660
 Bring in the wasp.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:24.660
 But yeah, they've got ink stating back always in 1920s.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.660
 And it's pretty cool.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.660
 So blood's used often in place of ink.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.660
 I was just looking into different types of methods of...

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.660
 Where?

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.660
 Where?

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.660
 So did a sadam Hussein have a caran in his eye?

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.660
 Yeah.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.660
 This is what I was going to say.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.660
 No, no, but it's extraordinary.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.660
 I've not heard of this.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:48.660
 So Sadam Hussein post a assassination attempt on his son, became a devout Muslim.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.660
 And so I read this in Atlas Obscura.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:58.660
 He gave on his, after his 60th birthday, 27 liters of his own blood to a polygonal form.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.660
 So he must have needed a big biscuit after that.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:09.660
 So he gave it to this calligrapher who spent two years putting together a 600 page blood.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:17.660
 Sadam Hussein blood-inked caran, which is now locked in a vault in a mosque in Baghdad.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.660
 But it sits there.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.660
 It's just bizarre.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.660
 Yeah.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.660
 I mean, there's much more blood than you would need to make a new Sadam Hussein there.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.660
 You need more than blood to make a personan.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.660
 That's true.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.660
 Yeah.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.660
 No.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.660
 I'm just saying if someone else finds other ingredients.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.660
 I don't know.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.660
 I've watched Jurassic Park and I'm pretty sure they only had some blood.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.660
 That's very true, actually.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.660
 But then the problem is that the dance was turned female.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.660
 So at some point Sadam Hussein might turn into a girl and start reproducing on the island.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.660
 Yeah.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.660
 But I'll see.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.660
 We're keeping him on.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.660
 All right.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.660
 I don't want to go to the theme park also in the film to be honest.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.660
 I think it's a more sensible pitch than the New Jurassic World movie.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.660
 Okay.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:59.660
 Okay.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.660
 It is time for fact number three.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.660
 And that is James.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:09.660
 Okay, my fact this week is that Sweden's highest point is now its second highest after the top of it melted.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.660
 Oh no.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.660
 Poor, poor highest point.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.660
 Oh, good for the second highest point.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.660
 Yeah, that's true.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.660
 Finally, that bastard's got what's coming to it.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.660
 So is the second highest one not covered in ice?

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.660
 So you're right.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.660
 Exactly right.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.660
 So they're basically the same part.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.660
 They're the same mountain.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.660
 But they're two different peaks on the same mountain.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.660
 And the highest point in Sweden has a glacier on top of it.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:37.660
 But due to the recent heat wave, the glacier has melted and now the second highest point is the highest.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.660
 But in the winter they expect them to swap places again.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.660
 Yeah.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:46.660
 So it must be really confusing for any sort of textbooks that they're going to publish between now and winter.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.660
 Because they don't know.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.660
 They can't confirm that it's definitely going to get cold enough.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.660
 The real victims.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.660
 This is, I'll probably pronounce this wrong.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.660
 But it's something like Kepp and the Kaiser mountain, which is in the north of Sweden.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.660
 Oh man.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.660
 So it's not a good news story in some ways.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.660
 Well, I didn't put it forward as a good news story.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.660
 No, no, no.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.660
 No, you didn't.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.660
 I think it's just a thing that happened.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:15.660
 And I think it's interesting that a country can have two peaks that are the highest of different parts.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.660
 Yeah.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.660
 And there are even worse things about it actually.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:24.660
 Because let's say you're Swedish or let's say you're any nationality, but you want to climb the highest point in Sweden.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:30.660
 You've always been able to climb this kind of point, which is a north peak of Kepp and Kaiser.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.660
 And now you need to climb the other one.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.660
 And actually it's a much more difficult climb.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:41.660
 So for a safety aspect, they think a lot more people might get injured or killed because they're trying to climb this really difficult peak.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.660
 Whereas before they could do the relatively easy one.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.660
 Can you wait until, I guess you can wait until winter.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.660
 I know it's bad climbing mountains and winter, isn't it?

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.660
 It's easier in spring and summer.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.660
 Yeah, although it's snowy at the top anyway of the old one.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.660
 How much is it mounted by to make it a match of center?

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.660
 Because you could just take like a calippo up if you really want the other one to be able to just stick it in the snow.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.660
 I don't think you're allowed to make your own highest point.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.660
 Well, that did happen.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.660
 That's that movie.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.660
 I think we might have mentioned it before.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.660
 The man who went up the hill and came down the mountain, which was a true story of the game.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.660
 Wales, who they said that to be amounted, it had to be a certain height.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.660
 So we added a little bit on top of it to make it higher.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.660
 But I think he did that with grounds rather than calipos.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.660
 I didn't actually, I thought that movie was going to be something sort of some tedious emotional journey.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.660
 And that was a metaphor.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.660
 I didn't realize that was literally the story.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.660
 I think it might also be a tedious emotional journey.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.660
 Yeah, it was.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.660
 Okay, so get this.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.660
 The lowest highest point.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.660
 No, hang on, sorry.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.660
 There we go.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.660
 No, down it.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.660
 The highest lowest point in the world in any country.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.660
 Oh, okay.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.660
 So is it, can I guess?

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.660
 Yeah.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.660
 I think is it in Swaziland?

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.660
 Oh, you're so close.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.660
 It's down there somewhere.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.660
 It's the other one.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.660
 Lesutu.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.660
 It's the other small country within South Africa.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.660
 It's Lesutu, the enclave country, which is completely surrounded by South Africa.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.660
 Okay.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.660
 What is it?

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.660
 Is it like a cave or is it supposed to be above ground?

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.660
 Yeah, it's just the lowest.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.660
 So all of Lesutu is well over 1,000 metres above sea level.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.660
 So the lowest point in Lesutu is 1,400 metres above sea level.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.660
 And everything else is even higher than that.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.660
 So in any countries that are entirely below that point.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.660
 Oh, well, two value.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.660
 Two value.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.660
 Yeah, all of those places that are going to get two value in the Maldives.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.660
 Yeah.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.660
 So the lowest high point, as opposed to the highest low point.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.660
 The lowest high point.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.660
 Yeah.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.660
 Is in the Maldives, which is 2.4 metres above sea level.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.660
 Yeah.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.660
 So Maldives, obviously, lots of islands.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.660
 And 99% of the Maldives territory is open ocean.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.660
 But there was this island called Villingale, which had an 8-foot rise on it,

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.660
 which was the highest point.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.660
 However, in 2013, a golf course opened on that island,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.660
 and it has a small mound on it, which was 16 feet above sea level.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.660
 And the fifth hole teeing off point is the highest point now in the Maldives.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.660
 Oh, good.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.660
 And it's in a resort, and they do a daily tour.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.660
 And all guests who complete the ascend get a certificate.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.660
 Wow.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.660
 That's hilarious.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.660
 That's be annoying, though, if you're playing golf and you've got a whole sort of expedition

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.660
 trying to mount a hole.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.660
 There's a flag there.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.660
 Someone's got here.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.660
 I've got a Swedish Mountains fact.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.660
 There is a massive bunker inside--

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.660
 Is this another golf fact?

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.660
 No.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.660
 So there's a sort of massive underground bunker inside the Swedish mountains.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.660
 And it was built as sort of government protection facility for, you know,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.660
 nuclear events and stuff.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.660
 And it's no longer used to that.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.660
 And it was sold to a private data center, so they keep servers in there now.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.660
 And one of the things that's kept inside of the servers is WikiLeaks.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.660
 Huh?

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.660
 A sunch?

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.660
 Yeah, actually, yeah.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.660
 The digital version of a sunch is kept in--

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.660
 It's kept in prison, in underground.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.660
 And you look at pictures.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.660
 It does actually look like an evil villain's layer.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.660
 It's crazy.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.660
 But it's inside a mountain.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.660
 It's made of glass.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:03.660
 Wow.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.660
 It's cool.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.660
 That's where WikiLeaks is, guys.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.660
 It's inside a Swedish mountain.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.660
 Wow.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.660
 That is very cool.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.660
 The highest point in the Netherlands is 4,000 miles from Amsterdam.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.660
 What?

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.660
 Yeah.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.660
 So there's the Caribbean Netherlands, which is a different hillies.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.660
 Yeah, I think it was called the Dutch Antilles, and then recently they had a weird admin change.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.660
 But there's an island called Saba, and it has a mount on it called Mount Scenery.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.660
 It's about three or four times higher than anywhere in the Netherlands.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.660
 That's true, actually.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:36.660
 If the highest point of Britain, I think, if we count everything that we claim is in the Antarctic--

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.660
 Oh, that's good.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.660
 --because we claim a little bit of the Antarctic, which has a massive mountain on it.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.660
 Nice.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.660
 And the highest point in Australia is not, what does it say--

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.660
 Cozy Oscar.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:50.660
 Yeah, it's actually an island off the coast of Australia, which has got a massive peak on it.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.660
 And the highest point in Spain is in the Canary Islands, Mount Tiede.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.660
 So loads of countries, the highest point, isn't really in that country at all.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.660
 Wow.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.660
 Who owns the moon?

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.660
 I know.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.660
 I'm singing the moon.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.660
 What is the highest?

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.660
 With the highest--

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.660
 No one owns the moon.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.660
 No, but there's the flag.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.660
 That's not true.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.660
 So I've got a certificate.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.660
 The highest point of Andy's house is actually on the moon.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.660
 I have a thing or two about the big heat wave that we've been going through.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.660
 So this is quite tied in, your fact, to the fact that globally there's been a heat wave.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:31.660
 And Ireland, very recently, through the heat wave and through the drought,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:37.660
 has had exposed a sort of huge stone that says "ire."

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.660
 So E-I-R-E.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.660
 Sorry, I always pronounce that error, but I don't know how to pronounce it.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.660
 Yeah, would you say error?

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:44.660
 Don't look at me.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.660
 Would you say it?

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.660
 I don't know.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.660
 I'd say it is an error to say it.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.660
 What?

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.660
 I think it is error.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.660
 Error, so I'll just say that.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.660
 Yeah.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.660
 So it's exposed.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:00.660
 This giant stone error, E-I-R-E, and it's along the Irish coast.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:07.660
 And what it was is during the Second World War, they built this to show the enemies that were flying over

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.660
 thinking that they were going to bomb, let's say, England.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.660
 Don't bomb us.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.660
 This is Ireland.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.660
 This is neutral grounds.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.660
 Wasn't it to differentiate Ireland from Northern Ireland?

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.660
 Oh, OK.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.660
 Was it Northern Ireland?

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.660
 Well, I'm just guessing, but I would have thought that pilots wouldn't know whether they were over Ireland or--

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.660
 Why could be foggy, you know?

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.660
 If you were.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.660
 Yeah.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.660
 Second World War, they actually have.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.660
 It's just assuming everyone in the war was an idiot.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.660
 It sounds like someone who's used the excuse to fog for making some pretty egregious errors in your life.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.660
 I don't mean to be in her house.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.660
 I don't know.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.660
 I didn't know.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.660
 I was 50 miles away.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.660
 I was foggy.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.660
 What could I say?

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.660
 Sorry, just to backtrack a tiny bit.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:52.660
 There were huge fires as a result of this heat wave, and the fires knocked out all of the grass and the trees and so on, and it's exposed.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.660
 This giant air, E-I-R-E, to mean Ireland.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.660
 I've found it on the internet, so let's see how they pronounce it.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.660
 Air or air?

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.660
 Brilliant.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:04.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.660
 Since that porn hub that you've not watched.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.660
 I have a fact about Sweden, which I definitely know how to pronounce.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.660
 So, in lots of Swedish mountains, there have been no worms since the ice age.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.660
 They were all wiped out.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.660
 It's true.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.660
 Yeah, great.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.660
 I mean, bad for the worms.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.660
 It's bad for the worms, but they've got other places to live, so it's fine.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.660
 And bad for the soil in the mountains?

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.660
 This is the thing.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.660
 So, they change the vegetation, and they have very negative effects on particular trees.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.660
 I think even effect deer at life cycles.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.660
 I can't remember how.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:44.660
 So, the thing is that they are definitely invasive, because world populations apparently are only capable of moving five to ten meters a year.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.660
 So, for them to make their way all the way through northern Europe into the Swedish mountains, they wouldn't have done it for thousands of doubt.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.660
 It's not much of an invasion.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.660
 It's not life for Germans going into Russia, is it?

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.660
 No.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.660
 So, this is how we know that they're invasive.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.660
 And they're impossible to get rid of if they establish themselves.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.660
 So, this could completely change the European landscape over the next few hundred years.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660
 Yeah.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:11.660
 Do you know that, due to the heat wave, bears in Dundee in the zoo.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.660
 I've got an 80 kilo ice lolly to keep them cool.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.660
 Wow.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.660
 What's it made of?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.660
 Ice.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.660
 Oh, nice.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.660
 And fruit.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.660
 Oh, lovely.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.660
 That's very nice.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.660
 That does sound good.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.660
 It sounds like one of those decoy healthy lollies.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.660
 Yeah, like when the ice cream man used to come, and we weren't allowed to go,

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.660
 and my mom would instead freeze some orange juice to have that healthy thing.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.660
 Yeah.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.660
 Would she then cut the carton open, as in, how would you get at the orange juice?

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.660
 Did you pour it into a glass?

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.660
 You do it in ice cube trays, right?

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.660
 No. So, we had special ice lolly trays that like ice cube trays,

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.660
 but shaped like ice lollies.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.660
 I remember those. So, you pour the, yeah, into the moulds.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.660
 Yeah. That is a better method.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.660
 And it was freezing the ice cube.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.660
 The orange could just cast a bit.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.660
 And then hacking it open.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.660
 Entire liter of ice orange juice.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.660
 What you do is you jab a pool cue into the orange juice cast and freeze that.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.660
 And did the bears get, like, get it on sticks?

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.660
 Or, I saw a photo of it, I think.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.660
 And I think it was hanging on a chain.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.660
 Wow.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.660
 And they could climb on it.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.660
 I believe it.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.660
 I believe it.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.660
 Yeah.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.660
 On a nice lolly.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.660
 Imagine a magnum.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.660
 A big magnum swinging from a chain and then you can just climb it on it.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.660
 Very grippable.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.660
 A nice lolly. It's a solid block of ice.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.660
 I think I've just discovered my fetish.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.660
 I would love to see that Miley Cyrus video where she's swinging down the magnum.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.660
 And the highest temperature ever recorded in Scotland.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.660
 Was it here?

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.660
 This year.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.660
 But it was declared invalid because the thermometer was next to a vehicle with its engine running.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:52.660
 And the coldest temperature ever outside of Antarctica was measured in Siberia.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.660
 But no one knows if that's right because the thermometer broke due to the cold.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.660
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:06.660
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.660
 That is my fact.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:13.660
 My fact this week is that when financier William C. Rollston modestly refused to allow a town to be named after him,

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.660
 the town instead called itself Modesto.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.660
 Modesto or Modesto?

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.660
 Modesto.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.660
 Modesto.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.660
 Modesto.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.660
 I will check on the internet.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.660
 Yeah.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.660
 Modesto.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.660
 Modesto.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.660
 Modesto.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.660
 Absolutely nailed it.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.660
 Really awful.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.660
 Yeah.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.660
 Modesto.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.660
 It sounds like a very demure magician.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.660
 It does.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.660
 The great Modesto.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.660
 Well, I would say great.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.660
 That would be good.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:50.660
 But yeah, so this fact was sent to me by @Shutter_Butter on Twitter.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.660
 It's an amazing fact.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.660
 So thank you, Shutter_Butter.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.660
 And so Modesto is in California.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:04.660
 It is a town that has had a bit of fame via the fact that it's the birthplace of George Lucas.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.660
 And back in the day, he made a very famous movie called American Graffiti.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.660
 It was a...

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.660
 It was a massive movie at the time.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.660
 I was pre-star wars.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.660
 It sounds like that's what I was going to say.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.660
 But I think what you're going to say is that might have been based on this.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.660
 It was.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.660
 The American Graffiti took place in Modesto.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.660
 It was filmed elsewhere, but that's where it took place.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.660
 Interestingly, George Lucas is so modest.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.660
 He only introduces himself as the director of American Graffiti.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.660
 Jeremy Renner, the actor.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.660
 Yeah.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.660
 From Modesto, he was born there as well.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.660
 This is a significant town.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.660
 It is.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.660
 And can I just quickly slip in my favorite Jeremy Renner fact from the year?

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.660
 Just he was like, "God, he was born there.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.660
 I've been dying to get this fact out."

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.660
 He's starring in the new movie Tag.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.660
 Oh, right.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.660
 So in Tag, it's only most of Jeremy Renner that appears in the movie.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.660
 His arms don't appear in the movie.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.660
 And the reason is he broke them just as they were filming.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.660
 And so they were in casts.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.660
 And so they had to CGI in his arms.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.660
 Yeah, so when you watch the movie Tag, which is predominantly about, I think,

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.660
 using your arms.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.660
 Using your own tag.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.660
 Yeah, they're not his arms.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.660
 They're CGI arms.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.660
 You're saying he was running around with two broken arms in casts?

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.660
 Yeah, he was in cast.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.660
 Does that mean technically he's still it?

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.660
 Because he has a tag.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.660
 It's also a really confusing conversation tabloid.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.660
 We're going to recast his arms because he's been broken.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.660
 Get the casting director in here.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.660
 Very good.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.660
 It's one of this town's naming thing.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.660
 Yeah.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.660
 It's a huge trope of how towns get their name.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.660
 So there's a town in Tennessee, which is called Difficult.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:44.660
 And it all happens when they write to the post office saying, can we have this particular name?

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.660
 And supposedly when they applied for the name, which was a really complicated name,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.660
 they wanted to name the town.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.660
 The US Postal Service replied, your name is Difficult.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.660
 And the people in the town thought, oh, they've just renamed our town Difficult.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.660
 I never believe any of these stories.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.660
 There's one in California called "Likely."

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.660
 And the legend is always that all the residents got together to sign the name for their new town.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.660
 Because there's some reason they were all living there in a town with no name.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.660
 And then they were like, oh, we're never going to grow in a name.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.660
 And a guy went, yeah, likely.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.660
 And then they were like, great name.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.660
 And the same happened for town you bet.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.660
 Apparently there's a guy who went, oh, you bet.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.660
 And that's why the town called you bet.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.660
 Diculous.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.660
 I mean, all of this stuff is on the internet.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.660
 And then you get more original stories.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.660
 Yeah.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.660
 Ding dong Texas.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.660
 Do you know that?

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.660
 Ding dong Texas.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.660
 We did somebody ring the bell just as they were.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.660
 No, it was named after for Governor Peter Bell.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.660
 And the businessman, Zulis Bell, and his nephew, Bert.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.660
 But Zulis and Bert were not in any way related to Peter.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.660
 So yeah, it was called Ding dong as a reference.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.660
 And weirdly, it's in Central Texas' Bell County.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.660
 Oh, that's good.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.660
 Oh, that's good.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.660
 I thought it might have been named after Leslie Phillips.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.660
 Ding dong.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.660
 Yeah.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.660
 Blast the purse.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.660
 And there's only one place in Earth that I've found,

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.660
 which is called Earth.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.660
 OK.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.660
 It's in Texas.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.660
 That's good.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.660
 And there are various reasons as to why, as always,

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.660
 somebody suggested it because they have a lot of Earth there.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.660
 But there's a really good article about it online,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.660
 which points out there are at least two other places in America

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.660
 named after every single other planet.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.660
 There's Venus and Mercury and Jupiter.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.660
 There are Saturn's guess which planet.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.660
 There are not two places named after.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.660
 Mercury.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.660
 It's Uranus.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.660
 There is one place, but it's more of a tourist attraction than the town.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.660
 It's a little tourist attraction, which contains the Uranus Brewing Company,

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.660
 Combat Uranus.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.660
 There's a guy who calls himself the Mayor of Uranus.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.660
 They sell Fudge, which has a label on it saying Uranus Fudge.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.660
 That's great.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.660
 There's a place called Nitro, which is named after the Explosive Powder,

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.660
 which was made there in the First World War.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.660
 That's so cool.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.660
 That seems like a proper etymology.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.660
 There's a place in Russia called Asbestos,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.660
 where a friend of mine was born.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.660
 Wow.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.660
 And it's where they make all the Asbestos and send it to America.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.660
 Very cool.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.660
 I don't know how well this is known in Britain,

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.660
 but in the UK, there was a place that had its name changed.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:10.660
 Stains.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.660
 Well, there's still a place called Stains.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.660
 Well, technically not just Stains.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.660
 It's now called Stains upon Thames.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.660
 It's not much better, is it?

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.660
 I remember this.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.660
 I remember when they tried to do this.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.660
 Yeah.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.660
 So the reason that they did this is because

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.660
 AlleyG internationally had given Stains.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.660
 The Stains massive.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.660
 Exactly.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.660
 Such a bad name that they were always associated.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.660
 I remember watching AlleyG in Australia

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.660
 and thinking, oh, Stains must be...

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.660
 I could see there was laughter,

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.660
 but you just associated it sort of as this place where...

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.660
 Stains is quite nice.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.660
 Yes.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.660
 That's the guy.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.660
 That's the guy.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.660
 Yeah.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.660
 So they wanted to change it, but they didn't really change it.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.660
 They just added an extra belt on the end.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.660
 Yeah, exactly.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.660
 So on the 15th of December, 2011,

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:59.660
 the Spellthorn borough council resolved by 25 votes to four

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.660
 to change the name of the town to Stains upon Thames

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.660
 to try and boost the local economy

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.660
 by promoting its Riverside location.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.660
 I'm quoting directly from the Wikipedia article

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.660
 that I found this on.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.660
 I wonder if there's a calculation for how much adding upon Thames

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.660
 adds to a town's net worth as it were.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.660
 As in, Richmond upon Thames is quite sort of...

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.660
 Yeah.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.660
 Or upon any river.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.660
 I do sort of like Stains with waitros,

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.660
 and that would probably help because...

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.660
 Yes, Stains upon the waitros.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:26.660
 Yeah.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660
 Yeah.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.660
 And...

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.660
 My uncle, when he was a counsellor in Bolton,

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.660
 tried to change the name of Bolton to Bolton Lemours.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.660
 Did you think?

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.660
 Yeah, because there are lots of other places called Bolton in the world

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.660
 and he thought it would distinguish our town from the other ones

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.660
 and also we're on the Moors as in...

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.660
 That's where all the fires were from.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.660
 Funny he was trying to bolt home an extra bit to the name.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.660
 Very good.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.660
 Was he successful?

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.660
 No, it's still called Bolton.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.660
 Surely Bolton is the most famous Bolton...

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.660
 I don't mean any disrespect to other Bolton's in the world,

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.660
 but...

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.660
 I am Michael.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.660
 Famously people are always getting confused with the town.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.660
 And Mr. Eggton mailed from the entire town

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.660
 to his house every day.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.660
 There's a city...

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.660
 Topeka?

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.660
 Topeka, so it's in Kansas.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.660
 And it's the capital of the state.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.660
 It's no one...

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.660
 It's no slouch.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.660
 It's no slouch.

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.660
 It's no slouch.

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.660
 But it changed its name to Google for a month.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:25.660
 Did it?

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.660
 Legally and officially...

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.660
 It's a peek at it.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.660
 Yeah.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.660
 And it was to win a Google high speed internet project

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.660
 which would have given everyone internet 100 times faster than the national average.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.660
 At the time.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.660
 No one would ever be able to search for them online.

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.660
 They would break the internet if you Google Google.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.660
 Well, it didn't work.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.660
 The Google went with Kansas City, Kansas instead.

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.660
 But the mayor, he said, he didn't really mind not winning.

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.660
 And he said, I've often wondered what difference does it make.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.660
 If it takes you 10 seconds or one second to access information,

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.660
 my life goes a little slower than that.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.660
 Oh.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.660
 Yeah, it's a very laid back guy.

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.660
 But there's not the first time they've changed the name.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.660
 In 1998, Topeka changed its name.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.660
 And one of you will really like this fact.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.660
 They've changed it to...

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.660
 Topeka Chu.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.660
 He's a Pokemon arrived in the USA.

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.660
 Yeah.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.660
 On Modesto.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.660
 Yeah.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.660
 It's the second unhappiest city in the United States of America.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.660
 What?

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.660
 Yeah.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.660
 Wow.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:22.660
 The city's motto is water wealth contentment health.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:26.660
 And that was selected in a contest in 1911,

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.660
 where the winner won three dollars as a prize.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.660
 Oh.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.660
 Yeah.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.660
 And just to say, Ralston wasn't just this local banker.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.660
 All the men who the town was not named after.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.660
 Exactly.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.660
 Ralston was...

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.660
 He was one of the most rich people in California, actually.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.660
 And he founded the Bank of California.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.660
 So he was a very important guy in his day.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.660
 Well, he didn't like to talk about it.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.660
 I really had to dig deep to find that.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.660
 There's a town in California called Secret Town.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.660
 Is that...

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.660
 And why is it called that, do we know?

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.660
 I can't tell you that.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.660
 I genuinely know nothing about it.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.660
 There's nothing in the Wikipedia page.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.660
 That's too long we can feed the page off.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.660
 That's it.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.660
 Okay, that's it.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.660
 That is all of our facts.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.660

 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.660
 We have everything up there from our previous episodes

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.660
 to links to our upcoming live shows, to our books.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.660
 We've got a new book coming out, which you can probably pre-order at this point.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:52.660
 We also have our great documentary series that we put up on iTunes called Behind the Gills.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.660
 It's on a few other platforms.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.660
 There'll be a link there.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.660
 Follows us around on our last tour of the UK.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.660
 You should get it in America, can't you?

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.660
 Yeah, it's in America now as well, which is very exciting.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.660
 If you're in Modesto, you can probably download it.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.660
 No.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.660
 We'll be back again next week.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.660
 We'll see you then.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.660
 Goodbye.
