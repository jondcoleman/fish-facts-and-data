00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,860
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,040
 My name is Dad Shriver and I'm sitting here with Adju Huttamari, James Harkin and Alex

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,400
 Bell and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,240
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go starting with you, Alex.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,540
 My fact this week is that the Swiss flush about $2 million worth of gold down the toilet

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,540
 every year.

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,500
 Are they hiding it because it's Nazi gold and they're embarrassed about the fact they

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 have it?

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 And time to mention the Nazis, like three seconds.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,420
 No, this is, it's lots and lots of little tiny, tiny gold particles.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,200
 It's a waste result of the manufacturing process of watches that they think.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,380
 They're not entirely sure where it comes from.

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,100
 All they know is that they've been analysing the content of sewage and it's got a really

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,900
 weirdly high percentage of gold in it.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
 Can they collect it?

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,820
 They're trying to come up with a way of getting it that's cost-effective but at the moment

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,260
 it's too expensive.

20
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,100
 How crazy that it's costing too much to get $1.8 million worth of gold.

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,900
 Yeah, except when you think it's tiny, tiny particles in the water so it's like panning

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,900
 for gold.

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,740
 Can you go panning for gold there?

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,340
 I think they're way too small, it's not like panning for gold in like old times where you

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,180
 had a little nugget so you had the choice.

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,580
 If you have the choice of panning for gold in a nice river in Scotland or maybe in a load

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,980
 of sewage in Switzerland, I know which one I choose.

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,900
 Yeah, but one definitely has gold at it.

29
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,500
 One's got $1.8 million worth of gold.

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,060
 There's gold in member mountains in Scotland.

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,060
 Is it?

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,060
 Did you not see that?

33
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
 That was in the news about two weeks ago.

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,180
 Maybe a week ago where they found the largest gold nugget ever in Britain, I think.

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,940
 Oh, the guy who was sitting in the river.

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,740
 I think what he does is he lies down, face down in the water and he just kind of looks for

37
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
 it.

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,300
 Like doesn't do that panning thing or whatever.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,740
 He just kind of lies there and waits and just tries to see it.

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,860
 That's nice because it's like fishing but without the fish.

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,700
 You are the fish in a way, you're in the water.

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,900
 In a way.

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,900
 What's it, do we know?

44
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,140
 Are you allowed to keep it if you find a big gold nugget in a river?

45
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,140
 I can't remember.

46
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,780
 I think what happens is the crown of states can claim it.

47
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
 Oh.

48
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,780
 So Queen's allowed to eat it.

49
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,700
 Is it, if you find it on crown of state land or is it just the Queen of?

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
 No.

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
 I think Queen knows everything actually.

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,860
 Oh, man.

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,700
 If you find it downstairs in the, you know, let's say you're rooting

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,940
 around in the toilets of the QI office and there's no reason to say that.

55
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,940
 And I don't know why you would look at me when you're saying that.

56
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,620
 Well, I would just say like we've already decided that that's a good place to find gold.

57
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,620
 There's no rivers around here.

58
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,620
 Right.

59
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,220
 But if you did find some gold then technically I think you'd have to offer it to the Queen.

60
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
 Really?

61
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,220
 I think so.

62
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,540
 I think the same goes for like bottle tops if you find them in a metal head.

63
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,540
 She's just less interested.

64
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,820
 It's a crown made of bottle tops, isn't it?

65
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,220
 It's all of these rooms at Buckingham Palace.

66
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,220
 They're just full of old bottle tops.

67
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,420
 Do you know there's loads of gold in British sewers as well?

68
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,660
 But it's not from, because we don't have a luxury watch industry the same way that the

69
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,580
 Swiss do, it's about seven parts per million which would make it economically feasible as

70
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,580
 a gold mine.

71
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,620
 As in, in a gold mine you get less than that.

72
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,980
 But the way you get, it gets into the water in Britain is from people doing the washing

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,140
 up while wearing wedding rings.

74
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,300
 So tiny bits of gold was a, and also get this.

75
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,940
 If you brush your teeth and you've got a gold tooth, tiny bits of gold will come off and

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
 make the way into the water.

77
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,540
 How often would I have to do the washing up before my wedding ring completely disappeared

78
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,540
 from my hand?

79
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,020
 It sounds like you're really hoping to get out of something by doing the washing up.

80
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,260
 I can say to my wife, I can't do the washing up because that marriage will be an old one.

81
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,180
 You've probably several hundred years of a phrase.

82
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,180
 Okay.

83
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,220
 It's a bit divorce and sounds like a loss of the wedding ring would happen much to you as

84
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,220
 well.

85
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,540
 We've got in our upcoming book, we've got an article on the Fatberg that was displayed

86
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,540
 in the London Museum this year.

87
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,540
 What is that book then?

88
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,620
 It's going to be called the Book of the Year 2018.

89
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
 Okay.

90
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,620
 And where is it going to be available?

91
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,860
 You know, places like Waterstones and online retailers that Andy doesn't allow us to say

92
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
 anymore.

93
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
 And I do.

94
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
 It's going to be on Amazon.

95
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
 I know you can't say that.

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,860
 Sorry, you were saying?

97
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,860
 Yeah.

98
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,900
 So the Fatberg for anyone that doesn't know is just a giant lump of fat that they find

99
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,460
 in the sewers, mainly of London, but they've been found worldwide.

100
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,020
 And yeah, they're ginormous.

101
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,500
 It takes some days and days, in some cases, weeks to absolutely knock them apart.

102
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,660
 They have to use pneumatic drills to get them down.

103
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,820
 And it was made up 90% of cooking fat that we put down our drains.

104
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,900
 The others are wet wipes, which is all down to, it turns out, Colonel Sanders and KFC.

105
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,380
 KFC, effectively, with the first people to let the wet wipe out into the public.

106
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,500
 The man, the man who invented the wet wipe sold it to KFC.

107
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,580
 So KFC, we're the original wet wipe people.

108
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,180
 But now they're mostly used by parents and stuff, right?

109
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
 Exactly.

110
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,180
 For children's mums.

111
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,180
 Yeah.

112
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,180
 They weren't used to wipe the chickens, were they?

113
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,260
 But yeah, what's interesting as well is that they found a higher concentration of banned

114
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,060
 gym supplements in the Fatberg than they did, say, cocaine or MDMA.

115
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,700
 What like steroids and things?

116
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
 Yeah, exactly.

117
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,740
 So the Fatberg might become muscle burn.

118
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,980
 That's a German city I want to go to sometime.

119
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,860
 All German cities and muscle burn.

120
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
 Yeah.

121
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,180
 Very well developed people.

122
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,140
 So I found a crime from this year where thieves used sewage to steal gold.

123
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,140
 This is clever.

124
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,420
 So it's in Western Australia, where there are lots of gold mines.

125
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,300
 And what they did is they stole a sewage truck, and you remember sewage trucks, they have

126
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,620
 those big hoses and nozzles, but they can suck up sewage with.

127
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:12,180
 And they stuck that into a gold mine site's big pit of gold-rich liquid, and they suck

128
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
 that all up.

129
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,180
 Interesting.

130
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,980
 And I didn't know they would have like gold-rich liquid.

131
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,380
 I don't know how the mining process works.

132
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,580
 I guess maybe if they're blasting out of the liquid, they sort of had this gold-y soup

133
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,580
 which they could then refine.

134
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,140
 And if you're going to leave that lying around in a big, fat-labeled gold-rich liquid.

135
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,620
 You're all skinned to be robbed, really, aren't you? That's like putting it in a sort of bag with a dollar sign on it.

136
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,620
 It's very impressive though, to steal a sewage truck, to think of that, because I would have just gone along with a Henry Hoover and tried to take a little bit.

137
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,740
 I think that would be the great escape level way of doing it, going in as a keener every day and just like getting a little bit in your Hoover.

138
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
 Yeah.

139
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,060
 The largest nugget of gold ever found was called "Welcome Stranger", okay.

140
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,420
 And I say was, because as soon as it was found, it was melted down into gold fingers.

141
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,940
 The second largest was called "Welcome", "Only Welcome".

142
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,020
 And that was also melted down into sovereigns.

143
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,420
 But the good thing about that is it was found by one guy with a pickaxe who carried on mining after his fellow miners had gone to lunch.

144
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,180
 So they all went away and he thought, "I'm going to carry on mining."

145
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,540
 And as soon as he saw the nugget, he fainted.

146
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,380
 And then when the guys came back from lunch, they saw he was kind of faced down in the middle of the hole and they thought he was dead.

147
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,380
 And so they climbed down to try and save him and they saw the nugget and they fainted as well.

148
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:30,740
 So it turns out the way to find nuggets of gold is just to lay face down.

149
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
 That's true.

150
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,900
 Why were they called "Welcome and Welcome Stranger", that's quite weird names for nuggets.

151
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,660
 Well, that's a really good question.

152
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,980
 I don't know why they're called that.

153
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:44,740
 I suppose what you might say, if you found a nugget, you might, "Oh, welcome Stranger."

154
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,980
 That's a bit.

155
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,060
 That's a oddly predatory way of discovering something.

156
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,140
 So the third largest is the largest extent nugget. It's called the Hand of Faith and it's on display in Las Vegas.

157
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,780
 Do you know what the Netherlands are doing with their old toilet paper, with their old toilet paper?

158
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,940
 Yeah, use toilet paper.

159
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,820
 They're making it into windmills.

160
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,820
 Shitty windmills.

161
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,540
 Oh, I wish it was that.

162
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,300
 No, well, they're turning it into bike lanes.

163
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,580
 So it is a similarly green, it was a similarly kind of stereotypical dutch thing.

164
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,820
 Are they, do they collect their paper on the side and not flush it down, is that way?

165
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,140
 I don't know how it's collected, actually, that's a really good point.

166
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,860
 It must be that it's flushed down and then sort of scooped out.

167
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,700
 I think it's scooped out.

168
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,100
 Because what they do, once they've got it, I don't know how they get it, but they extract the cellulose from it.

169
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 So it's tree pulp and stuff, which has a lot of cellulose, which is this tough fiber.

170
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,900
 Then they sterilize it, obviously.

171
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,660
 And then they turn it into big pellets, which they can turn into asphalt.

172
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,340
 But also, bike lanes are usually colored brown, aren't they, to make them look different to the rest of the road.

173
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,860
 Right.

174
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,660
 So they probably don't have to use any coloring.

175
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,460
 Yeah, a lot of skid marks as well.

176
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,620
 And then the breaking of the bikes, guys, watch out for pooled desertions.

177
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,060
 Oh, yeah, me.

178
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,500
 I'm almost certain that they are, they must be flushing them when they're clashing the sewers.

179
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,900
 Because it's not like they'd be saying, "Please, everyone put aside your used toilet paper, we'll come and get it."

180
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,100
 No, that does happen, dude.

181
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
 That does happen, Alex.

182
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,900
 That does happen.

183
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,740
 Yes, it does.

184
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,700
 Nothing that depends on people, like, no, no, no, no.

185
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,860
 It happens in Greece.

186
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,420
 Yeah, it happens in Greece, really?

187
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,260
 Yeah, I film.

188
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,860
 I don't remember that song.

189
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,860
 (Laughter)

190
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:27,860
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

191
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,620
 My factor is that Robert Burns made his own ink out of Old Beer,

192
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,660
 Lard, Elephant Tusk, and Sulfuric Acid.

193
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
 Wow.

194
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,660
 Yeah.

195
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,660
 It's very cool.

196
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
 What a man.

197
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,660
 I read the source that you sent for this, and it noted that these were all things that were readily available in Scotland at the time.

198
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,660
 (Laughter)

199
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,660
 Yeah, I mean, Old Beer and Lard, obviously.

200
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
 But where did they get Elephant Tusk in Scotland?

201
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,660
 Library, I reckon.

202
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,660
 Big ivory trade.

203
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
 Sure.

204
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,660
 Yeah.

205
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,660
 I mean, that's, I just said another word for the thing.

206
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,660
 (Laughter)

207
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
 Capitalism, I guess.

208
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
 (Laughter)

209
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,660
 Yeah, so I didn't know this, but writers basically had to make their own ink for centuries.

210
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,660
 You couldn't just go down to the ink shop and buy some ink.

211
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,660
 So there were all these recipes around, and the researchers from the University of Glasgow have analysed.

212
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
 It's really cool.

213
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,660
 They took original burns poems, and they lifted ink away in a way that didn't damage the original poems.

214
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
 Wow.

215
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
 Because obviously they're original manuscripts.

216
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,660
 That's amazing.

217
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
 I wonder how they do that.

218
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
 I don't know.

219
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
 I wish I did.

220
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
 Because you wouldn't want to accidentally lift off a whole word.

221
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
 No.

222
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
 (Laughter)

223
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
 And you forget what it is.

224
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
 (Laughter)

225
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,660
 And the really cool thing is they've found different recipes from different stages of his life.

226
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:45,660
 When he was a young and poor, he used a particular kind of iron gul ink, and then as he got richer, he used this thing called ivory black,

227
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,660
 which involved treacle, and lard, and acid, and vinegar, and ivory.

228
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,660
 And it's a way of telling the real poems from forgeries.

229
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
 Yeah, which is amazing, isn't it?

230
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,660
 They're starting to apply this now to all ancient manuscripts.

231
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,660
 Because if they see the recipe someone uses, and then someone else claims to have an original,

232
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:08,660
 and it turns out it's made from, I don't know, mull and butter and sausages.

233
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
 So he mull as in the animal.

234
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,660
 Yeah, the animal.

235
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
 No, mulls, human mulls.

236
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
 (Laughter)

237
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,660
 That's her in sausages.

238
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,660
 Yeah.

239
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,660
 Robert Burns used to have some really cool nicknames.

240
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
 He used to refer to himself as spunky.

241
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,660
 Oh, yeah.

242
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,660
 Yeah.

243
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
 He used to call himself the rant and roven robin.

244
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
 That was one of his personal favourites apparently.

245
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,660
 But he never called himself rabbi or roby, which is what?

246
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,660
 What?

247
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,660
 Rabbi Burns or Robby Burns is what many people in the UK would associate as his nickname,

248
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
 that we've given him.

249
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
 Yeah, never called himself that.

250
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
 But he's calling himself these.

251
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
 He's already nicknames.

252
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
 Yeah, they're not really nicknames if you call them yourself.

253
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
 No one else is calling him spunky.

254
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
 I don't think that counts as a nickname.

255
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
 Yeah, that's more like an online avatar.

256
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,660
 (Laughter)

257
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
 Just Twitter handle at rant and roven robin.

258
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
 (Laughter)

259
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,660
 Oh, he would have been great on Twitter.

260
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
 Really funny, I think.

261
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,660
 Really, actually just for tweeting, really tedious things about making your own ink.

262
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,660
 Yeah, these recipes are really weird.

263
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,660
 So there are lots of recipes that used to exist.

264
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
 Oh, do you know about a gall ink?

265
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
 Ah, no.

266
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
 Asterix?

267
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
 A gall?

268
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
 Ah, sorry, G-A.

269
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,660
 A gall as in gall bladder, I guess.

270
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,660
 Yes.

271
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
 But not as in gall bladder.

272
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
 Gall wasps.

273
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,660
 Exactly.

274
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,660
 Yeah, so there are hundreds of species of wasps called gall wasps.

275
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,660
 And what they do is they land on an oak tree and they lay their eggs inside the leaf buds.

276
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,660
 And then that turns into this weird kind of tumor or lump on the tree.

277
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,660
 And the little grub grows inside and it's all protected from the outside.

278
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,660
 But those galls can be ground up and they're a massive ingredient for ink.

279
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
 And they work for hundreds and hundreds of years.

280
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,660
 There's only one kind of oak gall which makes the ink.

281
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,660
 And it's basically the most important wasp in history.

282
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,660
 And so all of, you know, Mozart, Darwin, Magna Carta, Bayo of all of that was written in oak gall ink.

283
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
 Wow.

284
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,660
 It was for centuries and centuries it was the ink to use.

285
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,660
 So you could say that these wasps are responsible for all those great works, can't you really?

286
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
 I think you can.

287
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,660
 Yeah.

288
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
 Wow.

289
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,660
 I mean, also the trees that you made the paper from and you know, the tables.

290
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,660
 It's a group effort.

291
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
 It's a laboratory.

292
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
 It's just logic is flawed.

293
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,660
 You know, well done wasps.

294
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,660
 Yeah.

295
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
 It's not going to be like a hidden figures movie.

296
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
 Sorry.

297
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
 I'm a recognized asset.

298
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,660
 So what do we make it out of these days?

299
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,660
 I don't actually know much about.

300
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,660
 I don't know actually.

301
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,660
 I think it involves carbon, but I haven't looked it up properly.

302
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,660
 Is it not made out of moles and sausages?

303
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
 A butter, I think.

304
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
 Yeah, yeah.

305
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
 I don't know.

306
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,660
 It's probably made out of some kind of synthetic resin stuff.

307
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,660
 Yeah.

308
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
 Let's go with that.

309
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
 Yeah.

310
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
 Cool.

311
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
 Capitalism.

312
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,660
 Did you know that the Secret Service has an international ink library?

313
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
 No.

314
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,660
 And they keep more than 11,000 specimens of ink and it's for identifying mystery inks when they get,

315
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
 you know, like a poison pen battery or something like that.

316
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
 They've got ink stating all.

317
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
 So it was set up in a suit.

318
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,660
 What does that do for them?

319
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,660
 Or they can find out like when or where it was made and like tons of it.

320
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,660
 They're looking for the author of the bail wolf.

321
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,660
 Bring in the wasp.

322
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,660
 But yeah, they've got ink stating back always in 1920s.

323
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
 And it's pretty cool.

324
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,660
 So blood's used often in place of ink.

325
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,660
 I was just looking into different types of methods of...

326
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,660
 Where?

327
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
 Where?

328
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
 So did a sadam Hussein have a caran in his eye?

329
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
 Yeah.

330
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
 This is what I was going to say.

331
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
 No, no, but it's extraordinary.

332
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
 I've not heard of this.

333
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:48,660
 So Sadam Hussein post a assassination attempt on his son, became a devout Muslim.

334
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,660
 And so I read this in Atlas Obscura.

335
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:58,660
 He gave on his, after his 60th birthday, 27 liters of his own blood to a polygonal form.

336
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,660
 So he must have needed a big biscuit after that.

337
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:09,660
 So he gave it to this calligrapher who spent two years putting together a 600 page blood.

338
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:17,660
 Sadam Hussein blood-inked caran, which is now locked in a vault in a mosque in Baghdad.

339
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
 But it sits there.

340
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
 It's just bizarre.

341
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
 Yeah.

342
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,660
 I mean, there's much more blood than you would need to make a new Sadam Hussein there.

343
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
 You need more than blood to make a personan.

344
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
 That's true.

345
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
 Yeah.

346
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
 No.

347
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,660
 I'm just saying if someone else finds other ingredients.

348
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
 I don't know.

349
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660
 I've watched Jurassic Park and I'm pretty sure they only had some blood.

350
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,660
 That's very true, actually.

351
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,660
 But then the problem is that the dance was turned female.

352
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,660
 So at some point Sadam Hussein might turn into a girl and start reproducing on the island.

353
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
 Yeah.

354
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
 But I'll see.

355
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
 We're keeping him on.

356
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
 All right.

357
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660
 I don't want to go to the theme park also in the film to be honest.

358
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,660
 I think it's a more sensible pitch than the New Jurassic World movie.

359
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,660
 Okay.

360
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:59,660
 Okay.

361
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,660
 It is time for fact number three.

362
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
 And that is James.

363
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,660
 Okay, my fact this week is that Sweden's highest point is now its second highest after the top of it melted.

364
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,660
 Oh no.

365
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
 Poor, poor highest point.

366
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
 Oh, good for the second highest point.

367
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
 Yeah, that's true.

368
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,660
 Finally, that bastard's got what's coming to it.

369
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,660
 So is the second highest one not covered in ice?

370
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
 So you're right.

371
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
 Exactly right.

372
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,660
 So they're basically the same part.

373
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
 They're the same mountain.

374
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,660
 But they're two different peaks on the same mountain.

375
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,660
 And the highest point in Sweden has a glacier on top of it.

376
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,660
 But due to the recent heat wave, the glacier has melted and now the second highest point is the highest.

377
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,660
 But in the winter they expect them to swap places again.

378
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,660
 Yeah.

379
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,660
 So it must be really confusing for any sort of textbooks that they're going to publish between now and winter.

380
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
 Because they don't know.

381
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,660
 They can't confirm that it's definitely going to get cold enough.

382
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
 The real victims.

383
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,660
 This is, I'll probably pronounce this wrong.

384
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,660
 But it's something like Kepp and the Kaiser mountain, which is in the north of Sweden.

385
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
 Oh man.

386
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
 So it's not a good news story in some ways.

387
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,660
 Well, I didn't put it forward as a good news story.

388
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
 No, no, no.

389
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
 No, you didn't.

390
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,660
 I think it's just a thing that happened.

391
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,660
 And I think it's interesting that a country can have two peaks that are the highest of different parts.

392
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
 Yeah.

393
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660
 And there are even worse things about it actually.

394
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,660
 Because let's say you're Swedish or let's say you're any nationality, but you want to climb the highest point in Sweden.

395
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,660
 You've always been able to climb this kind of point, which is a north peak of Kepp and Kaiser.

396
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,660
 And now you need to climb the other one.

397
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
 And actually it's a much more difficult climb.

398
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:41,660
 So for a safety aspect, they think a lot more people might get injured or killed because they're trying to climb this really difficult peak.

399
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,660
 Whereas before they could do the relatively easy one.

400
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,660
 Can you wait until, I guess you can wait until winter.

401
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
 I know it's bad climbing mountains and winter, isn't it?

402
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
 It's easier in spring and summer.

403
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,660
 Yeah, although it's snowy at the top anyway of the old one.

404
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,660
 How much is it mounted by to make it a match of center?

405
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,660
 Because you could just take like a calippo up if you really want the other one to be able to just stick it in the snow.

406
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,660
 I don't think you're allowed to make your own highest point.

407
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
 Well, that did happen.

408
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
 That's that movie.

409
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
 I think we might have mentioned it before.

410
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,660
 The man who went up the hill and came down the mountain, which was a true story of the game.

411
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,660
 Wales, who they said that to be amounted, it had to be a certain height.

412
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,660
 So we added a little bit on top of it to make it higher.

413
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,660
 But I think he did that with grounds rather than calipos.

414
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,660
 I didn't actually, I thought that movie was going to be something sort of some tedious emotional journey.

415
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,660
 And that was a metaphor.

416
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
 I didn't realize that was literally the story.

417
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
 I think it might also be a tedious emotional journey.

418
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
 Yeah, it was.

419
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
 Okay, so get this.

420
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,660
 The lowest highest point.

421
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
 No, hang on, sorry.

422
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,660
 There we go.

423
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
 No, down it.

424
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,660
 The highest lowest point in the world in any country.

425
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
 Oh, okay.

426
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
 So is it, can I guess?

427
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
 Yeah.

428
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,660
 I think is it in Swaziland?

429
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
 Oh, you're so close.

430
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
 It's down there somewhere.

431
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,660
 It's the other one.

432
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,660
 Lesutu.

433
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
 It's the other small country within South Africa.

434
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,660
 It's Lesutu, the enclave country, which is completely surrounded by South Africa.

435
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
 Okay.

436
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
 What is it?

437
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,660
 Is it like a cave or is it supposed to be above ground?

438
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
 Yeah, it's just the lowest.

439
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,660
 So all of Lesutu is well over 1,000 metres above sea level.

440
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,660
 So the lowest point in Lesutu is 1,400 metres above sea level.

441
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
 And everything else is even higher than that.

442
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,660
 So in any countries that are entirely below that point.

443
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
 Oh, well, two value.

444
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
 Two value.

445
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,660
 Yeah, all of those places that are going to get two value in the Maldives.

446
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
 Yeah.

447
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,660
 So the lowest high point, as opposed to the highest low point.

448
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
 The lowest high point.

449
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
 Yeah.

450
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,660
 Is in the Maldives, which is 2.4 metres above sea level.

451
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
 Yeah.

452
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
 So Maldives, obviously, lots of islands.

453
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,660
 And 99% of the Maldives territory is open ocean.

454
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,660
 But there was this island called Villingale, which had an 8-foot rise on it,

455
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,660
 which was the highest point.

456
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,660
 However, in 2013, a golf course opened on that island,

457
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,660
 and it has a small mound on it, which was 16 feet above sea level.

458
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,660
 And the fifth hole teeing off point is the highest point now in the Maldives.

459
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
 Oh, good.

460
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
 And it's in a resort, and they do a daily tour.

461
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,660
 And all guests who complete the ascend get a certificate.

462
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,660
 [LAUGHTER]

463
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,660
 Wow.

464
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,660
 That's hilarious.

465
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,660
 That's be annoying, though, if you're playing golf and you've got a whole sort of expedition

466
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,660
 trying to mount a hole.

467
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
 There's a flag there.

468
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,660
 Someone's got here.

469
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,660
 [LAUGHTER]

470
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
 I've got a Swedish Mountains fact.

471
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,660
 Oh, yeah.

472
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
 There is a massive bunker inside--

473
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
 Is this another golf fact?

474
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
 No.

475
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,660
 So there's a sort of massive underground bunker inside the Swedish mountains.

476
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,660
 And it was built as sort of government protection facility for, you know,

477
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
 nuclear events and stuff.

478
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,660
 And it's no longer used to that.

479
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,660
 And it was sold to a private data center, so they keep servers in there now.

480
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,660
 And one of the things that's kept inside of the servers is WikiLeaks.

481
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,660
 Huh?

482
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
 A sunch?

483
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
 Yeah, actually, yeah.

484
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,660
 The digital version of a sunch is kept in--

485
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,660
 It's kept in prison, in underground.

486
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
 And you look at pictures.

487
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,660
 It does actually look like an evil villain's layer.

488
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,660
 It's crazy.

489
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,660
 But it's inside a mountain.

490
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
 It's made of glass.

491
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:03,660
 Wow.

492
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
 It's cool.

493
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
 That's where WikiLeaks is, guys.

494
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
 It's inside a Swedish mountain.

495
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
 Wow.

496
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
 That is very cool.

497
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,660
 The highest point in the Netherlands is 4,000 miles from Amsterdam.

498
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,660
 What?

499
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,660
 Yeah.

500
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,660
 So there's the Caribbean Netherlands, which is a different hillies.

501
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,660
 Yeah, I think it was called the Dutch Antilles, and then recently they had a weird admin change.

502
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,660
 But there's an island called Saba, and it has a mount on it called Mount Scenery.

503
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,660
 It's about three or four times higher than anywhere in the Netherlands.

504
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
 That's true, actually.

505
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,660
 If the highest point of Britain, I think, if we count everything that we claim is in the Antarctic--

506
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
 Oh, that's good.

507
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,660
 --because we claim a little bit of the Antarctic, which has a massive mountain on it.

508
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
 Nice.

509
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
 And the highest point in Australia is not, what does it say--

510
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
 Cozy Oscar.

511
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,660
 Yeah, it's actually an island off the coast of Australia, which has got a massive peak on it.

512
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,660
 And the highest point in Spain is in the Canary Islands, Mount Tiede.

513
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,660
 So loads of countries, the highest point, isn't really in that country at all.

514
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,660
 Wow.

515
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,660
 Who owns the moon?

516
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
 I know.

517
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
 I'm singing the moon.

518
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
 What is the highest?

519
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
 With the highest--

520
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
 No one owns the moon.

521
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
 No, but there's the flag.

522
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,660
 That's not true.

523
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
 So I've got a certificate.

524
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
 [LAUGHTER]

525
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,660
 The highest point of Andy's house is actually on the moon.

526
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,660
 [LAUGHTER]

527
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,660
 I have a thing or two about the big heat wave that we've been going through.

528
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,660
 Oh, yeah.

529
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,660
 So this is quite tied in, your fact, to the fact that globally there's been a heat wave.

530
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,660
 And Ireland, very recently, through the heat wave and through the drought,

531
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,660
 has had exposed a sort of huge stone that says "ire."

532
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
 So E-I-R-E.

533
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,660
 Sorry, I always pronounce that error, but I don't know how to pronounce it.

534
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
 Yeah, would you say error?

535
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660
 Don't look at me.

536
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,660
 Would you say it?

537
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
 I don't know.

538
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,660
 I'd say it is an error to say it.

539
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
 What?

540
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
 [LAUGHTER]

541
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
 I think it is error.

542
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
 Error, so I'll just say that.

543
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
 Yeah.

544
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
 So it's exposed.

545
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:00,660
 This giant stone error, E-I-R-E, and it's along the Irish coast.

546
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:07,660
 And what it was is during the Second World War, they built this to show the enemies that were flying over

547
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,660
 thinking that they were going to bomb, let's say, England.

548
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
 Don't bomb us.

549
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
 This is Ireland.

550
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
 This is neutral grounds.

551
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,660
 Wasn't it to differentiate Ireland from Northern Ireland?

552
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
 Oh, OK.

553
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
 Was it Northern Ireland?

554
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,660
 Well, I'm just guessing, but I would have thought that pilots wouldn't know whether they were over Ireland or--

555
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
 Why could be foggy, you know?

556
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,660
 If you were.

557
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,660
 Yeah.

558
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
 Second World War, they actually have.

559
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
 It's just assuming everyone in the war was an idiot.

560
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,660
 It sounds like someone who's used the excuse to fog for making some pretty egregious errors in your life.

561
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,660
 [LAUGHTER]

562
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
 I don't mean to be in her house.

563
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
 I don't know.

564
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
 I didn't know.

565
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
 I was 50 miles away.

566
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
 I was foggy.

567
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
 What could I say?

568
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,660
 Sorry, just to backtrack a tiny bit.

569
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:52,660
 There were huge fires as a result of this heat wave, and the fires knocked out all of the grass and the trees and so on, and it's exposed.

570
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,660
 This giant air, E-I-R-E, to mean Ireland.

571
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,660
 I've found it on the internet, so let's see how they pronounce it.

572
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,660
 Air or air?

573
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
 Brilliant.

574
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,660
 [LAUGHTER]

575
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
 Since that porn hub that you've not watched.

576
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,660
 [LAUGHTER]

577
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,660
 I have a fact about Sweden, which I definitely know how to pronounce.

578
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,660
 [LAUGHTER]

579
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,660
 So, in lots of Swedish mountains, there have been no worms since the ice age.

580
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,660
 They were all wiped out.

581
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
 [LAUGHTER]

582
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
 It's true.

583
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
 Yeah, great.

584
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
 I mean, bad for the worms.

585
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,660
 It's bad for the worms, but they've got other places to live, so it's fine.

586
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
 And bad for the soil in the mountains?

587
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
 This is the thing.

588
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,660
 So, they change the vegetation, and they have very negative effects on particular trees.

589
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
 I think even effect deer at life cycles.

590
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
 I can't remember how.

591
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:44,660
 So, the thing is that they are definitely invasive, because world populations apparently are only capable of moving five to ten meters a year.

592
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,660
 So, for them to make their way all the way through northern Europe into the Swedish mountains, they wouldn't have done it for thousands of doubt.

593
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
 It's not much of an invasion.

594
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
 It's not life for Germans going into Russia, is it?

595
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,660
 No.

596
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,660
 So, this is how we know that they're invasive.

597
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,660
 And they're impossible to get rid of if they establish themselves.

598
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,660
 So, this could completely change the European landscape over the next few hundred years.

599
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
 Yeah.

600
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:11,660
 Do you know that, due to the heat wave, bears in Dundee in the zoo.

601
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,660
 I've got an 80 kilo ice lolly to keep them cool.

602
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
 [LAUGHTER]

603
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,660
 Wow.

604
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,660
 What's it made of?

605
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,660
 Ice.

606
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
 Oh, nice.

607
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
 And fruit.

608
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
 Oh, lovely.

609
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,660
 That's very nice.

610
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
 That does sound good.

611
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
 It sounds like one of those decoy healthy lollies.

612
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
 [LAUGHTER]

613
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,660
 Yeah, like when the ice cream man used to come, and we weren't allowed to go,

614
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,660
 and my mom would instead freeze some orange juice to have that healthy thing.

615
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
 Yeah.

616
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,660
 Would she then cut the carton open, as in, how would you get at the orange juice?

617
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,660
 Did you pour it into a glass?

618
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
 You do it in ice cube trays, right?

619
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,660
 No. So, we had special ice lolly trays that like ice cube trays,

620
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
 but shaped like ice lollies.

621
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
 I remember those. So, you pour the, yeah, into the moulds.

622
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
 Yeah. That is a better method.

623
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
 And it was freezing the ice cube.

624
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
 The orange could just cast a bit.

625
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
 And then hacking it open.

626
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
 [LAUGHTER]

627
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
 Entire liter of ice orange juice.

628
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,660
 What you do is you jab a pool cue into the orange juice cast and freeze that.

629
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,660
 [LAUGHTER]

630
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
 And did the bears get, like, get it on sticks?

631
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
 Or, I saw a photo of it, I think.

632
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,660
 And I think it was hanging on a chain.

633
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
 Wow.

634
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
 And they could climb on it.

635
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
 I believe it.

636
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
 I believe it.

637
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,660
 Yeah.

638
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
 On a nice lolly.

639
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
 Imagine a magnum.

640
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,660
 A big magnum swinging from a chain and then you can just climb it on it.

641
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
 Very grippable.

642
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
 A nice lolly. It's a solid block of ice.

643
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
 I think I've just discovered my fetish.

644
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,660
 I would love to see that Miley Cyrus video where she's swinging down the magnum.

645
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
 [LAUGHTER]

646
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,660
 And the highest temperature ever recorded in Scotland.

647
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
 Was it here?

648
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
 This year.

649
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,660
 But it was declared invalid because the thermometer was next to a vehicle with its engine running.

650
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,660
 [LAUGHTER]

651
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:52,660
 And the coldest temperature ever outside of Antarctica was measured in Siberia.

652
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,660
 But no one knows if that's right because the thermometer broke due to the cold.

653
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,660
 [LAUGHTER]

654
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,660
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

655
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,660
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

656
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
 That is my fact.

657
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:13,660
 My fact this week is that when financier William C. Rollston modestly refused to allow a town to be named after him,

658
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,660
 the town instead called itself Modesto.

659
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
 [LAUGHTER]

660
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
 Modesto or Modesto?

661
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
 Modesto.

662
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
 Modesto.

663
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
 Modesto.

664
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
 I will check on the internet.

665
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
 Yeah.

666
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
 Modesto.

667
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
 Modesto.

668
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
 Modesto.

669
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,660
 [LAUGHTER]

670
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
 Absolutely nailed it.

671
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
 Really awful.

672
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
 Yeah.

673
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
 Modesto.

674
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
 It sounds like a very demure magician.

675
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
 It does.

676
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
 The great Modesto.

677
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
 Well, I would say great.

678
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
 [LAUGHTER]

679
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,660
 That would be good.

680
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:50,660
 But yeah, so this fact was sent to me by @Shutter_Butter on Twitter.

681
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
 It's an amazing fact.

682
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,660
 So thank you, Shutter_Butter.

683
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,660
 And so Modesto is in California.

684
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,660
 It is a town that has had a bit of fame via the fact that it's the birthplace of George Lucas.

685
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,660
 And back in the day, he made a very famous movie called American Graffiti.

686
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,660
 It was a...

687
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,660
 [LAUGHTER]

688
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
 It was a massive movie at the time.

689
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,660
 I was pre-star wars.

690
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,660
 It sounds like that's what I was going to say.

691
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
 [LAUGHTER]

692
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,660
 But I think what you're going to say is that might have been based on this.

693
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,660
 It was.

694
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,660
 The American Graffiti took place in Modesto.

695
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,660
 It was filmed elsewhere, but that's where it took place.

696
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,660
 Interestingly, George Lucas is so modest.

697
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,660
 He only introduces himself as the director of American Graffiti.

698
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,660
 [LAUGHTER]

699
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,660
 Jeremy Renner, the actor.

700
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
 Yeah.

701
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
 From Modesto, he was born there as well.

702
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,660
 This is a significant town.

703
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,660
 It is.

704
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,660
 And can I just quickly slip in my favorite Jeremy Renner fact from the year?

705
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,660
 [LAUGHTER]

706
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,660
 Just he was like, "God, he was born there.

707
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,660
 I've been dying to get this fact out."

708
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,660
 He's starring in the new movie Tag.

709
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
 Oh, right.

710
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:55,660
 So in Tag, it's only most of Jeremy Renner that appears in the movie.

711
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,660
 His arms don't appear in the movie.

712
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,660
 And the reason is he broke them just as they were filming.

713
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
 And so they were in casts.

714
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,660
 And so they had to CGI in his arms.

715
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,660
 Yeah, so when you watch the movie Tag, which is predominantly about, I think,

716
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,660
 using your arms.

717
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
 Using your own tag.

718
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,660
 Yeah, they're not his arms.

719
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
 They're CGI arms.

720
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,660
 You're saying he was running around with two broken arms in casts?

721
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,660
 Yeah, he was in cast.

722
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,660
 Does that mean technically he's still it?

723
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
 Because he has a tag.

724
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
 [LAUGHTER]

725
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,660
 It's also a really confusing conversation tabloid.

726
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,660
 We're going to recast his arms because he's been broken.

727
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
 [LAUGHTER]

728
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,660
 Get the casting director in here.

729
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,660
 [LAUGHTER]

730
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660
 Very good.

731
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,660
 It's one of this town's naming thing.

732
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,660
 Yeah.

733
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,660
 It's a huge trope of how towns get their name.

734
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,660
 So there's a town in Tennessee, which is called Difficult.

735
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,660
 And it all happens when they write to the post office saying, can we have this particular name?

736
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,660
 And supposedly when they applied for the name, which was a really complicated name,

737
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,660
 they wanted to name the town.

738
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,660
 The US Postal Service replied, your name is Difficult.

739
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,660
 And the people in the town thought, oh, they've just renamed our town Difficult.

740
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,660
 I never believe any of these stories.

741
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,660
 There's one in California called "Likely."

742
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,660
 And the legend is always that all the residents got together to sign the name for their new town.

743
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
 Because there's some reason they were all living there in a town with no name.

744
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,660
 And then they were like, oh, we're never going to grow in a name.

745
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,660
 And a guy went, yeah, likely.

746
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,660
 And then they were like, great name.

747
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,660
 And the same happened for town you bet.

748
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,660
 Apparently there's a guy who went, oh, you bet.

749
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,660
 And that's why the town called you bet.

750
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,660
 Diculous.

751
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,660
 I mean, all of this stuff is on the internet.

752
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,660
 And then you get more original stories.

753
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,660
 Yeah.

754
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,660
 Ding dong Texas.

755
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
 Do you know that?

756
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
 [LAUGHTER]

757
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,660
 Ding dong Texas.

758
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,660
 We did somebody ring the bell just as they were.

759
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,660
 [LAUGHTER]

760
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,660
 No, it was named after for Governor Peter Bell.

761
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,660
 And the businessman, Zulis Bell, and his nephew, Bert.

762
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,660
 But Zulis and Bert were not in any way related to Peter.

763
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,660
 So yeah, it was called Ding dong as a reference.

764
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,660
 And weirdly, it's in Central Texas' Bell County.

765
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,660
 Oh, that's good.

766
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
 Oh, that's good.

767
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,660
 I thought it might have been named after Leslie Phillips.

768
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
 Oh, yeah.

769
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,660
 Ding dong.

770
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,660
 Yeah.

771
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
 Blast the purse.

772
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,660
 And there's only one place in Earth that I've found,

773
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,660
 which is called Earth.

774
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,660
 OK.

775
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,660
 It's in Texas.

776
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
 That's good.

777
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,660
 And there are various reasons as to why, as always,

778
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,660
 somebody suggested it because they have a lot of Earth there.

779
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,660
 But there's a really good article about it online,

780
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,660
 which points out there are at least two other places in America

781
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
 named after every single other planet.

782
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,660
 There's Venus and Mercury and Jupiter.

783
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,660
 There are Saturn's guess which planet.

784
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,660
 There are not two places named after.

785
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,660
 Mercury.

786
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,660
 It's Uranus.

787
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,660
 There is one place, but it's more of a tourist attraction than the town.

788
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,660
 It's a little tourist attraction, which contains the Uranus Brewing Company,

789
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,660
 Combat Uranus.

790
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,660
 There's a guy who calls himself the Mayor of Uranus.

791
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,660
 They sell Fudge, which has a label on it saying Uranus Fudge.

792
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,660
 That's great.

793
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,660
 There's a place called Nitro, which is named after the Explosive Powder,

794
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,660
 which was made there in the First World War.

795
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
 That's so cool.

796
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,660
 That seems like a proper etymology.

797
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,660
 There's a place in Russia called Asbestos,

798
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,660
 where a friend of mine was born.

799
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
 Wow.

800
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,660
 And it's where they make all the Asbestos and send it to America.

801
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
 Very cool.

802
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,660
 I don't know how well this is known in Britain,

803
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,660
 but in the UK, there was a place that had its name changed.

804
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,660
 Stains.

805
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
 Well, there's still a place called Stains.

806
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
 Well, technically not just Stains.

807
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,660
 It's now called Stains upon Thames.

808
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,660
 It's not much better, is it?

809
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,660
 I remember this.

810
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
 I remember when they tried to do this.

811
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
 Yeah.

812
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,660
 So the reason that they did this is because

813
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,660
 AlleyG internationally had given Stains.

814
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,660
 The Stains massive.

815
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
 Exactly.

816
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
 Such a bad name that they were always associated.

817
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,660
 I remember watching AlleyG in Australia

818
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,660
 and thinking, oh, Stains must be...

819
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
 I could see there was laughter,

820
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,660
 but you just associated it sort of as this place where...

821
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,660
 Stains is quite nice.

822
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
 Yes.

823
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,660
 That's the guy.

824
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,660
 That's the guy.

825
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,660
 Yeah.

826
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,660
 So they wanted to change it, but they didn't really change it.

827
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
 They just added an extra belt on the end.

828
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
 Yeah, exactly.

829
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
 So on the 15th of December, 2011,

830
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,660
 the Spellthorn borough council resolved by 25 votes to four

831
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,660
 to change the name of the town to Stains upon Thames

832
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,660
 to try and boost the local economy

833
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,660
 by promoting its Riverside location.

834
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,660
 I'm quoting directly from the Wikipedia article

835
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,660
 that I found this on.

836
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,660
 I wonder if there's a calculation for how much adding upon Thames

837
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
 adds to a town's net worth as it were.

838
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,660
 As in, Richmond upon Thames is quite sort of...

839
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
 Yeah.

840
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
 Or upon any river.

841
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
 I do sort of like Stains with waitros,

842
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
 and that would probably help because...

843
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
 Yes, Stains upon the waitros.

844
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
 Yeah.

845
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
 Yeah.

846
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
 And...

847
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
 My uncle, when he was a counsellor in Bolton,

848
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,660
 tried to change the name of Bolton to Bolton Lemours.

849
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,660
 Did you think?

850
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,660
 Yeah, because there are lots of other places called Bolton in the world

851
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,660
 and he thought it would distinguish our town from the other ones

852
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,660
 and also we're on the Moors as in...

853
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,660
 That's where all the fires were from.

854
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
 Funny he was trying to bolt home an extra bit to the name.

855
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
 Very good.

856
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
 Was he successful?

857
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
 No, it's still called Bolton.

858
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,660
 Surely Bolton is the most famous Bolton...

859
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
 I don't mean any disrespect to other Bolton's in the world,

860
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
 but...

861
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
 I am Michael.

862
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,660
 Famously people are always getting confused with the town.

863
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,660
 And Mr. Eggton mailed from the entire town

864
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,660
 to his house every day.

865
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,660
 There's a city...

866
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,660
 Topeka?

867
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
 Topeka, so it's in Kansas.

868
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
 And it's the capital of the state.

869
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
 It's no one...

870
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,660
 It's no slouch.

871
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
 It's no slouch.

872
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,660
 It's no slouch.

873
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,660
 But it changed its name to Google for a month.

874
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
 Did it?

875
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,660
 Legally and officially...

876
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,660
 It's a peek at it.

877
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
 Yeah.

878
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,660
 And it was to win a Google high speed internet project

879
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,660
 which would have given everyone internet 100 times faster than the national average.

880
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,660
 At the time.

881
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,660
 No one would ever be able to search for them online.

882
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,660
 They would break the internet if you Google Google.

883
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
 Well, it didn't work.

884
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,660
 The Google went with Kansas City, Kansas instead.

885
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
 But the mayor, he said, he didn't really mind not winning.

886
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
 And he said, I've often wondered what difference does it make.

887
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,660
 If it takes you 10 seconds or one second to access information,

888
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
 my life goes a little slower than that.

889
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
 Oh.

890
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,660
 Yeah, it's a very laid back guy.

891
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
 But there's not the first time they've changed the name.

892
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
 In 1998, Topeka changed its name.

893
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
 And one of you will really like this fact.

894
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
 They've changed it to...

895
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
 Topeka Chu.

896
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,660
 He's a Pokemon arrived in the USA.

897
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,660
 Yeah.

898
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,660
 On Modesto.

899
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,660
 Yeah.

900
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,660
 It's the second unhappiest city in the United States of America.

901
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
 What?

902
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,660
 Yeah.

903
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,660
 Wow.

904
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,660
 The city's motto is water wealth contentment health.

905
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,660
 And that was selected in a contest in 1911,

906
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
 where the winner won three dollars as a prize.

907
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,660
 Oh.

908
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
 Yeah.

909
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,660
 And just to say, Ralston wasn't just this local banker.

910
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
 All the men who the town was not named after.

911
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
 Exactly.

912
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
 Ralston was...

913
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,660
 He was one of the most rich people in California, actually.

914
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,660
 And he founded the Bank of California.

915
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,660
 So he was a very important guy in his day.

916
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,660
 Well, he didn't like to talk about it.

917
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,660
 I really had to dig deep to find that.

918
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,660
 There's a town in California called Secret Town.

919
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
 Is that...

920
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,660
 And why is it called that, do we know?

921
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
 I can't tell you that.

922
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,660
 I genuinely know nothing about it.

923
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,660
 There's nothing in the Wikipedia page.

924
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,660
 That's too long we can feed the page off.

925
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,660
 That's it.

926
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,660
 Okay, that's it.

927
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,660
 That is all of our facts.

928
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,660
 Thank you so much for listening.

929
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,660
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

930
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,660
 about the things that we have said over the course of this podcast,

931
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

932
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,660
 I'm on @Sriberland.

933
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
 Andy.

934
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
 At Andrew Hunter M.

935
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
 James.

936
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
 At James Harkin.

937
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,660
 And Alex.

938
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,660
 At Alex Bell.

939
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,660
 That's right.

940
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,660
 And you can also go to our group account.

941
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,660
 And you can go to our Facebook page.

942
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
 No such thing as a fish or a website.

943
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
 No such thing as a fish.com.

944
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,660
 We have everything up there from our previous episodes

945
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,660
 to links to our upcoming live shows, to our books.

946
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,660
 We've got a new book coming out, which you can probably pre-order at this point.

947
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,660
 We also have our great documentary series that we put up on iTunes called Behind the Gills.

948
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,660
 It's on a few other platforms.

949
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,660
 There'll be a link there.

950
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,660
 Follows us around on our last tour of the UK.

951
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,660
 You should get it in America, can't you?

952
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,660
 Yeah, it's in America now as well, which is very exciting.

953
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,660
 If you're in Modesto, you can probably download it.

954
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,660
 No.

955
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,660
 We'll be back again next week.

956
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,660
 We'll see you then.

957
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,660
 Goodbye.

958
