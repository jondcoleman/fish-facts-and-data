1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 - We run it on QI a few years ago. - Yeah.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,400
 - Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,680
 - It ended up not such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,280
 - No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,080
 of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,520
 He says it right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,760
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,340
 (upbeat music)

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:27,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,240
 of no such thing as a fish,

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,280
 a weekly QI podcast coming to you

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,360
 from our offices in Coverns Garden.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,080
 and the three other elves joining me today

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,280
 are James Harkin, Energy Zenski, and Annie Murray.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,120
 Once again, we're gathering around the microphone

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,320
 and we're gonna share with each other

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,920
 our favorite facts from the last seven days.

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,680
 So, in no particular order,

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,520
 we're the best things we found out this week.

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,000
 (upbeat music)

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,200
 James, we're gonna start with you, fact number one.

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,600
 - Okay, my fact this week is,

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,760
 if the new Godzilla existed,

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,920
 it would produce 12.9 million gallons of urine a day.

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,360
 That's more urine than the Exxon Valdez spilled oil.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,920
 - How many times does Godzilla go a day?

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,560
 That's not one bash, is it?

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,640
 - Well, some animals go all the time,

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,040
 like voles, I think, just urinate the whole time.

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
 - Really? They're just consistently urinating?

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,000
 - Well, actually, you're consistently urinating,

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,680
 but it's, your kidneys trickle out

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,360
 a milliliter of urine every minute,

35
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,120
 but obviously you can store it in your bladder,

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,080
 but voles, I'm pretty sure they just always let it go.

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
 And birds of prey can sometimes see these tracks of urine,

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,960
 and that's what helps them find the voles.

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,000
 - Ah, 'cause they're just constantly living,

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,320
 leaving a piss trail, basically.

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,640
 - Yeah, what's weird though, right?

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,920
 Is that if Godzilla were, if the new Godzilla were real,

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,840
 he would take the same amount of time to urinate

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,360
 as the rest of us do, right?

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,560
 Because hasn't new research shown that all animals

46
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,680
 take roughly the same amount of time to wee?

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,520
 - To wee? - To wee?

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,280
 21 seconds, I think, on average?

49
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,440
 - It's all mammals over a certain size, I think.

50
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,080
 So I'm not sure that Godzilla is a mammal.

51
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,760
 - Did someone find out that most dogs urinate

52
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,440
 in the same direction that they face North,

53
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
 or they face North West?

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
 - Is that true?

55
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,080
 - Well, is it true?

56
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,480
 That's a good question.

57
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,960
 I think it was dogs defecating,

58
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,080
 according to the Earth's magnetic field,

59
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,160
 if I remember the study correctly.

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,440
 I didn't look into it into too much detail to see

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,240
 how true it is, but yeah, it was definitely claimed.

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,800
 - There is an article online saying that,

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,600
 this is the headline, dogs have a butt compass,

64
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,400
 which is the most unpleasant phrase I've heard for a long time.

65
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,880
 - Yeah, less convenient to carry around than a compass as well.

66
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
 - Yeah.

67
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,560
 (laughing)

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,320
 - But it would be convenient if you were lost with your dog.

69
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
 - With your dog?

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
 - Absolutely.

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,240
 If you were, for example, going to the North Pole

72
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,640
 and you lost your compass, it's a featureless environment.

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,800
 You just have to look at the dogs and think,

74
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,240
 "But Rover has taken a piss in that direction."

75
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,440
 - It's true, and if you had like five or six dogs

76
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,400
 and they all started peeing,

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
 but they were all facing nozzle to nozzle,

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,600
 in a big circle, it means you're exactly in the North Pole.

79
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
 - Fantastic.

80
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,680
 - So we agreed that Godzilla definitely isn't a mammal.

81
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,640
 - Originally Godzilla, the initial idea for Godzilla

82
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,880
 that it was half gorilla half whale.

83
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,280
 And that's where the word Godzilla comes from.

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
 Godzilla is a combination.

85
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,080
 And that's where the name, it's the two words

86
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,000
 smashed together, gorilla whale.

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
 When they actually made the movie,

88
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,680
 they did make it into a reptile dinosaur prehistoric sort of monster.

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,960
 - Well, one of the guys wanted it to be a giant octopus

90
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,680
 called Udaco, which is very close to Okado,

91
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,560
 which would have been good.

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,520
 - Okay, and what was it used in?

93
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,400
 Was it used in a Godzilla versus?

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,360
 - No, it was used to deliver groceries.

95
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,720
 (laughing)

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,440
 - In the 1954 one, which is the original?

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
 - Yeah, the sound of Godzilla roaring was made

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,120
 by rubbing a leather glove up and down a double base strings.

99
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
 - Wow.

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
 - Yeah, that's strange.

101
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
 I really like low-fi solutions to problems.

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,960
 So in Jurassic Park, the sound was, I think,

103
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,120
 tortoises mating.

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
 - Yeah.

105
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,600
 - The new Godzilla was massive, isn't it?

106
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,520
 Like much bigger than the old Godzilla's.

107
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,600
 - Okay, I think that's interesting.

108
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,200
 The scaling up that happens over the years.

109
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
 The bigger and bigger.

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,240
 - The website where I found how much urine they produce

111
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,200
 was deepcnews.com, and it was a postbag I called Dr. M.

112
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,080
 I don't know what his real name was.

113
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,160
 And he, as well as working out the urine,

114
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,640
 he also worked out how much bigger it's gotten

115
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,480
 in the last 50 years.

116
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,440
 And the 1954 Godzilla was 50 meters tall,

117
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,600
 but the new Godzilla is about 150 meters tall.

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,920
 And his idea, his theory is that the reason

119
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,520
 that it's gotten bigger is because skyscrapers

120
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,800
 have gotten bigger, and the Godzilla has to be big enough

121
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
 to crush the skyscrapers.

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,280
 - That's very interesting.

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,440
 - Yeah.

124
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,280
 - That's adapting.

125
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,120
 It's evolution.

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,280
 It's very fast evolution.

127
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
 - Well, it could be evolution.

128
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,760
 It could be sexual selection.

129
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,640
 So the Lady Godzilla's like male Godzilla's

130
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,560
 who can crush buildings, and so they have to get bigger.

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,160
 - So that's suggesting that there is a Lady Godzilla?

132
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,480
 - Or that this one isn't a Lady.

133
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,080
 I think that in Japanese, they just call it it.

134
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,640
 They don't say it's male or further.

135
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,600
 - So we've never known if it was a male or female.

136
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,520
 - Not to my knowledge.

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,960
 - I just think there's a general inflation

138
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,040
 that goes on with the next film,

139
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,680
 you have to have something even bigger.

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,240
 And it's just run away in a way.

141
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,000
 - This guy works it out, that it's getting bigger

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,320
 on a logarithmic scale.

143
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,000
 And he said if they do another one in 2050,

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,760
 then the Godzilla will be 288.4 meters tall.

145
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,520
 - Do you guys know what Godzilla breathes out of his mouth?

146
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,520
 - Yeah, doesn't he breathe like nuclear clouds?

147
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
 - It's atomic breath.

148
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,360
 - Atomic breath.

149
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
 - That's Godzilla.

150
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,040
 It's not fire.

151
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,680
 I thought it was fire, certainly.

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800
 - You think everything is fire.

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,680
 You think the sun is fire then?

154
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,000
 - I don't believe that that is.

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,840
 - I'd like to back down up.

156
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,120
 I also still think the sun is on fire.

157
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,000
 - But yeah, wasn't Godzilla initially

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,720
 a sort of comment on Hiroshima Nagasaki?

159
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,000
 That was why it was had all these nuclear content.

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,840
 - It was.

161
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,920
 - It's interesting that the way Godzilla is defeated,

162
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,320
 certainly in the last film, is with military weapons.

163
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,080
 Whereas the whole point of Godzilla is it's a metaphor

164
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
 for nuclear bombs, you know, the most devastating weapons

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,840
 we can come up with.

166
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,480
 So it's kind of missing the point if you just attack him

167
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,840
 with weapons capable of dealing with it.

168
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,600
 - So we should have beaten him with like a peace treaty?

169
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
 - Yeah, or is it like in the world of the world's way,

170
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,560
 the aliens catch the common cold?

171
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,720
 - Do you think Godzilla would have been as popular amongst

172
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,440
 like 10 to 15 year old boys?

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
 If the second half of the film had been like a potstamp

174
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,120
 around the table, peace treaty.

175
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,520
 (laughing)

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,760
 - Oh, just a lot of people tried to sneeze on him.

177
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,920
 (laughing)

178
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,640
 - Sorry, can you repeat your last amount?

179
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,400
 (laughing)

180
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,120
 - So what I really like about your fact, James,

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,480
 which I know you enjoy doing, and I like doing as well,

182
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,040
 is the fact that when you get like an original fact

183
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,960
 and you work it out and it reminded me of,

184
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,720
 when I think you found in one, three, three, nine facts

185
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,920
 to make your jaw drop, which is that the Statue of Liberty

186
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,440
 wears size 879 shoes.

187
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,440
 So I have worked out the shoe size of Godzilla.

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,280
 - Have you?

189
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,720
 - You know, it's the 50 meter Godzilla,

190
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,880
 so it's the original.

191
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,160
 So he wears UK size 1,680 shoes, which sounds weird,

192
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,480
 'cause he's only a little bit taller.

193
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,440
 In fact, the 50 meter is smaller than the Statue of Liberty,

194
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,640
 but he has bigger feet, so there was a press release

195
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,920
 at the time which gave the measurement of his feet.

196
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,120
 - Did you say 1,680?

197
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
 - 1,680.

198
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,680
 - So a US size that's 1,679.

199
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
 (laughing)

200
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,440
 - Yep.

201
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,360
 - It's a part to get them started out.

202
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,200
 - Because the new Godzilla is quite a lot bigger

203
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,280
 than the other one, a lot of Japanese super fans

204
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,320
 are really upset that the Americans have just made him fat.

205
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,360
 - So Godzilla's overweight, that's a problem?

206
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,960
 - They're saying like it's fat from the neck downwards

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,360
 and massive at the bottom.

208
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,440
 This is what Godzilla's super fan,

209
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,360
 Fumiko Abe, told the AFP at a Tokyo exhibition.

210
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,600
 But then they had the premiere, I think,

211
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,120
 a couple of weeks ago, and Gareth Edwards,

212
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
 who we have met, who was--

213
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,560
 - Gareth Edwards came, so the director of the latest

214
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,440
 Godzilla movie was on museumicuriosity, our radio show.

215
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,120
 He told us at the time that he was gonna be doing Godzilla,

216
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,280
 but it wasn't announced.

217
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,120
 - Oh, did he?

218
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't remember that.

219
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,400
 - Very exciting.

220
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,320
 - But they asked him at the premiere,

221
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,960
 what he thought about these Japanese people

222
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,200
 saying that Godzilla had got very fat.

223
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,640
 And he said, I just think it's comments like that

224
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,920
 that give giant monsters an image complex.

225
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,600
 (laughing)

226
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
 He's such a great combat.

227
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
 - Yeah.

228
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,920
 - Okay, let's move on to fact number two,

229
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,280
 and that one's yours, Annette.

230
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,200
 - Yeah, this is one of my favorite things I ever found.

231
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,240
 It's that the real Long John Silver from Treasure Island

232
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,360
 was father to the real Wendy Darling from Peter Pan.

233
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,680
 - The real Long John Silver.

234
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,480
 - The guy on whom Long John Silver is based,

235
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,880
 a guy called William Ernest Henley,

236
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
 who was a poet and he wrote the poem "Invictus"

237
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,760
 by far the most famous thing he did.

238
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,880
 - Was that Nelson Mandela's favorite one?

239
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,720
 - Yes.

240
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
 - And Barack Obama quoted it, didn't he?

241
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,240
 The last verse of it is funeral.

242
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,040
 - Mandela supposedly read it in prison to everyone,

243
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,080
 and that got them all kind of, you know,

244
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
 staying positive.

245
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,200
 - It's a fantastic poem.

246
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,600
 - So that's his most famous poem, this guy.

247
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,440
 - Yes, which just, I don't know if this will ever go in,

248
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,600
 but I do really like the last verse, which is,

249
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,560
 it matters not how straight to the gate,

250
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
 how charged with punishments, the scroll,

251
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,120
 I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,360
 It is a great poem.

253
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,800
 - So that was the poem written by the man

254
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,080
 who Long John Silver was based on?

255
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,920
 - Yeah, that's right.

256
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,600
 So he was this like full of life guy, had only one leg,

257
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,680
 and Robert Louis Stevenson just thought he was this great guy,

258
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,920
 wrote him a letter after writing Treasure Island saying,

259
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,560
 "I've got to be honest with you, I based Long John Silver on you

260
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,040
 "because I find you, you know, such an incredible chap."

261
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,280
 Does anyone read Treasure Island?

262
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,120
 - Yes, I have.

263
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
 - It's extraordinary that we've read it at all,

264
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,960
 because for a long time, no one read his books.

265
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,560
 Robert Louis Stevenson was seen as just a terrible author.

266
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,960
 To the point that when, when in 1973,

267
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,720
 they published a 2,000 page Oxford anthology

268
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,640
 of English literature, he wasn't mentioned in it at all.

269
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,280
 And now he's one of the 26 most translated authors

270
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,840
 in the world above Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde,

271
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,160
 but for a long time, no one read him.

272
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,400
 - I don't know much about him.

273
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,320
 I know he died on Samoa.

274
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,200
 - Yes, he's on their postage stamps.

275
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,880
 - And he drank a lot of Guinness.

276
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,960
 It's the only other thing I know about Robert Louis Stevenson.

277
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,520
 - Right, Samoa, he had it shipped out to him.

278
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,840
 - Wow, that's a long way to ship out Guinness.

279
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,120
 I remember I tried to find the furthest Irish pub

280
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,120
 from Dublin, and I reckon it's Waxio Shays in New Zealand.

281
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,400
 - So even from there, it's a long way to Samoa.

282
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,480
 - Yep, it must be strange to having somebody based on you.

283
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,640
 Years ago, I received a guy called Lord Berners,

284
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,040
 who was an early 20th century aristocrat and eccentric.

285
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,520
 He built one of the last follies in Britain.

286
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,760
 You know, those towers that go nowhere and are completely pointless.

287
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,080
 He built one of those, and then he put it at the bottom of science

288
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,400
 saying members of the public committing suicide off this tower

289
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,880
 do so at their own risk.

290
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
 He was a very, very funny guy.

291
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,600
 But he wrote a novel in which he based all of the characters

292
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
 on his friends, but he also cast it as a lesbian schoolgirl story.

293
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,240
 And one of the characters in it, Sitwell, was so angry

294
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,520
 that he tried to buy every copy of this book

295
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,280
 in circulation to destroy it.

296
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,520
 - That's a really good way to get good sales, isn't it?

297
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,320
 - Yeah, pretty much.

298
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,720
 - Isn't that what you have for Titchcock did

299
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
 when he released, I think it was Psycho.

300
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
 He bought up as many copies of the novel Psycho as he possibly could

301
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,520
 because he didn't want the ending to be given away.

302
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,320
 Was it Psycho?

303
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
 - Yeah, was Psycho?

304
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,280
 - Yeah, you know who Psycho was based on?

305
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,960
 - Yes, it's based on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre guy.

306
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,920
 - It's based on the same guy as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

307
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,080
 It's Silence of the Lambs and Psycho

308
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,440
 they're all based on the same guy called Ed Geene.

309
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
 - Oh wow.

310
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,120
 - And he was a big famous serial killer in the world.

311
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
 - So a real gift to, you know,

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 it's Greenplay writers.

313
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
 - Yeah, exactly.

314
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,120
 - Thank you, Ed.

315
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,320
 - But the, if you look at it one way,

316
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,800
 it means there are fewer Psychos out there than you think

317
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
 if they're all based on the same one guy.

318
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,400
 - Yeah, yeah, that's true.

319
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,320
 Oh, he just had such a variety of fictional type quirks.

320
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,600
 - There must be other Psychopaths going,

321
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,880
 "Why does he get all the gifts?"

322
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,720
 - Yeah.

323
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,160
 - I'm doing some great killings.

324
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,480
 - And yet, has he won a single Oscar?

325
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,320
 - No.

326
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,960
 - Yeah, another example of the Academy getting it known.

327
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,600
 - Well, Silence of the Lambs won best picture.

328
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,120
 - But he did, my point is, was he invited to the ceremony?

329
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
 - What are you wearing today, Ed?

330
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,240
 - Fine, wearing my mother.

331
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,280
 (laughing)

332
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,080
 - The nipples of all my victims in a belt?

333
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,440
 - In a, on a lighter note.

334
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,680
 (laughing)

335
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,080
 - Yeah, just to take us away from nipple wearing.

336
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
 When I was looking into Long John Silver,

337
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,040
 I found a porn star, here has a similar name.

338
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,760
 - When you were looking into Long John Silver.

339
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,800
 So his name's Long Dong Silver.

340
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,920
 And Long Dong Silver, he's a retired porn star now.

341
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,240
 But he was famed, obviously,

342
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,920
 for the apparent size of his penis,

343
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,880
 which, it turned out that he was using fake penis

344
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,040
 during the shoots, which no one really knew about.

345
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,320
 He persuaded a makeup artist who did the makeup

346
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,960
 for the film "The Elephant Man" to create a prosthetic.

347
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,880
 - I wonder if they felt, well, you know,

348
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,120
 we've got a trunk, yeah.

349
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
 (laughing)

350
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,120
 Actually, the elephant I didn't have a trunk.

351
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,400
 - No, no, no, that would have been the makeup artist going.

352
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,720
 I've done the trunk, and they go,

353
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,920
 no, he's not physically an elephant man.

354
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,080
 What am I going to do with this trunk?

355
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,840
 (laughing)

356
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,480
 - Do you think I should quickly explain

357
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,880
 the Wendy connection?

358
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,720
 - Yes, yes.

359
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,280
 - So we don't, when he met on his Henry,

360
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
 was the father to Margaret Henley,

361
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,520
 who was one of the girls who Jay and Barry.

362
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,880
 So he loved playing with children.

363
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,480
 He was always, he loved spending time with children.

364
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,560
 And he used to hang out in Kensington Gardens

365
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,320
 and entertain the kids and tell them stories.

366
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,720
 And Margaret Henley was one of the girls

367
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,080
 who used to hang out there with him.

368
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,680
 And she was the person who called him Wendy.

369
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
 Wasn't she?

370
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,360
 - Wendy Wendy.

371
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,560
 - Wendy Wendy, which is where,

372
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,360
 we think he got the name Wendy for Peter Pan.

373
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
 - Was it right that Wendy was not a name before he came up?

374
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,720
 - It was a very popular name at all,

375
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,640
 but there are some examples before him.

376
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,000
 - The original title of the novel,

377
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,760
 which Peter Pan first appeared in,

378
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
 was going to be the boy who hated mothers.

379
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,760
 - It was pretty dark.

380
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,240
 - Oh, yeah, it is.

381
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,040
 - And Jay and Barry was nicknamed the furry beast

382
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,240
 by his friends.

383
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,080
 - Yeah.

384
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,920
 - Yeah.

385
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,640
 - He was very, very short and very hersute.

386
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,720
 - He also loved to play cricket, right?

387
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,560
 - Yeah.

388
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,400
 - And this is extraordinary.

389
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,240
 His cricket team.

390
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,080
 Have you seen his cricket team?

391
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,920
 - The Alahackbury.

392
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,040
 - Yeah, the people on it.

393
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,880
 This was his team.

394
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,120
 H.G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Conan Doyle,

395
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,400
 PG Woodhouse, Jerome K. Jerome, G.K. Chesterton, A.A. Milne,

396
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,240
 and others.

397
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,760
 - This is his cricket team and others.

398
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
 - And there's plenty more very famous.

399
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,400
 - Yeah, they're so many.

400
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,840
 - But the thing is, they were a terrible team,

401
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,040
 and he printed a book of advice for them,

402
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,440
 which had little tips.

403
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,040
 It was in 1893.

404
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,240
 Like, don't practice on an opponent's ground

405
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,320
 before the match begins.

406
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,080
 This can only give them confidence.

407
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,920
 (laughing)

408
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,240
 Or, should you hit the ball, run it once,

409
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,880
 do not stop to cheer.

410
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
 (laughing)

411
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,480
 (upbeat music)

412
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,080
 (upbeat music)

413
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,680
 - Okay, time to move on to fact number three,

414
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,920
 and that is, I believe, my facts.

415
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
 My fact this week is that the tinfoil hats

416
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,480
 that conspiracy theorists wear in order to stop the government

417
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,040
 from sending messages into their brain

418
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,000
 actually does the opposite.

419
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,640
 It amplifies the signal.

420
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,480
 Almost to the point that if there were a thousand people

421
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,440
 in a crowd and they were the one with the tinfoil hat,

422
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,320
 that's the only brain that would actually get

423
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,160
 the brain messages.

424
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,240
 It's like a huge antenna that they're wearing.

425
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,080
 - I don't even know that.

426
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,040
 - Well, it was a study by a bunch of students in the America

427
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,760
 who just wanted to look into the myth, I guess,

428
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,000
 because people were doing it.

429
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 No one had actually checked it out before.

430
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,520
 And obviously, we don't know how to send messages

431
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,280
 into people's brains or take them out.

432
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,160
 As far as I know, James is shaking your head as if we do.

433
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,720
 - We don't, yeah, but they're working on it.

434
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,960
 There's been studies done in the last couple of years

435
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,280
 where people have thought about a word

436
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,400
 and people have been able to work out what word

437
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,120
 they were thinking about by measuring their brainwaves.

438
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,240
 But they would work if they were made properly, right?

439
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
 So they are meant to be a Faraday cage

440
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,360
 which stops electricity passing through it.

441
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,320
 - If it fully covered the head and properly tightly fitted it,

442
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,840
 then electromagnetic radiation could not get in.

443
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,880
 But as it is, if it's worn loosely or designed,

444
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,480
 it's sort of just a skull cap, then it gets in.

445
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,800
 But I love the idea that you would make one

446
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,080
 that was so good that the government couldn't get in,

447
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,440
 but also then you would immediately asphyxiate.

448
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,640
 (all laughing)

449
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,080
 - You guys know that the Vatican used a Faraday cage

450
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,440
 in 2013 to shield the cysteine chapel from its chopping.

451
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,280
 So no one could hear who they were electing as Pope

452
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,360
 because there was, I think in 2003 was it a Pope

453
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,600
 before that was elected.

454
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 It was thought there was a leak in Germany.

455
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,320
 And so they put a Faraday cage in the Vatican.

456
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 - Wow, massive tin foil cardinals.

457
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,160
 - Cardinals.

458
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,920
 (all laughing)

459
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,760
 - That's great.

460
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,680
 Have you guys heard of stealthware?

461
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,040
 This is a company who make clothes

462
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,640
 that make the wearers invisible to infrared surveillance cameras,

463
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,560
 particularly those on drones.

464
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,320
 So the idea is that you wear these clothes

465
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
 and drones can't see you and it's supposed to be make you safe.

466
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,880
 Say you were being infiltrated by the American government

467
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,040
 who were looking at you with drones,

468
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,320
 they won't be able to see you anymore.

469
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,880
 They make hoodies, they make full length burgers

470
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,280
 in this kind of material.

471
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,720
 The burger goes for $2,300.

472
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,520
 The hoodie is $481.

473
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,120
 But unfortunately due to the high cost

474
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,280
 and limited availability, so far they've only

475
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,120
 sold one item a scarf.

476
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,240
 (all laughing)

477
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,200
 - I know where we should put all the secrets in my neck.

478
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,560
 (all laughing)

479
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,400
 - It's all of them, but not completely.

480
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,760
 - Speaking of hats, useful hats.

481
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,600
 The following quote is from radiologist Richard Gerstle's

482
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,480
 1950 book How to Survive an Atomic Bomb.

483
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,240
 He said, "If you are caught outdoors in a sudden attack,

484
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,600
 "a hat will give you at least some protection

485
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,760
 "from the heat flash."

486
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,640
 (all laughing)

487
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
 When I say some...

488
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,560
 - That's true, you probably could mathematically calculate

489
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,480
 how much it gives you.

490
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,120
 It's just that it won't...

491
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,080
 - It will, by no means save your life under any circumstances.

492
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,920
 - This is amazing.

493
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,080
 No army at the start of the First World War,

494
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,040
 okay, this order's metal helmets.

495
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,320
 It took until 1915 and thousands and thousands of deaths

496
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,640
 before they said, you know.

497
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,920
 The German army had a leather,

498
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,040
 just a little leather cap's called a pickle helmet.

499
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,640
 Not until 1950, and people start making these helmets.

500
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,440
 And we have the image of the helmet from the First World War,

501
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,760
 the kind of shallow, again,

502
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,600
 innovated for the First World War.

503
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,080
 - Francis Galton, who was, I believe,

504
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,600
 a relative of Charles Darwin, he invented a hat, didn't he?

505
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,040
 Yeah, it was a hat that had an air conditioning device in it,

506
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,640
 or a little flap that opened the top,

507
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
 because it was the idea that if you thought too much

508
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,800
 about stuff, your head overheated.

509
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,720
 - It doesn't mean my hair is always sinking.

510
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
 (all laughing)

511
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
 Weird hats, you mentioned.

512
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
 When was it dangerous to wear a hat?

513
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,760
 Why am I phrasing this like a cute question?

514
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
 'Cause I reckon that you'll get it changed, wasn't it?

515
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,600
 - When was it dangerous?

516
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,400
 - In stockpot, you used to be attacked

517
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,680
 if you weren't wearing a hat,

518
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,680
 because they had the hat industry was quite big there,

519
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,400
 and they thought it was unpatriotic to the town,

520
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
 if you weren't actually attacked.

521
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,000
 - Yeah, by verbally or in principle.

522
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,720
 - Well, people throw things at you.

523
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,560
 - Wow.

524
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,000
 - But not as mean as the straw hat riots.

525
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,600
 So in the early 20th century, in New York,

526
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
 past September the 15th,

527
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,880
 it was socially unacceptable to wear a straw hat.

528
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,440
 It was a summer item.

529
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,800
 And if you wore a straw hat,

530
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,840
 past September the 15th,

531
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,800
 then it was traditional for youths to come along

532
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,720
 and knock your hat off your head and trample on it.

533
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,400
 And in 1922, it got out of hand.

534
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,920
 So the straw hat rioters decided to start

535
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,320
 knocking people's hats off their head a bit early,

536
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,840
 and I think they approached a bunch of dog workers

537
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,200
 who were wearing straw hats on September the 13th,

538
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
 not the hats off, trampled them, started a fight,

539
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
 huge fight riot lasted three days,

540
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,680
 bunch of people ended up in hospital, disaster.

541
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,080
 And in 1924, a guy was murdered for wearing a straw hat

542
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,160
 after September the 15th.

543
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,080
 So it was a dangerous business actually.

544
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,880
 - Three days of fighting.

545
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,800
 - Three days of riots, the straw hat riots.

546
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,640
 - One last thing on conspiracy theories.

547
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,480
 - Okay.

548
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,040
 - I like the randomness of them,

549
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,360
 because they're often so connected,

550
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,640
 but often they also have very strange outputs.

551
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,240
 So I found a list of conspiracy theories online,

552
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 and this was 16 conspiracy theories

553
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,720
 that have been proved to be true.

554
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,200
 Some day scientists will use millions

555
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,600
 of genetically modified animals in experiments.

556
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,200
 Scientists all over the world are creating

557
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,160
 bizarre human animal hybrids.

558
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
 Obama is making government employees

559
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,200
 spy on one another and pro-wrestling is fake.

560
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,040
 (laughing)

561
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,800
 - That's not the seven on this list.

562
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,080
 (laughing)

563
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,920
 - Should we move on?

564
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,960
 - Sorry, sorry, sorry, we were brothers and sisters

565
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,000
 before, literally brothers and sisters

566
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,040
 in family connections.

567
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,960
 The guy who came up with the first ever tin hat

568
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,240
 was Julian Huxley, who was the brother

569
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
 of all the Huxley.

570
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,280
 - No!

571
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,840
 - Yeah, it was in a short story called The Tissue Culture King,

572
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,480
 about a scientist who is lost in a jungle kingdom,

573
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
 and he offers to culture the king's flesh

574
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,800
 so the subjects can worship him in their home.

575
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,280
 And then this allows the king to exert telepathic power

576
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,600
 over the entire kingdom.

577
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,160
 And in that story, he says we used caps of metal foil,

578
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,960
 which reduced the effect on ourselves,

579
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,000
 but it started as a fiction in a short story.

580
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,840
 - Yeah.

581
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,680
 - That is great.

582
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,260
 (upbeat music)

583
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,960
 (upbeat music)

584
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,380
 - Okay, moving on to our final fact of the show,

585
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,220
 and that is Andy.

586
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,700
 - My fact is that geese sometimes fly upside down,

587
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,340
 to lose height quickly when they're coming into land,

588
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,260
 rather than doing a long, slow descent.

589
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,900
 They just, it's like a shortcut for them, like a life hack.

590
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,900
 - But the best thing is, they flip their body upside down,

591
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,260
 but their head and neck stay the right way up.

592
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,820
 - So they do a twist, so that it just looks weird.

593
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,820
 - It looks really bizarre.

594
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,780
 - You see the neck and the head are perfect, you know?

595
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,940
 And then they've got this weird upside down body

596
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,300
 flapping away beneath them.

597
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,140
 - Frankie.

598
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,900
 - Yeah, and this is called whiffling.

599
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,340
 - So great.

600
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,740
 - I know geese, the only animal to do that?

601
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,340
 - I think there are a few others which do it.

602
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
 - The description I read is that it looks like

603
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,940
 they're a falling leap, but they're not mine.

604
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,460
 - Yeah, there's good footage, which we can put up online

605
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,660
 on the podcast page.

606
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,340
 Yeah, and there are amazing photos of it

607
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,100
 being captured mid-flight, and it looks brilliant.

608
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,460
 - Yeah, so I started looking up things about flying upside down.

609
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,300
 - Oh, yeah.

610
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,340
 - The planes which are flown upside down.

611
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,940
 - There was that movie, wasn't there?

612
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,780
 - Flight.

613
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,300
 - Dental Washington, yeah, that's right.

614
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,300
 - The Robert Zermh, heck, I swear.

615
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,140
 - I got distracted.

616
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,420
 This fact should be a lot better research,

617
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,420
 but I got distracted watching a 10 minute clip from flight.

618
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,580
 - Was it the bit at the start where he crashes,

619
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,660
 he flies upside down?

620
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,940
 - Yeah, it was that.

621
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,100
 - Did you see the Boeing issued a statement

622
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,900
 after the film came out and they said,

623
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,940
 the MD80 cannot sustain inverted flight.

624
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,380
 The MD80, as with all commercial airliners,

625
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,220
 was designed to fly upright, so it was a bit, you know.

626
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,860
 - Do you remember that plane that flew under Tower Bridge?

627
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,940
 - Oh, yeah. - Remember that?

628
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,780
 - No.

629
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,380
 - Yeah, you must remember it.

630
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,340
 - I remember the Arc de Triomphe one.

631
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,180
 - Go on.

632
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,340
 - Well, in 1919, someone flew a biplane

633
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,940
 through the Arc de Triomphe, and the Arc de Triomphe is big,

634
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,260
 but it's not that big.

635
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,700
 And it was the wingspan of the plane,

636
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,780
 plus a medium meter on either side.

637
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,620
 - Wow.

638
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,100
 - It's such cool footage, and we can put that up online.

639
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
 - Yeah, let's put that up.

640
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,780
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

641
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,940
 - The guy who flew under Tower Bridge,

642
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,340
 I was talking about, this guy was called Harker Hunter,

643
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,220
 and he flew under Tower Bridge on the 5th of April, 1968.

644
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,780
 He did it as a, he flew across the Thames

645
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,460
 as a demonstration against Harold Wilson's government,

646
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,660
 and he was struck off from the RAF for it, I think.

647
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,140
 And weirdly, there was a quote from him

648
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,020
 when they asked him about it, and he said,

649
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,860
 he was flying down the Thames,

650
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,060
 and he said, until this very instant,

651
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,060
 I had absolutely no idea that, of course,

652
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,780
 Tower Bridge would be there.

653
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,300
 (laughing)

654
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,980
 - What did he think it was gonna be?

655
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,820
 I don't know.

656
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,460
 - Just going back to the animals in the air very quickly,

657
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,700
 so he's flying upside down.

658
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,180
 This is something that I've found out weeks ago,

659
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,100
 and I've mentioned it to you guys a bunch before,

660
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,260
 but we haven't said it on the podcast.

661
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,460
 It's about ladybirds.

662
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,860
 There's, I mean, this really surprised me,

663
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,500
 that recent research has shown that ladybirds,

664
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,540
 who were thought to have only flown at a height of, say,

665
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,660
 are shoulders, an average human's shoulder height,

666
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,860
 actually have been found flying at the height of 3,600 feet,

667
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,980
 and they travel as fast as 37 miles per hour,

668
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,780
 and they can go as far as 74 miles in one journey.

669
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,860
 - Do you know how they find them?

670
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,700
 - What do you mean?

671
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
 - Well, they originally found this out,

672
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,620
 'cause obviously you've got to be at that height to find one,

673
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,020
 so they sent up planes with sticky panes and saw what they got.

674
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,220
 That was very early, that was by planes.

675
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,980
 - When you try to swat a fly, you know how,

676
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,980
 you try to swat it, and you're definitely gonna get it.

677
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,660
 It looks barely conscious, and then it gets away,

678
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,300
 and you don't understand how.

679
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,260
 And apparently this is because the moment they see you coming,

680
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,260
 they do a somersault rather than just falling

681
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,220
 and that speeds up their descent.

682
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,580
 So they just drop into a somersault.

683
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
 You can sort of imagine it,

684
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,740
 and I wouldn't be able to explain the physics, maybe you would.

685
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,100
 And then they pick up the air

686
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,220
 with their wings and fly away.

687
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
 - That's so cool.

688
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,060
 - Little somersault.

689
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,660
 - Tennis rocket, that's what you need,

690
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,260
 'cause they can avoid most of the strings,

691
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,180
 but they can't avoid all of them.

692
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,020
 - Good.

693
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,660
 - Sorry to bring the helicopter down, but.

694
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,500
 - Unlike tennis balls in my experience.

695
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 (laughing)

696
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,740
 Every time I hit it, I do a little cheer,

697
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,060
 but then forget to run.

698
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,140
 (laughing)

699
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,220
 - And this might seem unrelated, but on geese.

700
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,340
 Can we go on geese?

701
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,500
 - I would almost say that's completely related.

702
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
 (laughing)

703
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,220
 - Goose grabbing was very popular as a sport,

704
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,980
 and 17th century new Amsterdam,

705
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,300
 which obviously became New York.

706
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,500
 And the way it was used smear the neck of a goose

707
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,100
 with soap or something slippery,

708
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,700
 and you hang the goose upside down,

709
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,420
 and a bunch of competitors ride towards it on horses,

710
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,940
 and the aim is to try and rip it's head off.

711
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,860
 - Oh, sorry.

712
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,780
 - Do you remember we did what used as a goose on cue?

713
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
 (laughing)

714
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,620
 - Yeah.

715
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,100
 - Remember that, we came up with loads of different things

716
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,660
 that you can use geese for.

717
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,620
 - Oh, yeah. - 'Cause they were used

718
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,860
 as guard dogs in ancient Rome and various different--

719
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
 - They were used to turn spits in the kitchen,

720
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,700
 which was grabbed the handle

721
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,020
 and turn it around, slowly in the kitchen.

722
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,860
 - That's great.

723
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,300
 - Have you heard of the goose crusade?

724
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,940
 And I was during the crusades.

725
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,620
 There was a group of crusaders slightly mad.

726
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,980
 They somehow managed to believe

727
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,820
 that a goose was filled with a holy spirit.

728
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,980
 And so they worshipped him and used him as a guide

729
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,500
 to find their way to Jerusalem.

730
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,660
 - Like the compass direction every time he did a little goose poo.

731
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,020
 (laughing)

732
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,060
 'Cause that should be east.

733
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,060
 (laughing)

734
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,180
 Wow, I'm still stunned by that cruelty of that.

735
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,700
 - Yeah, well, when James mentioned the goose rebellion,

736
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
 I thought what was it called?

737
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,220
 - The goose crusade. - The goose crusade.

738
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,420
 - What are they called a goose age?

739
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,540
 'Cause that is some kind of disgusting drink.

740
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,060
 (laughing)

741
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,420
 - God, progress movie.

742
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,140
 - Life gives you geese, make goose age.

743
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,980
 (laughing)

744
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,580
 (upbeat music)

745
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,860
 - Okay, that's it for another podcast.
