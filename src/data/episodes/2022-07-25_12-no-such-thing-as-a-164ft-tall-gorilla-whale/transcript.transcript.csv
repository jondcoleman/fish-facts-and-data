00:00:00,00:00:02,- We run it on QI a few years ago. - Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,- It ended up not such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:08,"- No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary"
00:00:08,00:00:10,of Underwater Life.
00:00:10,00:00:11,"He says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:15,(upbeat music)
00:00:15,00:00:27,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:27,00:00:29,"of no such thing as a fish,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,a weekly QI podcast coming to you
00:00:31,00:00:33,from our offices in Coverns Garden.
00:00:33,00:00:34,"My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:00:34,00:00:36,and the three other elves joining me today
00:00:36,00:00:39,"are James Harkin, Energy Zenski, and Annie Murray."
00:00:39,00:00:41,"Once again, we're gathering around the microphone"
00:00:41,00:00:42,and we're gonna share with each other
00:00:42,00:00:44,our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:44,00:00:46,"So, in no particular order,"
00:00:46,00:00:48,we're the best things we found out this week.
00:00:48,00:00:50,(upbeat music)
00:00:50,00:00:52,"James, we're gonna start with you, fact number one."
00:00:52,00:00:54,"- Okay, my fact this week is,"
00:00:54,00:00:56,"if the new Godzilla existed,"
00:00:56,00:01:00,it would produce 12.9 million gallons of urine a day.
00:01:00,00:01:04,That's more urine than the Exxon Valdez spilled oil.
00:01:04,00:01:06,- How many times does Godzilla go a day?
00:01:06,00:01:08,"That's not one bash, is it?"
00:01:08,00:01:10,"- Well, some animals go all the time,"
00:01:10,00:01:13,"like voles, I think, just urinate the whole time."
00:01:13,00:01:14,- Really? They're just consistently urinating?
00:01:14,00:01:17,"- Well, actually, you're consistently urinating,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,"but it's, your kidneys trickle out"
00:01:19,00:01:22,"a milliliter of urine every minute,"
00:01:22,00:01:24,"but obviously you can store it in your bladder,"
00:01:24,00:01:28,"but voles, I'm pretty sure they just always let it go."
00:01:28,00:01:32,"And birds of prey can sometimes see these tracks of urine,"
00:01:32,00:01:33,and that's what helps them find the voles.
00:01:33,00:01:36,"- Ah, 'cause they're just constantly living,"
00:01:36,00:01:37,"leaving a piss trail, basically."
00:01:37,00:01:38,"- Yeah, what's weird though, right?"
00:01:38,00:01:40,"Is that if Godzilla were, if the new Godzilla were real,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,he would take the same amount of time to urinate
00:01:42,00:01:44,"as the rest of us do, right?"
00:01:44,00:01:47,Because hasn't new research shown that all animals
00:01:47,00:01:49,take roughly the same amount of time to wee?
00:01:49,00:01:50,- To wee? - To wee?
00:01:50,00:01:52,"21 seconds, I think, on average?"
00:01:52,00:01:55,"- It's all mammals over a certain size, I think."
00:01:55,00:01:58,So I'm not sure that Godzilla is a mammal.
00:01:58,00:02:01,- Did someone find out that most dogs urinate
00:02:01,00:02:04,"in the same direction that they face North,"
00:02:04,00:02:05,or they face North West?
00:02:05,00:02:06,- Is that true?
00:02:06,00:02:09,"- Well, is it true?"
00:02:09,00:02:10,That's a good question.
00:02:10,00:02:12,"I think it was dogs defecating,"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"according to the Earth's magnetic field,"
00:02:15,00:02:17,if I remember the study correctly.
00:02:17,00:02:19,I didn't look into it into too much detail to see
00:02:19,00:02:22,"how true it is, but yeah, it was definitely claimed."
00:02:22,00:02:24,"- There is an article online saying that,"
00:02:24,00:02:27,"this is the headline, dogs have a butt compass,"
00:02:27,00:02:31,which is the most unpleasant phrase I've heard for a long time.
00:02:31,00:02:34,"- Yeah, less convenient to carry around than a compass as well."
00:02:34,00:02:35,- Yeah.
00:02:35,00:02:36,(laughing)
00:02:36,00:02:39,- But it would be convenient if you were lost with your dog.
00:02:39,00:02:40,- With your dog?
00:02:40,00:02:41,- Absolutely.
00:02:41,00:02:43,"If you were, for example, going to the North Pole"
00:02:43,00:02:46,"and you lost your compass, it's a featureless environment."
00:02:46,00:02:47,"You just have to look at the dogs and think,"
00:02:47,00:02:50,"""But Rover has taken a piss in that direction."""
00:02:50,00:02:52,"- It's true, and if you had like five or six dogs"
00:02:52,00:02:54,"and they all started peeing,"
00:02:54,00:02:56,"but they were all facing nozzle to nozzle,"
00:02:56,00:02:59,"in a big circle, it means you're exactly in the North Pole."
00:02:59,00:03:00,- Fantastic.
00:03:00,00:03:02,- So we agreed that Godzilla definitely isn't a mammal.
00:03:02,00:03:05,"- Originally Godzilla, the initial idea for Godzilla"
00:03:05,00:03:07,that it was half gorilla half whale.
00:03:07,00:03:09,And that's where the word Godzilla comes from.
00:03:09,00:03:11,Godzilla is a combination.
00:03:11,00:03:13,"And that's where the name, it's the two words"
00:03:13,00:03:15,"smashed together, gorilla whale."
00:03:15,00:03:16,"When they actually made the movie,"
00:03:16,00:03:21,they did make it into a reptile dinosaur prehistoric sort of monster.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"- Well, one of the guys wanted it to be a giant octopus"
00:03:23,00:03:27,"called Udaco, which is very close to Okado,"
00:03:27,00:03:28,which would have been good.
00:03:28,00:03:30,"- Okay, and what was it used in?"
00:03:30,00:03:32,Was it used in a Godzilla versus?
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- No, it was used to deliver groceries."
00:03:34,00:03:36,(laughing)
00:03:36,00:03:39,"- In the 1954 one, which is the original?"
00:03:39,00:03:43,"- Yeah, the sound of Godzilla roaring was made"
00:03:43,00:03:48,by rubbing a leather glove up and down a double base strings.
00:03:48,00:03:49,- Wow.
00:03:49,00:03:50,"- Yeah, that's strange."
00:03:50,00:03:53,I really like low-fi solutions to problems.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"So in Jurassic Park, the sound was, I think,"
00:03:55,00:03:57,tortoises mating.
00:03:57,00:03:57,- Yeah.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"- The new Godzilla was massive, isn't it?"
00:03:59,00:04:01,Like much bigger than the old Godzilla's.
00:04:01,00:04:02,"- Okay, I think that's interesting."
00:04:02,00:04:05,The scaling up that happens over the years.
00:04:05,00:04:06,The bigger and bigger.
00:04:06,00:04:11,- The website where I found how much urine they produce
00:04:11,00:04:15,"was deepcnews.com, and it was a postbag I called Dr. M."
00:04:15,00:04:17,I don't know what his real name was.
00:04:17,00:04:19,"And he, as well as working out the urine,"
00:04:19,00:04:22,he also worked out how much bigger it's gotten
00:04:22,00:04:24,in the last 50 years.
00:04:24,00:04:28,"And the 1954 Godzilla was 50 meters tall,"
00:04:28,00:04:31,but the new Godzilla is about 150 meters tall.
00:04:31,00:04:33,"And his idea, his theory is that the reason"
00:04:33,00:04:36,that it's gotten bigger is because skyscrapers
00:04:36,00:04:39,"have gotten bigger, and the Godzilla has to be big enough"
00:04:39,00:04:41,to crush the skyscrapers.
00:04:41,00:04:43,- That's very interesting.
00:04:43,00:04:44,- Yeah.
00:04:44,00:04:46,- That's adapting.
00:04:46,00:04:47,It's evolution.
00:04:47,00:04:48,It's very fast evolution.
00:04:48,00:04:49,"- Well, it could be evolution."
00:04:49,00:04:50,It could be sexual selection.
00:04:50,00:04:53,So the Lady Godzilla's like male Godzilla's
00:04:53,00:04:56,"who can crush buildings, and so they have to get bigger."
00:04:56,00:04:59,- So that's suggesting that there is a Lady Godzilla?
00:04:59,00:05:00,- Or that this one isn't a Lady.
00:05:00,00:05:03,"I think that in Japanese, they just call it it."
00:05:03,00:05:04,They don't say it's male or further.
00:05:04,00:05:06,- So we've never known if it was a male or female.
00:05:06,00:05:07,- Not to my knowledge.
00:05:07,00:05:08,- I just think there's a general inflation
00:05:08,00:05:10,"that goes on with the next film,"
00:05:10,00:05:11,you have to have something even bigger.
00:05:11,00:05:13,And it's just run away in a way.
00:05:13,00:05:16,"- This guy works it out, that it's getting bigger"
00:05:16,00:05:17,on a logarithmic scale.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"And he said if they do another one in 2050,"
00:05:20,00:05:23,then the Godzilla will be 288.4 meters tall.
00:05:23,00:05:27,- Do you guys know what Godzilla breathes out of his mouth?
00:05:27,00:05:30,"- Yeah, doesn't he breathe like nuclear clouds?"
00:05:30,00:05:31,- It's atomic breath.
00:05:31,00:05:32,- Atomic breath.
00:05:32,00:05:33,- That's Godzilla.
00:05:33,00:05:34,It's not fire.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"I thought it was fire, certainly."
00:05:35,00:05:36,- You think everything is fire.
00:05:36,00:05:38,You think the sun is fire then?
00:05:38,00:05:41,- I don't believe that that is.
00:05:41,00:05:41,- I'd like to back down up.
00:05:41,00:05:44,I also still think the sun is on fire.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- But yeah, wasn't Godzilla initially"
00:05:46,00:05:47,a sort of comment on Hiroshima Nagasaki?
00:05:47,00:05:50,That was why it was had all these nuclear content.
00:05:50,00:05:50,- It was.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"- It's interesting that the way Godzilla is defeated,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,"certainly in the last film, is with military weapons."
00:05:56,00:05:58,Whereas the whole point of Godzilla is it's a metaphor
00:05:58,00:06:02,"for nuclear bombs, you know, the most devastating weapons"
00:06:02,00:06:02,we can come up with.
00:06:02,00:06:06,So it's kind of missing the point if you just attack him
00:06:06,00:06:08,with weapons capable of dealing with it.
00:06:08,00:06:11,- So we should have beaten him with like a peace treaty?
00:06:11,00:06:13,"- Yeah, or is it like in the world of the world's way,"
00:06:13,00:06:15,the aliens catch the common cold?
00:06:15,00:06:17,- Do you think Godzilla would have been as popular amongst
00:06:17,00:06:19,like 10 to 15 year old boys?
00:06:19,00:06:21,If the second half of the film had been like a potstamp
00:06:21,00:06:24,"around the table, peace treaty."
00:06:24,00:06:25,(laughing)
00:06:25,00:06:27,"- Oh, just a lot of people tried to sneeze on him."
00:06:27,00:06:28,(laughing)
00:06:28,00:06:30,"- Sorry, can you repeat your last amount?"
00:06:30,00:06:33,(laughing)
00:06:33,00:06:35,"- So what I really like about your fact, James,"
00:06:35,00:06:37,"which I know you enjoy doing, and I like doing as well,"
00:06:37,00:06:40,is the fact that when you get like an original fact
00:06:40,00:06:42,"and you work it out and it reminded me of,"
00:06:42,00:06:45,"when I think you found in one, three, three, nine facts"
00:06:45,00:06:47,"to make your jaw drop, which is that the Statue of Liberty"
00:06:47,00:06:50,wears size 879 shoes.
00:06:50,00:06:55,So I have worked out the shoe size of Godzilla.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- Have you?
00:06:56,00:06:58,"- You know, it's the 50 meter Godzilla,"
00:06:58,00:06:59,so it's the original.
00:06:59,00:07:04,"So he wears UK size 1,680 shoes, which sounds weird,"
00:07:04,00:07:05,'cause he's only a little bit taller.
00:07:05,00:07:08,"In fact, the 50 meter is smaller than the Statue of Liberty,"
00:07:08,00:07:10,"but he has bigger feet, so there was a press release"
00:07:10,00:07:12,at the time which gave the measurement of his feet.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"- Did you say 1,680?"
00:07:14,00:07:14,"- 1,680."
00:07:14,00:07:16,"- So a US size that's 1,679."
00:07:16,00:07:17,(laughing)
00:07:17,00:07:18,- Yep.
00:07:18,00:07:20,- It's a part to get them started out.
00:07:20,00:07:23,- Because the new Godzilla is quite a lot bigger
00:07:23,00:07:25,"than the other one, a lot of Japanese super fans"
00:07:25,00:07:28,are really upset that the Americans have just made him fat.
00:07:28,00:07:30,"- So Godzilla's overweight, that's a problem?"
00:07:30,00:07:32,- They're saying like it's fat from the neck downwards
00:07:32,00:07:34,and massive at the bottom.
00:07:34,00:07:36,"This is what Godzilla's super fan,"
00:07:36,00:07:40,"Fumiko Abe, told the AFP at a Tokyo exhibition."
00:07:40,00:07:42,"But then they had the premiere, I think,"
00:07:42,00:07:45,"a couple of weeks ago, and Gareth Edwards,"
00:07:45,00:07:46,"who we have met, who was--"
00:07:46,00:07:48,"- Gareth Edwards came, so the director of the latest"
00:07:48,00:07:52,"Godzilla movie was on museumicuriosity, our radio show."
00:07:52,00:07:55,"He told us at the time that he was gonna be doing Godzilla,"
00:07:55,00:07:56,but it wasn't announced.
00:07:56,00:07:57,"- Oh, did he?"
00:07:57,00:07:58,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't remember that."
00:07:58,00:07:59,- Very exciting.
00:07:59,00:08:01,"- But they asked him at the premiere,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,what he thought about these Japanese people
00:08:03,00:08:06,saying that Godzilla had got very fat.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"And he said, I just think it's comments like that"
00:08:08,00:08:10,that give giant monsters an image complex.
00:08:10,00:08:12,(laughing)
00:08:12,00:08:13,He's such a great combat.
00:08:13,00:08:14,- Yeah.
00:08:14,00:08:20,"- Okay, let's move on to fact number two,"
00:08:20,00:08:23,"and that one's yours, Annette."
00:08:23,00:08:26,"- Yeah, this is one of my favorite things I ever found."
00:08:26,00:08:29,It's that the real Long John Silver from Treasure Island
00:08:29,00:08:32,was father to the real Wendy Darling from Peter Pan.
00:08:32,00:08:33,- The real Long John Silver.
00:08:33,00:08:36,"- The guy on whom Long John Silver is based,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,"a guy called William Ernest Henley,"
00:08:38,00:08:40,"who was a poet and he wrote the poem ""Invictus"""
00:08:40,00:08:42,by far the most famous thing he did.
00:08:42,00:08:44,- Was that Nelson Mandela's favorite one?
00:08:44,00:08:45,- Yes.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"- And Barack Obama quoted it, didn't he?"
00:08:47,00:08:49,The last verse of it is funeral.
00:08:49,00:08:52,"- Mandela supposedly read it in prison to everyone,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"and that got them all kind of, you know,"
00:08:54,00:08:54,staying positive.
00:08:54,00:08:56,- It's a fantastic poem.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"- So that's his most famous poem, this guy."
00:08:58,00:09:02,"- Yes, which just, I don't know if this will ever go in,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,"but I do really like the last verse, which is,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,"it matters not how straight to the gate,"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"how charged with punishments, the scroll,"
00:09:08,00:09:13,"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul."
00:09:13,00:09:14,It is a great poem.
00:09:14,00:09:16,- So that was the poem written by the man
00:09:16,00:09:19,who Long John Silver was based on?
00:09:19,00:09:19,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:09:19,00:09:22,"So he was this like full of life guy, had only one leg,"
00:09:22,00:09:24,"and Robert Louis Stevenson just thought he was this great guy,"
00:09:24,00:09:26,"wrote him a letter after writing Treasure Island saying,"
00:09:26,00:09:29,"""I've got to be honest with you, I based Long John Silver on you"
00:09:29,00:09:33,"""because I find you, you know, such an incredible chap."""
00:09:33,00:09:34,Does anyone read Treasure Island?
00:09:34,00:09:35,"- Yes, I have."
00:09:35,00:09:37,"- It's extraordinary that we've read it at all,"
00:09:37,00:09:39,"because for a long time, no one read his books."
00:09:39,00:09:44,Robert Louis Stevenson was seen as just a terrible author.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"To the point that when, when in 1973,"
00:09:46,00:09:49,"they published a 2,000 page Oxford anthology"
00:09:49,00:09:52,"of English literature, he wasn't mentioned in it at all."
00:09:52,00:09:55,And now he's one of the 26 most translated authors
00:09:55,00:09:57,"in the world above Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde,"
00:09:57,00:10:00,"but for a long time, no one read him."
00:10:00,00:10:01,- I don't know much about him.
00:10:01,00:10:03,I know he died on Samoa.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"- Yes, he's on their postage stamps."
00:10:05,00:10:06,- And he drank a lot of Guinness.
00:10:06,00:10:08,It's the only other thing I know about Robert Louis Stevenson.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"- Right, Samoa, he had it shipped out to him."
00:10:11,00:10:13,"- Wow, that's a long way to ship out Guinness."
00:10:13,00:10:18,I remember I tried to find the furthest Irish pub
00:10:18,00:10:23,"from Dublin, and I reckon it's Waxio Shays in New Zealand."
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- So even from there, it's a long way to Samoa."
00:10:25,00:10:27,"- Yep, it must be strange to having somebody based on you."
00:10:27,00:10:29,"Years ago, I received a guy called Lord Berners,"
00:10:29,00:10:33,who was an early 20th century aristocrat and eccentric.
00:10:33,00:10:34,He built one of the last follies in Britain.
00:10:34,00:10:36,"You know, those towers that go nowhere and are completely pointless."
00:10:36,00:10:39,"He built one of those, and then he put it at the bottom of science"
00:10:39,00:10:41,saying members of the public committing suicide off this tower
00:10:41,00:10:42,do so at their own risk.
00:10:42,00:10:44,"He was a very, very funny guy."
00:10:44,00:10:47,But he wrote a novel in which he based all of the characters
00:10:47,00:10:52,"on his friends, but he also cast it as a lesbian schoolgirl story."
00:10:52,00:10:55,"And one of the characters in it, Sitwell, was so angry"
00:10:55,00:10:57,that he tried to buy every copy of this book
00:10:57,00:10:59,in circulation to destroy it.
00:10:59,00:11:01,"- That's a really good way to get good sales, isn't it?"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"- Yeah, pretty much."
00:11:03,00:11:04,- Isn't that what you have for Titchcock did
00:11:04,00:11:06,"when he released, I think it was Psycho."
00:11:06,00:11:09,He bought up as many copies of the novel Psycho as he possibly could
00:11:09,00:11:11,because he didn't want the ending to be given away.
00:11:11,00:11:12,Was it Psycho?
00:11:12,00:11:13,"- Yeah, was Psycho?"
00:11:13,00:11:16,"- Yeah, you know who Psycho was based on?"
00:11:16,00:11:18,"- Yes, it's based on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre guy."
00:11:18,00:11:21,- It's based on the same guy as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
00:11:21,00:11:24,It's Silence of the Lambs and Psycho
00:11:24,00:11:26,they're all based on the same guy called Ed Geene.
00:11:26,00:11:27,- Oh wow.
00:11:27,00:11:29,- And he was a big famous serial killer in the world.
00:11:29,00:11:30,"- So a real gift to, you know,"
00:11:30,00:11:31,it's Greenplay writers.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:11:32,00:11:34,"- Thank you, Ed."
00:11:34,00:11:38,"- But the, if you look at it one way,"
00:11:38,00:11:40,it means there are fewer Psychos out there than you think
00:11:40,00:11:43,if they're all based on the same one guy.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"- Yeah, yeah, that's true."
00:11:45,00:11:49,"Oh, he just had such a variety of fictional type quirks."
00:11:49,00:11:50,"- There must be other Psychopaths going,"
00:11:50,00:11:51,"""Why does he get all the gifts?"""
00:11:51,00:11:52,- Yeah.
00:11:52,00:11:54,- I'm doing some great killings.
00:11:54,00:11:55,"- And yet, has he won a single Oscar?"
00:11:55,00:11:56,- No.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"- Yeah, another example of the Academy getting it known."
00:11:58,00:12:00,"- Well, Silence of the Lambs won best picture."
00:12:00,00:12:03,"- But he did, my point is, was he invited to the ceremony?"
00:12:03,00:12:04,"- What are you wearing today, Ed?"
00:12:04,00:12:06,"- Fine, wearing my mother."
00:12:06,00:12:07,(laughing)
00:12:07,00:12:11,- The nipples of all my victims in a belt?
00:12:11,00:12:12,"- In a, on a lighter note."
00:12:12,00:12:13,(laughing)
00:12:13,00:12:16,"- Yeah, just to take us away from nipple wearing."
00:12:16,00:12:18,"When I was looking into Long John Silver,"
00:12:18,00:12:21,"I found a porn star, here has a similar name."
00:12:21,00:12:23,- When you were looking into Long John Silver.
00:12:23,00:12:25,So his name's Long Dong Silver.
00:12:25,00:12:29,"And Long Dong Silver, he's a retired porn star now."
00:12:29,00:12:31,"But he was famed, obviously,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,"for the apparent size of his penis,"
00:12:33,00:12:37,"which, it turned out that he was using fake penis"
00:12:37,00:12:41,"during the shoots, which no one really knew about."
00:12:41,00:12:43,He persuaded a makeup artist who did the makeup
00:12:43,00:12:46,"for the film ""The Elephant Man"" to create a prosthetic."
00:12:46,00:12:48,"- I wonder if they felt, well, you know,"
00:12:48,00:12:50,"we've got a trunk, yeah."
00:12:50,00:12:51,(laughing)
00:12:51,00:12:53,"Actually, the elephant I didn't have a trunk."
00:12:53,00:12:55,"- No, no, no, that would have been the makeup artist going."
00:12:55,00:12:56,"I've done the trunk, and they go,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,"no, he's not physically an elephant man."
00:12:58,00:13:00,What am I going to do with this trunk?
00:13:00,00:13:01,(laughing)
00:13:01,00:13:03,- Do you think I should quickly explain
00:13:03,00:13:04,the Wendy connection?
00:13:04,00:13:05,"- Yes, yes."
00:13:05,00:13:07,"- So we don't, when he met on his Henry,"
00:13:07,00:13:09,"was the father to Margaret Henley,"
00:13:09,00:13:11,who was one of the girls who Jay and Barry.
00:13:11,00:13:12,So he loved playing with children.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"He was always, he loved spending time with children."
00:13:15,00:13:17,And he used to hang out in Kensington Gardens
00:13:17,00:13:19,and entertain the kids and tell them stories.
00:13:19,00:13:20,And Margaret Henley was one of the girls
00:13:20,00:13:22,who used to hang out there with him.
00:13:22,00:13:25,And she was the person who called him Wendy.
00:13:25,00:13:26,Wasn't she?
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Wendy Wendy.
00:13:27,00:13:29,"- Wendy Wendy, which is where,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,we think he got the name Wendy for Peter Pan.
00:13:31,00:13:34,- Was it right that Wendy was not a name before he came up?
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- It was a very popular name at all,"
00:13:35,00:13:37,but there are some examples before him.
00:13:37,00:13:39,"- The original title of the novel,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,"which Peter Pan first appeared in,"
00:13:41,00:13:44,was going to be the boy who hated mothers.
00:13:44,00:13:45,- It was pretty dark.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"- Oh, yeah, it is."
00:13:47,00:13:50,- And Jay and Barry was nicknamed the furry beast
00:13:50,00:13:51,by his friends.
00:13:51,00:13:52,- Yeah.
00:13:52,00:13:52,- Yeah.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"- He was very, very short and very hersute."
00:13:54,00:13:57,"- He also loved to play cricket, right?"
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Yeah.
00:13:58,00:13:59,- And this is extraordinary.
00:13:59,00:14:00,His cricket team.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Have you seen his cricket team?
00:14:01,00:14:01,- The Alahackbury.
00:14:01,00:14:04,"- Yeah, the people on it."
00:14:04,00:14:04,This was his team.
00:14:04,00:14:08,"H.G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Conan Doyle,"
00:14:08,00:14:12,"PG Woodhouse, Jerome K. Jerome, G.K. Chesterton, A.A. Milne,"
00:14:12,00:14:13,and others.
00:14:13,00:14:15,- This is his cricket team and others.
00:14:15,00:14:17,- And there's plenty more very famous.
00:14:17,00:14:18,"- Yeah, they're so many."
00:14:18,00:14:20,"- But the thing is, they were a terrible team,"
00:14:20,00:14:23,"and he printed a book of advice for them,"
00:14:23,00:14:25,which had little tips.
00:14:25,00:14:27,It was in 1893.
00:14:27,00:14:29,"Like, don't practice on an opponent's ground"
00:14:29,00:14:30,before the match begins.
00:14:30,00:14:32,This can only give them confidence.
00:14:32,00:14:32,(laughing)
00:14:32,00:14:35,"Or, should you hit the ball, run it once,"
00:14:35,00:14:36,do not stop to cheer.
00:14:36,00:14:38,(laughing)
00:14:38,00:14:41,(upbeat music)
00:14:41,00:14:44,(upbeat music)
00:14:44,00:14:49,"- Okay, time to move on to fact number three,"
00:14:49,00:14:51,"and that is, I believe, my facts."
00:14:51,00:14:54,My fact this week is that the tinfoil hats
00:14:54,00:14:57,that conspiracy theorists wear in order to stop the government
00:14:57,00:15:00,from sending messages into their brain
00:15:00,00:15:01,actually does the opposite.
00:15:01,00:15:02,It amplifies the signal.
00:15:02,00:15:04,Almost to the point that if there were a thousand people
00:15:04,00:15:06,"in a crowd and they were the one with the tinfoil hat,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,that's the only brain that would actually get
00:15:08,00:15:09,the brain messages.
00:15:09,00:15:11,It's like a huge antenna that they're wearing.
00:15:11,00:15:12,- I don't even know that.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"- Well, it was a study by a bunch of students in the America"
00:15:15,00:15:17,"who just wanted to look into the myth, I guess,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,because people were doing it.
00:15:19,00:15:21,No one had actually checked it out before.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"And obviously, we don't know how to send messages"
00:15:23,00:15:26,into people's brains or take them out.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"As far as I know, James is shaking your head as if we do."
00:15:29,00:15:30,"- We don't, yeah, but they're working on it."
00:15:30,00:15:32,There's been studies done in the last couple of years
00:15:32,00:15:35,where people have thought about a word
00:15:35,00:15:37,and people have been able to work out what word
00:15:37,00:15:40,they were thinking about by measuring their brainwaves.
00:15:40,00:15:42,"But they would work if they were made properly, right?"
00:15:42,00:15:43,So they are meant to be a Faraday cage
00:15:43,00:15:47,which stops electricity passing through it.
00:15:47,00:15:51,"- If it fully covered the head and properly tightly fitted it,"
00:15:51,00:15:53,then electromagnetic radiation could not get in.
00:15:53,00:15:56,"But as it is, if it's worn loosely or designed,"
00:15:56,00:15:59,"it's sort of just a skull cap, then it gets in."
00:15:59,00:16:01,But I love the idea that you would make one
00:16:01,00:16:04,"that was so good that the government couldn't get in,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,but also then you would immediately asphyxiate.
00:16:06,00:16:09,(all laughing)
00:16:09,00:16:12,- You guys know that the Vatican used a Faraday cage
00:16:12,00:16:16,in 2013 to shield the cysteine chapel from its chopping.
00:16:16,00:16:18,So no one could hear who they were electing as Pope
00:16:18,00:16:21,"because there was, I think in 2003 was it a Pope"
00:16:21,00:16:22,before that was elected.
00:16:22,00:16:24,It was thought there was a leak in Germany.
00:16:24,00:16:26,And so they put a Faraday cage in the Vatican.
00:16:26,00:16:29,"- Wow, massive tin foil cardinals."
00:16:29,00:16:30,- Cardinals.
00:16:30,00:16:32,(all laughing)
00:16:32,00:16:33,- That's great.
00:16:33,00:16:35,Have you guys heard of stealthware?
00:16:35,00:16:39,This is a company who make clothes
00:16:39,00:16:42,"that make the wearers invisible to infrared surveillance cameras,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,particularly those on drones.
00:16:44,00:16:46,So the idea is that you wear these clothes
00:16:46,00:16:49,and drones can't see you and it's supposed to be make you safe.
00:16:49,00:16:51,Say you were being infiltrated by the American government
00:16:51,00:16:53,"who were looking at you with drones,"
00:16:53,00:16:54,they won't be able to see you anymore.
00:16:54,00:16:57,"They make hoodies, they make full length burgers"
00:16:57,00:16:59,in this kind of material.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"The burger goes for $2,300."
00:17:01,00:17:04,The hoodie is $481.
00:17:04,00:17:06,But unfortunately due to the high cost
00:17:06,00:17:08,"and limited availability, so far they've only"
00:17:08,00:17:10,sold one item a scarf.
00:17:10,00:17:12,(all laughing)
00:17:12,00:17:15,- I know where we should put all the secrets in my neck.
00:17:15,00:17:17,(all laughing)
00:17:17,00:17:19,"- It's all of them, but not completely."
00:17:19,00:17:25,"- Speaking of hats, useful hats."
00:17:25,00:17:29,The following quote is from radiologist Richard Gerstle's
00:17:29,00:17:33,1950 book How to Survive an Atomic Bomb.
00:17:33,00:17:37,"He said, ""If you are caught outdoors in a sudden attack,"
00:17:37,00:17:39,"""a hat will give you at least some protection"
00:17:39,00:17:40,"""from the heat flash."""
00:17:40,00:17:42,(all laughing)
00:17:42,00:17:44,When I say some...
00:17:44,00:17:46,"- That's true, you probably could mathematically calculate"
00:17:46,00:17:47,how much it gives you.
00:17:47,00:17:49,It's just that it won't...
00:17:49,00:17:53,"- It will, by no means save your life under any circumstances."
00:17:53,00:17:53,- This is amazing.
00:17:53,00:17:56,"No army at the start of the First World War,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"okay, this order's metal helmets."
00:17:58,00:18:01,It took until 1915 and thousands and thousands of deaths
00:18:01,00:18:02,"before they said, you know."
00:18:02,00:18:04,"The German army had a leather,"
00:18:04,00:18:08,just a little leather cap's called a pickle helmet.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"Not until 1950, and people start making these helmets."
00:18:10,00:18:12,"And we have the image of the helmet from the First World War,"
00:18:12,00:18:13,"the kind of shallow, again,"
00:18:13,00:18:15,innovated for the First World War.
00:18:15,00:18:19,"- Francis Galton, who was, I believe,"
00:18:19,00:18:23,"a relative of Charles Darwin, he invented a hat, didn't he?"
00:18:23,00:18:27,"Yeah, it was a hat that had an air conditioning device in it,"
00:18:27,00:18:28,"or a little flap that opened the top,"
00:18:28,00:18:30,because it was the idea that if you thought too much
00:18:30,00:18:32,"about stuff, your head overheated."
00:18:32,00:18:34,- It doesn't mean my hair is always sinking.
00:18:34,00:18:36,(all laughing)
00:18:36,00:18:38,"Weird hats, you mentioned."
00:18:38,00:18:40,When was it dangerous to wear a hat?
00:18:40,00:18:42,Why am I phrasing this like a cute question?
00:18:42,00:18:44,"'Cause I reckon that you'll get it changed, wasn't it?"
00:18:44,00:18:45,- When was it dangerous?
00:18:45,00:18:48,"- In stockpot, you used to be attacked"
00:18:48,00:18:49,"if you weren't wearing a hat,"
00:18:49,00:18:52,"because they had the hat industry was quite big there,"
00:18:52,00:18:55,"and they thought it was unpatriotic to the town,"
00:18:55,00:18:57,if you weren't actually attacked.
00:18:57,00:18:59,"- Yeah, by verbally or in principle."
00:18:59,00:19:00,"- Well, people throw things at you."
00:19:00,00:19:01,- Wow.
00:19:01,00:19:06,- But not as mean as the straw hat riots.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"So in the early 20th century, in New York,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,"past September the 15th,"
00:19:11,00:19:13,it was socially unacceptable to wear a straw hat.
00:19:13,00:19:15,It was a summer item.
00:19:15,00:19:16,"And if you wore a straw hat,"
00:19:16,00:19:17,"past September the 15th,"
00:19:17,00:19:19,then it was traditional for youths to come along
00:19:19,00:19:21,and knock your hat off your head and trample on it.
00:19:21,00:19:24,"And in 1922, it got out of hand."
00:19:24,00:19:25,So the straw hat rioters decided to start
00:19:25,00:19:27,"knocking people's hats off their head a bit early,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,and I think they approached a bunch of dog workers
00:19:28,00:19:31,"who were wearing straw hats on September the 13th,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"not the hats off, trampled them, started a fight,"
00:19:33,00:19:35,"huge fight riot lasted three days,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"bunch of people ended up in hospital, disaster."
00:19:37,00:19:40,"And in 1924, a guy was murdered for wearing a straw hat"
00:19:40,00:19:41,after September the 15th.
00:19:41,00:19:43,So it was a dangerous business actually.
00:19:43,00:19:44,- Three days of fighting.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"- Three days of riots, the straw hat riots."
00:19:46,00:19:48,- One last thing on conspiracy theories.
00:19:48,00:19:49,- Okay.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"- I like the randomness of them,"
00:19:51,00:19:52,"because they're often so connected,"
00:19:52,00:19:54,but often they also have very strange outputs.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"So I found a list of conspiracy theories online,"
00:19:57,00:19:59,and this was 16 conspiracy theories
00:19:59,00:20:00,that have been proved to be true.
00:20:00,00:20:02,Some day scientists will use millions
00:20:02,00:20:04,of genetically modified animals in experiments.
00:20:04,00:20:06,Scientists all over the world are creating
00:20:06,00:20:08,bizarre human animal hybrids.
00:20:08,00:20:09,Obama is making government employees
00:20:09,00:20:13,spy on one another and pro-wrestling is fake.
00:20:13,00:20:15,(laughing)
00:20:15,00:20:16,- That's not the seven on this list.
00:20:16,00:20:19,(laughing)
00:20:19,00:20:19,- Should we move on?
00:20:19,00:20:21,"- Sorry, sorry, sorry, we were brothers and sisters"
00:20:21,00:20:24,"before, literally brothers and sisters"
00:20:24,00:20:25,in family connections.
00:20:25,00:20:27,The guy who came up with the first ever tin hat
00:20:27,00:20:30,"was Julian Huxley, who was the brother"
00:20:30,00:20:31,of all the Huxley.
00:20:31,00:20:32,- No!
00:20:32,00:20:35,"- Yeah, it was in a short story called The Tissue Culture King,"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"about a scientist who is lost in a jungle kingdom,"
00:20:38,00:20:40,and he offers to culture the king's flesh
00:20:40,00:20:42,so the subjects can worship him in their home.
00:20:42,00:20:45,And then this allows the king to exert telepathic power
00:20:45,00:20:46,over the entire kingdom.
00:20:46,00:20:49,"And in that story, he says we used caps of metal foil,"
00:20:49,00:20:50,"which reduced the effect on ourselves,"
00:20:50,00:20:53,but it started as a fiction in a short story.
00:20:53,00:20:53,- Yeah.
00:20:53,00:20:54,- That is great.
00:20:54,00:20:57,(upbeat music)
00:20:57,00:20:59,(upbeat music)
00:20:59,00:21:04,"- Okay, moving on to our final fact of the show,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,and that is Andy.
00:21:06,00:21:09,"- My fact is that geese sometimes fly upside down,"
00:21:09,00:21:12,"to lose height quickly when they're coming into land,"
00:21:12,00:21:15,"rather than doing a long, slow descent."
00:21:15,00:21:17,"They just, it's like a shortcut for them, like a life hack."
00:21:17,00:21:20,"- But the best thing is, they flip their body upside down,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,but their head and neck stay the right way up.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"- So they do a twist, so that it just looks weird."
00:21:25,00:21:26,- It looks really bizarre.
00:21:26,00:21:29,"- You see the neck and the head are perfect, you know?"
00:21:29,00:21:31,And then they've got this weird upside down body
00:21:31,00:21:33,flapping away beneath them.
00:21:33,00:21:34,- Frankie.
00:21:34,00:21:35,"- Yeah, and this is called whiffling."
00:21:35,00:21:37,- So great.
00:21:37,00:21:39,"- I know geese, the only animal to do that?"
00:21:39,00:21:41,- I think there are a few others which do it.
00:21:41,00:21:43,- The description I read is that it looks like
00:21:43,00:21:44,"they're a falling leap, but they're not mine."
00:21:44,00:21:46,"- Yeah, there's good footage, which we can put up online"
00:21:46,00:21:47,on the podcast page.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"Yeah, and there are amazing photos of it"
00:21:50,00:21:53,"being captured mid-flight, and it looks brilliant."
00:21:53,00:21:57,"- Yeah, so I started looking up things about flying upside down."
00:21:57,00:21:58,"- Oh, yeah."
00:21:58,00:21:59,- The planes which are flown upside down.
00:21:59,00:22:00,"- There was that movie, wasn't there?"
00:22:00,00:22:01,- Flight.
00:22:01,00:22:03,"- Dental Washington, yeah, that's right."
00:22:03,00:22:04,"- The Robert Zermh, heck, I swear."
00:22:04,00:22:05,- I got distracted.
00:22:05,00:22:06,"This fact should be a lot better research,"
00:22:06,00:22:09,but I got distracted watching a 10 minute clip from flight.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"- Was it the bit at the start where he crashes,"
00:22:11,00:22:12,he flies upside down?
00:22:12,00:22:13,"- Yeah, it was that."
00:22:13,00:22:16,- Did you see the Boeing issued a statement
00:22:16,00:22:18,"after the film came out and they said,"
00:22:18,00:22:22,the MD80 cannot sustain inverted flight.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"The MD80, as with all commercial airliners,"
00:22:25,00:22:29,"was designed to fly upright, so it was a bit, you know."
00:22:29,00:22:31,- Do you remember that plane that flew under Tower Bridge?
00:22:31,00:22:32,"- Oh, yeah. - Remember that?"
00:22:32,00:22:33,- No.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"- Yeah, you must remember it."
00:22:35,00:22:37,- I remember the Arc de Triomphe one.
00:22:37,00:22:38,- Go on.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"- Well, in 1919, someone flew a biplane"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"through the Arc de Triomphe, and the Arc de Triomphe is big,"
00:22:42,00:22:44,but it's not that big.
00:22:44,00:22:46,"And it was the wingspan of the plane,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,plus a medium meter on either side.
00:22:48,00:22:49,- Wow.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"- It's such cool footage, and we can put that up online."
00:22:51,00:22:52,"- Yeah, let's put that up."
00:22:52,00:22:53,"- Yeah, it's amazing."
00:22:53,00:22:56,"- The guy who flew under Tower Bridge,"
00:22:56,00:23:00,"I was talking about, this guy was called Harker Hunter,"
00:23:00,00:23:05,"and he flew under Tower Bridge on the 5th of April, 1968."
00:23:05,00:23:07,"He did it as a, he flew across the Thames"
00:23:07,00:23:11,"as a demonstration against Harold Wilson's government,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,"and he was struck off from the RAF for it, I think."
00:23:13,00:23:17,"And weirdly, there was a quote from him"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"when they asked him about it, and he said,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,"he was flying down the Thames,"
00:23:21,00:23:24,"and he said, until this very instant,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,"I had absolutely no idea that, of course,"
00:23:27,00:23:28,Tower Bridge would be there.
00:23:28,00:23:30,(laughing)
00:23:30,00:23:31,- What did he think it was gonna be?
00:23:31,00:23:32,I don't know.
00:23:32,00:23:36,"- Just going back to the animals in the air very quickly,"
00:23:36,00:23:38,so he's flying upside down.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"This is something that I've found out weeks ago,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"and I've mentioned it to you guys a bunch before,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,but we haven't said it on the podcast.
00:23:45,00:23:46,It's about ladybirds.
00:23:46,00:23:47,"There's, I mean, this really surprised me,"
00:23:47,00:23:51,"that recent research has shown that ladybirds,"
00:23:51,00:23:55,"who were thought to have only flown at a height of, say,"
00:23:55,00:23:58,"are shoulders, an average human's shoulder height,"
00:23:58,00:24:02,"actually have been found flying at the height of 3,600 feet,"
00:24:02,00:24:05,"and they travel as fast as 37 miles per hour,"
00:24:05,00:24:09,and they can go as far as 74 miles in one journey.
00:24:09,00:24:11,- Do you know how they find them?
00:24:11,00:24:12,- What do you mean?
00:24:12,00:24:14,"- Well, they originally found this out,"
00:24:14,00:24:18,"'cause obviously you've got to be at that height to find one,"
00:24:18,00:24:23,so they sent up planes with sticky panes and saw what they got.
00:24:23,00:24:25,"That was very early, that was by planes."
00:24:25,00:24:27,"- When you try to swat a fly, you know how,"
00:24:27,00:24:29,"you try to swat it, and you're definitely gonna get it."
00:24:29,00:24:31,"It looks barely conscious, and then it gets away,"
00:24:31,00:24:33,and you don't understand how.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"And apparently this is because the moment they see you coming,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,they do a somersault rather than just falling
00:24:38,00:24:40,and that speeds up their descent.
00:24:40,00:24:41,So they just drop into a somersault.
00:24:41,00:24:42,"You can sort of imagine it,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"and I wouldn't be able to explain the physics, maybe you would."
00:24:44,00:24:48,And then they pick up the air
00:24:48,00:24:49,with their wings and fly away.
00:24:49,00:24:50,- That's so cool.
00:24:50,00:24:51,- Little somersault.
00:24:51,00:24:52,"- Tennis rocket, that's what you need,"
00:24:52,00:24:54,"'cause they can avoid most of the strings,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,but they can't avoid all of them.
00:24:56,00:24:57,- Good.
00:24:57,00:24:58,"- Sorry to bring the helicopter down, but."
00:24:58,00:25:00,- Unlike tennis balls in my experience.
00:25:00,00:25:01,(laughing)
00:25:01,00:25:03,"Every time I hit it, I do a little cheer,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,but then forget to run.
00:25:05,00:25:06,(laughing)
00:25:06,00:25:08,"- And this might seem unrelated, but on geese."
00:25:08,00:25:09,Can we go on geese?
00:25:09,00:25:11,- I would almost say that's completely related.
00:25:11,00:25:13,(laughing)
00:25:13,00:25:15,"- Goose grabbing was very popular as a sport,"
00:25:15,00:25:16,"and 17th century new Amsterdam,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,which obviously became New York.
00:25:18,00:25:20,And the way it was used smear the neck of a goose
00:25:20,00:25:22,"with soap or something slippery,"
00:25:22,00:25:23,"and you hang the goose upside down,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,"and a bunch of competitors ride towards it on horses,"
00:25:26,00:25:27,and the aim is to try and rip it's head off.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"- Oh, sorry."
00:25:28,00:25:30,- Do you remember we did what used as a goose on cue?
00:25:30,00:25:31,(laughing)
00:25:31,00:25:32,- Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:34,"- Remember that, we came up with loads of different things"
00:25:34,00:25:35,that you can use geese for.
00:25:35,00:25:36,"- Oh, yeah. - 'Cause they were used"
00:25:36,00:25:39,as guard dogs in ancient Rome and various different--
00:25:39,00:25:41,"- They were used to turn spits in the kitchen,"
00:25:41,00:25:42,which was grabbed the handle
00:25:42,00:25:45,"and turn it around, slowly in the kitchen."
00:25:45,00:25:45,- That's great.
00:25:45,00:25:48,- Have you heard of the goose crusade?
00:25:48,00:25:49,And I was during the crusades.
00:25:49,00:25:52,There was a group of crusaders slightly mad.
00:25:52,00:25:53,They somehow managed to believe
00:25:53,00:25:56,that a goose was filled with a holy spirit.
00:25:56,00:25:59,And so they worshipped him and used him as a guide
00:25:59,00:26:01,to find their way to Jerusalem.
00:26:01,00:26:04,- Like the compass direction every time he did a little goose poo.
00:26:04,00:26:06,(laughing)
00:26:06,00:26:07,'Cause that should be east.
00:26:07,00:26:08,(laughing)
00:26:08,00:26:12,"Wow, I'm still stunned by that cruelty of that."
00:26:12,00:26:13,"- Yeah, well, when James mentioned the goose rebellion,"
00:26:13,00:26:14,I thought what was it called?
00:26:14,00:26:16,- The goose crusade. - The goose crusade.
00:26:16,00:26:18,- What are they called a goose age?
00:26:18,00:26:20,'Cause that is some kind of disgusting drink.
00:26:20,00:26:22,(laughing)
00:26:22,00:26:24,"- God, progress movie."
00:26:24,00:26:27,"- Life gives you geese, make goose age."
00:26:27,00:26:28,(laughing)
00:26:28,00:26:31,(upbeat music)
00:26:31,00:26:35,"- Okay, that's it for another podcast."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"That is all of our facts, thanks so much everyone for listening."
00:26:38,00:26:40,If you wanna get in touch with us about any of the things

00:27:12,00:27:14,And we're gonna have pictures and videos and links
00:27:14,00:27:17,to all the stuff that we've been talking about in this episode.
