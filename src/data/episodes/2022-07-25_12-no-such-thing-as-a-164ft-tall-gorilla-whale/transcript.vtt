00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 - We run it on QI a few years ago. - Yeah.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.400
 - Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.680
 - It ended up not such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.280
 - No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.080
 of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.520
 He says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.760
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.340
 (upbeat music)

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:27.560
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.240
 of no such thing as a fish,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.280
 a weekly QI podcast coming to you

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.360
 from our offices in Coverns Garden.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.080
 and the three other elves joining me today

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.280
 are James Harkin, Energy Zenski, and Annie Murray.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.120
 Once again, we're gathering around the microphone

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.320
 and we're gonna share with each other

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.920
 our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.680
 So, in no particular order,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.520
 we're the best things we found out this week.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.000
 (upbeat music)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.200
 James, we're gonna start with you, fact number one.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600
 - Okay, my fact this week is,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.760
 if the new Godzilla existed,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.920
 it would produce 12.9 million gallons of urine a day.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.360
 That's more urine than the Exxon Valdez spilled oil.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.920
 - How many times does Godzilla go a day?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.560
 That's not one bash, is it?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.640
 - Well, some animals go all the time,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.040
 like voles, I think, just urinate the whole time.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.840
 - Really? They're just consistently urinating?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.000
 - Well, actually, you're consistently urinating,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.680
 but it's, your kidneys trickle out

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.360
 a milliliter of urine every minute,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.120
 but obviously you can store it in your bladder,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.080
 but voles, I'm pretty sure they just always let it go.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.000
 And birds of prey can sometimes see these tracks of urine,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.960
 and that's what helps them find the voles.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.000
 - Ah, 'cause they're just constantly living,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.320
 leaving a piss trail, basically.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 - Yeah, what's weird though, right?

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.920
 Is that if Godzilla were, if the new Godzilla were real,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.840
 he would take the same amount of time to urinate

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.360
 as the rest of us do, right?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.560
 Because hasn't new research shown that all animals

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.680
 take roughly the same amount of time to wee?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.520
 - To wee? - To wee?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280
 21 seconds, I think, on average?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.440
 - It's all mammals over a certain size, I think.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.080
 So I'm not sure that Godzilla is a mammal.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.760
 - Did someone find out that most dogs urinate

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.440
 in the same direction that they face North,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440
 or they face North West?

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.280
 - Is that true?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.080
 - Well, is it true?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.480
 That's a good question.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.960
 I think it was dogs defecating,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.080
 according to the Earth's magnetic field,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.160
 if I remember the study correctly.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.440
 I didn't look into it into too much detail to see

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.240
 how true it is, but yeah, it was definitely claimed.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.800
 - There is an article online saying that,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 this is the headline, dogs have a butt compass,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.400
 which is the most unpleasant phrase I've heard for a long time.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.880
 - Yeah, less convenient to carry around than a compass as well.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.720
 - Yeah.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.560
 (laughing)

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.320
 - But it would be convenient if you were lost with your dog.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.160
 - With your dog?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.000
 - Absolutely.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.240
 If you were, for example, going to the North Pole

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.640
 and you lost your compass, it's a featureless environment.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.800
 You just have to look at the dogs and think,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.240
 "But Rover has taken a piss in that direction."

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.440
 - It's true, and if you had like five or six dogs

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.400
 and they all started peeing,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.800
 but they were all facing nozzle to nozzle,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.600
 in a big circle, it means you're exactly in the North Pole.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.440
 - Fantastic.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680
 - So we agreed that Godzilla definitely isn't a mammal.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.640
 - Originally Godzilla, the initial idea for Godzilla

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.880
 that it was half gorilla half whale.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.280
 And that's where the word Godzilla comes from.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.480
 Godzilla is a combination.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.080
 And that's where the name, it's the two words

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.000
 smashed together, gorilla whale.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.520
 When they actually made the movie,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.680
 they did make it into a reptile dinosaur prehistoric sort of monster.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.960
 - Well, one of the guys wanted it to be a giant octopus

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.680
 called Udaco, which is very close to Okado,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.560
 which would have been good.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.520
 - Okay, and what was it used in?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.400
 Was it used in a Godzilla versus?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.360
 - No, it was used to deliver groceries.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.720
 (laughing)

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.440
 - In the 1954 one, which is the original?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.120
 - Yeah, the sound of Godzilla roaring was made

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.120
 by rubbing a leather glove up and down a double base strings.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.120
 - Wow.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120
 - Yeah, that's strange.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.120
 I really like low-fi solutions to problems.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.960
 So in Jurassic Park, the sound was, I think,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.120
 tortoises mating.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.960
 - Yeah.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.600
 - The new Godzilla was massive, isn't it?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.520
 Like much bigger than the old Godzilla's.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.600
 - Okay, I think that's interesting.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.200
 The scaling up that happens over the years.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.400
 The bigger and bigger.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.240
 - The website where I found how much urine they produce

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.200
 was deepcnews.com, and it was a postbag I called Dr. M.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.080
 I don't know what his real name was.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.160
 And he, as well as working out the urine,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.640
 he also worked out how much bigger it's gotten

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.480
 in the last 50 years.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.440
 And the 1954 Godzilla was 50 meters tall,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.600
 but the new Godzilla is about 150 meters tall.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.920
 And his idea, his theory is that the reason

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.520
 that it's gotten bigger is because skyscrapers

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.800
 have gotten bigger, and the Godzilla has to be big enough

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.600
 to crush the skyscrapers.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.280
 - That's very interesting.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.440
 - Yeah.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.280
 - That's adapting.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.120
 It's evolution.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.280
 It's very fast evolution.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.280
 - Well, it could be evolution.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.760
 It could be sexual selection.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.640
 So the Lady Godzilla's like male Godzilla's

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.560
 who can crush buildings, and so they have to get bigger.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.160
 - So that's suggesting that there is a Lady Godzilla?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.480
 - Or that this one isn't a Lady.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.080
 I think that in Japanese, they just call it it.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.640
 They don't say it's male or further.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.600
 - So we've never known if it was a male or female.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.520
 - Not to my knowledge.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.960
 - I just think there's a general inflation

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.040
 that goes on with the next film,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.680
 you have to have something even bigger.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.240
 And it's just run away in a way.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.000
 - This guy works it out, that it's getting bigger

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.320
 on a logarithmic scale.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.000
 And he said if they do another one in 2050,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.760
 then the Godzilla will be 288.4 meters tall.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.520
 - Do you guys know what Godzilla breathes out of his mouth?

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.520
 - Yeah, doesn't he breathe like nuclear clouds?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.520
 - It's atomic breath.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.360
 - Atomic breath.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.200
 - That's Godzilla.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.040
 It's not fire.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.680
 I thought it was fire, certainly.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.800
 - You think everything is fire.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.680
 You think the sun is fire then?

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.000
 - I don't believe that that is.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.840
 - I'd like to back down up.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.120
 I also still think the sun is on fire.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.000
 - But yeah, wasn't Godzilla initially

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.720
 a sort of comment on Hiroshima Nagasaki?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.000
 That was why it was had all these nuclear content.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.840
 - It was.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.920
 - It's interesting that the way Godzilla is defeated,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.320
 certainly in the last film, is with military weapons.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.080
 Whereas the whole point of Godzilla is it's a metaphor

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.000
 for nuclear bombs, you know, the most devastating weapons

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.840
 we can come up with.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.480
 So it's kind of missing the point if you just attack him

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.840
 with weapons capable of dealing with it.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.600
 - So we should have beaten him with like a peace treaty?

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.400
 - Yeah, or is it like in the world of the world's way,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.560
 the aliens catch the common cold?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.720
 - Do you think Godzilla would have been as popular amongst

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.440
 like 10 to 15 year old boys?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.640
 If the second half of the film had been like a potstamp

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.120
 around the table, peace treaty.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.520
 (laughing)

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.760
 - Oh, just a lot of people tried to sneeze on him.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.920
 (laughing)

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.640
 - Sorry, can you repeat your last amount?

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.400
 (laughing)

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.120
 - So what I really like about your fact, James,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.480
 which I know you enjoy doing, and I like doing as well,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.040
 is the fact that when you get like an original fact

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.960
 and you work it out and it reminded me of,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.720
 when I think you found in one, three, three, nine facts

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.920
 to make your jaw drop, which is that the Statue of Liberty

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.440
 wears size 879 shoes.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.440
 So I have worked out the shoe size of Godzilla.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.280
 - Have you?

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.720
 - You know, it's the 50 meter Godzilla,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.880
 so it's the original.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.160
 So he wears UK size 1,680 shoes, which sounds weird,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.480
 'cause he's only a little bit taller.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.440
 In fact, the 50 meter is smaller than the Statue of Liberty,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.640
 but he has bigger feet, so there was a press release

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.920
 at the time which gave the measurement of his feet.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.120
 - Did you say 1,680?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.960
 - 1,680.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.680
 - So a US size that's 1,679.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.600
 (laughing)

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.440
 - Yep.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.360
 - It's a part to get them started out.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.200
 - Because the new Godzilla is quite a lot bigger

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.280
 than the other one, a lot of Japanese super fans

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.320
 are really upset that the Americans have just made him fat.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.360
 - So Godzilla's overweight, that's a problem?

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.960
 - They're saying like it's fat from the neck downwards

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.360
 and massive at the bottom.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.440
 This is what Godzilla's super fan,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.360
 Fumiko Abe, told the AFP at a Tokyo exhibition.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.600
 But then they had the premiere, I think,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.120
 a couple of weeks ago, and Gareth Edwards,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.440
 who we have met, who was--

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.560
 - Gareth Edwards came, so the director of the latest

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.440
 Godzilla movie was on museumicuriosity, our radio show.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.120
 He told us at the time that he was gonna be doing Godzilla,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.280
 but it wasn't announced.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.120
 - Oh, did he?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't remember that.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.400
 - Very exciting.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.320
 - But they asked him at the premiere,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.960
 what he thought about these Japanese people

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.200
 saying that Godzilla had got very fat.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.640
 And he said, I just think it's comments like that

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.920
 that give giant monsters an image complex.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.600
 (laughing)

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.800
 He's such a great combat.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.640
 - Yeah.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.920
 - Okay, let's move on to fact number two,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.280
 and that one's yours, Annette.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.200
 - Yeah, this is one of my favorite things I ever found.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.240
 It's that the real Long John Silver from Treasure Island

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.360
 was father to the real Wendy Darling from Peter Pan.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.680
 - The real Long John Silver.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.480
 - The guy on whom Long John Silver is based,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.880
 a guy called William Ernest Henley,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.880
 who was a poet and he wrote the poem "Invictus"

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.760
 by far the most famous thing he did.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.880
 - Was that Nelson Mandela's favorite one?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.720
 - Yes.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.120
 - And Barack Obama quoted it, didn't he?

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.240
 The last verse of it is funeral.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.040
 - Mandela supposedly read it in prison to everyone,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.080
 and that got them all kind of, you know,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.920
 staying positive.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.200
 - It's a fantastic poem.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.600
 - So that's his most famous poem, this guy.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.440
 - Yes, which just, I don't know if this will ever go in,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.600
 but I do really like the last verse, which is,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.560
 it matters not how straight to the gate,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.560
 how charged with punishments, the scroll,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.120
 I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.360
 It is a great poem.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.800
 - So that was the poem written by the man

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.080
 who Long John Silver was based on?

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.920
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.600
 So he was this like full of life guy, had only one leg,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.680
 and Robert Louis Stevenson just thought he was this great guy,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.920
 wrote him a letter after writing Treasure Island saying,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.560
 "I've got to be honest with you, I based Long John Silver on you

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.040
 "because I find you, you know, such an incredible chap."

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.280
 Does anyone read Treasure Island?

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.120
 - Yes, I have.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.040
 - It's extraordinary that we've read it at all,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.960
 because for a long time, no one read his books.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.560
 Robert Louis Stevenson was seen as just a terrible author.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.960
 To the point that when, when in 1973,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.720
 they published a 2,000 page Oxford anthology

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.640
 of English literature, he wasn't mentioned in it at all.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.280
 And now he's one of the 26 most translated authors

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.840
 in the world above Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.160
 but for a long time, no one read him.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.400
 - I don't know much about him.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.320
 I know he died on Samoa.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.200
 - Yes, he's on their postage stamps.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.880
 - And he drank a lot of Guinness.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.960
 It's the only other thing I know about Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.520
 - Right, Samoa, he had it shipped out to him.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.840
 - Wow, that's a long way to ship out Guinness.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.120
 I remember I tried to find the furthest Irish pub

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.120
 from Dublin, and I reckon it's Waxio Shays in New Zealand.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.400
 - So even from there, it's a long way to Samoa.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.480
 - Yep, it must be strange to having somebody based on you.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.640
 Years ago, I received a guy called Lord Berners,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.040
 who was an early 20th century aristocrat and eccentric.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.520
 He built one of the last follies in Britain.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.760
 You know, those towers that go nowhere and are completely pointless.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.080
 He built one of those, and then he put it at the bottom of science

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.400
 saying members of the public committing suicide off this tower

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.880
 do so at their own risk.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.400
 He was a very, very funny guy.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.600
 But he wrote a novel in which he based all of the characters

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.240
 on his friends, but he also cast it as a lesbian schoolgirl story.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.240
 And one of the characters in it, Sitwell, was so angry

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.520
 that he tried to buy every copy of this book

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.280
 in circulation to destroy it.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.520
 - That's a really good way to get good sales, isn't it?

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.320
 - Yeah, pretty much.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.720
 - Isn't that what you have for Titchcock did

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.720
 when he released, I think it was Psycho.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.920
 He bought up as many copies of the novel Psycho as he possibly could

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.520
 because he didn't want the ending to be given away.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.320
 Was it Psycho?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320
 - Yeah, was Psycho?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.280
 - Yeah, you know who Psycho was based on?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.960
 - Yes, it's based on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre guy.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.920
 - It's based on the same guy as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.080
 It's Silence of the Lambs and Psycho

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.440
 they're all based on the same guy called Ed Geene.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.280
 - Oh wow.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.120
 - And he was a big famous serial killer in the world.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.800
 - So a real gift to, you know,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.800
 it's Greenplay writers.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.120
 - Thank you, Ed.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.320
 - But the, if you look at it one way,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.800
 it means there are fewer Psychos out there than you think

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.120
 if they're all based on the same one guy.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.400
 - Yeah, yeah, that's true.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.320
 Oh, he just had such a variety of fictional type quirks.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.600
 - There must be other Psychopaths going,

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.880
 "Why does he get all the gifts?"

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.720
 - Yeah.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.160
 - I'm doing some great killings.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.480
 - And yet, has he won a single Oscar?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.320
 - No.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.960
 - Yeah, another example of the Academy getting it known.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.600
 - Well, Silence of the Lambs won best picture.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.120
 - But he did, my point is, was he invited to the ceremony?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.960
 - What are you wearing today, Ed?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.240
 - Fine, wearing my mother.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.280
 (laughing)

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.080
 - The nipples of all my victims in a belt?

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.440
 - In a, on a lighter note.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.680
 (laughing)

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.080
 - Yeah, just to take us away from nipple wearing.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.080
 When I was looking into Long John Silver,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.040
 I found a porn star, here has a similar name.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.760
 - When you were looking into Long John Silver.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.800
 So his name's Long Dong Silver.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.920
 And Long Dong Silver, he's a retired porn star now.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.240
 But he was famed, obviously,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.920
 for the apparent size of his penis,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.880
 which, it turned out that he was using fake penis

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.040
 during the shoots, which no one really knew about.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.320
 He persuaded a makeup artist who did the makeup

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.960
 for the film "The Elephant Man" to create a prosthetic.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.880
 - I wonder if they felt, well, you know,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.120
 we've got a trunk, yeah.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.360
 (laughing)

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.120
 Actually, the elephant I didn't have a trunk.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.400
 - No, no, no, that would have been the makeup artist going.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.720
 I've done the trunk, and they go,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.920
 no, he's not physically an elephant man.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.080
 What am I going to do with this trunk?

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.840
 (laughing)

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.480
 - Do you think I should quickly explain

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.880
 the Wendy connection?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.720
 - Yes, yes.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.280
 - So we don't, when he met on his Henry,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.120
 was the father to Margaret Henley,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.520
 who was one of the girls who Jay and Barry.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.880
 So he loved playing with children.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.480
 He was always, he loved spending time with children.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.560
 And he used to hang out in Kensington Gardens

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.320
 and entertain the kids and tell them stories.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.720
 And Margaret Henley was one of the girls

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.080
 who used to hang out there with him.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.680
 And she was the person who called him Wendy.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.520
 Wasn't she?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.360
 - Wendy Wendy.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.560
 - Wendy Wendy, which is where,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.360
 we think he got the name Wendy for Peter Pan.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.160
 - Was it right that Wendy was not a name before he came up?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.720
 - It was a very popular name at all,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.640
 but there are some examples before him.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.000
 - The original title of the novel,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.760
 which Peter Pan first appeared in,

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.560
 was going to be the boy who hated mothers.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.760
 - It was pretty dark.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.240
 - Oh, yeah, it is.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.040
 - And Jay and Barry was nicknamed the furry beast

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.240
 by his friends.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.080
 - Yeah.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.920
 - Yeah.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.640
 - He was very, very short and very hersute.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.720
 - He also loved to play cricket, right?

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.560
 - Yeah.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.400
 - And this is extraordinary.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.240
 His cricket team.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.080
 Have you seen his cricket team?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.920
 - The Alahackbury.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.040
 - Yeah, the people on it.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.880
 This was his team.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.120
 H.G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Conan Doyle,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.400
 PG Woodhouse, Jerome K. Jerome, G.K. Chesterton, A.A. Milne,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.240
 and others.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.760
 - This is his cricket team and others.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.360
 - And there's plenty more very famous.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.400
 - Yeah, they're so many.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.840
 - But the thing is, they were a terrible team,

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.040
 and he printed a book of advice for them,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.440
 which had little tips.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.040
 It was in 1893.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.240
 Like, don't practice on an opponent's ground

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.320
 before the match begins.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.080
 This can only give them confidence.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.920
 (laughing)

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.240
 Or, should you hit the ball, run it once,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.880
 do not stop to cheer.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.880
 (laughing)

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.480
 (upbeat music)

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.080
 (upbeat music)

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.680
 - Okay, time to move on to fact number three,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.920
 and that is, I believe, my facts.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.240
 My fact this week is that the tinfoil hats

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.480
 that conspiracy theorists wear in order to stop the government

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.040
 from sending messages into their brain

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.000
 actually does the opposite.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.640
 It amplifies the signal.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.480
 Almost to the point that if there were a thousand people

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.440
 in a crowd and they were the one with the tinfoil hat,

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.320
 that's the only brain that would actually get

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.160
 the brain messages.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.240
 It's like a huge antenna that they're wearing.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.080
 - I don't even know that.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.040
 - Well, it was a study by a bunch of students in the America

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.760
 who just wanted to look into the myth, I guess,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.000
 because people were doing it.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 No one had actually checked it out before.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.520
 And obviously, we don't know how to send messages

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.280
 into people's brains or take them out.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.160
 As far as I know, James is shaking your head as if we do.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.720
 - We don't, yeah, but they're working on it.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.960
 There's been studies done in the last couple of years

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.280
 where people have thought about a word

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.400
 and people have been able to work out what word

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.120
 they were thinking about by measuring their brainwaves.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.240
 But they would work if they were made properly, right?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.920
 So they are meant to be a Faraday cage

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.360
 which stops electricity passing through it.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.320
 - If it fully covered the head and properly tightly fitted it,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.840
 then electromagnetic radiation could not get in.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.880
 But as it is, if it's worn loosely or designed,

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.480
 it's sort of just a skull cap, then it gets in.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.800
 But I love the idea that you would make one

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.080
 that was so good that the government couldn't get in,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.440
 but also then you would immediately asphyxiate.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.640
 (all laughing)

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.080
 - You guys know that the Vatican used a Faraday cage

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.440
 in 2013 to shield the cysteine chapel from its chopping.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.280
 So no one could hear who they were electing as Pope

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.360
 because there was, I think in 2003 was it a Pope

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.600
 before that was elected.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600
 It was thought there was a leak in Germany.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.320
 And so they put a Faraday cage in the Vatican.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.320
 - Wow, massive tin foil cardinals.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.160
 - Cardinals.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.920
 (all laughing)

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.760
 - That's great.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.680
 Have you guys heard of stealthware?

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.040
 This is a company who make clothes

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.640
 that make the wearers invisible to infrared surveillance cameras,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.560
 particularly those on drones.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.320
 So the idea is that you wear these clothes

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.120
 and drones can't see you and it's supposed to be make you safe.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.880
 Say you were being infiltrated by the American government

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.040
 who were looking at you with drones,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.320
 they won't be able to see you anymore.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.880
 They make hoodies, they make full length burgers

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.280
 in this kind of material.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.720
 The burger goes for $2,300.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.520
 The hoodie is $481.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.120
 But unfortunately due to the high cost

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.280
 and limited availability, so far they've only

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.120
 sold one item a scarf.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.240
 (all laughing)

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.200
 - I know where we should put all the secrets in my neck.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.560
 (all laughing)

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.400
 - It's all of them, but not completely.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.760
 - Speaking of hats, useful hats.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.600
 The following quote is from radiologist Richard Gerstle's

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.480
 1950 book How to Survive an Atomic Bomb.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.240
 He said, "If you are caught outdoors in a sudden attack,

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.600
 "a hat will give you at least some protection

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.760
 "from the heat flash."

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.640
 (all laughing)

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.480
 When I say some...

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.560
 - That's true, you probably could mathematically calculate

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.480
 how much it gives you.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.120
 It's just that it won't...

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.080
 - It will, by no means save your life under any circumstances.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.920
 - This is amazing.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.080
 No army at the start of the First World War,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.040
 okay, this order's metal helmets.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.320
 It took until 1915 and thousands and thousands of deaths

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.640
 before they said, you know.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.920
 The German army had a leather,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.040
 just a little leather cap's called a pickle helmet.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.640
 Not until 1950, and people start making these helmets.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.440
 And we have the image of the helmet from the First World War,

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.760
 the kind of shallow, again,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.600
 innovated for the First World War.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.080
 - Francis Galton, who was, I believe,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.600
 a relative of Charles Darwin, he invented a hat, didn't he?

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.040
 Yeah, it was a hat that had an air conditioning device in it,

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.640
 or a little flap that opened the top,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.960
 because it was the idea that if you thought too much

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.800
 about stuff, your head overheated.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.720
 - It doesn't mean my hair is always sinking.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.480
 (all laughing)

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.080
 Weird hats, you mentioned.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.480
 When was it dangerous to wear a hat?

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.760
 Why am I phrasing this like a cute question?

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.520
 'Cause I reckon that you'll get it changed, wasn't it?

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.600
 - When was it dangerous?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.400
 - In stockpot, you used to be attacked

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.680
 if you weren't wearing a hat,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.680
 because they had the hat industry was quite big there,

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.400
 and they thought it was unpatriotic to the town,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.200
 if you weren't actually attacked.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.000
 - Yeah, by verbally or in principle.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.720
 - Well, people throw things at you.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.560
 - Wow.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.000
 - But not as mean as the straw hat riots.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.600
 So in the early 20th century, in New York,

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.360
 past September the 15th,

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.880
 it was socially unacceptable to wear a straw hat.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.440
 It was a summer item.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.800
 And if you wore a straw hat,

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.840
 past September the 15th,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.800
 then it was traditional for youths to come along

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.720
 and knock your hat off your head and trample on it.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.400
 And in 1922, it got out of hand.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.920
 So the straw hat rioters decided to start

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.320
 knocking people's hats off their head a bit early,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.840
 and I think they approached a bunch of dog workers

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.200
 who were wearing straw hats on September the 13th,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.760
 not the hats off, trampled them, started a fight,

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.520
 huge fight riot lasted three days,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.680
 bunch of people ended up in hospital, disaster.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.080
 And in 1924, a guy was murdered for wearing a straw hat

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.160
 after September the 15th.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.080
 So it was a dangerous business actually.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.880
 - Three days of fighting.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.800
 - Three days of riots, the straw hat riots.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.640
 - One last thing on conspiracy theories.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.480
 - Okay.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.040
 - I like the randomness of them,

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.360
 because they're often so connected,

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.640
 but often they also have very strange outputs.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.240
 So I found a list of conspiracy theories online,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.240
 and this was 16 conspiracy theories

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.720
 that have been proved to be true.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.200
 Some day scientists will use millions

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.600
 of genetically modified animals in experiments.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.200
 Scientists all over the world are creating

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.160
 bizarre human animal hybrids.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.720
 Obama is making government employees

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.200
 spy on one another and pro-wrestling is fake.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.040
 (laughing)

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.800
 - That's not the seven on this list.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.080
 (laughing)

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.920
 - Should we move on?

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.960
 - Sorry, sorry, sorry, we were brothers and sisters

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.000
 before, literally brothers and sisters

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.040
 in family connections.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.960
 The guy who came up with the first ever tin hat

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.240
 was Julian Huxley, who was the brother

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.440
 of all the Huxley.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.280
 - No!

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.840
 - Yeah, it was in a short story called The Tissue Culture King,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.480
 about a scientist who is lost in a jungle kingdom,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.240
 and he offers to culture the king's flesh

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.800
 so the subjects can worship him in their home.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.280
 And then this allows the king to exert telepathic power

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.600
 over the entire kingdom.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.160
 And in that story, he says we used caps of metal foil,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.960
 which reduced the effect on ourselves,

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.000
 but it started as a fiction in a short story.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.840
 - Yeah.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.680
 - That is great.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.260
 (upbeat music)

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.960
 (upbeat music)

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.380
 - Okay, moving on to our final fact of the show,

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.220
 and that is Andy.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.700
 - My fact is that geese sometimes fly upside down,

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.340
 to lose height quickly when they're coming into land,

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.260
 rather than doing a long, slow descent.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.900
 They just, it's like a shortcut for them, like a life hack.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.900
 - But the best thing is, they flip their body upside down,

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.260
 but their head and neck stay the right way up.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.820
 - So they do a twist, so that it just looks weird.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.820
 - It looks really bizarre.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.780
 - You see the neck and the head are perfect, you know?

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.940
 And then they've got this weird upside down body

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.300
 flapping away beneath them.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.140
 - Frankie.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.900
 - Yeah, and this is called whiffling.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.340
 - So great.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.740
 - I know geese, the only animal to do that?

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.340
 - I think there are a few others which do it.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.340
 - The description I read is that it looks like

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.940
 they're a falling leap, but they're not mine.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.460
 - Yeah, there's good footage, which we can put up online

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.660
 on the podcast page.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.340
 Yeah, and there are amazing photos of it

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.100
 being captured mid-flight, and it looks brilliant.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.460
 - Yeah, so I started looking up things about flying upside down.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.300
 - Oh, yeah.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.340
 - The planes which are flown upside down.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.940
 - There was that movie, wasn't there?

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.780
 - Flight.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.300
 - Dental Washington, yeah, that's right.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.300
 - The Robert Zermh, heck, I swear.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.140
 - I got distracted.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.420
 This fact should be a lot better research,

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.420
 but I got distracted watching a 10 minute clip from flight.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.580
 - Was it the bit at the start where he crashes,

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.660
 he flies upside down?

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.940
 - Yeah, it was that.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.100
 - Did you see the Boeing issued a statement

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.900
 after the film came out and they said,

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.940
 the MD80 cannot sustain inverted flight.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.380
 The MD80, as with all commercial airliners,

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.220
 was designed to fly upright, so it was a bit, you know.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.860
 - Do you remember that plane that flew under Tower Bridge?

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.940
 - Oh, yeah. - Remember that?

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.780
 - No.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.380
 - Yeah, you must remember it.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.340
 - I remember the Arc de Triomphe one.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.180
 - Go on.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.340
 - Well, in 1919, someone flew a biplane

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.940
 through the Arc de Triomphe, and the Arc de Triomphe is big,

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.260
 but it's not that big.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.700
 And it was the wingspan of the plane,

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.780
 plus a medium meter on either side.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.620
 - Wow.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.100
 - It's such cool footage, and we can put that up online.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.100
 - Yeah, let's put that up.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.780
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.940
 - The guy who flew under Tower Bridge,

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.340
 I was talking about, this guy was called Harker Hunter,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.220
 and he flew under Tower Bridge on the 5th of April, 1968.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.780
 He did it as a, he flew across the Thames

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.460
 as a demonstration against Harold Wilson's government,

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.660
 and he was struck off from the RAF for it, I think.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.140
 And weirdly, there was a quote from him

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.020
 when they asked him about it, and he said,

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.860
 he was flying down the Thames,

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.060
 and he said, until this very instant,

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.060
 I had absolutely no idea that, of course,

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.780
 Tower Bridge would be there.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.300
 (laughing)

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.980
 - What did he think it was gonna be?

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.820
 I don't know.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.460
 - Just going back to the animals in the air very quickly,

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.700
 so he's flying upside down.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.180
 This is something that I've found out weeks ago,

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.100
 and I've mentioned it to you guys a bunch before,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.260
 but we haven't said it on the podcast.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.460
 It's about ladybirds.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.860
 There's, I mean, this really surprised me,

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.500
 that recent research has shown that ladybirds,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.540
 who were thought to have only flown at a height of, say,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.660
 are shoulders, an average human's shoulder height,

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.860
 actually have been found flying at the height of 3,600 feet,

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.980
 and they travel as fast as 37 miles per hour,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.780
 and they can go as far as 74 miles in one journey.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.860
 - Do you know how they find them?

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.700
 - What do you mean?

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.700
 - Well, they originally found this out,

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.620
 'cause obviously you've got to be at that height to find one,

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:23.020
 so they sent up planes with sticky panes and saw what they got.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.220
 That was very early, that was by planes.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.980
 - When you try to swat a fly, you know how,

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.980
 you try to swat it, and you're definitely gonna get it.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.660
 It looks barely conscious, and then it gets away,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.300
 and you don't understand how.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.260
 And apparently this is because the moment they see you coming,

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.260
 they do a somersault rather than just falling

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.220
 and that speeds up their descent.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.580
 So they just drop into a somersault.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.580
 You can sort of imagine it,

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.740
 and I wouldn't be able to explain the physics, maybe you would.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.100
 And then they pick up the air

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.220
 with their wings and fly away.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.220
 - That's so cool.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.060
 - Little somersault.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.660
 - Tennis rocket, that's what you need,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.260
 'cause they can avoid most of the strings,

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.180
 but they can't avoid all of them.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.020
 - Good.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.660
 - Sorry to bring the helicopter down, but.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.500
 - Unlike tennis balls in my experience.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.500
 (laughing)

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.740
 Every time I hit it, I do a little cheer,

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.060
 but then forget to run.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.140
 (laughing)

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.220
 - And this might seem unrelated, but on geese.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.340
 Can we go on geese?

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.500
 - I would almost say that's completely related.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.500
 (laughing)

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.220
 - Goose grabbing was very popular as a sport,

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.980
 and 17th century new Amsterdam,

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.300
 which obviously became New York.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.500
 And the way it was used smear the neck of a goose

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.100
 with soap or something slippery,

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.700
 and you hang the goose upside down,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.420
 and a bunch of competitors ride towards it on horses,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.940
 and the aim is to try and rip it's head off.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.860
 - Oh, sorry.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.780
 - Do you remember we did what used as a goose on cue?

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.780
 (laughing)

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.620
 - Yeah.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.100
 - Remember that, we came up with loads of different things

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.660
 that you can use geese for.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.620
 - Oh, yeah. - 'Cause they were used

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.860
 as guard dogs in ancient Rome and various different--

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.860
 - They were used to turn spits in the kitchen,

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.700
 which was grabbed the handle

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.020
 and turn it around, slowly in the kitchen.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.860
 - That's great.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.300
 - Have you heard of the goose crusade?

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.940
 And I was during the crusades.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.620
 There was a group of crusaders slightly mad.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.980
 They somehow managed to believe

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.820
 that a goose was filled with a holy spirit.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.980
 And so they worshipped him and used him as a guide

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.500
 to find their way to Jerusalem.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.660
 - Like the compass direction every time he did a little goose poo.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.020
 (laughing)

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.060
 'Cause that should be east.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.060
 (laughing)

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.180
 Wow, I'm still stunned by that cruelty of that.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.700
 - Yeah, well, when James mentioned the goose rebellion,

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.700
 I thought what was it called?

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.220
 - The goose crusade. - The goose crusade.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.420
 - What are they called a goose age?

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.540
 'Cause that is some kind of disgusting drink.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.060
 (laughing)

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.420
 - God, progress movie.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.140
 - Life gives you geese, make goose age.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.980
 (laughing)

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.580
 (upbeat music)

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.860
 - Okay, that's it for another podcast.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.420
 That is all of our facts, thanks so much everyone for listening.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.380

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.900
 - James.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.060
 - @EdShaped.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.140
 - Anna, still fighting against the avalanche of requests

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.500
 coming through to us on Twitter and Facebook

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.460
 to get her on there.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.140
 - #GetAnnerOnTwitter.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.660
 (laughing)

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.140
 - #BuggerOffAllOfYou.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.460
 (laughing)

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.620
 - So in the meantime, you can get her on @Quikipedia

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.180
 or you can go to the page that she creates

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.140
 for each of every single one of these episodes,

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.380
 which is qi.com/podcast.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.980
 And we're gonna have pictures and videos and links

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.460
 to all the stuff that we've been talking about in this episode.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.180
 We're gonna be back again next week with another set of facts,

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.620
 so we'll talk to you then.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.460
 Catch you later.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.300
 Goodbye.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.880
 (upbeat music)

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.460
 (upbeat music)

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:35.360
 (upbeat music)

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.360
