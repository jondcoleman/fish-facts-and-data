00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 Hi everyone, Dan here, welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.680
 Before we get started, we just want to let you know that we have now completed our run

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.840
 for the first series of our TV show No Such Thing as the News.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.320
 If you missed it and you want to see it, head to No Such Thing as the News.com,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.280
 where we have all of the episodes either on iPlayer for viewers in the UK

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.800
 or on YouTube for everyone who's international.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.160
 Please watch them, we love making them, hopefully we'll get to make more.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.360
 But in the meantime, here's another episode,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.040
 and you'll notice James is away this week, he's in Transylvania, so we have,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.120
 in his place, another QIL, Stephen Colgan.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.160
 Steve's just actually published a book, it's called "Why Did The policeman Cross the Road?"

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.560
 How to solve problems before they arise.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.920
 It's in bookshops now, it's an amazing book, it's all about his time when he was a police officer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.560
 and all the problems he had to solve as a part of Scotland Yards Problem Solving Unit.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.960
 How cool is that sound? Okay, that's it, on with this week's show.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.440
 [Dance Music]

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:12.800
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 coming to you from the QIL offices in Covenant Garden.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.040
 My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with Annachosinski, Andy Murray, and Stephen Colgan.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.760
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.360
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.160
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that heart surgeons now perform surgery

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.960
 while wearing 3D glasses.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 3D glasses, like the ones you get in the cinema.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.320
 They're slightly more modern, but they are 3D glasses.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.080
 To get other special effects as well, like, to someone blowing their faces while they're doing their final prayer bit of order.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.160
 Then that's a 4D operating experience. That's true, yeah.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.800
 The reason they do this is because with heart surgery, a lot of the way that they do heart surgery now

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.600
 is via camera going in, because they can't get into such delicate spots, so they have to watch it on a camera.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.200
 And so it's really hard to know if you're further than you think you are, or if you're not close enough,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.760
 it's just hard to get perception.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.360
 So what they realize that they could do is by adding a 3D camera to the thing that goes into the body.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.960
 You could then wear the 3D glasses, and you would have total immersive and proper experience of a 3D operation.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960
 It's insane.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.200
 Plus you look awesome.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.280
 These aren't the old red and green ones, are they?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.480
 So they're slightly more modern, so yeah.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.800
 I have been to the cinema to like to clarify since 2005.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.640
 They said that, but even the ones in the cinema, they actually can reduce the brightness of the screen by up to 88%.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.040
 So should they be able to light it quite well?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.280
 Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe that's the modification.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 But when they used to do it with the 2D normal operations, it would take something like two hours longer or four hours longer,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.120
 because it was so hard, you had to be so careful.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.800
 And now with these glasses, they can do things at twice the speed.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.160
 They have the time of what the operation should be.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
 So it's just, yeah, it's amazing.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.480
 Well, the whole 3D things are very interesting area anyway, because a few years ago hearing Andy Neiman go out about this,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.600
 because Andy Neiman, the magician and Ratti, he's a huge fan of 3D movies.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.680
 And he was saying that 3D was kind of brought into cinemas as a way of fighting back against new technologies,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.640
 that the cinemas were worried that people would stop going to the cinemas.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.360
 So like in the 1950s, it was because of the rise of television in the late 70s and early 80s,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.960
 because of video coming along.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.720
 And in the modern age, it was because of computers in the internet.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.560
 And that's what I was saying. And people would go, oh my god, people aren't going to go to the cinema anymore.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.080
 So 3D kept coming back as a gimmick over and over again.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.920
 But now they spent so much money on the infrastructure, we can't get rid of it now.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920
 Wow. I didn't know that.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.320
 It was kind of stuck with it, yeah.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.760
 These people should have watched more knockoff DVDs and realized most of them,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.160
 the sound is out of sync with the visions and it cuts off halfway through anyway.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.880
 So cinemas are safe.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880
 Safe bet.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.760
 Well, if you go to the cinema and you hate watching 3D movies,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.840
 but you happen to be in a 3D movie,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.800
 you can now buy and it's been for a while 2D glasses that turn a 3D movie back into 2D.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.560
 So this is on.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.000
 If you go to 2D-glasses.com, you can now buy these glasses.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.640
 And it's basically the guy who invented them, his wife hated going to 3D movies.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.520
 So he invented it so that she would still come to the movies, but get the 2D experience.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.600
 Well, I was looking into this a bit more and looking at a few medical papers about this.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.400
 And apparently there's 12% of people who can't see 3D anyway.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.120
 Well, when they were in the glasses, yeah.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.880
 Wow. Wow.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.880
 Is that due to visual impairment?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.960
 Yeah, well not impairment, it's just that the rods and cones and the eyes can pick it up very clearly.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.000
 Wow. So these are people with 2020.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.640
 Yeah, it's people who otherwise have got good vision.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.040
 Amazing. The other thing is the rods and cones in your eyes, they discovered last year,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.280
 your eyes actually do see 3D separately.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.880
 So your eyes can actually see each eye, can actually see 3D on its own.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.400
 What?

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.080
 When that's combined with parallax, which is where you're seeing it from two slightly different viewpoints from each eye,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.800
 that gives you perfect 3D vision.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.600
 So they don't reckon that the 3D vision that we see in cinemas is actually anywhere near as close to real 3D vision anyway.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.080
 That's really amazing because we obviously just think the only reason we see 3D is because we've got two.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.680
 Well that's the parallax thing, isn't it? You see things from two slightly different viewpoints.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.840
 The brain superimposes them, but apparently each one of your eyes can actually detect 3D anyway on its own.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.800
 Apparently there are three or four different things that come together to give us 3D vision.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.480
 And a couple of those we've got anyway, because even if you shut one eye,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.240
 you've still got a fairly good idea of how far things are away.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.000
 It's only when things get close to your eye, like you're trying to thread a needle that it all goes completely to pot.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.200
 Wow, yeah.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.400
 So I was distracted because Anna was launching her hand into her own face.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.000
 I was practicing my one eye 3D vision, and all it made me think is I'm really short-sighted in my left eye.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.120
 I was looking into surgical innovations and things that surgeons are doing now that are improving medicine.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.000
 And I've been corresponding with a couple of doctors who have told me amazing things.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.880
 And I just wanted to mention them, they're called Peter Brindley at Martin Beat.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.520
 Well no, this isn't about personal ailments or anything, is it?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.640
 No, it's like, although they've assured me it will clear up in four to six weeks if I keep putting the ointment on.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.600
 Okay, get this. To train surgeons, one thing you can do is simulate smells for them.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.240
 Smells of particular things in an operating room.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:13.680
 So there are cookbooks available online where you can cook up the smell of internal organs or cerebral spinal fluid,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.600
 or whatever it might be to sort of train surgeons more effectively for when they actually get under operating.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.800
 Wow, that's cool.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.640
 Why is identifying a smell?

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.280
 Well, I don't think a smell is useful medically, is it?

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.320
 To identify a disease.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.200
 So yeah, so a lot of people could diagnose while you're going.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.400
 Oh, okay, you shut yourself.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:39.440
 I was reading, there was an article on cracks written by a surgeon saying some secrets of the trade.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.680
 And he was recounting, so he recounted two quite amusing things.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.040
 One was that at one point a man woke up while he was restarting his heart because they'd have to give him,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.960
 I think a dose of adrenaline to get his heart going and maybe it was too much the man woke up.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.440
 And this surgeon said, "When he saw a resident elbow deep in his organs, he gave us the exact look,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.040
 you picture somebody having when they wake up to find a stranger's hands inside their chest."

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.680
 We all know that, though.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.760
 I was like, the position of a masterful.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.040
 He looked at us exactly like we were doing the thing that we were doing.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.920
 Yeah, I read a few articles about doctors revealing secrets about surgery and stuff.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.600
 One weird one, I wish I wrote it down.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.120
 This is just going from memory, but about how, with every surgery, if you're a man getting surgery,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.920
 they have to hold and squeeze the penis just to make sure there's no urine in it.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.000
 Dan, I think you've been had.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.480
 If that's the excuse he gave you.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.760
 Where were you at the time?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.960
 If you weren't in a hospital, then he said he was a doctor.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.760
 My mum's never going to consent to another general anesthetic, now she knows that's outrageous.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.560
 Yeah, I don't know how they get it out of the ladies, actually.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.520
 Yeah, that's true.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.800
 We probably have a doctor to pick him up and take him away from him for the fact.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.000
 I did read some stuff about, I mean, you talked about a keyhole surgery earlier.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.760
 There have been a number of scientific papers, people looking at whether people playing video games

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.400
 give them skills that will make them better surgeons in the future.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.320
 And there's one particular paper I was looking at, which was called "The Impact of

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.880
 Video Games on Training Surgeons in the 21st Century," which was kind of looking at all the

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.880
 existing papers that have been written on it and bringing all the data together.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.000
 And apparently they found that current video game players made 32% fewer errors

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.800
 when they were involved in doing surgical work and performed 24% faster.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.520
 It will be all that time spending in your bedroom.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.640
 It could mean you're going to be a really good keyhole surgeon one day.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.600
 Yeah, you're not allowed to be stoned when you perform surgery, though.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.960
 So that's what I'll first of all.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.680
 The worry about thing is cool, so there are surgeons who now perform operations routinely

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.720
 from like 400 kilometres away from their patients, aren't they?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.680
 There's this guy called Mr. Tickle.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.960
 Yeah, no, there's this guy called Mecharan Anvari, who does almost all of his operations

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.800
 on different continents, and he just does it.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.880
 But you put this sort of console on your head.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.480
 It looks like one of those things that, when women get their hair permed in hairdressers,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.240
 it's like one of those and then you just control that and you're remotely controlling.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.800
 Exactly.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.520
 But there was one, so I think the most used one is the DaVinci surgical system,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.800
 and that's used in about 200,000 operations worldwide.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.000
 And it's a virtual reality thing.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.120
 So you stick your head in a console and you can be in a different room,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.640
 but your voice will blast into the patient's room while you're on the surgery.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.320
 So you can tell the nurse is what to do.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.280
 Oh, blast clip.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.960
 This is the voice of the surgeon.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.320
 Well, one doctor said, I've heard one surgeon get carried away while doing this in shout.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.320
 I'm Conan the fucking barbarian.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:45.760
 Okay, it is time to move on to fact number two, and that is Steve.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.800
 Okay, my fact is that one day we may all be drinking pigeon milk.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.720
 First of all, I should say that pigeon milk isn't milk like we get from cows,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.480
 because birds can't lactate.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.640
 It's actually produced in the bird's crop, a little space between the throat and the stomach,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.080
 where birds will store food, sometimes to soften it up before swallowing.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.680
 But sometimes, if they're looking after young, they can keep food in to regurgitate to the young later.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.080
 And there are some species of bird pigeons are one of them that actually can make

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.680
 a kind of secretion in that crop to feed the young birds.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.760
 And they generally do it when the birds are first hatched.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.920
 It's a bit like, you know, in humans, you get colostrum.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.280
 You get the stuff that mother first produces when babies are born.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.080
 And it allows the baby to put on weight very quickly, and it also feeds their immune system.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.200
 Well, this stuff does the same job, and they reckon it's part of the reason

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.760
 that pigeons are able to survive so well in cities.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.600
 So is this why we're going to be drinking it?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.800
 We need to survive in cities.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.960
 What they're saying is that they might be able to switch on some parts of the DNA in pigeon milk,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.200
 and put it into other animals milk that we do drink,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.200
 which means that milk won't taste any different, but it'll actually boost our immune system.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.240
 Oh, okay.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.440
 So they sort of secrete it, don't they, pigeons, from the crop?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.000
 It's like curd, is she like?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.960
 Yeah, it's like cottage cheese, texture, isn't it?

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.840
 Yeah, that's a pretty thick secretion.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.280
 Yeah, well here it is.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.560
 Because the crop is sort of lined with these cells which are full of fat,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.400
 and those are the cells which extrude this milk.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.200
 Oh, okay, right.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.560
 Yeah, so I was looking into birds which produce milk.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.920
 You've got pigeons, where both sexes can do it.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.640
 You've got flamingos, where both sexes can do it, and you've got penguins.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.440
 Emperor penguins, only the males produce milk.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.280
 Oh, wow, a feminist society.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.040
 Basically, yeah.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.720
 But I was looking into the flamingo milk because I thought that sounds like a cool thing.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.600
 And it turns out flamingo milk also pink.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.160
 Oh, yes, I was so hoping you were going to say that.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.280
 So there's been a load of studies done, especially at Exeter University by guy called Paul Rose.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.400
 Everything is pink.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.880
 Okay, so we all know flamingos pink, but the milk is pink.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.600
 The inside of a flamingo's egg is pink.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.840
 The egg yolk of a flamingo egg is pink.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.000
 The skin is pink.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.800
 When they get the breeding season, they decide how they're going to have sex.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.240
 They're all hanging around together.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.120
 And one of them goes deep pink, he sort of flushes.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.360
 And if all the other birds start to go pink, they all start breeding.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.840
 So going pink is a way of saying I'm ready to meet with you.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.960
 Yeah, and presumably it just depends how attractive the flamingo that's gone pink is.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.360
 Yeah.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.880
 Because either all of them do it or only one or two of them do it, and then they feel embarrassed.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.840
 Okay.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.360
 So the reason they're pink is that they eat the algae and the little shrimp things which are pink.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.600
 So this is a whole species that goes around thinking it's a colour that it's not.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.680
 Yeah, and it's just because they've got a weird diet.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.360
 It's a one day they'll just have a new food taste or that bacterial diet out.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.160
 And then they'll go back to their normal colour and be like, what?

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.960
 Yeah.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.480
 Why aren't we eating flamingo eggs with pink yolk every day?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.160
 Because it's harder to store flamingos than it is to store chickens.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.920
 Because you just need slightly taller...

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.360
 Taller-coote buildings.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.360
 That's it.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.080
 You could just drill a hole in the top for the head to poke out.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.320
 You're getting trouble for that.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.680
 Oh, one shop.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.400
 It was either...

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:04.880
 I can't remember.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.520
 Maybe it was M&S.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.080
 They sold recently double yolk eggs.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.040
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.600
 There's about one egg in a thousand, has two yolks out.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.480
 I've never had.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.840
 How did they find out where they're opening it?

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.120
 I think they can scan them and detect two yolks.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.840
 That's very good.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.120
 You say, wow, as if that's the most advanced technology you've ever heard.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.800
 They can just use an X-ray camera to see inside an egg.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.960
 No, I just thought it's a lot of effort, isn't it?

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.840
 To buy the scanning machine, to buy the eggs.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.320
 Absolutely.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.880
 To give away...

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.800
 To throw away the other eggs.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.360
 I don't think so.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.560
 That was 99 eggs, was smashed.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.200
 You should throw the rest away.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.000
 Back to pigeons very quickly.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.720
 There's a theory that pigeons killed a lot of Tyrannosaurus rexes.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.240
 The only issue with the pigeon is it needed to die in order to kill the T-Rex.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.480
 And that was to be eaten by the T-Rex.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.720
 Paleontologist called Dr. Steve Salisbury,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.840
 University of Queensland, has been looking into it.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.360
 And he says that, basically, they have evidence of avian infectious disease and dinosaurs.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.840
 And they noticed it in the back of their jaws,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.680
 these little holes in the back of their jaws,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.320
 which could only have got there by eating something.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.080
 And so pigeons could carry this disease, but they were immune to it.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.680
 And so the T-Rexes were eating pigeons, which is an amazing image.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.080
 If you think, I mean, I didn't know how far back pigeons went,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.720
 but the disease would then carry through to their jaw.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.680
 And that would be a bacterial infection that just destroyed them.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.400
 Wow.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.280
 That's very cool.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.720
 Everything killed the dinosaurs, didn't it?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.320
 I'm amazed that they survived so long.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.440
 Apparently it's like an earthquake, a great global event.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.400
 They all drowned.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:38.960
 A pigeon.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.000
 A Martian invasions.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.800
 Mocking.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.040
 It's true.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.720
 Have you ever seen, I mean, people always say,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.920
 you know, you never see baby pigeons.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.160
 Well, there is a good reason for that because they stay in the nest a lot longer.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.760
 They don't fled journey like a lot of other birds.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.840
 They stay in their for ages, saying feed me.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.760
 But if you ever see one in a nest,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.360
 it looks remarkably like a dodo.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.280
 It's got this huge, really.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.600
 Well, dodo's are the closest known relations.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.320
 What?

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.120
 Dodo's are pigeons.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.760
 Dodo's are pigeons.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.400
 Yeah.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.320
 I have learnt so much in the same thing.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.600
 They can fly, they do backward somersaults pigeons and no one knows why.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.800
 Is this in the, it's in the hair or on a branch?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.520
 In the air.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.600
 So there's a pigeon called a Birmingham roller,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.680
 which is called that because it does this rolling.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.560
 And yeah, we don't know why,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.560
 but it seems like they might just do it because they like it.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.640
 And one of the reasons we think they might like it is because

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.880
 before they do the somersault when they're in the air,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.800
 apparently they engage in arching, frequent arching and wing clapping.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.120
 They just start clapping their wings together and excitement

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.640
 at the fact that they're about to do an awesome trick.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.400
 Of course they pre-applaud their efforts.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.200
 Yeah, get it going, guys.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.160
 Get the floors going.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.120
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.240
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.320
 And that is Chazinski.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.720
 My fact this week is that books used to be stacked

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.240
 with the spines facing in woods.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.680
 That's amazing.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.480
 It's so ridiculous.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.840
 It's so weird.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.360
 It's just so weird that this is more widely known.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.320
 So the reason this happened, which is really interesting.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.640
 And I learned this when I discovered a book called

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.440
 "The Book on the Bookshelf" by Henry Petrosky.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.960
 He found out that they did this because books were incredibly precious

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.320
 back in medieval times.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.120
 Almost always the last thing you would do to a book after you'd found it

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.000
 is send it to a jeweler and a goldsmith to get it all decorated.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.040
 They had lots of like really precious diamonds and jewels on them.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.760
 Book chazzled.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.760
 Book chazzled, exactly.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.880
 So they were really precious.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.880
 And so then they were always chained.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.160
 Or they were usually chained to the shelves where they were stored.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.440
 And they'd usually be in monasteries.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.280
 It was mainly kind of monks who had books.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.720
 And obviously it's easier to chain a book to a bookshelf or a cupboard

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.160
 if you're doing it via the spine.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.360
 Because you can just put the chain through the spine.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.400
 Oh yeah, yeah.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.000
 And so that's how they attached them.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.240
 See, I kind of assumed it was something to do with fading

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.880
 or something like that.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.800
 Because I've got some quite old books at home.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.480
 And the spine is much more faded than the actual front and backpapers are.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.200
 Oh really?

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.680
 Because the spines were sort of the least desirable part.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.480
 They were almost something you should hide like the hinge of a door.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.080
 Yeah, it's sort of philosophical.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.600
 But Trosky says that shelving books with the spines in was must have seemed

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.520
 as natural and appropriate a thing to do as to put the winding machinery of a clock

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.200
 toward the wall or behind a door.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.600
 Cool, but still a nightmare trying to find a book in a library.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.520
 Yeah, and you can imagine it just walking in there.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.040
 Just face to it with all the pages.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.720
 Yeah, I see that.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.680
 Okay, there is a library in Dublin called Marsh's Library.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.320
 Yeah.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.520
 It's a really early public library.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.840
 And they don't have chained books because chain books is obviously to keep them safe

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.840
 just in case people want to just connect them or anything.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.880
 So they don't have chain books.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.720
 But they do have cages which you have to sit in if you want to read certain books.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.280
 What?

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.480
 Wow.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.880
 And they're really nice cages.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.200
 I mean, they're not what you're picturing.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.840
 But they are sections of the library little alcos with girls across them

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.240
 and you get sort of shot in there with the really precious books.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.920
 What's so you're like a zoo animal?

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.880
 People can observe what a human reading looks like.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.000
 Yeah, cage reading.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.120
 cage reading.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.760
 The next extreme sport.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.960
 I was looking into libraries generally when I was researching this topic

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.880
 because old libraries are really fascinating.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.120
 The systems that they used to run by.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.440
 And I was reading about, and this is from the independent

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.680
 about how the New York Public Library has unearthed this huge file

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.040
 of questions submitted to them by members of the public.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.960
 So before the internet, before Google, where would you get your information?

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.200
 If you needed it immediately, you would go to your library

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.840
 and you would submit a question and have them answer it for you.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.040
 And the librarian would go off and look for it and either call you back

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.680
 or just next time you're in, give you the answer.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.160
 And they published some of their favorite questions.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.440
 So they include, why do the 18th century English paintings

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.960
 have so many squirrels on them?

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.640
 And how did they tame them so they wouldn't bite the painter?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.880
 So that was from 1976.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.040
 And they have it on a little card that they've counted.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.920
 1976 as far as that drug you.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.000
 Yeah, from 1956, what kind of apple did Eve eat?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.440
 And then this telephone call, mid afternoon, New Year's Day, 1967.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.640
 I have two questions.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.800
 The first is a sort of an etiquette one.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.680
 I went to a New Year's Eve party and unexpectedly stayed over.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.280
 I don't really know the hosts.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.040
 Or to I to send a thank you note.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.520
 Second, when you meet a fellow and you know he's worth $27 million

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.720
 because that's what they told me, $27 million.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.400
 And you know his nationality.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.600
 How do you find out his name?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:22.880
 You can see why she was desperate to track that guy down again.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.640
 Yeah, I'll start with a thank you note, actually.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.640
 And I'd say, by the way, the man wearing the gold suit from last night,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.440
 what was his name?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.120
 So 1976, you're saying, wow, as far as then,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.040
 people still sending in questions.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.040
 The library, the New York Public Library,

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.920
 have said that they still get 1,700 questions a month to take.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.280
 Wow, so they are the original Google, right?

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.880
 Librarians are the original Google.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.840
 And now it's kind of exactly the same situation as black cabs and Uber, I think, isn't it?

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.240
 So now, presumably, librarians just can say Google it

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.960
 and they're putting these old school knowledgeable ones out of business.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.680
 Just like the way that cabbies now will say, just Uber it.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.760
 So this is the thing, you were talking about old libraries, Dan.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.200
 So in very early monasteries and libraries and places where books were extremely

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.840
 precious, right?

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.440
 Some places had a system where the librarian has a key, right?

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.840
 And all the books are kept in trunks.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.520
 You know, he's great big trunks.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.880
 But there are also two other locks and there are two other keys.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.320
 And you have to have all three people present, all three librarians,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.760
 for someone to borrow a book.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.760
 Wow, what a crown jewel!

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.600
 There's so valuable.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.000
 And then there's a ritual of book return as well.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.680
 So I'm quoting here,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.560
 the librarian shall read the statement as to the manner in which brethren

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.040
 have had books during the past year, as a monastery.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.840
 As each brother hears his name pronounced, he is to give back the book

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.840
 which had been entrusted to him for reading.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.720
 And he, whose conscience accuses him of not having read the book

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.080
 through which he had received,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.080
 is to fall on his face, confess his fault, and in treat forgiveness.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.160
 And I think that's right for return to libraries.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.280
 Absolutely.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.360
 A little powerful and a fine, isn't it?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.920
 I did find out what the biggest fine-waver was for a library book.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.400
 Yeah, surprisingly modest actually.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.640
 It was $345.14.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.120
 What?

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.920
 That was a lot, isn't it?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.000
 But it was a two cents a day for a poetry book, Days and Deeds,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.600
 which was booked out of the Kennewee Public Library in Illinois in 1955.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.200
 And they found it in her house 47 years later.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:23.680
 Wow.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.480
 But 47 years, only accrued $345, which in current money is about $200 and 3 quid.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.200
 That's good to know.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.400
 So surprisingly modest.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.560
 Do you know someone who was responsible for a cool bit of book innovation

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.840
 as then in the way we see books?

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.960
 It was Lewis Carroll.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.440
 Really?

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.400
 Yeah, so in 1876 he wrote to his publisher saying,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.640
 "Guys, could you please put the name of the book on the outside on the dust jacket?"

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.840
 Really?

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.080
 Yeah, so dust jacket, this is a really interesting thing.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.600
 You used to not have dust jackets on books at all,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.080
 and then you developed really nice bindings, like Hannah says,

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.360
 and you would then have a dust jacket to protect against the dust,

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.400
 but it was plain, and you just throw it away once you'd opened the book.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.920
 It was just unnecessary packaging.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.800
 And then they started having transparent dust jackets,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.880
 so you could see a bit of the spine.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.560
 And then eventually people started drawing on the dust jackets,

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.400
 and they started in about the 1830s.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.560
 And in 1876 Lewis Carroll had to ask his publishers,

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.680
 though, "Can you put the name of the book on the spine of the dust jacket?"

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.800
 So it was still not widespread, even then, I think.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.600
 Wow.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.400
 Yeah.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.880
 People often say that he invented putting the name of the book on the spine.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.160
 I don't know if that's true.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.080
 People often say, "This is a good idea on 19th century figures and books."

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.560
 So Humphrey Davey, who's an extremely famous chemist,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.080
 who we've talked about before, who discovered a bunch of metals, famous metals,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.760
 and who is important in electricity and battery making,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.760
 he never wanted to waste time by being tempted to read the same book again.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.400
 So every time he finished a book, he destroyed it.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.760
 He mutilated it, so he would never be tempted to go back and reread it.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.400
 Whoa.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.840
 Did you do it as you read?

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.080
 Repaid, did he tear off?

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.840
 I'm never reading this again.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.920
 And then he gets to, "Wait, who was that character?"

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.680
 That's amazing.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:15.760
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.920
 My fact is that in May, an internal memo by the Egyptian government

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.520
 on how to crush the press was accidentally sent out to the press.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.080
 It's so pleasing.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.280
 So Egypt is a very repressive government,

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.000
 and they're constantly arresting journalists and things like that.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.200
 And they, in May, sent out memos to journalists

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.120
 from the Ministry's official email account

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.840
 about how to counter this news media campaign,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.560
 which was saying, by the way, the government keep arresting journalists,

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.520
 and they were saying, "Oh, well, we can stop all coverage related to this."

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.560
 We can undermine the credibility of the journalist union,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.920
 and we can monitor news websites around the clock with more staff.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.160
 And it was basically this whole series of measures

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.360
 designed to shut down the press.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.360
 And then they put it out as a press release, basically.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.120
 Oh, my God, I'm fantastic.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.240
 Yeah, and I got this from a report in the economist

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.640
 about press freedom and loads and loads of it not happening.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.760
 It's a world all over the world.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.080
 So lots of people are being arrested.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.240
 There was someone in Thailand who was prosecuted recently

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.400
 for being sarcastic about the king's dog.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.040
 Wow.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.920
 Yeah, really?

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.240
 It's quite hard to prove sarcasm.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.440
 It's one of that, because you can always just say I was being genuine.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:23.760
 Yep.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.640
 Or you can say, "Oh, yeah, I was being really genuine."

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.560
 I think you will still get locked up, of course.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.680
 It's worth a try.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.600
 My favorite thing that's happened recently

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.760
 in terms of freedom of expression

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.440
 and people getting oppressed for, for instance, satirising.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.400
 Leaders is your favorite impression story.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.960
 I'm really big into those, yeah.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.000
 No, that's not true.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 No, my favorite thing that's happened along these lines

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.960
 was in December 2015 in Turkey

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.520
 when a Turkish guy was on trial

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.880
 and he'd been accused of insulting the president again

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.160
 because he compared him to Golem from Lord of the Rings.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.160
 And the trial had to be adjourned

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.160
 because it turned out that the judge on trial

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.520
 hadn't read Lord of the Rings.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.200
 And so it was impossible to assert

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.200
 whether or not this was an insult.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.160
 And in the end, they had to call in five experts

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.320
 to deduce whether or not comparing

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.960
 the president to Golem was an insulting thing to do

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.200
 and to decide whether or not Golem was an evil character

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.720
 or a good character.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.720
 Completely five as well.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.320
 What did you show the film?

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.920
 No, because it takes...

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.760
 Because they needed the experts to interpret it.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.240
 So they had two academics, two psychologists

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.720
 and a movie/television expert.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.520
 Marker mode.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:41.040
 Eventually Peter Jackson got involved.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.600
 He released a statement or he tweeted

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.160
 saying that actually it shouldn't have been seen as insulting

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.520
 because smegel in fact, which is who was depicted in the satire,

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.400
 it was a very good character, a lovable and honest guy

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.480
 who should never be confused with Golem.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.680
 So he got his aura in?

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.520
 Swing it in favour of the defendant?

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.160
 I think it was concluded at the end of the trial

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.280
 that it's not insulting to compare someone to Golem.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:03.760
 Oh good.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.360
 Well, we can say that President Erdogan is exactly like Golem then, can't we?

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.760
 And we can't do that because in Germany, for example,

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.440
 a poet wrote a poem about saying

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.600
 that President Erdogan has sex with goats

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.640
 and has been arrested.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.760
 And I think is awaiting charges now.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.800
 Because there are laws against insulting foreign heads of state.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.960
 There's a huge thing across Europe as well.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.920
 So in Iceland, I think you can get up to six years in prison.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.280
 I mean, something insane like that.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.360
 Well, for insulting, not your own head of state,

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.480
 but a foreign head of state.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.440
 Yeah, that is mad.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.760
 Well, they have to call in people to decide whether it's offensive

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.280
 to say someone has sex with goats.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.520
 I don't know, yeah, I think five.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.720
 There was quite a big international incident

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.560
 of an insult that was done recently

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.880
 between the president of Argentina and Pope Francis.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.120
 And basically, the president of Argentina

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.160
 made a huge charitable donation towards a cause

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.480
 that Pope Francis had set up and been talking about.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.840
 The amount that this guy gave was 16,666,000 pesos,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.680
 which is roughly just under $1.2 million American dollars.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.480
 But it contained the number 666 in it.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.640
 And the Pope was convinced that that was a deliberate move by him.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.360
 To sort of insult him and sort of undermine him.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.360
 So he rejected the charitable donation.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.720
 Well, it contained the number.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.360
 So it was like 16,666,666 right there.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.480
 I think we've done on QI.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.120
 That it's not 66661616.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.800
 Although it is just about possible

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.800
 that the Pope isn't an avid QI fan.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.040
 He's going to feel like a fool when he gets that clax.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.520
 As he's watching the show.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.240
 I'm quite fond of gaps with politicians.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.280
 It was a great one in 2013 when the Australian opposition leader, Tony Abbott,

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.920
 was criticizing the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and said,

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.960
 "No one, however smart, however well educated, however experienced,

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.560
 is the suppository of all wisdom."

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.040
 I can't handle that one.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.000
 I'm sorry, yes.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.440
 Do you know that George Bush senior,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.680
 when he was president, threw up on the Japanese Prime Minister?

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.520
 I mean, he did have an intestinal flu at the time, or so he claimed.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.320
 But what was really funny is that it actually became a phrase for vomiting in Japanese,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.680
 it's just going to do a bush, or Bushu-Zuru.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.960
 He's to do a bush.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.840
 He's to throw up.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.360
 He's to throw up.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.360
 I love you say that he had an intestinal problem, or so he claimed.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.640
 So this suggestion is he might have just managed to bring voluntary vomit out of his mouth.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.360
 To insult Japanese Prime Minister.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.120
 Is that what we're saying?

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.320
 Finger down the throat, excuse me.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.520
 Do you see one as well recently?

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.200
 This is quite a big gap.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.080
 Queen's Honours list this year, a lot of amazing people on it,

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.320
 and they included by accident two serving soldiers from the SAS.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.520
 They released their names.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.600
 They're still active, and it's the first time ever that that's happened.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.440
 Yeah, and so they had to immediately delete it.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.720
 And the newspapers have been quite good.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.360
 They've not published their names, but they were on there.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.560
 Oh, wow.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.360
 We're here to reveal that.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.280
 James Harker.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.040
 Mark Kamo.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.720
 That was a bit like, in 2003, there was a schoolgirl in Devon called Clem McDonald.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.760
 She was 15, and she suddenly started getting emails from the Pentagon.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.400
 And she got about 11 emails a week.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.400
 They were full of state secrets, they came from a Ministry of Defence.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.760
 They came from the Pentagon.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.440
 They detailed various things like communications problems on British warships.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.280
 New Zealand's Defence Strategy.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.800
 One of them actually had details for how to avoid leaks from the secret service department.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.400
 Tips on how to avoid leaking information.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.680
 And it turned out that there was a Navy commander who was supposed to distribute it to an email list and made a typo.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.440
 And she was getting all these emails.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.680
 She replied to them saying, "I really don't think this is meant for me.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.040
 I'm a schoolgirl from Devon."

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.840
 Her no response.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.440
 She just kept on receiving them.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.240
 And eventually-

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.360
 I hope we're at this weekend.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.640
 Schoolgirl from Devon.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.440
 Yes, we're all schoolgirls from Devon.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.000
 Okay, that's it.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.040
 That's all of our facts.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.800
