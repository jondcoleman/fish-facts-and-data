00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, Dan here, welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:00:04,00:00:08,"Before we get started, we just want to let you know that we have now completed our run"
00:00:08,00:00:11,for the first series of our TV show No Such Thing as the News.
00:00:11,00:00:15,"If you missed it and you want to see it, head to No Such Thing as the News.com,"
00:00:15,00:00:19,where we have all of the episodes either on iPlayer for viewers in the UK
00:00:19,00:00:21,or on YouTube for everyone who's international.
00:00:21,00:00:25,"Please watch them, we love making them, hopefully we'll get to make more."
00:00:25,00:00:27,"But in the meantime, here's another episode,"
00:00:27,00:00:31,"and you'll notice James is away this week, he's in Transylvania, so we have,"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"in his place, another QIL, Stephen Colgan."
00:00:34,00:00:38,"Steve's just actually published a book, it's called ""Why Did The policeman Cross the Road?"""
00:00:38,00:00:40,How to solve problems before they arise.
00:00:40,00:00:44,"It's in bookshops now, it's an amazing book, it's all about his time when he was a police officer"
00:00:44,00:00:49,and all the problems he had to solve as a part of Scotland Yards Problem Solving Unit.
00:00:49,00:00:52,"How cool is that sound? Okay, that's it, on with this week's show."
00:00:52,00:00:58,[Dance Music]
00:00:58,00:01:12,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:12,00:01:15,coming to you from the QIL offices in Covenant Garden.
00:01:15,00:01:22,"My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with Annachosinski, Andy Murray, and Stephen Colgan."
00:01:22,00:01:25,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:01:25,00:01:29,"from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:29,00:01:35,"Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that heart surgeons now perform surgery"
00:01:35,00:01:37,while wearing 3D glasses.
00:01:37,00:01:40,"3D glasses, like the ones you get in the cinema."
00:01:40,00:01:44,"They're slightly more modern, but they are 3D glasses."
00:01:44,00:01:50,"To get other special effects as well, like, to someone blowing their faces while they're doing their final prayer bit of order."
00:01:50,00:01:54,"Then that's a 4D operating experience. That's true, yeah."
00:01:54,00:01:58,"The reason they do this is because with heart surgery, a lot of the way that they do heart surgery now"
00:01:58,00:02:04,"is via camera going in, because they can't get into such delicate spots, so they have to watch it on a camera."
00:02:04,00:02:09,"And so it's really hard to know if you're further than you think you are, or if you're not close enough,"
00:02:09,00:02:10,it's just hard to get perception.
00:02:10,00:02:16,So what they realize that they could do is by adding a 3D camera to the thing that goes into the body.
00:02:16,00:02:22,"You could then wear the 3D glasses, and you would have total immersive and proper experience of a 3D operation."
00:02:22,00:02:23,It's insane.
00:02:23,00:02:25,Plus you look awesome.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"These aren't the old red and green ones, are they?"
00:02:27,00:02:29,"So they're slightly more modern, so yeah."
00:02:29,00:02:32,I have been to the cinema to like to clarify since 2005.
00:02:32,00:02:37,"They said that, but even the ones in the cinema, they actually can reduce the brightness of the screen by up to 88%."
00:02:37,00:02:39,So should they be able to light it quite well?
00:02:39,00:02:41,"Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe that's the modification."
00:02:41,00:02:48,"But when they used to do it with the 2D normal operations, it would take something like two hours longer or four hours longer,"
00:02:48,00:02:51,"because it was so hard, you had to be so careful."
00:02:51,00:02:53,"And now with these glasses, they can do things at twice the speed."
00:02:53,00:02:56,They have the time of what the operation should be.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"So it's just, yeah, it's amazing."
00:02:58,00:03:03,"Well, the whole 3D things are very interesting area anyway, because a few years ago hearing Andy Neiman go out about this,"
00:03:03,00:03:07,"because Andy Neiman, the magician and Ratti, he's a huge fan of 3D movies."
00:03:07,00:03:13,"And he was saying that 3D was kind of brought into cinemas as a way of fighting back against new technologies,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,that the cinemas were worried that people would stop going to the cinemas.
00:03:15,00:03:20,"So like in the 1950s, it was because of the rise of television in the late 70s and early 80s,"
00:03:20,00:03:21,because of video coming along.
00:03:21,00:03:24,"And in the modern age, it was because of computers in the internet."
00:03:24,00:03:27,"And that's what I was saying. And people would go, oh my god, people aren't going to go to the cinema anymore."
00:03:27,00:03:30,So 3D kept coming back as a gimmick over and over again.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"But now they spent so much money on the infrastructure, we can't get rid of it now."
00:03:33,00:03:34,Wow. I didn't know that.
00:03:34,00:03:36,"It was kind of stuck with it, yeah."
00:03:36,00:03:38,"These people should have watched more knockoff DVDs and realized most of them,"
00:03:38,00:03:42,the sound is out of sync with the visions and it cuts off halfway through anyway.
00:03:42,00:03:43,So cinemas are safe.
00:03:43,00:03:44,Safe bet.
00:03:44,00:03:48,"Well, if you go to the cinema and you hate watching 3D movies,"
00:03:48,00:03:50,"but you happen to be in a 3D movie,"
00:03:50,00:03:56,you can now buy and it's been for a while 2D glasses that turn a 3D movie back into 2D.
00:03:56,00:03:58,So this is on.
00:03:58,00:04:03,"If you go to 2D-glasses.com, you can now buy these glasses."
00:04:03,00:04:07,"And it's basically the guy who invented them, his wife hated going to 3D movies."
00:04:07,00:04:11,"So he invented it so that she would still come to the movies, but get the 2D experience."
00:04:11,00:04:15,"Well, I was looking into this a bit more and looking at a few medical papers about this."
00:04:15,00:04:18,And apparently there's 12% of people who can't see 3D anyway.
00:04:18,00:04:20,"Well, when they were in the glasses, yeah."
00:04:20,00:04:20,Wow. Wow.
00:04:20,00:04:22,Is that due to visual impairment?
00:04:22,00:04:26,"Yeah, well not impairment, it's just that the rods and cones and the eyes can pick it up very clearly."
00:04:26,00:04:29,Wow. So these are people with 2020.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"Yeah, it's people who otherwise have got good vision."
00:04:30,00:04:35,"Amazing. The other thing is the rods and cones in your eyes, they discovered last year,"
00:04:35,00:04:38,your eyes actually do see 3D separately.
00:04:38,00:04:41,"So your eyes can actually see each eye, can actually see 3D on its own."
00:04:41,00:04:42,What?
00:04:42,00:04:47,"When that's combined with parallax, which is where you're seeing it from two slightly different viewpoints from each eye,"
00:04:47,00:04:48,that gives you perfect 3D vision.
00:04:48,00:04:54,So they don't reckon that the 3D vision that we see in cinemas is actually anywhere near as close to real 3D vision anyway.
00:04:54,00:05:00,That's really amazing because we obviously just think the only reason we see 3D is because we've got two.
00:05:00,00:05:02,"Well that's the parallax thing, isn't it? You see things from two slightly different viewpoints."
00:05:02,00:05:07,"The brain superimposes them, but apparently each one of your eyes can actually detect 3D anyway on its own."
00:05:07,00:05:10,Apparently there are three or four different things that come together to give us 3D vision.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"And a couple of those we've got anyway, because even if you shut one eye,"
00:05:13,00:05:16,you've still got a fairly good idea of how far things are away.
00:05:16,00:05:22,"It's only when things get close to your eye, like you're trying to thread a needle that it all goes completely to pot."
00:05:22,00:05:23,"Wow, yeah."
00:05:23,00:05:26,So I was distracted because Anna was launching her hand into her own face.
00:05:26,00:05:32,"I was practicing my one eye 3D vision, and all it made me think is I'm really short-sighted in my left eye."
00:05:32,00:05:39,I was looking into surgical innovations and things that surgeons are doing now that are improving medicine.
00:05:39,00:05:44,And I've been corresponding with a couple of doctors who have told me amazing things.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"And I just wanted to mention them, they're called Peter Brindley at Martin Beat."
00:05:46,00:05:49,"Well no, this isn't about personal ailments or anything, is it?"
00:05:49,00:05:54,"No, it's like, although they've assured me it will clear up in four to six weeks if I keep putting the ointment on."
00:05:54,00:06:01,"Okay, get this. To train surgeons, one thing you can do is simulate smells for them."
00:06:01,00:06:04,Smells of particular things in an operating room.
00:06:04,00:06:13,"So there are cookbooks available online where you can cook up the smell of internal organs or cerebral spinal fluid,"
00:06:13,00:06:19,or whatever it might be to sort of train surgeons more effectively for when they actually get under operating.
00:06:19,00:06:20,"Wow, that's cool."
00:06:20,00:06:22,Why is identifying a smell?
00:06:22,00:06:25,"Well, I don't think a smell is useful medically, is it?"
00:06:25,00:06:26,To identify a disease.
00:06:26,00:06:29,"So yeah, so a lot of people could diagnose while you're going."
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Oh, okay, you shut yourself."
00:06:30,00:06:39,"I was reading, there was an article on cracks written by a surgeon saying some secrets of the trade."
00:06:39,00:06:43,"And he was recounting, so he recounted two quite amusing things."
00:06:43,00:06:49,"One was that at one point a man woke up while he was restarting his heart because they'd have to give him,"
00:06:49,00:06:52,I think a dose of adrenaline to get his heart going and maybe it was too much the man woke up.
00:06:52,00:06:57,"And this surgeon said, ""When he saw a resident elbow deep in his organs, he gave us the exact look,"
00:06:57,00:07:01,"you picture somebody having when they wake up to find a stranger's hands inside their chest."""
00:07:01,00:07:03,"We all know that, though."
00:07:03,00:07:05,"I was like, the position of a masterful."
00:07:05,00:07:09,He looked at us exactly like we were doing the thing that we were doing.
00:07:09,00:07:15,"Yeah, I read a few articles about doctors revealing secrets about surgery and stuff."
00:07:15,00:07:17,"One weird one, I wish I wrote it down."
00:07:17,00:07:23,"This is just going from memory, but about how, with every surgery, if you're a man getting surgery,"
00:07:23,00:07:27,they have to hold and squeeze the penis just to make sure there's no urine in it.
00:07:27,00:07:32,"Dan, I think you've been had."
00:07:32,00:07:34,If that's the excuse he gave you.
00:07:34,00:07:35,Where were you at the time?
00:07:35,00:07:38,"If you weren't in a hospital, then he said he was a doctor."
00:07:38,00:07:43,"My mum's never going to consent to another general anesthetic, now she knows that's outrageous."
00:07:43,00:07:46,"Yeah, I don't know how they get it out of the ladies, actually."
00:07:46,00:07:47,"Yeah, that's true."
00:07:47,00:07:50,We probably have a doctor to pick him up and take him away from him for the fact.
00:07:50,00:07:56,"I did read some stuff about, I mean, you talked about a keyhole surgery earlier."
00:07:56,00:07:59,"There have been a number of scientific papers, people looking at whether people playing video games"
00:07:59,00:08:02,give them skills that will make them better surgeons in the future.
00:08:02,00:08:06,"And there's one particular paper I was looking at, which was called ""The Impact of"
00:08:06,00:08:10,"Video Games on Training Surgeons in the 21st Century,"" which was kind of looking at all the"
00:08:10,00:08:14,existing papers that have been written on it and bringing all the data together.
00:08:14,00:08:20,And apparently they found that current video game players made 32% fewer errors
00:08:20,00:08:24,when they were involved in doing surgical work and performed 24% faster.
00:08:24,00:08:27,It will be all that time spending in your bedroom.
00:08:27,00:08:30,It could mean you're going to be a really good keyhole surgeon one day.
00:08:30,00:08:33,"Yeah, you're not allowed to be stoned when you perform surgery, though."
00:08:33,00:08:34,So that's what I'll first of all.
00:08:34,00:08:39,"The worry about thing is cool, so there are surgeons who now perform operations routinely"
00:08:39,00:08:42,"from like 400 kilometres away from their patients, aren't they?"
00:08:42,00:08:45,There's this guy called Mr. Tickle.
00:08:45,00:08:52,"Yeah, no, there's this guy called Mecharan Anvari, who does almost all of his operations"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"on different continents, and he just does it."
00:08:54,00:08:56,But you put this sort of console on your head.
00:08:56,00:09:00,"It looks like one of those things that, when women get their hair permed in hairdressers,"
00:09:00,00:09:04,it's like one of those and then you just control that and you're remotely controlling.
00:09:04,00:09:06,Exactly.
00:09:06,00:09:11,"But there was one, so I think the most used one is the DaVinci surgical system,"
00:09:11,00:09:14,"and that's used in about 200,000 operations worldwide."
00:09:14,00:09:16,And it's a virtual reality thing.
00:09:16,00:09:19,"So you stick your head in a console and you can be in a different room,"
00:09:19,00:09:22,but your voice will blast into the patient's room while you're on the surgery.
00:09:22,00:09:24,So you can tell the nurse is what to do.
00:09:24,00:09:25,"Oh, blast clip."
00:09:25,00:09:28,This is the voice of the surgeon.
00:09:28,00:09:34,"Well, one doctor said, I've heard one surgeon get carried away while doing this in shout."
00:09:34,00:09:36,I'm Conan the fucking barbarian.
00:09:36,00:09:45,"Okay, it is time to move on to fact number two, and that is Steve."
00:09:45,00:09:50,"Okay, my fact is that one day we may all be drinking pigeon milk."
00:09:50,00:09:56,"First of all, I should say that pigeon milk isn't milk like we get from cows,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,because birds can't lactate.
00:09:58,00:10:02,"It's actually produced in the bird's crop, a little space between the throat and the stomach,"
00:10:02,00:10:06,"where birds will store food, sometimes to soften it up before swallowing."
00:10:06,00:10:11,"But sometimes, if they're looking after young, they can keep food in to regurgitate to the young later."
00:10:11,00:10:16,And there are some species of bird pigeons are one of them that actually can make
00:10:16,00:10:19,a kind of secretion in that crop to feed the young birds.
00:10:19,00:10:21,And they generally do it when the birds are first hatched.
00:10:21,00:10:23,"It's a bit like, you know, in humans, you get colostrum."
00:10:23,00:10:27,You get the stuff that mother first produces when babies are born.
00:10:27,00:10:32,"And it allows the baby to put on weight very quickly, and it also feeds their immune system."
00:10:32,00:10:35,"Well, this stuff does the same job, and they reckon it's part of the reason"
00:10:35,00:10:37,that pigeons are able to survive so well in cities.
00:10:37,00:10:39,So is this why we're going to be drinking it?
00:10:39,00:10:40,We need to survive in cities.
00:10:40,00:10:46,"What they're saying is that they might be able to switch on some parts of the DNA in pigeon milk,"
00:10:46,00:10:49,"and put it into other animals milk that we do drink,"
00:10:49,00:10:53,"which means that milk won't taste any different, but it'll actually boost our immune system."
00:10:53,00:10:54,"Oh, okay."
00:10:54,00:10:57,"So they sort of secrete it, don't they, pigeons, from the crop?"
00:10:57,00:11:00,"It's like curd, is she like?"
00:11:00,00:11:02,"Yeah, it's like cottage cheese, texture, isn't it?"
00:11:02,00:11:05,"Yeah, that's a pretty thick secretion."
00:11:05,00:11:07,"Yeah, well here it is."
00:11:07,00:11:10,"Because the crop is sort of lined with these cells which are full of fat,"
00:11:10,00:11:14,and those are the cells which extrude this milk.
00:11:14,00:11:15,"Oh, okay, right."
00:11:15,00:11:18,"Yeah, so I was looking into birds which produce milk."
00:11:18,00:11:21,"You've got pigeons, where both sexes can do it."
00:11:21,00:11:24,"You've got flamingos, where both sexes can do it, and you've got penguins."
00:11:24,00:11:27,"Emperor penguins, only the males produce milk."
00:11:27,00:11:31,"Oh, wow, a feminist society."
00:11:31,00:11:33,"Basically, yeah."
00:11:33,00:11:36,But I was looking into the flamingo milk because I thought that sounds like a cool thing.
00:11:36,00:11:39,And it turns out flamingo milk also pink.
00:11:39,00:11:42,"Oh, yes, I was so hoping you were going to say that."
00:11:42,00:11:47,"So there's been a load of studies done, especially at Exeter University by guy called Paul Rose."
00:11:47,00:11:48,Everything is pink.
00:11:48,00:11:50,"Okay, so we all know flamingos pink, but the milk is pink."
00:11:50,00:11:53,The inside of a flamingo's egg is pink.
00:11:53,00:11:55,The egg yolk of a flamingo egg is pink.
00:11:55,00:11:58,The skin is pink.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"When they get the breeding season, they decide how they're going to have sex."
00:12:00,00:12:02,They're all hanging around together.
00:12:02,00:12:05,"And one of them goes deep pink, he sort of flushes."
00:12:05,00:12:09,"And if all the other birds start to go pink, they all start breeding."
00:12:09,00:12:11,So going pink is a way of saying I'm ready to meet with you.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"Yeah, and presumably it just depends how attractive the flamingo that's gone pink is."
00:12:14,00:12:15,Yeah.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"Because either all of them do it or only one or two of them do it, and then they feel embarrassed."
00:12:18,00:12:19,Okay.
00:12:19,00:12:25,So the reason they're pink is that they eat the algae and the little shrimp things which are pink.
00:12:25,00:12:29,So this is a whole species that goes around thinking it's a colour that it's not.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"Yeah, and it's just because they've got a weird diet."
00:12:31,00:12:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:32,00:12:37,It's a one day they'll just have a new food taste or that bacterial diet out.
00:12:37,00:12:40,"And then they'll go back to their normal colour and be like, what?"
00:12:40,00:12:40,Yeah.
00:12:40,00:12:46,Why aren't we eating flamingo eggs with pink yolk every day?
00:12:46,00:12:50,Because it's harder to store flamingos than it is to store chickens.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Because you just need slightly taller...
00:12:51,00:12:53,Taller-coote buildings.
00:12:53,00:12:55,That's it.
00:12:55,00:12:58,You could just drill a hole in the top for the head to poke out.
00:12:58,00:13:02,You're getting trouble for that.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"Oh, one shop."
00:13:03,00:13:04,It was either...
00:13:04,00:13:04,I can't remember.
00:13:04,00:13:05,Maybe it was M&S.
00:13:05,00:13:08,They sold recently double yolk eggs.
00:13:08,00:13:09,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:09,00:13:11,"There's about one egg in a thousand, has two yolks out."
00:13:11,00:13:12,I've never had.
00:13:12,00:13:13,How did they find out where they're opening it?
00:13:13,00:13:17,I think they can scan them and detect two yolks.
00:13:17,00:13:17,That's very good.
00:13:17,00:13:21,"You say, wow, as if that's the most advanced technology you've ever heard."
00:13:21,00:13:24,They can just use an X-ray camera to see inside an egg.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"No, I just thought it's a lot of effort, isn't it?"
00:13:26,00:13:29,"To buy the scanning machine, to buy the eggs."
00:13:29,00:13:30,Absolutely.
00:13:30,00:13:30,To give away...
00:13:30,00:13:32,To throw away the other eggs.
00:13:32,00:13:33,I don't think so.
00:13:33,00:13:38,"That was 99 eggs, was smashed."
00:13:38,00:13:41,You should throw the rest away.
00:13:41,00:13:44,Back to pigeons very quickly.
00:13:44,00:13:48,There's a theory that pigeons killed a lot of Tyrannosaurus rexes.
00:13:48,00:13:54,The only issue with the pigeon is it needed to die in order to kill the T-Rex.
00:13:54,00:13:56,And that was to be eaten by the T-Rex.
00:13:56,00:13:58,"Paleontologist called Dr. Steve Salisbury,"
00:13:58,00:14:01,"University of Queensland, has been looking into it."
00:14:01,00:14:07,"And he says that, basically, they have evidence of avian infectious disease and dinosaurs."
00:14:07,00:14:09,"And they noticed it in the back of their jaws,"
00:14:09,00:14:11,"these little holes in the back of their jaws,"
00:14:11,00:14:14,which could only have got there by eating something.
00:14:14,00:14:18,"And so pigeons could carry this disease, but they were immune to it."
00:14:18,00:14:21,"And so the T-Rexes were eating pigeons, which is an amazing image."
00:14:21,00:14:24,"If you think, I mean, I didn't know how far back pigeons went,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,but the disease would then carry through to their jaw.
00:14:26,00:14:29,And that would be a bacterial infection that just destroyed them.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Wow.
00:14:30,00:14:31,That's very cool.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"Everything killed the dinosaurs, didn't it?"
00:14:32,00:14:34,I'm amazed that they survived so long.
00:14:34,00:14:37,"Apparently it's like an earthquake, a great global event."
00:14:37,00:14:38,They all drowned.
00:14:38,00:14:38,A pigeon.
00:14:38,00:14:40,A Martian invasions.
00:14:40,00:14:40,Mocking.
00:14:40,00:14:43,It's true.
00:14:43,00:14:44,"Have you ever seen, I mean, people always say,"
00:14:44,00:14:45,"you know, you never see baby pigeons."
00:14:45,00:14:48,"Well, there is a good reason for that because they stay in the nest a lot longer."
00:14:48,00:14:49,They don't fled journey like a lot of other birds.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"They stay in their for ages, saying feed me."
00:14:51,00:14:53,"But if you ever see one in a nest,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,it looks remarkably like a dodo.
00:14:55,00:14:57,"It's got this huge, really."
00:14:57,00:14:59,"Well, dodo's are the closest known relations."
00:14:59,00:15:00,What?
00:15:00,00:15:01,Dodo's are pigeons.
00:15:01,00:15:01,Dodo's are pigeons.
00:15:01,00:15:02,Yeah.
00:15:02,00:15:04,I have learnt so much in the same thing.
00:15:04,00:15:07,"They can fly, they do backward somersaults pigeons and no one knows why."
00:15:07,00:15:10,"Is this in the, it's in the hair or on a branch?"
00:15:10,00:15:11,In the air.
00:15:11,00:15:13,"So there's a pigeon called a Birmingham roller,"
00:15:13,00:15:15,which is called that because it does this rolling.
00:15:15,00:15:18,"And yeah, we don't know why,"
00:15:18,00:15:20,but it seems like they might just do it because they like it.
00:15:20,00:15:22,And one of the reasons we think they might like it is because
00:15:22,00:15:24,"before they do the somersault when they're in the air,"
00:15:24,00:15:28,"apparently they engage in arching, frequent arching and wing clapping."
00:15:28,00:15:31,They just start clapping their wings together and excitement
00:15:31,00:15:32,at the fact that they're about to do an awesome trick.
00:15:32,00:15:34,Of course they pre-applaud their efforts.
00:15:34,00:15:37,"Yeah, get it going, guys."
00:15:37,00:15:38,Get the floors going.
00:15:38,00:15:43,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:15:43,00:15:48,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:15:48,00:15:50,And that is Chazinski.
00:15:50,00:15:52,My fact this week is that books used to be stacked
00:15:52,00:15:54,with the spines facing in woods.
00:15:54,00:15:55,That's amazing.
00:15:55,00:15:56,It's so ridiculous.
00:15:56,00:15:57,It's so weird.
00:15:57,00:16:01,It's just so weird that this is more widely known.
00:16:01,00:16:04,"So the reason this happened, which is really interesting."
00:16:04,00:16:06,And I learned this when I discovered a book called
00:16:06,00:16:09,"""The Book on the Bookshelf"" by Henry Petrosky."
00:16:09,00:16:12,He found out that they did this because books were incredibly precious
00:16:12,00:16:14,back in medieval times.
00:16:14,00:16:17,Almost always the last thing you would do to a book after you'd found it
00:16:17,00:16:20,is send it to a jeweler and a goldsmith to get it all decorated.
00:16:20,00:16:23,They had lots of like really precious diamonds and jewels on them.
00:16:23,00:16:23,Book chazzled.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"Book chazzled, exactly."
00:16:25,00:16:26,So they were really precious.
00:16:26,00:16:28,And so then they were always chained.
00:16:28,00:16:32,Or they were usually chained to the shelves where they were stored.
00:16:32,00:16:33,And they'd usually be in monasteries.
00:16:33,00:16:35,It was mainly kind of monks who had books.
00:16:35,00:16:38,And obviously it's easier to chain a book to a bookshelf or a cupboard
00:16:38,00:16:40,if you're doing it via the spine.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Because you can just put the chain through the spine.
00:16:41,00:16:42,"Oh yeah, yeah."
00:16:42,00:16:44,And so that's how they attached them.
00:16:44,00:16:46,"See, I kind of assumed it was something to do with fading"
00:16:46,00:16:46,or something like that.
00:16:46,00:16:48,Because I've got some quite old books at home.
00:16:48,00:16:52,And the spine is much more faded than the actual front and backpapers are.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Oh really?
00:16:53,00:16:55,Because the spines were sort of the least desirable part.
00:16:55,00:16:58,They were almost something you should hide like the hinge of a door.
00:16:58,00:17:00,"Yeah, it's sort of philosophical."
00:17:00,00:17:03,But Trosky says that shelving books with the spines in was must have seemed
00:17:03,00:17:07,as natural and appropriate a thing to do as to put the winding machinery of a clock
00:17:07,00:17:09,toward the wall or behind a door.
00:17:09,00:17:11,"Cool, but still a nightmare trying to find a book in a library."
00:17:11,00:17:13,"Yeah, and you can imagine it just walking in there."
00:17:13,00:17:15,Just face to it with all the pages.
00:17:15,00:17:16,"Yeah, I see that."
00:17:16,00:17:19,"Okay, there is a library in Dublin called Marsh's Library."
00:17:19,00:17:20,Yeah.
00:17:20,00:17:21,It's a really early public library.
00:17:21,00:17:25,And they don't have chained books because chain books is obviously to keep them safe
00:17:25,00:17:27,just in case people want to just connect them or anything.
00:17:27,00:17:28,So they don't have chain books.
00:17:28,00:17:32,But they do have cages which you have to sit in if you want to read certain books.
00:17:32,00:17:33,What?
00:17:33,00:17:34,Wow.
00:17:34,00:17:36,And they're really nice cages.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"I mean, they're not what you're picturing."
00:17:39,00:17:43,But they are sections of the library little alcos with girls across them
00:17:43,00:17:46,and you get sort of shot in there with the really precious books.
00:17:46,00:17:47,What's so you're like a zoo animal?
00:17:47,00:17:50,People can observe what a human reading looks like.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Yeah, cage reading."
00:17:52,00:17:53,cage reading.
00:17:53,00:17:55,The next extreme sport.
00:17:55,00:17:58,I was looking into libraries generally when I was researching this topic
00:17:58,00:18:00,because old libraries are really fascinating.
00:18:00,00:18:03,The systems that they used to run by.
00:18:03,00:18:05,"And I was reading about, and this is from the independent"
00:18:05,00:18:09,about how the New York Public Library has unearthed this huge file
00:18:09,00:18:13,of questions submitted to them by members of the public.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"So before the internet, before Google, where would you get your information?"
00:18:16,00:18:19,"If you needed it immediately, you would go to your library"
00:18:19,00:18:21,and you would submit a question and have them answer it for you.
00:18:21,00:18:25,And the librarian would go off and look for it and either call you back
00:18:25,00:18:27,"or just next time you're in, give you the answer."
00:18:27,00:18:30,And they published some of their favorite questions.
00:18:30,00:18:33,"So they include, why do the 18th century English paintings"
00:18:33,00:18:34,have so many squirrels on them?
00:18:34,00:18:38,And how did they tame them so they wouldn't bite the painter?
00:18:38,00:18:40,So that was from 1976.
00:18:40,00:18:43,And they have it on a little card that they've counted.
00:18:43,00:18:45,1976 as far as that drug you.
00:18:45,00:18:50,"Yeah, from 1956, what kind of apple did Eve eat?"
00:18:50,00:18:55,"And then this telephone call, mid afternoon, New Year's Day, 1967."
00:18:55,00:18:56,I have two questions.
00:18:56,00:18:58,The first is a sort of an etiquette one.
00:18:58,00:19:01,I went to a New Year's Eve party and unexpectedly stayed over.
00:19:01,00:19:03,I don't really know the hosts.
00:19:03,00:19:05,Or to I to send a thank you note.
00:19:05,00:19:09,"Second, when you meet a fellow and you know he's worth $27 million"
00:19:09,00:19:12,"because that's what they told me, $27 million."
00:19:12,00:19:14,And you know his nationality.
00:19:14,00:19:15,How do you find out his name?
00:19:15,00:19:22,You can see why she was desperate to track that guy down again.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"Yeah, I'll start with a thank you note, actually."
00:19:24,00:19:28,"And I'd say, by the way, the man wearing the gold suit from last night,"
00:19:28,00:19:29,what was his name?
00:19:29,00:19:33,"So 1976, you're saying, wow, as far as then,"
00:19:33,00:19:35,people still sending in questions.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"The library, the New York Public Library,"
00:19:37,00:19:41,"have said that they still get 1,700 questions a month to take."
00:19:41,00:19:45,"Wow, so they are the original Google, right?"
00:19:45,00:19:46,Librarians are the original Google.
00:19:46,00:19:51,"And now it's kind of exactly the same situation as black cabs and Uber, I think, isn't it?"
00:19:51,00:19:54,"So now, presumably, librarians just can say Google it"
00:19:54,00:19:56,and they're putting these old school knowledgeable ones out of business.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"Just like the way that cabbies now will say, just Uber it."
00:19:59,00:20:05,"So this is the thing, you were talking about old libraries, Dan."
00:20:05,00:20:09,So in very early monasteries and libraries and places where books were extremely
00:20:09,00:20:09,"precious, right?"
00:20:09,00:20:13,"Some places had a system where the librarian has a key, right?"
00:20:13,00:20:15,And all the books are kept in trunks.
00:20:15,00:20:17,"You know, he's great big trunks."
00:20:17,00:20:20,But there are also two other locks and there are two other keys.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"And you have to have all three people present, all three librarians,"
00:20:24,00:20:25,for someone to borrow a book.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"Wow, what a crown jewel!"
00:20:27,00:20:29,There's so valuable.
00:20:29,00:20:32,And then there's a ritual of book return as well.
00:20:32,00:20:33,"So I'm quoting here,"
00:20:33,00:20:36,the librarian shall read the statement as to the manner in which brethren
00:20:36,00:20:39,"have had books during the past year, as a monastery."
00:20:39,00:20:41,"As each brother hears his name pronounced, he is to give back the book"
00:20:41,00:20:43,which had been entrusted to him for reading.
00:20:43,00:20:46,"And he, whose conscience accuses him of not having read the book"
00:20:46,00:20:48,"through which he had received,"
00:20:48,00:20:52,"is to fall on his face, confess his fault, and in treat forgiveness."
00:20:52,00:20:58,And I think that's right for return to libraries.
00:20:58,00:20:59,Absolutely.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"A little powerful and a fine, isn't it?"
00:21:01,00:21:03,I did find out what the biggest fine-waver was for a library book.
00:21:03,00:21:04,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:04,00:21:06,"Yeah, surprisingly modest actually."
00:21:06,00:21:10,It was $345.14.
00:21:10,00:21:11,What?
00:21:11,00:21:11,"That was a lot, isn't it?"
00:21:11,00:21:16,"But it was a two cents a day for a poetry book, Days and Deeds,"
00:21:16,00:21:19,which was booked out of the Kennewee Public Library in Illinois in 1955.
00:21:19,00:21:23,And they found it in her house 47 years later.
00:21:23,00:21:23,Wow.
00:21:23,00:21:28,"But 47 years, only accrued $345, which in current money is about $200 and 3 quid."
00:21:28,00:21:29,That's good to know.
00:21:29,00:21:30,So surprisingly modest.
00:21:30,00:21:34,Do you know someone who was responsible for a cool bit of book innovation
00:21:34,00:21:35,as then in the way we see books?
00:21:35,00:21:36,It was Lewis Carroll.
00:21:36,00:21:37,Really?
00:21:37,00:21:40,"Yeah, so in 1876 he wrote to his publisher saying,"
00:21:40,00:21:46,"""Guys, could you please put the name of the book on the outside on the dust jacket?"""
00:21:46,00:21:47,Really?
00:21:47,00:21:50,"Yeah, so dust jacket, this is a really interesting thing."
00:21:50,00:21:53,"You used to not have dust jackets on books at all,"
00:21:53,00:21:56,"and then you developed really nice bindings, like Hannah says,"
00:21:56,00:21:59,"and you would then have a dust jacket to protect against the dust,"
00:21:59,00:22:02,"but it was plain, and you just throw it away once you'd opened the book."
00:22:02,00:22:03,It was just unnecessary packaging.
00:22:03,00:22:06,"And then they started having transparent dust jackets,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,so you could see a bit of the spine.
00:22:08,00:22:12,"And then eventually people started drawing on the dust jackets,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,and they started in about the 1830s.
00:22:14,00:22:18,"And in 1876 Lewis Carroll had to ask his publishers,"
00:22:18,00:22:21,"though, ""Can you put the name of the book on the spine of the dust jacket?"""
00:22:21,00:22:24,"So it was still not widespread, even then, I think."
00:22:24,00:22:25,Wow.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Yeah.
00:22:26,00:22:30,People often say that he invented putting the name of the book on the spine.
00:22:30,00:22:32,I don't know if that's true.
00:22:32,00:22:38,"People often say, ""This is a good idea on 19th century figures and books."""
00:22:38,00:22:40,"So Humphrey Davey, who's an extremely famous chemist,"
00:22:40,00:22:44,"who we've talked about before, who discovered a bunch of metals, famous metals,"
00:22:44,00:22:47,"and who is important in electricity and battery making,"
00:22:47,00:22:51,he never wanted to waste time by being tempted to read the same book again.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"So every time he finished a book, he destroyed it."
00:22:54,00:22:57,"He mutilated it, so he would never be tempted to go back and reread it."
00:22:57,00:22:58,Whoa.
00:22:58,00:22:59,Did you do it as you read?
00:22:59,00:23:02,"Repaid, did he tear off?"
00:23:02,00:23:03,I'm never reading this again.
00:23:03,00:23:05,"And then he gets to, ""Wait, who was that character?"""
00:23:05,00:23:07,That's amazing.
00:23:07,00:23:15,"Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:23:15,00:23:19,"My fact is that in May, an internal memo by the Egyptian government"
00:23:19,00:23:23,on how to crush the press was accidentally sent out to the press.
00:23:24,00:23:26,It's so pleasing.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"So Egypt is a very repressive government,"
00:23:29,00:23:32,and they're constantly arresting journalists and things like that.
00:23:32,00:23:35,"And they, in May, sent out memos to journalists"
00:23:35,00:23:39,from the Ministry's official email account
00:23:39,00:23:41,"about how to counter this news media campaign,"
00:23:41,00:23:44,"which was saying, by the way, the government keep arresting journalists,"
00:23:44,00:23:47,"and they were saying, ""Oh, well, we can stop all coverage related to this."""
00:23:47,00:23:50,"We can undermine the credibility of the journalist union,"
00:23:50,00:23:53,and we can monitor news websites around the clock with more staff.
00:23:53,00:23:56,And it was basically this whole series of measures
00:23:56,00:23:57,designed to shut down the press.
00:23:57,00:23:59,"And then they put it out as a press release, basically."
00:23:59,00:24:01,"Oh, my God, I'm fantastic."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"Yeah, and I got this from a report in the economist"
00:24:04,00:24:08,about press freedom and loads and loads of it not happening.
00:24:08,00:24:09,It's a world all over the world.
00:24:09,00:24:12,So lots of people are being arrested.
00:24:12,00:24:14,There was someone in Thailand who was prosecuted recently
00:24:14,00:24:16,for being sarcastic about the king's dog.
00:24:16,00:24:17,Wow.
00:24:17,00:24:17,"Yeah, really?"
00:24:17,00:24:18,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:18,00:24:20,It's quite hard to prove sarcasm.
00:24:20,00:24:23,"It's one of that, because you can always just say I was being genuine."
00:24:23,00:24:23,Yep.
00:24:23,00:24:26,"Or you can say, ""Oh, yeah, I was being really genuine."""
00:24:26,00:24:28,"I think you will still get locked up, of course."
00:24:28,00:24:31,It's worth a try.
00:24:31,00:24:35,My favorite thing that's happened recently
00:24:35,00:24:37,in terms of freedom of expression
00:24:37,00:24:41,"and people getting oppressed for, for instance, satirising."
00:24:41,00:24:44,Leaders is your favorite impression story.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"I'm really big into those, yeah."
00:24:46,00:24:48,"No, that's not true."
00:24:48,00:24:50,"No, my favorite thing that's happened along these lines"
00:24:50,00:24:52,was in December 2015 in Turkey
00:24:52,00:24:55,when a Turkish guy was on trial
00:24:55,00:24:58,and he'd been accused of insulting the president again
00:24:58,00:25:02,because he compared him to Golem from Lord of the Rings.
00:25:02,00:25:04,And the trial had to be adjourned
00:25:04,00:25:06,because it turned out that the judge on trial
00:25:06,00:25:07,hadn't read Lord of the Rings.
00:25:07,00:25:09,And so it was impossible to assert
00:25:09,00:25:11,whether or not this was an insult.
00:25:11,00:25:14,"And in the end, they had to call in five experts"
00:25:14,00:25:16,to deduce whether or not comparing
00:25:16,00:25:18,the president to Golem was an insulting thing to do
00:25:18,00:25:21,and to decide whether or not Golem was an evil character
00:25:21,00:25:22,or a good character.
00:25:22,00:25:24,Completely five as well.
00:25:24,00:25:26,What did you show the film?
00:25:26,00:25:27,"No, because it takes..."
00:25:27,00:25:29,Because they needed the experts to interpret it.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"So they had two academics, two psychologists"
00:25:32,00:25:34,and a movie/television expert.
00:25:34,00:25:35,Marker mode.
00:25:35,00:25:41,Eventually Peter Jackson got involved.
00:25:41,00:25:43,He released a statement or he tweeted
00:25:43,00:25:46,saying that actually it shouldn't have been seen as insulting
00:25:46,00:25:49,"because smegel in fact, which is who was depicted in the satire,"
00:25:49,00:25:52,"it was a very good character, a lovable and honest guy"
00:25:52,00:25:54,who should never be confused with Golem.
00:25:54,00:25:55,So he got his aura in?
00:25:55,00:25:57,Swing it in favour of the defendant?
00:25:57,00:26:00,I think it was concluded at the end of the trial
00:26:00,00:26:03,that it's not insulting to compare someone to Golem.
00:26:03,00:26:03,Oh good.
00:26:03,00:26:07,"Well, we can say that President Erdogan is exactly like Golem then, can't we?"
00:26:07,00:26:09,"And we can't do that because in Germany, for example,"
00:26:09,00:26:11,a poet wrote a poem about saying
00:26:11,00:26:13,that President Erdogan has sex with goats
00:26:13,00:26:16,and has been arrested.
00:26:16,00:26:19,And I think is awaiting charges now.
00:26:19,00:26:22,Because there are laws against insulting foreign heads of state.
00:26:22,00:26:24,There's a huge thing across Europe as well.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"So in Iceland, I think you can get up to six years in prison."
00:26:27,00:26:29,"I mean, something insane like that."
00:26:29,00:26:31,"Well, for insulting, not your own head of state,"
00:26:31,00:26:32,but a foreign head of state.
00:26:32,00:26:33,"Yeah, that is mad."
00:26:33,00:26:35,"Well, they have to call in people to decide whether it's offensive"
00:26:35,00:26:37,to say someone has sex with goats.
00:26:37,00:26:39,"I don't know, yeah, I think five."
00:26:39,00:26:42,There was quite a big international incident
00:26:42,00:26:44,of an insult that was done recently
00:26:44,00:26:48,between the president of Argentina and Pope Francis.
00:26:48,00:26:51,"And basically, the president of Argentina"
00:26:51,00:26:54,made a huge charitable donation towards a cause
00:26:54,00:26:56,that Pope Francis had set up and been talking about.
00:26:56,00:27:01,"The amount that this guy gave was 16,666,000 pesos,"
00:27:01,00:27:05,which is roughly just under $1.2 million American dollars.
00:27:05,00:27:08,But it contained the number 666 in it.
00:27:08,00:27:12,And the Pope was convinced that that was a deliberate move by him.
00:27:12,00:27:15,To sort of insult him and sort of undermine him.
00:27:15,00:27:17,So he rejected the charitable donation.
00:27:17,00:27:18,"Well, it contained the number."
00:27:18,00:27:23,"So it was like 16,666,666 right there."
00:27:23,00:27:24,I think we've done on QI.
00:27:24,00:27:27,That it's not 66661616.
00:27:27,00:27:28,Although it is just about possible
00:27:28,00:27:30,that the Pope isn't an avid QI fan.
00:27:30,00:27:35,He's going to feel like a fool when he gets that clax.
00:27:35,00:27:37,As he's watching the show.
00:27:37,00:27:40,I'm quite fond of gaps with politicians.
00:27:40,00:27:45,"It was a great one in 2013 when the Australian opposition leader, Tony Abbott,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"was criticizing the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and said,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"""No one, however smart, however well educated, however experienced,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,"is the suppository of all wisdom."""
00:27:52,00:27:55,I can't handle that one.
00:27:55,00:27:56,"I'm sorry, yes."
00:27:56,00:27:57,"Do you know that George Bush senior,"
00:27:57,00:27:59,"when he was president, threw up on the Japanese Prime Minister?"
00:27:59,00:28:03,"I mean, he did have an intestinal flu at the time, or so he claimed."
00:28:03,00:28:08,"But what was really funny is that it actually became a phrase for vomiting in Japanese,"
00:28:08,00:28:11,"it's just going to do a bush, or Bushu-Zuru."
00:28:11,00:28:12,He's to do a bush.
00:28:12,00:28:13,He's to throw up.
00:28:13,00:28:15,He's to throw up.
00:28:15,00:28:19,"I love you say that he had an intestinal problem, or so he claimed."
00:28:19,00:28:24,So this suggestion is he might have just managed to bring voluntary vomit out of his mouth.
00:28:24,00:28:27,To insult Japanese Prime Minister.
00:28:27,00:28:29,Is that what we're saying?
00:28:29,00:28:30,"Finger down the throat, excuse me."
00:28:30,00:28:31,Do you see one as well recently?
00:28:31,00:28:33,This is quite a big gap.
00:28:33,00:28:36,"Queen's Honours list this year, a lot of amazing people on it,"
00:28:36,00:28:40,and they included by accident two serving soldiers from the SAS.
00:28:40,00:28:41,They released their names.
00:28:41,00:28:45,"They're still active, and it's the first time ever that that's happened."
00:28:45,00:28:47,"Yeah, and so they had to immediately delete it."
00:28:47,00:28:48,And the newspapers have been quite good.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"They've not published their names, but they were on there."
00:28:51,00:28:52,"Oh, wow."
00:28:52,00:28:55,We're here to reveal that.
00:28:55,00:28:57,James Harker.
00:28:57,00:28:59,Mark Kamo.
00:28:59,00:29:04,"That was a bit like, in 2003, there was a schoolgirl in Devon called Clem McDonald."
00:29:04,00:29:09,"She was 15, and she suddenly started getting emails from the Pentagon."
00:29:09,00:29:12,And she got about 11 emails a week.
00:29:12,00:29:16,"They were full of state secrets, they came from a Ministry of Defence."
00:29:16,00:29:17,They came from the Pentagon.
00:29:17,00:29:21,They detailed various things like communications problems on British warships.
00:29:21,00:29:23,New Zealand's Defence Strategy.
00:29:23,00:29:28,One of them actually had details for how to avoid leaks from the secret service department.
00:29:28,00:29:30,Tips on how to avoid leaking information.
00:29:30,00:29:35,And it turned out that there was a Navy commander who was supposed to distribute it to an email list and made a typo.
00:29:35,00:29:37,And she was getting all these emails.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"She replied to them saying, ""I really don't think this is meant for me."
00:29:39,00:29:41,"I'm a schoolgirl from Devon."""
00:29:41,00:29:41,Her no response.
00:29:41,00:29:43,She just kept on receiving them.
00:29:43,00:29:44,And eventually-
00:29:44,00:29:45,I hope we're at this weekend.
00:29:45,00:29:46,Schoolgirl from Devon.
00:29:46,00:29:49,"Yes, we're all schoolgirls from Devon."
00:29:49,00:29:54,"Okay, that's it."
00:29:54,00:29:55,That's all of our facts.
