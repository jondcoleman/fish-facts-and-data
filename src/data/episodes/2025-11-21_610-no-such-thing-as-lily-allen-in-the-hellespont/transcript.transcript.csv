00:00:34,00:00:38,"That's right. Her new book is called ""Lidia Marmalade and the Christmas Wish""."
00:00:38,00:00:45,So it's the children's book. It's really funny. It's charming. It's got a little Jane Austenie flavor to it.
00:00:45,00:00:48,A little Regency Tinge. That's a terrible phrase.
00:00:48,00:00:52,But it's really funny. It's charming. It's about a girl called Lydia Marmalade.
00:00:52,00:01:00,"Obviously, there's an amazing sausage dog. It's basically everything you could want for a kind of fun, classic, Christmassy Robb."

00:02:18,00:02:25,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:02:25,00:02:30,"from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:02:30,00:02:35,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and Carrie Adloyd. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:35,00:02:41,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:41,00:02:46,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Carrie Adloyd. My fact is that Joseph Baseljet,"
00:02:46,00:02:52,"the famous engineer who designed London Surers, who was inspired by the great stink."
00:02:52,00:02:58,His great great grandson was the league guitarist of the band The Vapers.
00:02:58,00:03:03,Who are most famous for their single turning Japanese?
00:03:03,00:03:08,Yes. Brilliant. Now this is a very famous song. A lot of people might know it. We just discovered
00:03:08,00:03:14,"someone in the QI office does not know it, who's in their late 20s. I think it's an age thing,"
00:03:14,00:03:17,"because I recently was telling people this fact, and a lot of people were like, ""What song?"""
00:03:17,00:03:22,"And I was like, ""Come on, turn it up, and they just stare at you."" Really?"
00:03:22,00:03:26,"Yeah, I do think it's an age thing. Because it came out in 1980, so it's an oldie."
00:03:26,00:03:31,It's an oldie. But a goodie. It's a thing classic. It's a brilliant song.
00:03:31,00:03:34,The reason I know this is I know Ed Baseljet.
00:03:34,00:03:41,"No. Yes, Clang. Clang, because he is now, he left The Vapers, and became a TV director,"
00:03:41,00:03:45,"and he is directed Doctor Who, loads of different things, and I work with him very recently,"
00:03:45,00:03:50,"on excellent Channel 5 Police drama, Ellis, starring Sharon D. Clark and Andrew Gao."
00:03:50,00:03:55,"Wow, cool. At what stage in your relationship did the great great-great-grandfather come out?"
00:03:55,00:04:02,"So, I am of a mind like yourself. I managed to keep it together for five days filming in Belfast,"
00:04:02,00:04:05,"but the whole time I was like, ""Oh, Baseljet. Must be a Baseljet. Must be related."""
00:04:05,00:04:09,"That's such an unusual surname, can't be. And then we went for a drink in Belfast,"
00:04:09,00:04:13,"beautiful, beautiful Belfast, after we finished our episode, and I think"
00:04:13,00:04:18,"he was probably two points at Guinness Down. I was probably one rum and ginger, and I was like,"
00:04:18,00:04:23,"""So are you related to the Baseljets?"" And he was like, ""Oh, yeah."" And then some young actors,"
00:04:23,00:04:28,"namely, we're like, ""Who? Didn't know?"" ""Didn't know."" And they're classic sewers."
00:04:28,00:04:33,"They're probably the 1860s, but I think anyone should know them. It's like the song ""Turning Japanese."""
00:04:33,00:04:39,"You just think, ""Imagine being Baseljet, and you don't know my song. You don't know my family sewers."""
00:04:39,00:04:44,"Yeah, so I just know a very successful television director, and yeah, so then he said,"
00:04:44,00:04:49,"""Oh, yes, I am related to that Baseljet."" And then someone else must, he must,"
00:04:49,00:04:52,"""Oh, maybe he just came out with it. I can't remember now because we were in a"
00:04:52,00:04:57,"pub in Belfast."" Just said, ""Oh, yeah."" And I was in the band ""The Vapers."" And I initially didn't"
00:04:57,00:05:02,"recognize the name until he said ""Turning Japanese."" I was like, ""Oh my god."" And it's curious,"
00:05:02,00:05:07,"as well as ""The Vapers,"" the name, you would think might have been Ed's suggestion, but it's not."
00:05:07,00:05:14,"They all smoked e-cigarettes. That's exactly right. It was, yeah, before it's time. I think the head"
00:05:14,00:05:19,"of the game. Yeah. Because Ed was the guitarist, and the main songwriter was someone else,"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"wasn't that a thing? Well, that makes sense. That makes sense when he felt it. Yeah. If it had been"
00:05:23,00:05:27,"Ed Baseljet who came up with the name, he probably would have come up with the cholera epidemics."
00:05:27,00:05:31,"Yes, of the 1850s. Yeah, I still going. She said, ""You know, this, the Vapers are still,"
00:05:31,00:05:36,"they reformed."" There he is. Ed was in it for a bit, and now he's gone off to TV directing."
00:05:36,00:05:42,"How often do you think they play the song ""Turning Japanese"" in an average set? I think it's quite a lot."
00:05:42,00:05:48,"Yeah, I think it's quite a lot. I went to watch Junior Senior just after their song"
00:05:48,00:05:52,"""Move Your Feet"" had come out and been a big hit. Oh, yeah. And they played it four times."
00:05:52,00:05:56,"Right. That's, yeah. They could have played it five, and I would have loved it."
00:05:56,00:06:00,"Yeah. And it is a bit being your own tribute act, isn't it? Yeah."
00:06:00,00:06:04,"""Turning Japanese"" was like a global hit as well. It was huge. And it was, it was their biggest hit."
00:06:04,00:06:09,"I like that they knew it at the time as well. So they had it ready, and they went, we should hold"
00:06:09,00:06:13,"this back. Yeah. This is going to be a big song. And so they released it as a second single,"
00:06:13,00:06:16,as opposed to a first single from their album. Because they didn't want to be one hit wonders.
00:06:16,00:06:21,"Yeah. But then, yeah, sort of. They are. And that's no bad thing."
00:06:21,00:06:23,"Sorry, yeah, there's no bad thing. That's no bad thing."
00:06:23,00:06:27,"That's everything. And the former drummer, Howard Smith, was recently elected Mayor of Guildford."
00:06:27,00:06:30,No. That's pretty cool. I thought I wanted a flang.
00:06:30,00:06:34,"Oh, he let the Mayor go. No, he haven't. I haven't met Mayor Guildford. Sorry, bye, sir."
00:06:34,00:06:39,"The one other thing about Ed Baseljet is, as you say, it was a TV director, but one of the things"
00:06:39,00:06:46,he directed on his IMDB is Seven Wonders of the Industrial World in 2003 where Robert Lindsay
00:06:46,00:06:52,looked at London's Suez. What kind of having combination. That's great.
00:06:52,00:06:55,"When do you think he thought, did you think he went to production company with it? Or do you"
00:06:55,00:07:02,"think they said, I think, because you know what, there are like eight episodes in that series,"
00:07:02,00:07:06,"and he only directed one of them, and it was about the Suez. They thought let's get in there."
00:07:06,00:07:10,"We'd like you to do one about the phone network, please. No, I'm sure."
00:07:10,00:07:15,"And that's good, because Robert Lindsay, as a star of my family, has been in a lot of old shit."
00:07:15,00:07:20,"And then, wow, I love my family. I just couldn't resist. I saw the opening."
00:07:20,00:07:24,I'm sorry. Sometimes you're going to throw your heroes under the bus for the show.
00:07:24,00:07:27,"It's really interesting, because it's lovely, Dan, who says, I love my family."
00:07:27,00:07:32,I love my family in such a wife guy. Brilliant. Let's go into Suez.
00:07:32,00:07:37,"Yes. I kind of thought that you guys would have Suez sewn up,"
00:07:37,00:07:41,so I thought I'd leave with more vapors stuff. I thought that somebody...
00:07:41,00:07:45,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excited to talk about Baseljep."
00:07:45,00:07:49,"Have you ever been in the Suez, Andy? No, I never have. I've been to the church"
00:07:49,00:07:52,"where the Baseljep Maulzileum is, but I didn't know at the time that the Maulzileum's there."
00:07:52,00:07:57,"I'm absolutely gussied. I'm going to have to go back. You should go soon, because it's in trouble."
00:07:57,00:08:01,Is it? Yeah. It's being refurbished. It's being refurbished. They've got a heritage grant.
00:08:01,00:08:08,"I'm all over this now. Ironically, water is destroying it. It's not as welcome-tank for me."
00:08:08,00:08:12,"I think if shit was destroying it, I think the water. It's very good point. It is underground, you know."
00:08:12,00:08:16,"He was responsible for a lot of underground stuff, not just the Suez. Also, a bit of the district line"
00:08:16,00:08:21,was part of the tunnel. Let's get into it. Let's get into it. He was a bit forgotten for a while.
00:08:21,00:08:25,"I think he's not now, but I think there's one Baseljep family, because it's such an old surname."
00:08:25,00:08:30,There's one tiny place in France called La Baseljep. The Baseljep family came from France.
00:08:30,00:08:35,"Weirdly, they came via America. It was a strange route, but they migrated to Britain,"
00:08:35,00:08:39,and I think the early 19th century. And one person who was a few generations
00:08:39,00:08:46,"above Joseph was the tailor of Prince of Wales, George. Oh, yes, right. He was the first British"
00:08:46,00:08:52,Baseljep. He was the one who... Would you like a new suit? Would you like a new suit? I really think so.
00:08:52,00:08:57,"That's what it was. I can imagine it now. Yeah, yeah. He was the grandfather of Joseph."
00:08:57,00:09:02,"Right, Baseljep. What a family. It's a stunning family. And then there was Joseph William,"
00:09:02,00:09:07,who we think might have been in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It's amazing. It was just like
00:09:07,00:09:11,nepotism has been going through the ages of England. It's like England is built on a few
00:09:11,00:09:17,"of the stars. Stop it. Stop it. If your grandfather was talented, somehow you managed to still be fine."
00:09:17,00:09:22,It's amazing how they're all so talented. It's just despite everything. French immigrants.
00:09:22,00:09:30,"I will say that when new arrivals, yeah, 300 years ago. Anyway, I think this Joseph was a stunning man."
00:09:30,00:09:35,"Oh, yeah. Mr. Sewers is great. Yeah, basically what he did, Joseph Baseljep,"
00:09:35,00:09:41,"as he born in 1819, he is responsible more than most other people or maybe the biggest individual"
00:09:41,00:09:46,"contribution to London turning from a medieval city into a modern one. Christopher Rad,"
00:09:46,00:09:50,"this is the other one, I guess. Yeah, but what Baseljep was doing was so before Baseljep,"
00:09:50,00:09:57,"the city was open-suers, cesspools and people's back gardens, you would have night-soil men"
00:09:57,00:10:02,"turning up to take away the poo. I mean, just, and that led to cholera, cholera cholera. Like, it was"
00:10:02,00:10:06,"just, it was cholera city. Yeah, the, the, the terms was disgusting. The terms was, basically,"
00:10:06,00:10:11,"it's healthier now, isn't it, than it was then. Yeah. So unimaginably healthier. So basically,"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"you put all the poo in the terms, the terms obviously flows out to see that broadly,"
00:10:15,00:10:20,"broadly worked as a solution. It's a tidal river. But it's a tidal river. And it's so,"
00:10:20,00:10:24,"so there would just be this mass in the water of poo that broadly is making its way out to see,"
00:10:24,00:10:29,"but sometimes the tile would come back in. And that normally is okay, because it's normally in the water."
00:10:29,00:10:33,"Obviously, it stinks and obviously it's very, you cannot drink from the river. Yeah, yeah. But"
00:10:33,00:10:40,"the main problem comes when the river level goes down a bit. And in the summer, summer of 1858 was"
00:10:40,00:10:47,unbelievably hot and dry. And the water level dropped. And there were piles of this matter on
00:10:47,00:10:50,the banks of the times that were about six feet deep. Anyone who smelted at the time just wrote
00:10:50,00:10:55,"these accounts saying, I cannot describe the smell. Yeah, yeah. I will never forget the smell as long"
00:10:55,00:11:00,"as I live. Yeah, right. And people were dying and dying and dying of cholera. Yeah. So he then,"
00:11:00,00:11:05,he then set in motion the building of the sewers. Yeah. Did a little thing where he sort of calculated
00:11:05,00:11:09,"that they should be double the size that they were planning on building, which means that we're"
00:11:09,00:11:14,"largely using a lot of them 150 years later, right? We're still using them. But also, I mean, just"
00:11:14,00:11:18,"sort of as a on a tourist level, if you're walking around London, you're kind of walking largely"
00:11:18,00:11:23,"in Basil Jets London. Yeah. All of the embankments. So all the embankments amazing that it just wasn't,"
00:11:23,00:11:28,"the Thames was so much wider. Yeah, but those are basically to be described as sewer caps. They are"
00:11:28,00:11:31,"where the sewers are underneath. That was never there. So if you ever walk along the Thames,"
00:11:31,00:11:37,that's Basil Jets basically. It's like 50 acres of new London that you created. And that thing
00:11:37,00:11:42,"about him doubling the capacity, some sources say he worked out the purge of an average Londoner"
00:11:42,00:11:48,"generously and then doubled it. And then some sources say he doubled it again. Because he said,"
00:11:48,00:11:53,"look, we're only going to do this. I know Londoners. They're going to be pulling more than this. I tell"
00:11:53,00:11:58,"you, we'll need to double this. Exactly. And he basically said, look, we cannot do this a second time."
00:11:58,00:12:04,"We have to do it once. Yeah. And that meant, right, that as the population rose, you had either double"
00:12:04,00:12:08,"or quadruple the capacity, which meant that when high-rise buildings started being built and the"
00:12:08,00:12:14,"purge overall purge did increase massively, like there is an alternate world in which he didn't"
00:12:14,00:12:19,"double the capacity and in which 1960s London was overflowing the raw sewage, like swinging"
00:12:19,00:12:24,London would have just smelt. It would have been the worst. It would have been a nightmare. But because
00:12:24,00:12:31,"of his solution, it lasted until today. And now that we've just built this huge new sewer, the Thames"
00:12:31,00:12:37,"Tideway Tunnel, which is designed to sort of solve the creaking of the system. He's buried in"
00:12:37,00:12:43,"Wimbledon, I think. In St Mary's Church. Yes. And the Mausoleum is stunning. Sorry, most people won't know"
00:12:43,00:12:47,"what St Mary's, like you were like, yeah, like everyone knows what St Mary's Church is. Sorry."
00:12:47,00:12:51,"I've lived in London for 15 years. I don't know where that is. I used to live in Wimbledon. Sorry,"
00:12:51,00:12:55,"yeah. It's where they do, it's where they do the overflow parking for the tennis tournament."
00:12:55,00:13:01,"Right, right. Sorry to get you. Oh, you mean opposite the co-op. Right. Okay, you know."
00:13:01,00:13:07,"There's no co-op in Wimbledon James. It's near the second weight trove. But that church is, the"
00:13:07,00:13:12,"Mausoleum is really interesting because it wasn't built for him. Did you see this? I did, yeah. It was built"
00:13:12,00:13:19,"for a a slave owner called John Antony Rucker. Oh, no. Yeah. I who died in 1804. And then his family"
00:13:19,00:13:23,did not want to be in the Mausoleum with him for whatever reason. So it's just figured out he was
00:13:23,00:13:28,"a terrible slave owner. Yeah, mother Rucker. And then his family didn't want to be in there. So there"
00:13:28,00:13:32,"was just almost empty, just one grave filled. So the Basil Jets bought the Mausoleum. Wow."
00:13:32,00:13:36,"And it, but he is still in there, Rucker. A Rucker is still in there. Yeah, so it's Rucker. And then"
00:13:36,00:13:40,"half a dozen Basil Jets around him. Wow. Yeah, there's, there's, there's main Basil Jets. And then"
00:13:40,00:13:45,"I think five children and Mrs. Basil Jets. And Mrs. Basil Jets. So we can fit nine, I read. So what"
00:13:45,00:13:49,"are we up to? Seven, eight, one more space. Ed could go in that Mausoleum, couldn't he? I mean,"
00:13:49,00:13:54,"that's warning now. But then there's also Peter, who's his other way. Yeah, it's the other famous"
00:13:54,00:13:59,"Basil Jets. He's a television producer. Yeah, also isn't TV and made Big Brother awesome. He may,"
00:13:59,00:14:06,"yeah, he was the creative head, I believe, of Endermall. And so he's the one who they brought in Big Brother"
00:14:06,00:14:10,"because that was an international format. But really, the British one is what made it go global."
00:14:10,00:14:14,"And Dilo, no deal as well. He's got his message. Sorry, just what I'm thinking is obviously"
00:14:14,00:14:20,works in formatting. They've got one space in the Basil Jets Mausoleum. Wow. And all these Basil Jets
00:14:20,00:14:26,"who might decide. It's like reverse Dilo, no deal, because it's who goes in the box. This is Dabina."
00:14:26,00:14:33,I'm going into the Big Basil Jets Mausoleum. I'm coming in. Oh my god. That's so good. Let's ask Ed if
00:14:33,00:14:37,"he wants to direct it. Robert Lindsay wants to host it. I think that would work. I should just say,"
00:14:37,00:14:50,Robert Lindsay is great. I call it my fubbly. And friend. Or no. And yeah.
00:14:50,00:14:57,"Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that this year,"
00:14:57,00:15:03,26 new bacteria species were discovered in a room specifically designed to not have any bacteria
00:15:03,00:15:09,in them. Brilliant. So I got this story of a pop science writer. He's one of my favorite pop science
00:15:09,00:15:14,"writers, Dr. Robin George Andrews. He wrote it for National Geographic. And this is a story about"
00:15:14,00:15:19,the clean rooms that they have at NASA. So we build all of these rocket instruments that are going
00:15:19,00:15:23,"to Mars, all the rovers and so forth in these specific rooms, because you don't want to bring"
00:15:23,00:15:28,"any life to Mars. I just love the way he said we. He's involved in their hopes like, wow,"
00:15:28,00:15:35,"did we not feel great? You're talking about the podcast. Okay, me, sorry, I am heavily involved."
00:15:35,00:15:41,You did it. Be proud. So basically the idea of the clean rooms is that humans can't allow any
00:15:41,00:15:45,"form of life on to Mars, because if we're looking for life there and we bring it there, we won't be"
00:15:45,00:15:49,able to tell if it was there or if it was from us. So these rooms are made very specifically
00:15:49,00:15:53,to make sure that the smallest of bacteria gets killed off. And they have various different
00:15:53,00:15:59,ways that they do that. They fill the room with ultraviolet lights. They have radioactive beams
00:15:59,00:16:04,going through. They have prolonged periods of dry heating and they get to they get it to above
00:16:04,00:16:08,water's boiling point. So it would kill anything that would be on the surface. They do basically
00:16:08,00:16:21,"everything they can to make sure nothing goes on. And they go, that's quite good. So that's the opening."
00:16:21,00:16:28,Use another brand. You just pour them into a bucket together. Dumb. I'm going to set up a bleached
00:16:28,00:16:38,"company that kills not point not not. Oh, I don't need it. I don't need it. Yeah, so and a while ago,"
00:16:38,00:16:44,they found a bacteria that did survive and did possibly go into space on various missions. So it
00:16:44,00:16:49,"is possible that right now on Mars, there is a bacteria there that they didn't detect. So life"
00:16:49,00:16:54,might be on Mars right now. That'd be good. But why love was they when they saying that it's not
00:16:54,00:16:58,that this bacteria are extremely good at like they're not like so small they couldn't find them.
00:16:58,00:17:03,This bacteria was playing dead. That's the thing. This is what's the bacteria new to hide.
00:17:03,00:17:08,"When the velociraptor figures out the door like that's yes, that's what we've got, right? The bacteria"
00:17:08,00:17:24,"was like guys guys. Yeah, it's basically like the ties. It goes into a hibernation that makes"
00:17:24,00:17:29,"it seem as if it's because all of that bright red aren't they? Guys, put the camera on."
00:17:29,00:17:34,"Put the camera on. Go down. Go down. Behind the bush. Behind the bush. Okay, we've got we'll be in"
00:17:34,00:17:39,Mars in 14 years. We've just got to keep quiet. What I find really interesting is that because the rooms
00:17:39,00:17:44,"are clean so much, the microbes that are found there, it's almost like we are putting them through"
00:17:44,00:17:49,"an accelerated breeding program to make sure they can withstand cleaning, drying, UV treatment and"
00:17:49,00:17:54,"lack of food. Yeah. And you know, all the sterilization methods we're using, actually we're creating"
00:17:54,00:18:00,super bacteria. But what do they like swap the surfaces to see if it's there? I guess they must do
00:18:00,00:18:06,"right? Yes, I think and the ones they find the really weird thing is sometimes they're found only"
00:18:06,00:18:12,in clean rooms. So in 2013 scientists found a new microbe which had only been found in spacecraft
00:18:12,00:18:17,"clean rooms, one in Florida and one in French Guiana. Yeah, was that the one where they found that"
00:18:17,00:18:22,"they were actually eating the cleaning products that they were using? Oh, you're amazing. Oh, this"
00:18:22,00:18:27,"statue is delicious. Yeah, yum, yum. Isn't that bad that they found them in two different places? So then"
00:18:27,00:18:32,"the pre that's pre that it's us doing this then. It's certainly a heavy implication, isn't it? Yeah,"
00:18:32,00:18:37,"yeah, yeah. But that's why they swabs, James saying about swapping, they do swabs are in"
00:18:37,00:18:40,"places and then they put them into solutions and test them and they're like, oh my god, yeah,"
00:18:40,00:18:46,"this thing is still alive. That's how they've been discovering them. Yeah. Um, bacteria, oh yeah."
00:18:46,00:18:51,"And being discovered and so on. Yeah. They've recently found, we've spoken a bit about the"
00:18:51,00:18:57,"largest single-celled organisms, which is kind of algae, I think, and they get really big. But in 2022,"
00:18:57,00:19:04,"the world's largest bacterium was found and it's the size of an eyelash. It's 5,000 times bigger than"
00:19:04,00:19:09,the previous largest known bacterium. Right. You can pick it up with a pair of tweezers. It's
00:19:09,00:19:14,crazy. It's called Theomargarita Magnifica. And I've bothered that from Peter Express.
00:19:15,00:19:21,"Disappointingly small. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very big for a bacterium. Um, tiny pizza. Tiny, yeah, yeah."
00:19:21,00:19:27,"Waiter, there's a hair in my pizza. Actually. Don't shut everyone."
00:19:27,00:19:33,"Um, apparently it's the equivalent of us meeting a human being who's as tall as Mount Everest."
00:19:33,00:19:37,"What? That's how big it is in comparison to not a normal bacterium. To a normal bacterium, right?"
00:19:37,00:19:42,"Isn't that? I mean, crazy. That's funny in the clean room when you go hide and mount Everest, dude."
00:19:42,00:19:49,"Oh, cleaning against the walls and awkward ways. Let me give you one more story about bacteria."
00:19:49,00:19:53,"Oh, okay. Okay. The stats are very bad, but it does have a happy ending. Okay."
00:19:53,00:20:00,"So there was a woman in 1984. She was in America and she was studying, um, gonorrhea."
00:20:00,00:20:07,And she was driving home from work and she picked up her son on the way who was like three years old.
00:20:08,00:20:13,"And then left the sun in the car while she went to the shops to buy some stuff. Oh, no."
00:20:13,00:20:19,"The gonorrhea was in a petri dish that contains something called chocolate agar,"
00:20:19,00:20:26,"which is like a type of jelly that you use to grow. It's not sweet, but you grow bacteria on it,"
00:20:26,00:20:33,"but it looks a bit like chocolate. Oh, no. Anyway, the child et pyagarr. You've got to"
00:20:33,00:20:39,"re-alarm and test positive for gonorrhea two days later. Oh, my God. And so they took them to the"
00:20:39,00:20:46,centers of disease control and told them what had happened. And the happy ending is that the
00:20:46,00:20:52,child was cured because they gave them antibiotics mixed in with ice cream. So he got some ice cream
00:20:52,00:20:58,"in the end of chocolate. Chocolate ice cream. What a win for this kid. Oh, good lord. Imagine being"
00:20:58,00:21:02,"that got when they get much older and being like trying to let you know, STD chat and being like,"
00:21:02,00:21:11,was a long time ago. I just think don't make your agar jelly look like ice cream. There are
00:21:11,00:21:16,a few different barriers that have been that have been gone through there on the in the like
00:21:16,00:21:21,"it's a real get me anymore situation. Now, anyway, I've left the gonorrhea in this thing"
00:21:22,00:21:31,"label chocolate. It's very 80s parenting as well. With all the chemicals. Well, it's like the marshmallow"
00:21:31,00:21:38,test except marshmallow. It's really interesting. This wiggly sort of ties back a bit to the previous
00:21:38,00:21:44,fact because bacteria were first discovered in the 17th century and we think maybe in the 1640s
00:21:44,00:21:52,Athanasius Kircher. He wrote that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms.
00:21:52,00:21:57,"So that might have been him observing with a primitive microscope, like the microscopic life."
00:21:57,00:22:03,"But basically in 1900, so even 200 years after bacteria were discovered, the leading causes of"
00:22:03,00:22:10,"death were influenza, tuberculosis and gastroenteritis, right? These are all microorganism based. In 2000,"
00:22:10,00:22:14,"100 years later, the main causes of death were heart disease cancer and stroke. It's just a massive"
00:22:14,00:22:20,"shift in what does eventually get you and our lives. Yeah, yeah, it was so bacterial before."
00:22:20,00:22:24,"Back in the day. Yeah, and before things like penicillin, that's what exactly."
00:22:24,00:22:29,"Yeah. Penicillin, I always think as one of those moments that were so lucky happened because"
00:22:29,00:22:33,"there was a real sliding doors moment there. Because Alexander Fleming was to come back from holiday,"
00:22:33,00:22:39,so he was sitting inside his lab and he was going over all the petri dishes that he had left before
00:22:39,00:22:48,"going off on a holiday. So chocolate, chocolate. And out of nowhere, sort of as he's looking,"
00:22:48,00:22:54,"a man called Merlin pops his head around the door. And there used to be colleagues together,"
00:22:54,00:23:00,"and he was looking for a new job, I believe. And he sort of said, hey, Fleming, and had he'd said,"
00:23:00,00:23:04,"let's go to the pub, which is why he was kind of coming in to have a chat with him and take him"
00:23:04,00:23:09,away from the work. He would have not have seen what he saw in the petri dish in that moment.
00:23:09,00:23:14,"So Merlin said, no, no, you keep looking. And that was the moment when he went, that's funny."
00:23:14,00:23:19,"And he saw what would become the mold, the bacteria had disappeared and that some mold had"
00:23:19,00:23:22,"presumably killed it. And that was penicillin. And that was penicillin. How much do we believe that, Andy?"
00:23:22,00:23:25,"Well, then the other thing he hasn't said is that Merlin handed him a sword, which he pulled"
00:23:25,00:23:30,"out of his dome, and he became the rightful king of England. And that, I think that's a pretty"
00:23:30,00:23:35,big part of penicillin journey. I don't know why he left that out. Yeah. My way grandpa was called
00:23:35,00:23:40,"Herbert Mervin, but he told me as a child that his middle name was Merlin. That's because we"
00:23:40,00:23:47,"were descended as well as people from Merlin. And I was about 25. Before, you know, when you say"
00:23:47,00:23:55,"a fact out loud, and I was like, oh, yeah, because we're descended from Merlin. Oh, no, he lied."
00:23:55,00:24:00,"But so do we think that that's questionable if Merlin came in or not? Well, obviously Fleming was"
00:24:00,00:24:05,"already a bacteriologist. And, you know, and he had made this discovery of lysosine, which was a thing"
00:24:05,00:24:11,"which it did inhibit bacterial growth, but against a few small numbers of bacteria. So it wasn't a"
00:24:11,00:24:16,"game changer. He found that in about 1921 or two. And then several years later, he left some"
00:24:16,00:24:21,"Staphylococcus bacteria, a culture in the lab. And then he got back and he saw they'd been contaminated"
00:24:21,00:24:26,"by a fungus, which had destroyed the colonies of staff around it. So that wasn't accident,"
00:24:26,00:24:30,but obviously he was very well placed to discover it. There is this story that it's only because
00:24:30,00:24:34,"he was in a rifle club at his local medical school. He was in medical school, just doing general"
00:24:34,00:24:40,"medicine. And the team captain really wanted to keep him in the team and said, well, you'll stay in"
00:24:40,00:24:44,the team if you join the research department at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in Paddington.
00:24:44,00:24:49,And that's why he became a bacteriologist. He's also written up on collegiatewaterpolot.org as
00:24:49,00:24:55,"the most significant water polo player of all time. Yeah, out. It's because... What did he do with the"
00:24:55,00:25:01,others? Is it just him? He played water polo age 16 for the London Scottish regiment because he
00:25:01,00:25:07,was in the army as a young man. And this is a great website collegiatewaterpolot.org which basically
00:25:07,00:25:14,"re-centers the universe around water polo. I love it. That's very good. And even after he discovered it,"
00:25:14,00:25:19,"it wasn't rolled out until 15 years later. Well, because yes, so there was that thing where it didn't"
00:25:19,00:25:24,"yield as much penicillin as they need, that particular mould. So it became a global hunt in order"
00:25:24,00:25:29,"to try and find a different mould that produced penicillin. And I guess it's part, you know, there's a lot"
00:25:29,00:25:34,"of legendary tales about this stuff, but the story of moldy Mary, who's the person who often gets"
00:25:34,00:25:39,attributed to being the person. I think I've heard that like you are. There was a lab in Illinois
00:25:39,00:25:45,that was trying to find a new mould. And they sent basically a calling out to soldiers around the
00:25:45,00:25:50,"world who were in the field trying to find mould and send it back to this lab. She, moldy Mary,"
00:25:50,00:25:54,"the story of her, was a lab assistant working there. And one day when she was coming into work,"
00:25:54,00:25:59,"she passed a grocery store outside, and she was buying a melon, and she saw an interesting melon"
00:25:59,00:26:04,"in the in the batch that had some mould on it. And she thought, ""How looks like the mould we might be"
00:26:04,00:26:09,"looking for?"" I still remember the day in QI when someone came into the office. I think it was probably"
00:26:09,00:26:16,"just in Pollard and told us about moldy Mary's melons. We were just like, ""Okay, well that's 20 minutes"
00:26:16,00:26:20,"of material."" Yeah, they have their own rights itself. Well so isn't it funny? There's that other Mary,"
00:26:20,00:26:25,"TV Mary, moldy Mary. Oh yeah, type of Mary. Type of Mary, type of Mary. I'm like, ""Don't call"
00:26:25,00:26:29,"you kid Mary, it's the thing I'm getting, if I'm getting here."" One thing about the older days is"
00:26:29,00:26:34,a lot of people call their kids Mary. Yes. We all have relatively young kids so know how hard it is
00:26:34,00:26:40,"to get them to brush their teeth. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. So here's some vibri begging, crying."
00:26:40,00:26:46,"Just open, just let me, yeah. Oh cool. Well here's something we can say to them that"
00:26:46,00:26:51,"might help them to do it. If you brush your teeth properly, your mouth becomes full of nice bacteria,"
00:26:51,00:26:56,"as if you don't. It's full of evil bacteria. Great. Don't get rid of bacteria. James, come onto my"
00:26:56,00:27:00,"house. Please engage my five-year-old son with that argument. Let's see how far. Yeah, I think you're"
00:27:00,00:27:04,raising your child a bit differently to have maybe carry it and I hope that's not going to do much.
00:27:04,00:27:09,You're not giving shits about the good bacteria or the nice bacteria. Here's what I do. If you clean
00:27:09,00:27:15,"your teeth, I'm going to give you five pounds. I say if you want to brush your teeth, we put the"
00:27:15,00:27:20,telly on. That's the deal. No one gets telly to tell you. I brought you for the yakled to get the
00:27:20,00:27:25,"friendly bacteria on them. We're doing the right thing. Yeah, that's right. So the idea is that if you"
00:27:25,00:27:31,put a load of bacteria together in a petri dish and some are nice as some are nasty. You got a party.
00:27:31,00:27:35,"And the nasty ones, they love a party and they're going to kill all the nice ones, right?"
00:27:35,00:27:42,"And that works in pretty much all situations. But if you keep cleaning somewhere, then everyone's"
00:27:42,00:27:47,energy is used up by the fact that they keep getting killed by the fact that they're being cleaned and
00:27:47,00:27:52,it suddenly becomes no use anymore to attack the other bacteria. Because they're fighting a bigger
00:27:52,00:27:57,"problem. Exactly that. And so what you find is that the more that people brush their teeth,"
00:27:57,00:28:01,the more the bacteria that's in your mouth are the ones that don't attack the other bacteria.
00:28:01,00:28:07,"And there's lots of links, isn't it, to like plaque bacteria in gums and dementia? Yeah, hard to"
00:28:07,00:28:12,see as well. Like flossing is one of the biggest things you can do because they found this bacteria in the
00:28:12,00:28:18,"plaque. And then I haven't read it, I can't remember. But there's some links to then finding the"
00:28:18,00:28:23,the the the mold in the brain. And so the one the biggest like causes they think is in between the
00:28:23,00:28:28,"teeth. Oh my god. It's interdental brushing, okay? Yeah, so that's good as a floss, yeah. Oh great."
00:28:28,00:28:32,"Because I use them as well. In other words, that's £5 while spent them. That's what we're saying,"
00:28:32,00:28:38,"yeah, yeah, yeah. Mine is like cleaning my own teeth again. I start to when I moved out of home and"
00:28:38,00:28:49,"that money dried up. Okay, it's time for fact number three. And that is James. Okay, my fact this"
00:28:49,00:28:56,"week is that Byron's Don Jewen, which Gerta called a work of boundless genius, was inspired by a"
00:28:56,00:29:05,"pantomime. Wow, two wells, one for the fact, the other for Don Jewen. I say Don Juan. Well, if you"
00:29:05,00:29:10,"read the poem, you would get very confused by some of the rhymes. Really? Does it fail? They're in"
00:29:10,00:29:15,"lies of tale. Yeah, so Don Juan is a story, isn't it? As sort of classic Spanish. He's a"
00:29:15,00:29:22,"noble wothario. He's a dirty boy. Yeah, Don Juan. And the devil drags him to hell at the end. Sorry,"
00:29:22,00:29:31,"spoiler. Don Juan. Yes, sorry. Oh, right. There's Johnny Depp film, which Byron Adams did the song for,"
00:29:31,00:29:35,"good. Have you ever really loved a woman? We've all got, I was going to say Moliad, but yeah."
00:29:35,00:29:43,"Have you ever really, really, really ever loved a woman? Oh, I love that song. I've held back"
00:29:43,00:29:46,"until now, but the number of copyright breaches you've made this show, but they're going to be a"
00:29:46,00:29:52,"nightmare to edit around. Sorry, sorry, we have stews review it. That was beautiful singing career."
00:29:52,00:29:59,"Thank you so much. I call him Donnie Johnny. Oh, that's what Byron called. Yeah, I really like that."
00:29:59,00:30:03,"In letters, it was found that he was referring to him as Donnie Johnny. Now, this is not a Byron"
00:30:03,00:30:06,"story, is it? This is a story that goes further than. Yeah, it goes all the way back, but Byron did"
00:30:06,00:30:12,"his own version, which was actually quite different than Don Juan. But in his version, he said he was"
00:30:12,00:30:19,inspired by a boldly rise version of Shadwell's Liberty. And Shadwell's Liberty was a pantomime.
00:30:19,00:30:24,"In those days, pantomime wasn't, he's behind you and stuff. There was also some different things."
00:30:24,00:30:29,"They could be Marionettes. They could be, they're basically very popular plays that happened"
00:30:29,00:30:35,"in, in the west end of London. And this one was made by Charles Anthony Del Pini at the Royal Theatre"
00:30:35,00:30:40,"Byron Sora, and thought I'm going to write something that slags off all my mates, but with this theme."
00:30:40,00:30:44,"So what? Don Juan is basically. Do we know if it was, did you say, do we know if it was Panto or a"
00:30:44,00:30:49,"puppet show or a... Well, I've really tried to find out. It was definitely a pant, this was a"
00:30:49,00:30:53,"pantomime, but some pantomimes did have Marionettes in, and I think this one did, and I think it was"
00:30:53,00:30:58,"also based a little bit on Punch and Judy, because I was very popular at time as well. Right."
00:30:58,00:31:05,"It sounds like the poem itself, which has seemed to be Lord Byron's sort of masterpiece, really,"
00:31:05,00:31:10,"and which he published many years, because they were written in cantoes, right. So they sort of were"
00:31:10,00:31:13,"released. Yeah, you do a book at a time, and then it was about six years he was, they were coming in."
00:31:13,00:31:19,"It's like M-thrums. Yeah, exactly, right. Yeah. And like Game of Thrones, the final book was never"
00:31:19,00:31:23,"written, I believe. Yeah. I mean, we've still got a chance with George R.R. Martin, but..."
00:31:23,00:31:26,"I was the last seven were missing. He said it was meant to be 24, cantoes,"
00:31:26,00:31:30,"many books and four, and there are sort of 60's. Is anyone around here read it?"
00:31:30,00:31:33,"I've read the whole thing. Have you? Oh, because I studied English. I thought it was a little"
00:31:33,00:31:38,"prop for you all. Oh, yeah. My university edition of Lord Byron, and it's very..."
00:31:38,00:31:42,"We did Byron, but it's Sussex. You didn't ever read the text. You just had to talk about the"
00:31:42,00:31:48,"historical context of what was after that. Look, it's so... So it's that it's about..."
00:31:48,00:31:54,"It's nearly 500 pages of this book, and it's eight line verses. It's really..."
00:31:54,00:31:59,"Yeah, I remember looking at it and finding it not quite hard to read. But the thing is, I think it's"
00:31:59,00:32:06,"the most readable epic poem. And give us a random, yeah, verse. You gentlemen,"
00:32:06,00:32:12,"by dint of long seclusion, from better company, have kept your own. At Keswick and through still"
00:32:12,00:32:20,"continued fusion of one another's minds, at last, have grown. To deem, as a most logical conclusion,"
00:32:20,00:32:26,"that Poise has reached for you alone, there is a narrowness in such a notion, which makes me wish"
00:32:26,00:32:36,"you change your lakes for ocean. Absolutely devastating slam. So he spends... Come on, it's like when"
00:32:36,00:32:42,it's a ten-year-old does a little rhyming pose. Was Keswick? So he's at about Wordsworth that.
00:32:42,00:32:46,"It's about the Lake Poets. Is it? It's worth Conorage, who were his big rivals, Sothe,"
00:32:46,00:32:51,"who was the poet laureate at the time, who was very stoji. He spends a lot of this epic poem about,"
00:32:51,00:32:56,"supposedly, about Don Jew and slagging off Wordsworth et al. And you mentioned Keswick, home of the"
00:32:56,00:33:03,"now, well-famous pencil museum. Right. But I would say Byron is probably the only one of those who's"
00:33:03,00:33:08,"readily readable, pretty much anyone can pick up Wordsworth. It's worth it. It's so readable."
00:33:08,00:33:14,It's much more readable. I think Don Jew and it's so funny. It's so clear and it's so entertaining.
00:33:14,00:33:19,It's a brilliant story. It's all about this young nobleman and it's the scrapes he gets into and
00:33:19,00:33:24,it starts with him accidentally getting into an adulterous situation with a married lady when
00:33:24,00:33:30,"his young man. And then canto two is all his massive shipwreck story, which is so exciting."
00:33:30,00:33:35,"Unlike Don Juan, he's not a lethario. He keeps finding himself with older women and stuff like that."
00:33:35,00:33:42,"You're on it. Basically Byron is Byron slightly excusing his own lethario-ish behaviour by saying,"
00:33:42,00:33:47,"""Look, it's not like that you're on it. It just happened."" I just fell into this room."
00:33:47,00:33:53,But the second book of it is all about this big shipwreck which Don Jew and gets caught up in.
00:33:53,00:33:58,"And this is really cool because Byron's grandfather, again very aristocratic family, he was Lord Byron."
00:33:58,00:34:05,"His grandfather was a young man called John Byron, maybe 50 years earlier. So it's John Byron."
00:34:05,00:34:12,"And he was in a shipwreck himself. There's this amazing book called The Wager, which is all about this"
00:34:12,00:34:17,English shipwreck got sunk in 1732. I've just finished it and one of the main sources of how it all
00:34:17,00:34:22,"went down and there was cannibalism, there was mutiny, there was murder. One of the main sources is John"
00:34:22,00:34:27,"Byron, who later became an admiral and got nicknamed Fowler the Jack because everywhere he went,"
00:34:27,00:34:31,"the worst storms in the world happened to him. But if you're on the ship with Lord Byron's grandfather,"
00:34:31,00:34:35,"yeah, you're going to have terrible weather. That was his reputation. So then Fowler the Jack"
00:34:35,00:34:42,"son was Mad Jack Byron, who was Byron's dad. And then Byron didn't seem to carry on the nicknames."
00:34:42,00:34:49,Everyone was called Jack or Mary. But basically Byron took a lot of the shipwreck stuff from his
00:34:49,00:34:54,grandfather's own book about the shipwreck. Like there's a bit where they eat Don Jewen's dog and it's
00:34:54,00:34:58,"a really sad story. And that had happened to his own grandfather. Well, that did seem to be the"
00:34:58,00:35:03,"thing about Byron was that his poetry, as you're saying, that's laced with autobiography in it. And"
00:35:03,00:35:07,"the Lathario stuff, which is what he was known for it in his real world, people were sort of reading"
00:35:07,00:35:13,"it almost almost in the way that as as we're talking, a new Lillie Allen album has been released,"
00:35:13,00:35:21,"yeah, which just lays out the life that she's recently experienced with her now ex-husband. It's just"
00:35:21,00:35:25,"like it's all the stories. It's like a gossip, right? We send that Lillie Allen is the modern day,"
00:35:25,00:35:30,"Lord Byron. You know what? Fuck yeah, we are. Because that is a piece of genius. That album,"
00:35:30,00:35:35,"the writing on that is so beautiful. The lyrics are unbelievable. Also, I'll take her as modern day by"
00:35:35,00:35:41,"her dad was very famous. Yeah, Mad Jack. Mad Key, Alan. How do you think you'd object to that title,"
00:35:41,00:35:48,"either? This is the most, how do you do fellow kids where you describe it, Lord Byron. Sorry,"
00:35:48,00:35:53,"and her brother was in Game of Thrones. So, and they slept together, haven't they? Lillie Allen"
00:35:53,00:36:00,"and her brother. No, no, brother. That was Alfie Allen and Gemma Wheelan, so not actually Lillie Allen."
00:36:00,00:36:06,"Sorry, yeah, yeah. Gemma playing her sister. I know. I really like the Lord Byron as Lillie Allen"
00:36:06,00:36:10,"theory. Oh, yeah. Because he did have to flee England. Lillie Allen has never had to flee England."
00:36:10,00:36:15,She's been living in New York. She fled New York. She brought a big brownstone because
00:36:15,00:36:18,he told her to buy it and encourage her to get it more good. These are the lyrics to the
00:36:18,00:36:23,"first song. Okay, it's great. We continue in Kerry's copyright corner here. It's fine."
00:36:23,00:36:28,"Does she have a club foot? Do we know? She has a club. She, yeah, yeah. She swam the"
00:36:28,00:36:32,"hellish bumps in the straight between Europe and Asia. She died into the canal in Venice,"
00:36:32,00:36:38,"famously. Huge fan of Greek independence. But Byron sort of, he had to flee England after his"
00:36:38,00:36:44,marriage fell apart and he was accused of unnatural vices and having appallingly mistreated his wife.
00:36:44,00:36:49,"You know, there was this thing about his half-sister. Did they have an affair? But also, he was the only"
00:36:49,00:36:55,poet. He properly walked the walk and he went to Greece and funded the Greek Navy for a while
00:36:55,00:36:59,because Greece was trying to win his independence from the Turks. That's track five on the
00:36:59,00:37:07,Will the Greeks try and keep Lillie Allen's lungs after she dies because she used her breath to speak
00:37:07,00:37:12,"out for Greek independence. Byron died in Missalongi, which is Greek town promoting Greek independence."
00:37:12,00:37:17,"And he'd been there for years, backing the Greek. He was this huge fan of the Greeks and he wrote"
00:37:17,00:37:21,"some very rude stuff about Lord Elgin and that, you know, like knicking Greek treasures. And the"
00:37:21,00:37:28,"Greeks kept his lungs, the source of his new map, the breath of the soul and his larynx and they were"
00:37:28,00:37:33,sort of put in an earning Greece until and they've disappeared. The give back those marbles we might
00:37:33,00:37:45,"get the lungs back coming as a first one. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. That is Andy."
00:37:45,00:37:50,"My fact is, for several years in the 1920s, a beach in South Wales was the fastest place on the"
00:37:50,00:37:57,"planet. How can a beach be faster? Well, good point. I'm not surprised as someone with South"
00:37:57,00:38:02,"Wales in heritage. Oh, yeah. Your Welsh carrier. I'm half Welsh. Yes, I've never fully understood"
00:38:02,00:38:07,"the extent to which Welsh, but well, my dad is Welsh. Oh, there we go. So I was born there and I"
00:38:07,00:38:12,am called Calean Lloyd. I thought that I know. That was my clue. So have you ever been to the
00:38:12,00:38:18,"Pentine Sands in Carmarthenshire? Oh, Carmarthenshire, yeah, I have actually, yeah. So is this stunningly"
00:38:18,00:38:22,beautiful beach? Make the whole of the beaches of South Wales are the most beautiful beaches in the
00:38:22,00:38:27,"world. Sorry, Dan. I don't know if you're going to interject there with beaches that you may be from,"
00:38:27,00:38:32,"but the gower peninsula, all of that bit are stunning. Absolutely. I wasn't trying to raise up"
00:38:32,00:38:36,"although the Pentine Sands, if I were to blow any of the other beaches of South Wales, all of which"
00:38:36,00:38:44,are 10 out of 10 or Australia or Australia. Sydney ones are terrible actually. I'm sure they're fine.
00:38:44,00:38:48,"Yeah, you know, but oh, the gower. Oh my god. Oh, absolutely. Tell us more."
00:38:48,00:38:54,"Well, there's this beach called the Pentine Sands and the interesting thing about it is it's"
00:38:54,00:39:00,"very long and the sand is nice and compact and hard and it was traditionally used for foot races,"
00:39:00,00:39:05,"you know, horseback races, bike races. They started having motorbike races there in the early"
00:39:05,00:39:11,"20s and they realized that hang on in the 20s, people were starting to get serious about breaking"
00:39:11,00:39:16,"land speed records in a car. And the early records have been broken out of a track called Brooklyn,"
00:39:16,00:39:23,"which is circular or avoid. And what you really need to break a land speed record is a very,"
00:39:23,00:39:27,very long straight track because you need a couple of miles to get up to top speed. You need a mile
00:39:27,00:39:31,at top speed and then you need another mile to slow down. Turning those carnages on is going to
00:39:31,00:39:37,slow you down. Exactly. And so they realized this beach is perfect to drive on because it's seven
00:39:37,00:39:43,"miles of sand and you can drive on it. I wonder on it a few weeks ago. Yeah. And it's absolutely,"
00:39:43,00:39:49,"it's amazing. Of course it is. It's stunning. Yeah, yeah. But I thought that it's now property of"
00:39:49,00:39:53,the MOD. It is. You can't walk on it during the week. I was there on a weekday and there are
00:39:53,00:39:58,"loud dystopian announcements saying, do not walk on the beach. Right. You can go at the end by"
00:39:58,00:40:01,"the cafe in the museum, which is where I went. What do they do on there? They test weapons."
00:40:01,00:40:08,You know what the MOD are like? They're testing weapons. They're not having cups of tea.
00:40:08,00:40:10,That was the most beautiful place in the country we can bond.
00:40:10,00:40:17,"Unbelievable. So it's, but there is this bit, which you can't go on, which is open to the public."
00:40:17,00:40:22,And they've just opened a new museum there about the land speed records. And it's amazing. And
00:40:22,00:40:26,"they've got a brilliant display of other different kinds of sand and the diameter of the grains,"
00:40:26,00:40:30,which I found very interesting. How are your family? Wait a few to week. All those tiny
00:40:30,00:40:34,bits of information next to the pictures. Were they because you reminded me so much of my father
00:40:34,00:40:40,one hundred a day. He's still reading it. He's still reading the information flags. But we
00:40:40,00:40:48,spent two hours. I don't touch the petri dishes. That's exactly why I went to the website for
00:40:48,00:40:55,"the museum. And it said, if you rush, you can probably complete it in two hours. So I imagine Andy's"
00:40:55,00:40:59,"family were. No, I did a new land speed record in the museum because people were getting a bit"
00:40:59,00:41:09,"impatient. People were getting a tad impatient. But this is where Malcolm Campbell, who's the site,"
00:41:09,00:41:13,the sort of head of this amazing speed-breaking family. I'm sure we'll talk about them. He broke
00:41:13,00:41:19,"the record at 146 miles an hour. His friend and rival, JG Perry Thomas, broke it in his car,"
00:41:19,00:41:27,"Babs. Babs is the name Babs. Oh sorry, Perry Thomas was Welsh and he was, he tragically was killed"
00:41:27,00:41:32,there during the land's been record attempt. Instantly killed. And the action later moved to places like
00:41:32,00:41:38,"the Daytona Salt Flats. As a result of that crash, I think. I really do. Basically, he was trying to"
00:41:38,00:41:43,get over 200 miles an hour really. He was trying to get there and thereabouts. And they realised that
00:41:43,00:41:47,"when he died in that crash, probably this isn't the best place to go that fast. Right."
00:41:47,00:41:51,"He needed somewhere even flatter. And then they went to the salt flats, didn't they?"
00:41:51,00:41:57,Yes. And he got buried and so did Babs. His car was buried as well. Babs was buried in the exact
00:41:57,00:42:01,"spot where the crash happened. So they literally dug a hole, put it down there. And it was buried"
00:42:01,00:42:06,"there for about 42 years. And then someone petitioned to excavate it, to put it back together."
00:42:06,00:42:11,"And it now very occasionally sits in the museum, Andy. I have seen it. Wow. You saw Babs?"
00:42:11,00:42:16,"Yeah. It's been lovingly restored. Wow. It's so, it's such a great museum."
00:42:16,00:42:20,"Yeah. But also, did you read about the heritage of Babs? It must have been there in the museum."
00:42:20,00:42:25,Okay. So Babs went by a different name before. So that was a new name given to Babs because it was
00:42:25,00:42:32,"a new owner. It was originally called Chitty 4 because it was owned by a man called Count Zbrowski,"
00:42:32,00:42:37,who was the inspiration for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. What? This was one of the cars that was the
00:42:37,00:42:41,inspiration for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I'm sorry. Let's see the PRS moment. Bang Bang Chitty Chitty.
00:42:41,00:42:46,Oh my god. Oh my god. We love you. Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Okay.
00:42:46,00:42:52,"There was Chitty 1, Chitty 2, Chitty 3, and then Chitty 4. Chitty 1, Chitty 2, Chitty 2, Chitty 3."
00:42:52,00:42:58,"Chitty 1 became the ownership of Arthur Conan Doyle's sons. They took ownership of that,"
00:42:58,00:43:01,"and the other two went to other people, and number 4 raised it. Yeah. So that's what you saw."
00:43:01,00:43:05,You know who has the current British land speed record? Bob Goudof. I'm going to...
00:43:05,00:43:11,"Actually, I think I'm right now. Is it Freddy Fudd's half? No. It's not. Oh, is it someone from"
00:43:11,00:43:17,Top Gear? Is it... It's not Idris Elba. It's Idris Elba. Is it? I'm sorry. Bob Goudof is far off from
00:43:17,00:43:25,Idris Elba. They're both national treasures. Exactly. Exactly. He broke it in 2015. He did 180
00:43:25,00:43:29,"miles an hour for what they call the flying mile in a, in a some kind of Bentley. I mean, he did it"
00:43:29,00:43:34,"on the pen by chance. Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's the UK land speed record. Like the current"
00:43:34,00:43:39,"world land speed record is 760 something miles an hour. It's very, very fast. Okay."
00:43:40,00:43:45,"But yeah, Amy Johnson, when she flew from South Wales to New York directly, she took off from..."
00:43:45,00:43:50,"The pen, nine sounds. The pen, nine sounds. Wow. I know. He's a big glamorous spot. It's used to be"
00:43:50,00:43:54,"glamorous and it lasted a very, very brief time. So he talked about Malcolm Campbell. Oh, yeah."
00:43:54,00:43:59,"And then let's talk about some of the other family members. So his son was Donald Campbell,"
00:43:59,00:44:05,who was the only man to hold both the land and water speed records at the same time. Wow.
00:44:05,00:44:10,And he was one of who famously died on Coniston in a water accident. Lake District.
00:44:10,00:44:14,Coniston water. Yeah. Actually climbed the old man at Coniston. Yeah.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"At the same trip I went to the Kessik Pantson Museum. Did you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:18,00:44:24,And Donald has a daughter called Gina. Yeah. And she has broken the women's world water speed record.
00:44:24,00:44:28,The Campbell's just have this huge... We've done dynasties today. It is dynasties.
00:44:28,00:44:34,"Don Wales. Malcolm's grandson has broken the record for the fastest lawnmower on the pen, nine sounds."
00:44:34,00:44:39,"Okay. Who's, who did that? He's a guy called, he's called Don Wales and he's Malcolm Campbell's grandson."
00:44:39,00:44:45,"He loves Wales so much. He was like, just call me Don Wales. Don Wales. Don Dune and Don Wales."
00:44:45,00:44:51,"I think that's like, that is very British isn't it? It's like, our land speed record is so"
00:44:51,00:44:54,shit compared to the rest of the world. We're going to have to go lawnmowers. We're going to go
00:44:54,00:44:59,novelty. You do. It's 87 miles an hour. It's just pretty good for a lawnmower. Just a sit-on lawnmower.
00:44:59,00:45:03,"Well, you do have to take part in a public grass cutting demonstration before the race."
00:45:03,00:45:07,"So it has to be a pro, you have to be a proper lawnmower. But that's got to have a different engine,"
00:45:07,00:45:11,"right? It's made from lawnmower parts. No, I get that. I think it's not different."
00:45:11,00:45:16,"Yeah. Yeah, it's my massive rocket strength. The bit where the grass normally collects is now a"
00:45:16,00:45:22,"fuel tank. Yeah, that's right. Okay. You can't be just getting up to 87 miles an hour on a normal,"
00:45:22,00:45:28,"oh, people will be dying. Sorry. Imagine if that was assessing what's the top speed. Let's try that."
00:45:28,00:45:35,"Be awful. And fastest shed also broken on the pen, nine sounds. Okay. Well, the pen, nine sounds are"
00:45:35,00:45:39,"doing their best to keep these records coming, aren't they? Do you think it's faster or slower than"
00:45:39,00:45:46,"the fastest lawnmower? I think slower. Slow, because it's so bulky. Okay. Well, I guess I'll go faster."
00:45:46,00:45:52,Downs correct. 100 miles an hour is the faster shed record. It's pretty good. Was it on a lawnmower?
00:45:52,00:45:56,"Did they build it around the lawnmower? I don't know, but there's no shed demonstration,"
00:45:56,00:46:00,like you don't have to get a side out of it. Was the lawnmower guy trying to put the lawnmower
00:46:00,00:46:12,"back into the shed when he went that fast? Very good. Pen, nine sounds is, I know it's full of making"
00:46:12,00:46:18,"the best of their last class. If you're nearby, the museum is wicked. Landspeed records are in a"
00:46:18,00:46:24,"bit of a funk at the moment, I'd say. So the last time the land speed record was broken was 1997."
00:46:24,00:46:30,"Oh, I guess as the world is being slowly destroyed, it feels a bit, it's ingenuous to just go really fast."
00:46:30,00:46:36,"They have tried to find a synthetic fuel for the bloodhound project, which is this massive rocket"
00:46:36,00:46:40,they're trying to fire across the ground. They were going to try and do a thousand miles an hour
00:46:40,00:46:45,"with a slightly more eco-friendly version of it, but they just keep running out of money and"
00:46:45,00:46:49,"it's sort of parked for the moment. I mean, literally it is parked. But it's the era of breaking"
00:46:49,00:46:53,"records like Guinness World Record, you know what I mean? I feel like we grew up with that being a"
00:46:53,00:46:59,"big thing that that was how fast can you go? And now maybe we're like, you know, we've stopped to think,"
00:46:59,00:47:04,"should we do this? How many followers you have? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just should, is it worth this?"
00:47:04,00:47:10,"Yeah. We should all slow down. Yeah. There was a, there was a bicycle record, really interesting one"
00:47:10,00:47:16,"that was set there. Good, an eco record. Thank you, Dan. Thank you. This was in 2013. This was Guy"
00:47:16,00:47:23,"Martin. You know Guy Martin? Yeah, he's a motorbike guy and he's, he's run a bunch of best-selling books"
00:47:23,00:47:30,and TV shows and so on. And he set a record for a bicycle slipstream record. Okay. Isn't that
00:47:30,00:47:36,"amazing? So he was, he was going behind another vehicle and then he used the slipstream and that's when"
00:47:36,00:47:40,"they started recording the time. If it's faster or slower than, let's say the shed. Give me the shed"
00:47:40,00:47:44,"again. Shed was a hundred miles an hour. Okay, cycling. Well, what do you think then? In a"
00:47:44,00:47:49,slipstream. Can't be a hundred miles. Even in a slipstream. On a bicycle as well. On a bicycle.
00:47:49,00:47:55,He got a bit slower than a shed. Not an e-bike. Was it a line bike? Because they can go really fast.
00:47:55,00:48:01,"Yeah, a bit unnerving. I'll say slower than, but only just slower than the shed."
00:48:01,00:48:07,Yeah. I think this might be a minor Nana's book that I can't remember what it was.
00:48:07,00:48:12,"Oh, right. I think it was like a hundred and twenty odd miles an hour, but 112.9 miles an hour."
00:48:12,00:48:17,Fasten the shed. Yeah. So it goes lawnmower shed. Guy Martin in a slipstream.
00:48:17,00:48:22,"Yeah. But you do have electric car speed records, don't you? I think we're talking about."
00:48:22,00:48:28,Yeah. I think I think I'm mental. Are they fast? I've got one from 1899. It was the first electric
00:48:28,00:48:35,"car to go over a hundred kilometers an hour. It was called Le Jamé Contente, meaning never satisfied."
00:48:35,00:48:41,"Oh, I really thought it was saying to him, sorry. I was like, oh, that happened. Happy"
00:48:41,00:48:47,time. Yeah. I've seen the photo of that. It's insane. It was absolutely bananas there.
00:48:47,00:48:52,Apparently it was it was pretty tough to ride and the muscles of his body and neck became
00:48:52,00:48:56,"completely rigid as he drove it, because it was just all over the place."
00:48:56,00:49:00,"Oh, right. So obviously they didn't have any stability or anything like that in those days."
00:49:00,00:49:04,They have just launched the fastest e-scooter on the planet. Yeah. And you please mind out on the
00:49:04,00:49:08,"pavements because they are driving these things like crazy people. Well, this one goes at a hundred"
00:49:08,00:49:13,miles an hour. Watch out. Why do you need that? Watch out. Pick a dilly circus. Watch out.
00:49:13,00:49:18,It's not a good idea. It's a really bad idea. That feels like that's my daughter going to nursery
00:49:18,00:49:23,in the morning. Yeah. When I'm trying to catch up with her. Those microscuters are fast.
00:49:23,00:49:29,It's called the Turbo. It's made of aerospace grade aluminium and it has a range of 150 miles.
00:49:29,00:49:32,And I bet you some fucker was still not where I held me and be on the road with that.
00:49:32,00:49:36,Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned being overtaken in the far you're driving in the fast lane.
00:49:37,00:49:42,Someone behind you is on an e-scooter right up your back bumper. I've learned to. I've seen people
00:49:42,00:49:48,on e-scooters like going so fast on the road. It's terrifying. This is the future. You'll be soon
00:49:48,00:49:54,"saying, honey, I think we were just overtaken by a shed. So some Welsh records. Great."
00:49:54,00:50:00,The number of people skinny dipping in a single venue is beaten this year and the Gallup Peninsula.
00:50:00,00:50:06,"Oh, of course. What a lovely place to skinny dip wonderful. Do you want to guess how many?"
00:50:07,00:50:12,"130. Close? No, not close. Oh, I'm going to say a thousand. I'm going to say four things."
00:50:12,00:50:18,"Oh, closer than that. 295. 413. Wow."
00:50:18,00:50:24,"Yeah. And did you turn into an orgy afterwards? No, it didn't. It was very respectable."
00:50:24,00:50:29,They did at 9 a.m. to stop any rubber neckas from turning up. They can still get up early.
00:50:30,00:50:40,"But no one in our clock is morning work. Are you ready? They're prying. Oh, it's 830. I simply cannot be"
00:50:40,00:50:46,learing at someone before 9 a.m. I haven't had my guppuccino. And recently the longest ever tug of
00:50:46,00:50:50,"war game took place on a Welsh beach. Now, when you say longest, yeah, are we talking"
00:50:50,00:50:56,"longest? No, it is stretched out. It's the longest rope. So it doesn't have to be the most people."
00:50:56,00:51:02,It's just the longest rope. Here's the question. Was it longer or shorter than the longest suspension
00:51:02,00:51:12,"bridge in Portugal? No, no. No. No, because I know this one. I know this one. Can I just say as well?"
00:51:12,00:51:18,"It's part of Club Fish. We're launching a quarterly quiz. And I can tell you, you're listening now."
00:51:18,00:51:21,This is the kind of gold you're going to get. You're going to love this.
00:51:22,00:51:27,You're going to think about it logically. There's no way logic can apply here. Why have I found
00:51:27,00:51:32,this suspension bridge? Because it's very short. Because Portugal doesn't have any suspension
00:51:32,00:51:40,"bridges. Oh, because I know the length of the rope. Yeah. And I'm searching for other things."
00:51:40,00:51:47,So they're the same. They're the same. And it was the largest suspension bridge in the world
00:51:47,00:51:51,until quite recently. And then it got overtaken by one in Southeast Asia. Wow.
00:51:51,00:51:56,So the rope was that long? How long do you have length? 20 meters.
00:51:56,00:52:03,"There's 1,694 feet. Is that two very strong people to believe in that?"
00:52:03,00:52:08,"As in, could you hold that rope in the air? Two teams of 50. Oh, okay. That's a lot. But they're"
00:52:08,00:52:12,well. So they're going to be strong. They're going to be strong. That's just a fact. There's
00:52:12,00:52:16,nothing they can do about that. That's actually strong. I always struggle to remember whether you're
00:52:16,00:52:28,"halfway or 150%. Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening."
