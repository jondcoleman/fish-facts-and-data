00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish, Dan and Andy here.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,440
 Hello!

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,520
 And we just want to quickly let you know before we launch into this week's episode about this week's guest.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,200
 Yes.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,400
 It's our friend, and yours.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,000
 - Carried Lloyd. - Yeah.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,920
 She's brilliant. She's been on loads of times before. She's always fantastic.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,080
 Her fact this week is a really good one.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,680
 And it's brilliantly entertaining show. I've just listened to it and I've written it up for our archive.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,920
 - How do you? - So you're in for a treat. I can tell you that much.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,040
 - Oh, well, there we go. - Yeah.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:34,000
 And also, you should know that Carried is not only a comedian, not only a podcaster, she's also an author.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,720
 That's right. Her new book is called "Lidia Marmalade and the Christmas Wish".

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,120
 So it's the children's book. It's really funny. It's charming. It's got a little Jane Austenie flavor to it.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,800
 A little Regency Tinge. That's a terrible phrase.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,880
 But it's really funny. It's charming. It's about a girl called Lydia Marmalade.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:00,240
 Obviously, there's an amazing sausage dog. It's basically everything you could want for a kind of fun, classic, Christmassy Robb.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,400
 - Yeah. - "Lidia Marmalade and the Christmas Wish".

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,720
 Perfect. Christmas book. It's out now.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,200
 And if you love books generally and you like being part of Book Clubs, Sarah Pasco and Carried Lloyd have a podcast.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,240
 It's brilliant. It's called "Sara and Carried's Weirdos Book Club".

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,840
 Weirdos. Good name for podcasts.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,240
 - Yep. Show me something news before. - Yeah.

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,440
 And there's plenty of episodes. One of your favourite authors, Mick Heron Andy, was a guest recently talking about his slow horses series.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,000
 It's great. Check it out. But get Carried's book and one final bit of business before we start.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:18,960
 *Music*

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,640
 from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin,

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,200
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Carrie Adloyd. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,120
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order, here we go.

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Carrie Adloyd. My fact is that Joseph Baseljet,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,960
 the famous engineer who designed London Surers, who was inspired by the great stink.

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,000
 His great great grandson was the league guitarist of the band The Vapers.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,200
 Who are most famous for their single turning Japanese?

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,640
 Yes. Brilliant. Now this is a very famous song. A lot of people might know it. We just discovered

44
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,240
 someone in the QI office does not know it, who's in their late 20s. I think it's an age thing,

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,840
 because I recently was telling people this fact, and a lot of people were like, "What song?"

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,000
 And I was like, "Come on, turn it up, and they just stare at you." Really?

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,480
 Yeah, I do think it's an age thing. Because it came out in 1980, so it's an oldie.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,520
 It's an oldie. But a goodie. It's a thing classic. It's a brilliant song.

49
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,880
 The reason I know this is I know Ed Baseljet.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,200
 No. Yes, Clang. Clang, because he is now, he left The Vapers, and became a TV director,

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,520
 and he is directed Doctor Who, loads of different things, and I work with him very recently,

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,560
 on excellent Channel 5 Police drama, Ellis, starring Sharon D. Clark and Andrew Gao.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,360
 Wow, cool. At what stage in your relationship did the great great-great-grandfather come out?

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,720
 So, I am of a mind like yourself. I managed to keep it together for five days filming in Belfast,

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,920
 but the whole time I was like, "Oh, Baseljet. Must be a Baseljet. Must be related."

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,440
 That's such an unusual surname, can't be. And then we went for a drink in Belfast,

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,840
 beautiful, beautiful Belfast, after we finished our episode, and I think

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,240
 he was probably two points at Guinness Down. I was probably one rum and ginger, and I was like,

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,200
 "So are you related to the Baseljets?" And he was like, "Oh, yeah." And then some young actors,

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,240
 namely, we're like, "Who? Didn't know?" "Didn't know." And they're classic sewers.

61
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,280
 They're probably the 1860s, but I think anyone should know them. It's like the song "Turning Japanese."

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,440
 You just think, "Imagine being Baseljet, and you don't know my song. You don't know my family sewers."

63
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,560
 Yeah, so I just know a very successful television director, and yeah, so then he said,

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,440
 "Oh, yes, I am related to that Baseljet." And then someone else must, he must,

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,080
 "Oh, maybe he just came out with it. I can't remember now because we were in a

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,760
 pub in Belfast." Just said, "Oh, yeah." And I was in the band "The Vapers." And I initially didn't

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,480
 recognize the name until he said "Turning Japanese." I was like, "Oh my god." And it's curious,

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,920
 as well as "The Vapers," the name, you would think might have been Ed's suggestion, but it's not.

69
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,000
 They all smoked e-cigarettes. That's exactly right. It was, yeah, before it's time. I think the head

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,040
 of the game. Yeah. Because Ed was the guitarist, and the main songwriter was someone else,

71
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,200
 wasn't that a thing? Well, that makes sense. That makes sense when he felt it. Yeah. If it had been

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,360
 Ed Baseljet who came up with the name, he probably would have come up with the cholera epidemics.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,760
 Yes, of the 1850s. Yeah, I still going. She said, "You know, this, the Vapers are still,

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,320
 they reformed." There he is. Ed was in it for a bit, and now he's gone off to TV directing.

75
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,640
 How often do you think they play the song "Turning Japanese" in an average set? I think it's quite a lot.

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,240
 Yeah, I think it's quite a lot. I went to watch Junior Senior just after their song

77
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
 "Move Your Feet" had come out and been a big hit. Oh, yeah. And they played it four times.

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,640
 Right. That's, yeah. They could have played it five, and I would have loved it.

79
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,080
 Yeah. And it is a bit being your own tribute act, isn't it? Yeah.

80
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,880
 "Turning Japanese" was like a global hit as well. It was huge. And it was, it was their biggest hit.

81
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,680
 I like that they knew it at the time as well. So they had it ready, and they went, we should hold

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
 this back. Yeah. This is going to be a big song. And so they released it as a second single,

83
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,880
 as opposed to a first single from their album. Because they didn't want to be one hit wonders.

84
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,680
 Yeah. But then, yeah, sort of. They are. And that's no bad thing.

85
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
 Sorry, yeah, there's no bad thing. That's no bad thing.

86
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,920
 That's everything. And the former drummer, Howard Smith, was recently elected Mayor of Guildford.

87
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,800
 No. That's pretty cool. I thought I wanted a flang.

88
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,720
 Oh, he let the Mayor go. No, he haven't. I haven't met Mayor Guildford. Sorry, bye, sir.

89
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,600
 The one other thing about Ed Baseljet is, as you say, it was a TV director, but one of the things

90
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,160
 he directed on his IMDB is Seven Wonders of the Industrial World in 2003 where Robert Lindsay

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,640
 looked at London's Suez. What kind of having combination. That's great.

92
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,840
 When do you think he thought, did you think he went to production company with it? Or do you

93
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,160
 think they said, I think, because you know what, there are like eight episodes in that series,

94
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,720
 and he only directed one of them, and it was about the Suez. They thought let's get in there.

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,880
 We'd like you to do one about the phone network, please. No, I'm sure.

96
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,040
 And that's good, because Robert Lindsay, as a star of my family, has been in a lot of old shit.

97
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,400
 And then, wow, I love my family. I just couldn't resist. I saw the opening.

98
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,560
 I'm sorry. Sometimes you're going to throw your heroes under the bus for the show.

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,600
 It's really interesting, because it's lovely, Dan, who says, I love my family.

100
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,160
 I love my family in such a wife guy. Brilliant. Let's go into Suez.

101
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,680
 Yes. I kind of thought that you guys would have Suez sewn up,

102
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,440
 so I thought I'd leave with more vapors stuff. I thought that somebody...

103
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,040
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excited to talk about Baseljep.

104
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,040
 Have you ever been in the Suez, Andy? No, I never have. I've been to the church

105
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,320
 where the Baseljep Maulzileum is, but I didn't know at the time that the Maulzileum's there.

106
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,360
 I'm absolutely gussied. I'm going to have to go back. You should go soon, because it's in trouble.

107
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,120
 Is it? Yeah. It's being refurbished. It's being refurbished. They've got a heritage grant.

108
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,240
 I'm all over this now. Ironically, water is destroying it. It's not as welcome-tank for me.

109
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,640
 I think if shit was destroying it, I think the water. It's very good point. It is underground, you know.

110
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,480
 He was responsible for a lot of underground stuff, not just the Suez. Also, a bit of the district line

111
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,520
 was part of the tunnel. Let's get into it. Let's get into it. He was a bit forgotten for a while.

112
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,520
 I think he's not now, but I think there's one Baseljep family, because it's such an old surname.

113
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,800
 There's one tiny place in France called La Baseljep. The Baseljep family came from France.

114
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,760
 Weirdly, they came via America. It was a strange route, but they migrated to Britain,

115
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,520
 and I think the early 19th century. And one person who was a few generations

116
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,960
 above Joseph was the tailor of Prince of Wales, George. Oh, yes, right. He was the first British

117
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,320
 Baseljep. He was the one who... Would you like a new suit? Would you like a new suit? I really think so.

118
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,680
 That's what it was. I can imagine it now. Yeah, yeah. He was the grandfather of Joseph.

119
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,800
 Right, Baseljep. What a family. It's a stunning family. And then there was Joseph William,

120
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,200
 who we think might have been in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It's amazing. It was just like

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,760
 nepotism has been going through the ages of England. It's like England is built on a few

122
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,600
 of the stars. Stop it. Stop it. If your grandfather was talented, somehow you managed to still be fine.

123
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,160
 It's amazing how they're all so talented. It's just despite everything. French immigrants.

124
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,880
 I will say that when new arrivals, yeah, 300 years ago. Anyway, I think this Joseph was a stunning man.

125
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,440
 Oh, yeah. Mr. Sewers is great. Yeah, basically what he did, Joseph Baseljep,

126
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,680
 as he born in 1819, he is responsible more than most other people or maybe the biggest individual

127
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,480
 contribution to London turning from a medieval city into a modern one. Christopher Rad,

128
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,800
 this is the other one, I guess. Yeah, but what Baseljep was doing was so before Baseljep,

129
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,280
 the city was open-suers, cesspools and people's back gardens, you would have night-soil men

130
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,080
 turning up to take away the poo. I mean, just, and that led to cholera, cholera cholera. Like, it was

131
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,160
 just, it was cholera city. Yeah, the, the, the terms was disgusting. The terms was, basically,

132
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,520
 it's healthier now, isn't it, than it was then. Yeah. So unimaginably healthier. So basically,

133
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,840
 you put all the poo in the terms, the terms obviously flows out to see that broadly,

134
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,560
 broadly worked as a solution. It's a tidal river. But it's a tidal river. And it's so,

135
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,560
 so there would just be this mass in the water of poo that broadly is making its way out to see,

136
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,520
 but sometimes the tile would come back in. And that normally is okay, because it's normally in the water.

137
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,280
 Obviously, it stinks and obviously it's very, you cannot drink from the river. Yeah, yeah. But

138
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,000
 the main problem comes when the river level goes down a bit. And in the summer, summer of 1858 was

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,360
 unbelievably hot and dry. And the water level dropped. And there were piles of this matter on

140
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,800
 the banks of the times that were about six feet deep. Anyone who smelted at the time just wrote

141
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,360
 these accounts saying, I cannot describe the smell. Yeah, yeah. I will never forget the smell as long

142
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,000
 as I live. Yeah, right. And people were dying and dying and dying of cholera. Yeah. So he then,

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,840
 he then set in motion the building of the sewers. Yeah. Did a little thing where he sort of calculated

144
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,440
 that they should be double the size that they were planning on building, which means that we're

145
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,640
 largely using a lot of them 150 years later, right? We're still using them. But also, I mean, just

146
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,960
 sort of as a on a tourist level, if you're walking around London, you're kind of walking largely

147
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,520
 in Basil Jets London. Yeah. All of the embankments. So all the embankments amazing that it just wasn't,

148
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,400
 the Thames was so much wider. Yeah, but those are basically to be described as sewer caps. They are

149
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,760
 where the sewers are underneath. That was never there. So if you ever walk along the Thames,

150
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,520
 that's Basil Jets basically. It's like 50 acres of new London that you created. And that thing

151
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,000
 about him doubling the capacity, some sources say he worked out the purge of an average Londoner

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,560
 generously and then doubled it. And then some sources say he doubled it again. Because he said,

153
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,840
 look, we're only going to do this. I know Londoners. They're going to be pulling more than this. I tell

154
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,320
 you, we'll need to double this. Exactly. And he basically said, look, we cannot do this a second time.

155
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,000
 We have to do it once. Yeah. And that meant, right, that as the population rose, you had either double

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,240
 or quadruple the capacity, which meant that when high-rise buildings started being built and the

157
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,640
 purge overall purge did increase massively, like there is an alternate world in which he didn't

158
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,760
 double the capacity and in which 1960s London was overflowing the raw sewage, like swinging

159
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,720
 London would have just smelt. It would have been the worst. It would have been a nightmare. But because

160
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,040
 of his solution, it lasted until today. And now that we've just built this huge new sewer, the Thames

161
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,760
 Tideway Tunnel, which is designed to sort of solve the creaking of the system. He's buried in

162
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,120
 Wimbledon, I think. In St Mary's Church. Yes. And the Mausoleum is stunning. Sorry, most people won't know

163
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,600
 what St Mary's, like you were like, yeah, like everyone knows what St Mary's Church is. Sorry.

164
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,840
 I've lived in London for 15 years. I don't know where that is. I used to live in Wimbledon. Sorry,

165
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,120
 yeah. It's where they do, it's where they do the overflow parking for the tennis tournament.

166
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,920
 Right, right. Sorry to get you. Oh, you mean opposite the co-op. Right. Okay, you know.

167
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,920
 There's no co-op in Wimbledon James. It's near the second weight trove. But that church is, the

168
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,480
 Mausoleum is really interesting because it wasn't built for him. Did you see this? I did, yeah. It was built

169
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,760
 for a a slave owner called John Antony Rucker. Oh, no. Yeah. I who died in 1804. And then his family

170
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,600
 did not want to be in the Mausoleum with him for whatever reason. So it's just figured out he was

171
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,240
 a terrible slave owner. Yeah, mother Rucker. And then his family didn't want to be in there. So there

172
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,480
 was just almost empty, just one grave filled. So the Basil Jets bought the Mausoleum. Wow.

173
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,160
 And it, but he is still in there, Rucker. A Rucker is still in there. Yeah, so it's Rucker. And then

174
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,560
 half a dozen Basil Jets around him. Wow. Yeah, there's, there's, there's main Basil Jets. And then

175
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,040
 I think five children and Mrs. Basil Jets. And Mrs. Basil Jets. So we can fit nine, I read. So what

176
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,760
 are we up to? Seven, eight, one more space. Ed could go in that Mausoleum, couldn't he? I mean,

177
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,400
 that's warning now. But then there's also Peter, who's his other way. Yeah, it's the other famous

178
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,600
 Basil Jets. He's a television producer. Yeah, also isn't TV and made Big Brother awesome. He may,

179
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,080
 yeah, he was the creative head, I believe, of Endermall. And so he's the one who they brought in Big Brother

180
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,240
 because that was an international format. But really, the British one is what made it go global.

181
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,880
 And Dilo, no deal as well. He's got his message. Sorry, just what I'm thinking is obviously

182
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,560
 works in formatting. They've got one space in the Basil Jets Mausoleum. Wow. And all these Basil Jets

183
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,160
 who might decide. It's like reverse Dilo, no deal, because it's who goes in the box. This is Dabina.

184
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,040
 I'm going into the Big Basil Jets Mausoleum. I'm coming in. Oh my god. That's so good. Let's ask Ed if

185
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,120
 he wants to direct it. Robert Lindsay wants to host it. I think that would work. I should just say,

186
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:50,880
 Robert Lindsay is great. I call it my fubbly. And friend. Or no. And yeah.

187
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,040
 Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that this year,

188
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,760
 26 new bacteria species were discovered in a room specifically designed to not have any bacteria

189
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,520
 in them. Brilliant. So I got this story of a pop science writer. He's one of my favorite pop science

190
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,400
 writers, Dr. Robin George Andrews. He wrote it for National Geographic. And this is a story about

191
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,440
 the clean rooms that they have at NASA. So we build all of these rocket instruments that are going

192
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,760
 to Mars, all the rovers and so forth in these specific rooms, because you don't want to bring

193
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,320
 any life to Mars. I just love the way he said we. He's involved in their hopes like, wow,

194
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,200
 did we not feel great? You're talking about the podcast. Okay, me, sorry, I am heavily involved.

195
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,040
 You did it. Be proud. So basically the idea of the clean rooms is that humans can't allow any

196
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,200
 form of life on to Mars, because if we're looking for life there and we bring it there, we won't be

197
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,840
 able to tell if it was there or if it was from us. So these rooms are made very specifically

198
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,840
 to make sure that the smallest of bacteria gets killed off. And they have various different

199
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,040
 ways that they do that. They fill the room with ultraviolet lights. They have radioactive beams

200
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,960
 going through. They have prolonged periods of dry heating and they get to they get it to above

201
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,640
 water's boiling point. So it would kill anything that would be on the surface. They do basically

202
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:21,280
 everything they can to make sure nothing goes on. And they go, that's quite good. So that's the opening.

203
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:28,880
 Use another brand. You just pour them into a bucket together. Dumb. I'm going to set up a bleached

204
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:38,880
 company that kills not point not not. Oh, I don't need it. I don't need it. Yeah, so and a while ago,

205
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,960
 they found a bacteria that did survive and did possibly go into space on various missions. So it

206
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,680
 is possible that right now on Mars, there is a bacteria there that they didn't detect. So life

207
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,080
 might be on Mars right now. That'd be good. But why love was they when they saying that it's not

208
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,320
 that this bacteria are extremely good at like they're not like so small they couldn't find them.

209
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,440
 This bacteria was playing dead. That's the thing. This is what's the bacteria new to hide.

210
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,720
 When the velociraptor figures out the door like that's yes, that's what we've got, right? The bacteria

211
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:24,320
 was like guys guys. Yeah, it's basically like the ties. It goes into a hibernation that makes

212
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,520
 it seem as if it's because all of that bright red aren't they? Guys, put the camera on.

213
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,080
 Put the camera on. Go down. Go down. Behind the bush. Behind the bush. Okay, we've got we'll be in

214
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,760
 Mars in 14 years. We've just got to keep quiet. What I find really interesting is that because the rooms

215
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,400
 are clean so much, the microbes that are found there, it's almost like we are putting them through

216
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,680
 an accelerated breeding program to make sure they can withstand cleaning, drying, UV treatment and

217
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,960
 lack of food. Yeah. And you know, all the sterilization methods we're using, actually we're creating

218
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,000
 super bacteria. But what do they like swap the surfaces to see if it's there? I guess they must do

219
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,320
 right? Yes, I think and the ones they find the really weird thing is sometimes they're found only

220
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,240
 in clean rooms. So in 2013 scientists found a new microbe which had only been found in spacecraft

221
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,600
 clean rooms, one in Florida and one in French Guiana. Yeah, was that the one where they found that

222
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,560
 they were actually eating the cleaning products that they were using? Oh, you're amazing. Oh, this

223
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,360
 statue is delicious. Yeah, yum, yum. Isn't that bad that they found them in two different places? So then

224
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,960
 the pre that's pre that it's us doing this then. It's certainly a heavy implication, isn't it? Yeah,

225
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,520
 yeah, yeah. But that's why they swabs, James saying about swapping, they do swabs are in

226
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,960
 places and then they put them into solutions and test them and they're like, oh my god, yeah,

227
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,160
 this thing is still alive. That's how they've been discovering them. Yeah. Um, bacteria, oh yeah.

228
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,760
 And being discovered and so on. Yeah. They've recently found, we've spoken a bit about the

229
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,040
 largest single-celled organisms, which is kind of algae, I think, and they get really big. But in 2022,

230
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:04,000
 the world's largest bacterium was found and it's the size of an eyelash. It's 5,000 times bigger than

231
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,680
 the previous largest known bacterium. Right. You can pick it up with a pair of tweezers. It's

232
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,240
 crazy. It's called Theomargarita Magnifica. And I've bothered that from Peter Express.

233
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,920
 Disappointingly small. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very big for a bacterium. Um, tiny pizza. Tiny, yeah, yeah.

234
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,440
 Waiter, there's a hair in my pizza. Actually. Don't shut everyone.

235
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,280
 Um, apparently it's the equivalent of us meeting a human being who's as tall as Mount Everest.

236
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,280
 What? That's how big it is in comparison to not a normal bacterium. To a normal bacterium, right?

237
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,960
 Isn't that? I mean, crazy. That's funny in the clean room when you go hide and mount Everest, dude.

238
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,200
 Oh, cleaning against the walls and awkward ways. Let me give you one more story about bacteria.

239
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,600
 Oh, okay. Okay. The stats are very bad, but it does have a happy ending. Okay.

240
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,320
 So there was a woman in 1984. She was in America and she was studying, um, gonorrhea.

241
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,520
 And she was driving home from work and she picked up her son on the way who was like three years old.

242
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,440
 And then left the sun in the car while she went to the shops to buy some stuff. Oh, no.

243
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,360
 The gonorrhea was in a petri dish that contains something called chocolate agar,

244
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,000
 which is like a type of jelly that you use to grow. It's not sweet, but you grow bacteria on it,

245
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,120
 but it looks a bit like chocolate. Oh, no. Anyway, the child et pyagarr. You've got to

246
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,920
 re-alarm and test positive for gonorrhea two days later. Oh, my God. And so they took them to the

247
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:46,560
 centers of disease control and told them what had happened. And the happy ending is that the

248
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,160
 child was cured because they gave them antibiotics mixed in with ice cream. So he got some ice cream

249
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,560
 in the end of chocolate. Chocolate ice cream. What a win for this kid. Oh, good lord. Imagine being

250
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,720
 that got when they get much older and being like trying to let you know, STD chat and being like,

251
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:11,840
 was a long time ago. I just think don't make your agar jelly look like ice cream. There are

252
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,000
 a few different barriers that have been that have been gone through there on the in the like

253
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,600
 it's a real get me anymore situation. Now, anyway, I've left the gonorrhea in this thing

254
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:31,920
 label chocolate. It's very 80s parenting as well. With all the chemicals. Well, it's like the marshmallow

255
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,240
 test except marshmallow. It's really interesting. This wiggly sort of ties back a bit to the previous

256
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,640
 fact because bacteria were first discovered in the 17th century and we think maybe in the 1640s

257
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,000
 Athanasius Kircher. He wrote that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms.

258
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,680
 So that might have been him observing with a primitive microscope, like the microscopic life.

259
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,760
 But basically in 1900, so even 200 years after bacteria were discovered, the leading causes of

260
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,320
 death were influenza, tuberculosis and gastroenteritis, right? These are all microorganism based. In 2000,

261
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,800
 100 years later, the main causes of death were heart disease cancer and stroke. It's just a massive

262
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,960
 shift in what does eventually get you and our lives. Yeah, yeah, it was so bacterial before.

263
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,320
 Back in the day. Yeah, and before things like penicillin, that's what exactly.

264
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,680
 Yeah. Penicillin, I always think as one of those moments that were so lucky happened because

265
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,840
 there was a real sliding doors moment there. Because Alexander Fleming was to come back from holiday,

266
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,520
 so he was sitting inside his lab and he was going over all the petri dishes that he had left before

267
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:48,400
 going off on a holiday. So chocolate, chocolate. And out of nowhere, sort of as he's looking,

268
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,560
 a man called Merlin pops his head around the door. And there used to be colleagues together,

269
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,000
 and he was looking for a new job, I believe. And he sort of said, hey, Fleming, and had he'd said,

270
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,720
 let's go to the pub, which is why he was kind of coming in to have a chat with him and take him

271
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,120
 away from the work. He would have not have seen what he saw in the petri dish in that moment.

272
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,320
 So Merlin said, no, no, you keep looking. And that was the moment when he went, that's funny.

273
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,120
 And he saw what would become the mold, the bacteria had disappeared and that some mold had

274
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,400
 presumably killed it. And that was penicillin. And that was penicillin. How much do we believe that, Andy?

275
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,760
 Well, then the other thing he hasn't said is that Merlin handed him a sword, which he pulled

276
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,160
 out of his dome, and he became the rightful king of England. And that, I think that's a pretty

277
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,280
 big part of penicillin journey. I don't know why he left that out. Yeah. My way grandpa was called

278
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,400
 Herbert Mervin, but he told me as a child that his middle name was Merlin. That's because we

279
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,280
 were descended as well as people from Merlin. And I was about 25. Before, you know, when you say

280
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:55,680
 a fact out loud, and I was like, oh, yeah, because we're descended from Merlin. Oh, no, he lied.

281
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,160
 But so do we think that that's questionable if Merlin came in or not? Well, obviously Fleming was

282
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,120
 already a bacteriologist. And, you know, and he had made this discovery of lysosine, which was a thing

283
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,280
 which it did inhibit bacterial growth, but against a few small numbers of bacteria. So it wasn't a

284
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,000
 game changer. He found that in about 1921 or two. And then several years later, he left some

285
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,200
 Staphylococcus bacteria, a culture in the lab. And then he got back and he saw they'd been contaminated

286
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,320
 by a fungus, which had destroyed the colonies of staff around it. So that wasn't accident,

287
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,720
 but obviously he was very well placed to discover it. There is this story that it's only because

288
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,960
 he was in a rifle club at his local medical school. He was in medical school, just doing general

289
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,400
 medicine. And the team captain really wanted to keep him in the team and said, well, you'll stay in

290
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,720
 the team if you join the research department at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in Paddington.

291
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,920
 And that's why he became a bacteriologist. He's also written up on collegiatewaterpolot.org as

292
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,360
 the most significant water polo player of all time. Yeah, out. It's because... What did he do with the

293
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,520
 others? Is it just him? He played water polo age 16 for the London Scottish regiment because he

294
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,440
 was in the army as a young man. And this is a great website collegiatewaterpolot.org which basically

295
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,560
 re-centers the universe around water polo. I love it. That's very good. And even after he discovered it,

296
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,120
 it wasn't rolled out until 15 years later. Well, because yes, so there was that thing where it didn't

297
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,640
 yield as much penicillin as they need, that particular mould. So it became a global hunt in order

298
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,120
 to try and find a different mould that produced penicillin. And I guess it's part, you know, there's a lot

299
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,560
 of legendary tales about this stuff, but the story of moldy Mary, who's the person who often gets

300
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,280
 attributed to being the person. I think I've heard that like you are. There was a lab in Illinois

301
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,040
 that was trying to find a new mould. And they sent basically a calling out to soldiers around the

302
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,240
 world who were in the field trying to find mould and send it back to this lab. She, moldy Mary,

303
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,560
 the story of her, was a lab assistant working there. And one day when she was coming into work,

304
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,360
 she passed a grocery store outside, and she was buying a melon, and she saw an interesting melon

305
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,240
 in the in the batch that had some mould on it. And she thought, "How looks like the mould we might be

306
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,520
 looking for?" I still remember the day in QI when someone came into the office. I think it was probably

307
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,080
 just in Pollard and told us about moldy Mary's melons. We were just like, "Okay, well that's 20 minutes

308
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,960
 of material." Yeah, they have their own rights itself. Well so isn't it funny? There's that other Mary,

309
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,440
 TV Mary, moldy Mary. Oh yeah, type of Mary. Type of Mary, type of Mary. I'm like, "Don't call

310
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,440
 you kid Mary, it's the thing I'm getting, if I'm getting here." One thing about the older days is

311
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,560
 a lot of people call their kids Mary. Yes. We all have relatively young kids so know how hard it is

312
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,400
 to get them to brush their teeth. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. So here's some vibri begging, crying.

313
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,000
 Just open, just let me, yeah. Oh cool. Well here's something we can say to them that

314
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,440
 might help them to do it. If you brush your teeth properly, your mouth becomes full of nice bacteria,

315
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,160
 as if you don't. It's full of evil bacteria. Great. Don't get rid of bacteria. James, come onto my

316
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,720
 house. Please engage my five-year-old son with that argument. Let's see how far. Yeah, I think you're

317
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,640
 raising your child a bit differently to have maybe carry it and I hope that's not going to do much.

318
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,040
 You're not giving shits about the good bacteria or the nice bacteria. Here's what I do. If you clean

319
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,280
 your teeth, I'm going to give you five pounds. I say if you want to brush your teeth, we put the

320
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,720
 telly on. That's the deal. No one gets telly to tell you. I brought you for the yakled to get the

321
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,600
 friendly bacteria on them. We're doing the right thing. Yeah, that's right. So the idea is that if you

322
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,120
 put a load of bacteria together in a petri dish and some are nice as some are nasty. You got a party.

323
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,680
 And the nasty ones, they love a party and they're going to kill all the nice ones, right?

324
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,800
 And that works in pretty much all situations. But if you keep cleaning somewhere, then everyone's

325
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,280
 energy is used up by the fact that they keep getting killed by the fact that they're being cleaned and

326
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,880
 it suddenly becomes no use anymore to attack the other bacteria. Because they're fighting a bigger

327
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,280
 problem. Exactly that. And so what you find is that the more that people brush their teeth,

328
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,040
 the more the bacteria that's in your mouth are the ones that don't attack the other bacteria.

329
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,280
 And there's lots of links, isn't it, to like plaque bacteria in gums and dementia? Yeah, hard to

330
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,960
 see as well. Like flossing is one of the biggest things you can do because they found this bacteria in the

331
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,000
 plaque. And then I haven't read it, I can't remember. But there's some links to then finding the

332
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,600
 the the the mold in the brain. And so the one the biggest like causes they think is in between the

333
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,240
 teeth. Oh my god. It's interdental brushing, okay? Yeah, so that's good as a floss, yeah. Oh great.

334
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,720
 Because I use them as well. In other words, that's £5 while spent them. That's what we're saying,

335
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,720
 yeah, yeah, yeah. Mine is like cleaning my own teeth again. I start to when I moved out of home and

336
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:49,920
 that money dried up. Okay, it's time for fact number three. And that is James. Okay, my fact this

337
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:56,400
 week is that Byron's Don Jewen, which Gerta called a work of boundless genius, was inspired by a

338
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:05,840
 pantomime. Wow, two wells, one for the fact, the other for Don Jewen. I say Don Juan. Well, if you

339
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,160
 read the poem, you would get very confused by some of the rhymes. Really? Does it fail? They're in

340
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,760
 lies of tale. Yeah, so Don Juan is a story, isn't it? As sort of classic Spanish. He's a

341
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,240
 noble wothario. He's a dirty boy. Yeah, Don Juan. And the devil drags him to hell at the end. Sorry,

342
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:31,520
 spoiler. Don Juan. Yes, sorry. Oh, right. There's Johnny Depp film, which Byron Adams did the song for,

343
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,520
 good. Have you ever really loved a woman? We've all got, I was going to say Moliad, but yeah.

344
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:43,360
 Have you ever really, really, really ever loved a woman? Oh, I love that song. I've held back

345
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,800
 until now, but the number of copyright breaches you've made this show, but they're going to be a

346
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,480
 nightmare to edit around. Sorry, sorry, we have stews review it. That was beautiful singing career.

347
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,280
 Thank you so much. I call him Donnie Johnny. Oh, that's what Byron called. Yeah, I really like that.

348
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,040
 In letters, it was found that he was referring to him as Donnie Johnny. Now, this is not a Byron

349
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,960
 story, is it? This is a story that goes further than. Yeah, it goes all the way back, but Byron did

350
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,880
 his own version, which was actually quite different than Don Juan. But in his version, he said he was

351
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:19,680
 inspired by a boldly rise version of Shadwell's Liberty. And Shadwell's Liberty was a pantomime.

352
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,080
 In those days, pantomime wasn't, he's behind you and stuff. There was also some different things.

353
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,280
 They could be Marionettes. They could be, they're basically very popular plays that happened

354
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,280
 in, in the west end of London. And this one was made by Charles Anthony Del Pini at the Royal Theatre

355
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,080
 Byron Sora, and thought I'm going to write something that slags off all my mates, but with this theme.

356
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,480
 So what? Don Juan is basically. Do we know if it was, did you say, do we know if it was Panto or a

357
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,280
 puppet show or a... Well, I've really tried to find out. It was definitely a pant, this was a

358
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,920
 pantomime, but some pantomimes did have Marionettes in, and I think this one did, and I think it was

359
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,800
 also based a little bit on Punch and Judy, because I was very popular at time as well. Right.

360
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:05,280
 It sounds like the poem itself, which has seemed to be Lord Byron's sort of masterpiece, really,

361
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,240
 and which he published many years, because they were written in cantoes, right. So they sort of were

362
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,920
 released. Yeah, you do a book at a time, and then it was about six years he was, they were coming in.

363
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,040
 It's like M-thrums. Yeah, exactly, right. Yeah. And like Game of Thrones, the final book was never

364
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,120
 written, I believe. Yeah. I mean, we've still got a chance with George R.R. Martin, but...

365
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,960
 I was the last seven were missing. He said it was meant to be 24, cantoes,

366
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,320
 many books and four, and there are sort of 60's. Is anyone around here read it?

367
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,520
 I've read the whole thing. Have you? Oh, because I studied English. I thought it was a little

368
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,000
 prop for you all. Oh, yeah. My university edition of Lord Byron, and it's very...

369
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,320
 We did Byron, but it's Sussex. You didn't ever read the text. You just had to talk about the

370
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,080
 historical context of what was after that. Look, it's so... So it's that it's about...

371
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,480
 It's nearly 500 pages of this book, and it's eight line verses. It's really...

372
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,040
 Yeah, I remember looking at it and finding it not quite hard to read. But the thing is, I think it's

373
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:06,160
 the most readable epic poem. And give us a random, yeah, verse. You gentlemen,

374
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,400
 by dint of long seclusion, from better company, have kept your own. At Keswick and through still

375
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:20,240
 continued fusion of one another's minds, at last, have grown. To deem, as a most logical conclusion,

376
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,960
 that Poise has reached for you alone, there is a narrowness in such a notion, which makes me wish

377
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:36,480
 you change your lakes for ocean. Absolutely devastating slam. So he spends... Come on, it's like when

378
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,400
 it's a ten-year-old does a little rhyming pose. Was Keswick? So he's at about Wordsworth that.

379
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,400
 It's about the Lake Poets. Is it? It's worth Conorage, who were his big rivals, Sothe,

380
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,040
 who was the poet laureate at the time, who was very stoji. He spends a lot of this epic poem about,

381
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,080
 supposedly, about Don Jew and slagging off Wordsworth et al. And you mentioned Keswick, home of the

382
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,120
 now, well-famous pencil museum. Right. But I would say Byron is probably the only one of those who's

383
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,880
 readily readable, pretty much anyone can pick up Wordsworth. It's worth it. It's so readable.

384
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,880
 It's much more readable. I think Don Jew and it's so funny. It's so clear and it's so entertaining.

385
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,840
 It's a brilliant story. It's all about this young nobleman and it's the scrapes he gets into and

386
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,640
 it starts with him accidentally getting into an adulterous situation with a married lady when

387
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,080
 his young man. And then canto two is all his massive shipwreck story, which is so exciting.

388
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,840
 Unlike Don Juan, he's not a lethario. He keeps finding himself with older women and stuff like that.

389
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,480
 You're on it. Basically Byron is Byron slightly excusing his own lethario-ish behaviour by saying,

390
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,840
 "Look, it's not like that you're on it. It just happened." I just fell into this room.

391
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,040
 But the second book of it is all about this big shipwreck which Don Jew and gets caught up in.

392
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,720
 And this is really cool because Byron's grandfather, again very aristocratic family, he was Lord Byron.

393
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,520
 His grandfather was a young man called John Byron, maybe 50 years earlier. So it's John Byron.

394
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:12,160
 And he was in a shipwreck himself. There's this amazing book called The Wager, which is all about this

395
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,600
 English shipwreck got sunk in 1732. I've just finished it and one of the main sources of how it all

396
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,560
 went down and there was cannibalism, there was mutiny, there was murder. One of the main sources is John

397
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,600
 Byron, who later became an admiral and got nicknamed Fowler the Jack because everywhere he went,

398
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,840
 the worst storms in the world happened to him. But if you're on the ship with Lord Byron's grandfather,

399
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,920
 yeah, you're going to have terrible weather. That was his reputation. So then Fowler the Jack

400
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:42,160
 son was Mad Jack Byron, who was Byron's dad. And then Byron didn't seem to carry on the nicknames.

401
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:49,440
 Everyone was called Jack or Mary. But basically Byron took a lot of the shipwreck stuff from his

402
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,000
 grandfather's own book about the shipwreck. Like there's a bit where they eat Don Jewen's dog and it's

403
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,800
 a really sad story. And that had happened to his own grandfather. Well, that did seem to be the

404
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,760
 thing about Byron was that his poetry, as you're saying, that's laced with autobiography in it. And

405
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,920
 the Lathario stuff, which is what he was known for it in his real world, people were sort of reading

406
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,760
 it almost almost in the way that as as we're talking, a new Lillie Allen album has been released,

407
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:21,280
 yeah, which just lays out the life that she's recently experienced with her now ex-husband. It's just

408
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,360
 like it's all the stories. It's like a gossip, right? We send that Lillie Allen is the modern day,

409
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,080
 Lord Byron. You know what? Fuck yeah, we are. Because that is a piece of genius. That album,

410
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,280
 the writing on that is so beautiful. The lyrics are unbelievable. Also, I'll take her as modern day by

411
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,920
 her dad was very famous. Yeah, Mad Jack. Mad Key, Alan. How do you think you'd object to that title,

412
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,240
 either? This is the most, how do you do fellow kids where you describe it, Lord Byron. Sorry,

413
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,280
 and her brother was in Game of Thrones. So, and they slept together, haven't they? Lillie Allen

414
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,720
 and her brother. No, no, brother. That was Alfie Allen and Gemma Wheelan, so not actually Lillie Allen.

415
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,240
 Sorry, yeah, yeah. Gemma playing her sister. I know. I really like the Lord Byron as Lillie Allen

416
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,960
 theory. Oh, yeah. Because he did have to flee England. Lillie Allen has never had to flee England.

417
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,280
 She's been living in New York. She fled New York. She brought a big brownstone because

418
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,720
 he told her to buy it and encourage her to get it more good. These are the lyrics to the

419
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,120
 first song. Okay, it's great. We continue in Kerry's copyright corner here. It's fine.

420
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,000
 Does she have a club foot? Do we know? She has a club. She, yeah, yeah. She swam the

421
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,880
 hellish bumps in the straight between Europe and Asia. She died into the canal in Venice,

422
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,800
 famously. Huge fan of Greek independence. But Byron sort of, he had to flee England after his

423
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,240
 marriage fell apart and he was accused of unnatural vices and having appallingly mistreated his wife.

424
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,840
 You know, there was this thing about his half-sister. Did they have an affair? But also, he was the only

425
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,680
 poet. He properly walked the walk and he went to Greece and funded the Greek Navy for a while

426
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,200
 because Greece was trying to win his independence from the Turks. That's track five on the

427
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:07,920
 Will the Greeks try and keep Lillie Allen's lungs after she dies because she used her breath to speak

428
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,400
 out for Greek independence. Byron died in Missalongi, which is Greek town promoting Greek independence.

429
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,200
 And he'd been there for years, backing the Greek. He was this huge fan of the Greeks and he wrote

430
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,680
 some very rude stuff about Lord Elgin and that, you know, like knicking Greek treasures. And the

431
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,160
 Greeks kept his lungs, the source of his new map, the breath of the soul and his larynx and they were

432
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,200
 sort of put in an earning Greece until and they've disappeared. The give back those marbles we might

433
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:45,040
 get the lungs back coming as a first one. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. That is Andy.

434
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,000
 My fact is, for several years in the 1920s, a beach in South Wales was the fastest place on the

435
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,280
 planet. How can a beach be faster? Well, good point. I'm not surprised as someone with South

436
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,240
 Wales in heritage. Oh, yeah. Your Welsh carrier. I'm half Welsh. Yes, I've never fully understood

437
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,920
 the extent to which Welsh, but well, my dad is Welsh. Oh, there we go. So I was born there and I

438
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,320
 am called Calean Lloyd. I thought that I know. That was my clue. So have you ever been to the

439
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,560
 Pentine Sands in Carmarthenshire? Oh, Carmarthenshire, yeah, I have actually, yeah. So is this stunningly

440
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,800
 beautiful beach? Make the whole of the beaches of South Wales are the most beautiful beaches in the

441
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,520
 world. Sorry, Dan. I don't know if you're going to interject there with beaches that you may be from,

442
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,160
 but the gower peninsula, all of that bit are stunning. Absolutely. I wasn't trying to raise up

443
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,160
 although the Pentine Sands, if I were to blow any of the other beaches of South Wales, all of which

444
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:44,080
 are 10 out of 10 or Australia or Australia. Sydney ones are terrible actually. I'm sure they're fine.

445
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,240
 Yeah, you know, but oh, the gower. Oh my god. Oh, absolutely. Tell us more.

446
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,080
 Well, there's this beach called the Pentine Sands and the interesting thing about it is it's

447
00:38:54,080 --> 00:39:00,000
 very long and the sand is nice and compact and hard and it was traditionally used for foot races,

448
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,520
 you know, horseback races, bike races. They started having motorbike races there in the early

449
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,120
 20s and they realized that hang on in the 20s, people were starting to get serious about breaking

450
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,240
 land speed records in a car. And the early records have been broken out of a track called Brooklyn,

451
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,680
 which is circular or avoid. And what you really need to break a land speed record is a very,

452
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,520
 very long straight track because you need a couple of miles to get up to top speed. You need a mile

453
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,200
 at top speed and then you need another mile to slow down. Turning those carnages on is going to

454
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:37,040
 slow you down. Exactly. And so they realized this beach is perfect to drive on because it's seven

455
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,520
 miles of sand and you can drive on it. I wonder on it a few weeks ago. Yeah. And it's absolutely,

456
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,760
 it's amazing. Of course it is. It's stunning. Yeah, yeah. But I thought that it's now property of

457
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,600
 the MOD. It is. You can't walk on it during the week. I was there on a weekday and there are

458
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,000
 loud dystopian announcements saying, do not walk on the beach. Right. You can go at the end by

459
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,920
 the cafe in the museum, which is where I went. What do they do on there? They test weapons.

460
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,400
 You know what the MOD are like? They're testing weapons. They're not having cups of tea.

461
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,960
 That was the most beautiful place in the country we can bond.

462
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,840
 Unbelievable. So it's, but there is this bit, which you can't go on, which is open to the public.

463
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,000
 And they've just opened a new museum there about the land speed records. And it's amazing. And

464
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,080
 they've got a brilliant display of other different kinds of sand and the diameter of the grains,

465
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,480
 which I found very interesting. How are your family? Wait a few to week. All those tiny

466
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,800
 bits of information next to the pictures. Were they because you reminded me so much of my father

467
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,960
 one hundred a day. He's still reading it. He's still reading the information flags. But we

468
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:48,320
 spent two hours. I don't touch the petri dishes. That's exactly why I went to the website for

469
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:55,600
 the museum. And it said, if you rush, you can probably complete it in two hours. So I imagine Andy's

470
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,600
 family were. No, I did a new land speed record in the museum because people were getting a bit

471
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:09,520
 impatient. People were getting a tad impatient. But this is where Malcolm Campbell, who's the site,

472
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,360
 the sort of head of this amazing speed-breaking family. I'm sure we'll talk about them. He broke

473
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:19,840
 the record at 146 miles an hour. His friend and rival, JG Perry Thomas, broke it in his car,

474
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:27,120
 Babs. Babs is the name Babs. Oh sorry, Perry Thomas was Welsh and he was, he tragically was killed

475
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,800
 there during the land's been record attempt. Instantly killed. And the action later moved to places like

476
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,000
 the Daytona Salt Flats. As a result of that crash, I think. I really do. Basically, he was trying to

477
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,280
 get over 200 miles an hour really. He was trying to get there and thereabouts. And they realised that

478
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,840
 when he died in that crash, probably this isn't the best place to go that fast. Right.

479
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,200
 He needed somewhere even flatter. And then they went to the salt flats, didn't they?

480
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,680
 Yes. And he got buried and so did Babs. His car was buried as well. Babs was buried in the exact

481
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,440
 spot where the crash happened. So they literally dug a hole, put it down there. And it was buried

482
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,720
 there for about 42 years. And then someone petitioned to excavate it, to put it back together.

483
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,520
 And it now very occasionally sits in the museum, Andy. I have seen it. Wow. You saw Babs?

484
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,560
 Yeah. It's been lovingly restored. Wow. It's so, it's such a great museum.

485
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,640
 Yeah. But also, did you read about the heritage of Babs? It must have been there in the museum.

486
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,600
 Okay. So Babs went by a different name before. So that was a new name given to Babs because it was

487
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:32,800
 a new owner. It was originally called Chitty 4 because it was owned by a man called Count Zbrowski,

488
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,680
 who was the inspiration for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. What? This was one of the cars that was the

489
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,840
 inspiration for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I'm sorry. Let's see the PRS moment. Bang Bang Chitty Chitty.

490
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,240
 Oh my god. Oh my god. We love you. Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Okay.

491
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,560
 There was Chitty 1, Chitty 2, Chitty 3, and then Chitty 4. Chitty 1, Chitty 2, Chitty 2, Chitty 3.

492
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,080
 Chitty 1 became the ownership of Arthur Conan Doyle's sons. They took ownership of that,

493
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,280
 and the other two went to other people, and number 4 raised it. Yeah. So that's what you saw.

494
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,760
 You know who has the current British land speed record? Bob Goudof. I'm going to...

495
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,600
 Actually, I think I'm right now. Is it Freddy Fudd's half? No. It's not. Oh, is it someone from

496
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:17,200
 Top Gear? Is it... It's not Idris Elba. It's Idris Elba. Is it? I'm sorry. Bob Goudof is far off from

497
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:25,120
 Idris Elba. They're both national treasures. Exactly. Exactly. He broke it in 2015. He did 180

498
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,760
 miles an hour for what they call the flying mile in a, in a some kind of Bentley. I mean, he did it

499
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,720
 on the pen by chance. Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's the UK land speed record. Like the current

500
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,280
 world land speed record is 760 something miles an hour. It's very, very fast. Okay.

501
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,200
 But yeah, Amy Johnson, when she flew from South Wales to New York directly, she took off from...

502
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,000
 The pen, nine sounds. The pen, nine sounds. Wow. I know. He's a big glamorous spot. It's used to be

503
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,320
 glamorous and it lasted a very, very brief time. So he talked about Malcolm Campbell. Oh, yeah.

504
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,600
 And then let's talk about some of the other family members. So his son was Donald Campbell,

505
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,040
 who was the only man to hold both the land and water speed records at the same time. Wow.

506
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,000
 And he was one of who famously died on Coniston in a water accident. Lake District.

507
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,160
 Coniston water. Yeah. Actually climbed the old man at Coniston. Yeah.

508
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,800
 At the same trip I went to the Kessik Pantson Museum. Did you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,320
 And Donald has a daughter called Gina. Yeah. And she has broken the women's world water speed record.

510
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,960
 The Campbell's just have this huge... We've done dynasties today. It is dynasties.

511
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,400
 Don Wales. Malcolm's grandson has broken the record for the fastest lawnmower on the pen, nine sounds.

512
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,360
 Okay. Who's, who did that? He's a guy called, he's called Don Wales and he's Malcolm Campbell's grandson.

513
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:45,040
 He loves Wales so much. He was like, just call me Don Wales. Don Wales. Don Dune and Don Wales.

514
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,280
 I think that's like, that is very British isn't it? It's like, our land speed record is so

515
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,640
 shit compared to the rest of the world. We're going to have to go lawnmowers. We're going to go

516
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,680
 novelty. You do. It's 87 miles an hour. It's just pretty good for a lawnmower. Just a sit-on lawnmower.

517
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,440
 Well, you do have to take part in a public grass cutting demonstration before the race.

518
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,440
 So it has to be a pro, you have to be a proper lawnmower. But that's got to have a different engine,

519
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,120
 right? It's made from lawnmower parts. No, I get that. I think it's not different.

520
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,960
 Yeah. Yeah, it's my massive rocket strength. The bit where the grass normally collects is now a

521
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,480
 fuel tank. Yeah, that's right. Okay. You can't be just getting up to 87 miles an hour on a normal,

522
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,000
 oh, people will be dying. Sorry. Imagine if that was assessing what's the top speed. Let's try that.

523
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,920
 Be awful. And fastest shed also broken on the pen, nine sounds. Okay. Well, the pen, nine sounds are

524
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,760
 doing their best to keep these records coming, aren't they? Do you think it's faster or slower than

525
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,240
 the fastest lawnmower? I think slower. Slow, because it's so bulky. Okay. Well, I guess I'll go faster.

526
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,160
 Downs correct. 100 miles an hour is the faster shed record. It's pretty good. Was it on a lawnmower?

527
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,240
 Did they build it around the lawnmower? I don't know, but there's no shed demonstration,

528
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,480
 like you don't have to get a side out of it. Was the lawnmower guy trying to put the lawnmower

529
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:12,880
 back into the shed when he went that fast? Very good. Pen, nine sounds is, I know it's full of making

530
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,720
 the best of their last class. If you're nearby, the museum is wicked. Landspeed records are in a

531
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,160
 bit of a funk at the moment, I'd say. So the last time the land speed record was broken was 1997.

532
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,960
 Oh, I guess as the world is being slowly destroyed, it feels a bit, it's ingenuous to just go really fast.

533
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,160
 They have tried to find a synthetic fuel for the bloodhound project, which is this massive rocket

534
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,640
 they're trying to fire across the ground. They were going to try and do a thousand miles an hour

535
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,200
 with a slightly more eco-friendly version of it, but they just keep running out of money and

536
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,200
 it's sort of parked for the moment. I mean, literally it is parked. But it's the era of breaking

537
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,680
 records like Guinness World Record, you know what I mean? I feel like we grew up with that being a

538
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,360
 big thing that that was how fast can you go? And now maybe we're like, you know, we've stopped to think,

539
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,720
 should we do this? How many followers you have? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just should, is it worth this?

540
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,800
 Yeah. We should all slow down. Yeah. There was a, there was a bicycle record, really interesting one

541
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,800
 that was set there. Good, an eco record. Thank you, Dan. Thank you. This was in 2013. This was Guy

542
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,200
 Martin. You know Guy Martin? Yeah, he's a motorbike guy and he's, he's run a bunch of best-selling books

543
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,960
 and TV shows and so on. And he set a record for a bicycle slipstream record. Okay. Isn't that

544
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,240
 amazing? So he was, he was going behind another vehicle and then he used the slipstream and that's when

545
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,640
 they started recording the time. If it's faster or slower than, let's say the shed. Give me the shed

546
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,800
 again. Shed was a hundred miles an hour. Okay, cycling. Well, what do you think then? In a

547
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,200
 slipstream. Can't be a hundred miles. Even in a slipstream. On a bicycle as well. On a bicycle.

548
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,840
 He got a bit slower than a shed. Not an e-bike. Was it a line bike? Because they can go really fast.

549
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:01,120
 Yeah, a bit unnerving. I'll say slower than, but only just slower than the shed.

550
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,040
 Yeah. I think this might be a minor Nana's book that I can't remember what it was.

551
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,800
 Oh, right. I think it was like a hundred and twenty odd miles an hour, but 112.9 miles an hour.

552
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,520
 Fasten the shed. Yeah. So it goes lawnmower shed. Guy Martin in a slipstream.

553
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,400
 Yeah. But you do have electric car speed records, don't you? I think we're talking about.

554
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,640
 Yeah. I think I think I'm mental. Are they fast? I've got one from 1899. It was the first electric

555
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:35,920
 car to go over a hundred kilometers an hour. It was called Le Jamé Contente, meaning never satisfied.

556
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,920
 Oh, I really thought it was saying to him, sorry. I was like, oh, that happened. Happy

557
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,360
 time. Yeah. I've seen the photo of that. It's insane. It was absolutely bananas there.

558
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,960
 Apparently it was it was pretty tough to ride and the muscles of his body and neck became

559
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,560
 completely rigid as he drove it, because it was just all over the place.

560
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,400
 Oh, right. So obviously they didn't have any stability or anything like that in those days.

561
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,960
 They have just launched the fastest e-scooter on the planet. Yeah. And you please mind out on the

562
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,560
 pavements because they are driving these things like crazy people. Well, this one goes at a hundred

563
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,760
 miles an hour. Watch out. Why do you need that? Watch out. Pick a dilly circus. Watch out.

564
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,320
 It's not a good idea. It's a really bad idea. That feels like that's my daughter going to nursery

565
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,520
 in the morning. Yeah. When I'm trying to catch up with her. Those microscuters are fast.

566
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:29,280
 It's called the Turbo. It's made of aerospace grade aluminium and it has a range of 150 miles.

567
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,160
 And I bet you some fucker was still not where I held me and be on the road with that.

568
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,160
 Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned being overtaken in the far you're driving in the fast lane.

569
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,160
 Someone behind you is on an e-scooter right up your back bumper. I've learned to. I've seen people

570
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:48,320
 on e-scooters like going so fast on the road. It's terrifying. This is the future. You'll be soon

571
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:54,720
 saying, honey, I think we were just overtaken by a shed. So some Welsh records. Great.

572
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,400
 The number of people skinny dipping in a single venue is beaten this year and the Gallup Peninsula.

573
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,400
 Oh, of course. What a lovely place to skinny dip wonderful. Do you want to guess how many?

574
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,720
 130. Close? No, not close. Oh, I'm going to say a thousand. I'm going to say four things.

575
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,400
 Oh, closer than that. 295. 413. Wow.

576
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,080
 Yeah. And did you turn into an orgy afterwards? No, it didn't. It was very respectable.

577
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:29,600
 They did at 9 a.m. to stop any rubber neckas from turning up. They can still get up early.

578
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:40,000
 But no one in our clock is morning work. Are you ready? They're prying. Oh, it's 830. I simply cannot be

579
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,480
 learing at someone before 9 a.m. I haven't had my guppuccino. And recently the longest ever tug of

580
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,880
 war game took place on a Welsh beach. Now, when you say longest, yeah, are we talking

581
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,480
 longest? No, it is stretched out. It's the longest rope. So it doesn't have to be the most people.

582
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,320
 It's just the longest rope. Here's the question. Was it longer or shorter than the longest suspension

583
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:12,800
 bridge in Portugal? No, no. No. No, because I know this one. I know this one. Can I just say as well?

584
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,240
 It's part of Club Fish. We're launching a quarterly quiz. And I can tell you, you're listening now.

585
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,680
 This is the kind of gold you're going to get. You're going to love this.

586
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,760
 You're going to think about it logically. There's no way logic can apply here. Why have I found

587
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,480
 this suspension bridge? Because it's very short. Because Portugal doesn't have any suspension

588
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:40,080
 bridges. Oh, because I know the length of the rope. Yeah. And I'm searching for other things.

589
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:47,280
 So they're the same. They're the same. And it was the largest suspension bridge in the world

590
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,600
 until quite recently. And then it got overtaken by one in Southeast Asia. Wow.

591
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,000
 So the rope was that long? How long do you have length? 20 meters.

592
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,120
 There's 1,694 feet. Is that two very strong people to believe in that?

593
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:08,240
 As in, could you hold that rope in the air? Two teams of 50. Oh, okay. That's a lot. But they're

594
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,480
 well. So they're going to be strong. They're going to be strong. That's just a fact. There's

595
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,800
 nothing they can do about that. That's actually strong. I always struggle to remember whether you're

596
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:28,720
 halfway or 150%. Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.
