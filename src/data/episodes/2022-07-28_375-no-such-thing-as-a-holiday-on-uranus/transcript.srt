1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,000
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,880
 and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,240
 this week coming to you live

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,000
 from the O2 Forum in Kentish Town.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,160
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,680
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,560
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,720
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,440
 And in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,320
 - My fact this week is that one of the main villains

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,400
 in China's equivalent of WWE is Steve,

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,600
 the English as a second language teacher.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
 (audience laughing)

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,680
 - That is terrifying.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,600
 - It's a frightening concept for a lot of Chinese people

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,520
 trying to learn English.

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,320
 I think it's quite a small outfit compared to WWE,

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,880
 which you may remember as WWF,

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
 but of course it's not allowed to be called that anymore

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,080
 'cause the Wildlife Fund got that name.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,920
 - Yes, absolutely.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,740
 - And that was it, wasn't it?

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,200
 - It was a big fight with Hulk Hogan and the panda.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,000
 (audience laughing)

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,080
 - Bizarrely the panda won that one.

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,720
 So this is Middle Kingdom Wrestling, MKE,

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,800
 which is the very nascent Chinese pro wrestling organization

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,480
 that was started in 2015.

34
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,120
 And yeah, it's got some imaginative evil dudes.

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,160
 So Steve, the English as a second language teacher,

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,600
 he brings exam textbooks into the ring.

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,080
 - Oh, that's so cool.

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,200
 - Does he like hit them with it?

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
 Us, he must be right.

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
 - I think he does a bit, yes he does.

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,040
 - Does he?

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,880
 - I thought he did.

43
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,720
 - He probably does.

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,200
 I was imagining he just opened it up in front of them

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
 and said, "Answer these questions."

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,000
 (audience laughing)

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,840
 - I don't know.

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,520
 - I read the article that you sent round about this, Anna,

49
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,360
 I read something, it was in sixth tone, I think,

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
 was the website.

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
 - Yes, yeah.

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
 - And it said, "Burger, burger,"

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,160
 repeats the English language instructor,

54
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,840
 showing a picture of a hamburger to his opponent.

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,440
 (audience laughing)

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,520
 And then the commentator says,

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,000
 "Cowardly attack here by Steve, the ESL teacher,

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,960
 "letting issues from his personal life

59
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,200
 "creep into the business life again."

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,520
 (audience laughing)

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
 - Yeah, his wife cheated on him with a hamburger.

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
 (audience laughing)

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520
 Very awkward.

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,200
 - But they do, I mean, it is like WWE,

65
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,720
 used to be WWF, you know, amazing characters.

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
 They've got the bamboo crusher,

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,440
 who's a guy who comes out with sort of,

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,080
 it's basically, he's meant to be a panda

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,560
 and he's just got two black marks around his eyes, yeah.

70
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,160
 - There's another character who is the curry kid

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,160
 and he wears a devil mask, quite scary.

72
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,800
 And then on his head, there's a,

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,080
 I thought it was a weird looking hat.

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,120
 And I zoomed right in and it's a paper plate

75
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,560
 with rice on top.

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,600
 (audience laughing)

77
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,680
 I don't know if it's real rice

78
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
 and it's like finishing school,

79
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
 you have to balance it on your head

80
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
 the whole way through.

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,640
 - Wow.

82
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,480
 - But that was him.

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,320
 - That's amazing.

84
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,200
 - There's Queen Marie, who just wears a crown.

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,600
 She's the only lady.

86
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,520
 And there's Buffer Daboonbox.

87
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,520
 No, sorry, Buffer and Daboonbox,

88
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,240
 who carries a boombox.

89
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
 - Wow.

90
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,920
 - It's a great cast character.

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,120
 - He's Buffer.

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,360
 - He's Buffer.

93
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,200
 - And Daboonbox.

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
 - And Daboonbox, it's his sidekick, yeah.

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
 - You said there was only one female wrestler there,

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,840
 does that mean she fights against the men or?

97
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,200
 - I think they fight other wrestling outfits.

98
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 So there's another outfit called

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,320
 the OWE Oriental Wrestling Entertainment

100
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,160
 and I think they've interacted.

101
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,200
 But I'm not sure what Queen Marie does.

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
 - Interesting, 'cause do you know that TV show,

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,240
 Glow, that used to be on?

104
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
 - Yeah.

105
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,960
 - Brilliant TV show.

106
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,720
 The gorgeous ladies of wrestling, it's called,

107
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,800
 and it's about women's wrestling,

108
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 but it was based on real life wrestling.

109
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,760
 And they brought in all these women

110
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,480
 who are mostly dancers and stuff like this.

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,520
 And there was only one woman who had any wrestling experience.

112
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,360
 She was called Dee Booher and she played Matilda the Hun.

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,240
 But when she was doing her wrestling,

114
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,760
 she wasn't allowed to fight against the men.

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,840
 And there were no other women who could fight against her,

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
 so they needed to find someone to fight her.

117
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,320
 And they found a female bear.

118
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
 - Okay.

119
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,000
 (audience laughs)

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,080
 - Who she fought.

121
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,200
 - It's Hulk who converted the panda all over again, so.

122
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,920
 - And so she wasn't allowed to fight men.

123
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,200
 They had to find a female.

124
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,680
 They found a female bear.

125
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,520
 - Okay, so surely fighting a female bear

126
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
 is harder than fighting a man.

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,000
 (audience laughs)

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,720
 - Have you not seen that thing on Twitter

129
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
 that's been doing the rounds

130
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,760
 that most men think they can beat up a bear?

131
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,720
 - Yes, right.

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
 - Oh, I'm so glad that we've got onto this.

133
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,920
 I didn't think we would.

134
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
 But it was really interesting,

135
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,240
 because the question specified,

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,080
 this was a YouGov poll,

137
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,960
 which was, you know, what percent of men and women

138
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
 think they could beat which animals?

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,800
 And it was within the last week, wasn't it?

140
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,680
 And it was something like 38% of men

141
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,520
 think they could beat a chimpanzee, unarmed.

142
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,640
 Chimpanzees are strong.

143
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,680
 - It was like 7% of men thought they could beat a lion.

144
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,080
 - Yeah, and it was something like 8% of men.

145
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,880
 And women were the same number, weirdly.

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
 Both men and women, about 7% or 8%

147
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,320
 think they could beat an elephant in a fight, if unarmed.

148
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,160
 - Wow.

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,080
 I mean, what do you do?

150
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,920
 How do you fight?

151
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
 - Yeah.

152
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,600
 - What, you grab the trunk, obviously.

153
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,080
 - You grab the trunk, and then.

154
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
 - But then what?

155
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
 I mean, it submits, I guess.

156
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,840
 I mean, they're very sensitive.

157
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,680
 Yeah.

158
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,720
 - This thing of the sort of the villain wrestlers,

159
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,600
 the heels, you know, they're the sort of,

160
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,720
 and this thing of, which I don't really understand

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
 'cause I'm not a wrestling fan,

162
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,760
 where you have to stay in character.

163
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,800
 No one really acknowledges the.

164
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,920
 - Yeah, it's a.

165
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,880
 - Yeah, it's a whole thing.

166
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,160
 You don't acknowledge the kind of fictional elements

167
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,520
 of the universe and, you know, all of this.

168
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,240
 But this was such a big thing that wrestlers

169
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,320
 in the 70s and 80s weren't allowed to travel

170
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,440
 to matches together if they were on opposite sides

171
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
 in the fictional universe of wrestling.

172
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,040
 - Oh, really? So like if two of them saw each other

173
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,320
 on a plane, they'd have to get in a big fight?

174
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,400
 - Yeah, exactly, basically, yeah.

175
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,280
 And so there were two wrestlers called Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

176
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
 - Oh, yeah.

177
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,200
 - Ba-ba-beats people up.

178
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,040
 - Okay, so.

179
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,880
 - Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

180
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,400
 - I should just say, we very much have done

181
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,600

182
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,760
 - That's not even his theme tune.

183
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,160
 That was like a random WWF music album

184
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,520
 that was released in 1995.

185
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,360
 It's great.

186
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
 Brent the Hitman Heart has a love song on it,

187
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,800
 "Much a man, Randy Savage."

188
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,640
 Keep going, sorry.

189
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,480
 - Thank you.

190
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,240
 - So he, CF, downs early a bit.

191
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,840
 Hacksaw Jim Duggan and an evil character

192
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
 called the Iron Shake.

193
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,960
 - Ah!

194
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,800
 (laughing)

195
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,960
 - Classic.

196
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,800
 - Huge.

197
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,360
 - Oh, I think I know what you're about to say.

198
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
 He was at a conference.

199
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,600
 The Iron Shake met up with the ultimate warrior

200
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,160
 and he wanted to say hi.

201
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,120
 And the ultimate warrior didn't want to say hi back.

202
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,240
 And so the Iron Shake slapped the man

203
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,440
 who said he would say hi.

204
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,280
 It's very dramatic.

205
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,120
 It's on YouTube.

206
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,480
 - That's not what I was gonna say.

207
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
 (laughing)

208
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,640
 - Anyway, this fact has received such a kicking from Dad.

209
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
 But basically.

210
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
 - I'm just giving background context.

211
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
 - Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

212
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
 - Mama beats people up.

213
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,880
 - Thank you.

214
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,720
 (laughing)

215
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,240
 And the Iron Shake were arrested

216
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,000
 while traveling in the same car in 1987.

217
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,440
 - Wait, because they were traveling in the same car?

218
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,520
 - Admittedly, they weren't arrested

219
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,600
 because of the fictional universe of wrestling being breached.

220
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,760
 They were arrested for possession of cocaine and marijuana.

221
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,600
 But still.

222
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,520
 (laughing)

223
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,840
 - But I bet the police were bloody cross

224
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,000
 about the fictional world being breached as well, weren't they?

225
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
 - You guys shouldn't even be in the same room together.

226
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,080
 (laughing)

227
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,000
 - Well, there was a guy, another famous pro wrestler

228
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,560
 in Britain in the 60s, 70s.

229
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,640
 Actually, I think wrestled up to the late 80s, 90s

230
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,840
 called Kendo Nagasaki, who actually,

231
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,360
 there are two Kendo Nagasaki's.

232
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,680
 One is a Japanese guy, which sounds about right,

233
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,960
 who is called Kazuo Sakurada.

234
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,760
 But the famous one in Britain

235
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,840
 is just this bloke called Peter Thornley.

236
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,720
 (laughing)

237
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,880
 Now, Wikipedia describes Peter Thornley

238
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,960
 as someone who remains a household name in his home country.

239
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,320
 'Cause anyone heard of Peter Thornley?

240
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,160
 - No.

241
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,560
 - Right, so it's not, none of the households here tonight.

242
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,000
 But, yeah, so he was super committed to the role

243
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
 and he wore a mask and his character was,

244
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,680
 he had these powers of hypnosis

245
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,280
 and he was very dark and brooding

246
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,560
 and had a very troubled past.

247
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,400
 And he's taking vengeance on everyone, et cetera, et cetera,

248
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,560
 lots of bullshit.

249
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,760
 And he never spoke, so he had to have with him

250
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,280
 a verbalizer at all times.

251
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,920
 He was called Gorgeous George Gillette.

252
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
 - Oh, yeah.

253
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,160
 - But so basically this guy was like sooty,

254
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,480
 Kendo Nagasaki, and Gorgeous George had to lean over

255
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,160
 and say, "What's that Kendo Nagasaki?"

256
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
 (laughing)

257
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
 You're gonna beat the shit out of this guy.

258
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,280
 Well, I'll tell them, but I don't think they're gonna like it.

259
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,960
 - He was very intimidating.

260
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,760
 - What do you think of that, Bison Girl?

261
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,360
 (laughing)

262
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,600
 - So his life was essentially ruined in the late 70s

263
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 because he was sort of living with Gorgeous George

264
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,680
 at the time, it seems.

265
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,160
 And his identity was fully hardcore secret.

266
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
 No one knew he was.

267
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,240
 And then their toilet broke

268
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,800
 and they had to call a plumber in.

269
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
 And the plumber saw Gorgeous George answer the door,

270
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
 put two and two together and was like,

271
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,200
 "I bet that guy who's sitting there on the sofa

272
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,640
 is Kendo Nagasaki."

273
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,400
 'Cause he's hanging out with Gorgeous George.

274
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,760
 And so he then printed loads of leaflets saying,

275
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,720
 "This is the real identity of Kendo Nagasaki

276
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,400
 and this is the address he lives at."

277
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,120
 He used to hand them out at all the gigs they did.

278
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
 - Really?

279
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,280
 - And whenever he'd put adverts in the newspaper,

280
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,800
 so there'd be a big ad that Kendo Nagasaki's having

281
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,840
 a big fight here, then just below it would appear,

282
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,800
 posted by this plumber, a thing saying,

283
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,560
 "The above wrestler, Kendo Nagasaki, is Peter Thornley

284
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,200
 and he lives at this address."

285
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,760
 - Right.

286
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,960
 - And everyone in the UK is going,

287
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,000
 "We know who Peter Thornley is."

288
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
 (laughing)

289
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,800
 - But that is the reality

290
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,520
 when you've got these amazing characters

291
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,360
 and then the real life.

292
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,560
 You know, Yokozuna, one of the greatest characters in WWF,

293
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,760
 he was a Japanese sumo wrestler.

294
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,320
 He wasn't, he was from Hawaii

295
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,920
 and his name was Rodney in real life.

296
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,960
 You know, Hulk Hogan, his name's Terry, you know?

297
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,920
 - Is it Terry Hogan?

298
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,680
 - No, it's called Belayah, something like that.

299
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,520
 Belayah.

300
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,680
 - I should have learned that you would know.

301
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,760
 - Yeah, Terry Belayah.

302
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,240
 - Okay, here's a quiz question for you Dan,

303
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,400
 as soon as you're such an expert.

304
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
 - Okay.

305
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,320
 - In which country do you think was the highest attended

306
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,560
 wrestling performance in history?

307
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,240
 - Ooh, I'm gonna say Philippines.

308
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
 - Matthew, no.

309
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
 Keep going.

310
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
 - I'm gonna say America.

311
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,840
 - You've got 193 countries in the world.

312
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,160
 - I'm gonna say South Sudan.

313
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,520
 Andy, this is my game, sorry.

314
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,400
 - It's pretty much one of the last places you would think of.

315
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,000
 It's North Korea.

316
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
 - What?

317
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
 - Okay.

318
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,680
 And in 1995, there was a load of wrestlers from America,

319
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,720
 from WWF, went over to North Korea with Muhammad Ali,

320
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,520
 by the way, to do a big sort of wrestling show.

321
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,760
 One of them was Ric Flair, who I'm sure you will know.

322
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,360
 - Yeah, the nature boy, Ric Flair.

323
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,960
 Always wore red when he was gonna lose.

324
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
 No one knew that at the time.

325
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,640
 - We've never done a podcast with live footnotes before.

326
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,480
 (laughing)

327
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,600
 And it's unbelievably annoying.

328
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,840
 (laughing)

329
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,480
 - And he fought against this guy called Antonio Inoki,

330
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,520
 who was a Japanese wrestler.

331
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,560
 And he kind of had some connections in North Korea,

332
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,400
 so he could do it.

333
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,320
 But there were about 100,000 people

334
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,080
 who watched this wrestling match.

335
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,920
 - Wow.

336
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
 - All North Koreans, and so didn't cheer.

337
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,400
 They just sat in silence and watched this match happen.

338
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,080
 And then Ric Flair at the end,

339
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,120
 they tried to force him into doing a statement saying,

340
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,280
 oh, I can see why North Korea is so great,

341
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,440
 and why America is so afraid of North Korea,

342
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
 and stuff like that.

343
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,320
 But he refused to do that.

344
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,720
 But Inoki, who is the Japanese guy,

345
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,360
 he was also a politician.

346
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,320
 And he once successfully negotiated with Saddam Hussein

347
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,280
 for the release of Japanese hostages, this wrestler.

348
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
 - Wow.

349
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,100
 - Isn't that amazing?

350
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,200
 And he's so revered in the Japanese wrestling world

351
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,680
 that if you're a Japanese wrestler,

352
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,520
 you might request to be slapped in the face by him.

353
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,000
 (laughing)

354
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,120
 And that might give you some of his courage.

355
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,520
 That's the idea.

356
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,640
 - I didn't know that slapping in the face

357
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,600
 is apparently a big wrestling move.

358
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,440
 I'm learning tonight.

359
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
 - Yeah.

360
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,960
 - You're not supposed to do it with an open palm.

361
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,800
 Is that right, Dan?

362
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,560
 - You, well, you don't do it with a fist.

363
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
 You have to do it with open palm.

364
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,240
 - You don't do it with a fist.

365
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
 It's an open palm so that you don't make,

366
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,560
 it's a more, let's see that noise.

367
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,800
 - Yeah, thank you, yeah.

368
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,760
 - You don't get that with the palm.

369
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,540
 So it's more for the dramatics of it.

370
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,160
 And it's obviously safer.

371
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
 And you don't pull hair.

372
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,400
 But also, there was a tag team called the Bushwhackers,

373
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,040
 and they used to lick people's heads.

374
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,880
 They were from New Zealand.

375
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,220
 And I met them as a kid in public home.

376
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,440
 - Sorry, sorry, sorry.

377
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,800
 The New Zealand was your headline.

378
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,140
 But I think what you said just before,

379
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,520
 it was more interesting.

380
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,680
 - Oh, so they, yeah.

381
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,840
 So their whole thing was they would lick people's heads.

382
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,400
 - Was this pre-COVID or?

383
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,240
 - Yes.

384
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,080
 (laughing)

385
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,460
 - Very safe at the time.

386
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,640
 - It's not a winning move.

387
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
 - I don't understand how that would come to take you.

388
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,120
 - Did the two of them lick the head

389
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,680
 at the, the enemy's head at the same time?

390
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,080
 Like a sort of finishing move?

391
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,360
 - No, no, it wasn't a finishing move.

392
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,520
 No, it was just a mid-match cheeky lick on the head.

393
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,360
 - Come on, Annie.

394
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,200
 That's foreplay.

395
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,560
 - That's it, that's coming first.

396
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,920
 - It would be before matches.

397
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,360
 It would be if they were being interviewed

398
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,040
 by the WWF, you know, ring announcers and so on.

399
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
 - Why would they, why would they,

400
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
 what they would lick the heads of the people into,

401
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
 is this mid-match or is this an interview?

402
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,280
 Just you'd lick the interviewer's head.

403
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,120
 - They'd lick the interviewer's head.

404
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,720
 Occasionally they'd be a mid-match lick.

405
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,440
 If it called for it.

406
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
 My point is, is when I met them,

407
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
 I asked them to lick my head and they did.

408
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,960
 And because--

409
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,040
 - They licked your head?

410
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,880
 - Yeah, both of them.

411
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,720
 I've got photos.

412
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,520
 I've got like a tongue, like really burrowing

413
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,640
 right next to the--

414
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,240
 - What, they had tongues that could burrow into your head?

415
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,080
 - Big-ass tongues.

416
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,200
 Probably why they started licking heads professionally.

417
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
 (laughing)

418
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 - That's amazing.

419
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,840
 - Yeah.

420
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,200
 - Well, can I tell you my favorite fact I learned

421
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
 about wrestlers, which will be of interest

422
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,080
 to a very small proportion of people,

423
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,760
 but I'm gonna do it anyway.

424
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,600
 - Probably done.

425
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,480
 (laughing)

426
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,920
 - She may be not, right?

427
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,960
 You know David Arquette, the actor who--

428
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,280
 - In Scream and--

429
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,760
 - In, well, and what?

430
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,440
 It's very, very little else.

431
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,280
 - Courtney Cox?

432
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,520
 (laughing)

433
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,360
 - So, as Dan has specified, David Arquette,

434
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,560
 the actor famous for Scream and Courtney Cox.

435
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,960
 He, one of the reasons his career sort of disappeared

436
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,600
 is that he got really obsessed with wrestling.

437
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
 So he played this character called Gordie Boggs

438
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,240
 in a film, a 2000 film about pro wrestling.

439
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,560
 - Gordie Boggs?

440
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,040
 - That Gordie Boggs.

441
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,880
 - Oh, sorry.

442
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,720
 It just sounded like Gordie Boggs,

443
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,800
 which sounds like Courtney Cox.

444
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,680
 And I just wondered if--

445
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,800
 (laughing)

446
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,360
 - That was before or after he met Courtney Cox.

447
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,640
 - Well, this is after, but this is what's interesting.

448
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,520
 They were together, they were married at this point.

449
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,600
 He played this character, he got obsessed with pro wrestling.

450
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
 He was actually crowned the champion of pro wrestling,

451
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,440
 which was extremely controversial in the wrestling world

452
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
 'cause they were like, "He can't even wrestle."

453
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,200
 But he got so into it that it became really embarrassing.

454
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,240
 And Courtney Cox, as I said in interviews,

455
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,120
 it was a lot to handle to be with David

456
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,680
 and to see David at this point.

457
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,520
 'Cause he suddenly got all consumed by that.

458
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,440
 He was going to wrestling matches and being loud

459
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,200
 and screaming, and it was kind of insane.

460
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
 I remember feeling embarrassed.

461
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,960
 Now, what is effing weird about that,

462
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,160
 is that is a plot in Friends three years

463
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,120
 before it happened in real life, right?

464
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,960
 Who remembers that plot?

465
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,640
 - Wait, her boyfriend, Tom Selleck,

466
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,360
 wants to be the ultimate fighting champion?

467
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,600
 - It's not Tom Selleck, thank you for that, my God.

468
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,000
 - It is Tom Selleck, isn't it?

469
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
 - No, it's not Tom Selleck.

470
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,760
 No, he is also Monica's lover in Friends, but--

471
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,160
 - John Favreau?

472
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,840
 - Yes, it's that guy, yeah.

473
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,680
 - Wow.

474
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,520
 - Anyway, how weird is that?

475
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,360
 Three years before it happened,

476
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,560
 this happened to Monica in Friends

477
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,880
 and then happened to Courtney Cox in real life.

478
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,720
 - Yeah, that is weird.

479
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,280
 - What a roller coaster.

480
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,520
 But now, David Arquette, in 2018,

481
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
 decided to take up pro wrestling

482
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,240
 'cause he wants to redeem his name

483
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,360
 in the wrestling communities.

484
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,640
 - Wow, how is that a roller coaster

485
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,320
 if the same thing is happening?

486
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,920
 (laughing)

487
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,840
 A roller coaster, you want different things to happen.

488
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,680
 - It's a shit roller coaster.

489
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,800
 - What a monorail.

490
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,040
 (laughing)

491
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,840
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

492
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,000
 and that is Andy.

493
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,560
 My fact is that expert bell makers

494
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,520
 can tell where a bell was made

495
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,640
 just from listening to the bong.

496
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,000
 (laughing)

497
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,120
 - Yeah, I mean, pretty cool.

498
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,040
 - Is that a useful skill, would you say?

499
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,880
 - Uh...

500
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,760
 - I mean, how often are you in a party?

501
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,680
 (laughing)

502
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,400
 And someone's got a massive church bells, I guess, right?

503
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,240
 - You church bells, yeah.

504
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
 - Yeah, and someone's like,

505
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,680
 hey, Andy, come over here and tell us where this is from.

506
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,440
 - It's a party, it's more of a party trick

507
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,240
 unless you're a professional founder,

508
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,040
 which is that you're right, you're absolutely right.

509
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,200
 - How do you verify it in the moment?

510
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,920
 How do you, if you said that's from, you know,

511
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,120
 this small foundry in-- - Not, yeah, yeah.

512
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,840
 I don't know how you verify it.

513
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
 I guess the person asking you

514
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,360
 where was this bell made knows, and you don't.

515
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,720
 - So they're being forced into the game,

516
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,560
 they're not just bringing it up.

517
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,880
 - So you're telling someone something

518
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,200
 they already know in effect, aren't you?

519
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,040
 - No, well, no, you're saying,

520
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,120
 come and listen to my bell if you're a vicar, say.

521
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,600
 You get the founder into your church, they listen to the bell,

522
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,640
 they say, oh, that was made at the White Chapel Bell Foundry,

523
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
 or whatever.

524
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,040
 - By the way, if a vicar ever says to you,

525
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
 come and listen to my bell, do not go with him.

526
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
 (audience laughing)

527
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 - Oh, my God.

528
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,220
 Oh, dear.

529
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,960
 - I mean, there aren't that many places,

530
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,280
 and I don't mean to belittle this,

531
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
 but there are not that many places

532
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
 a bell could have been made in this day and age, are there?

533
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,320
 - That's right.

534
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,080
 - Yeah, but we have a lot of old bells.

535
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,920
 - There are a lot of old bells.

536
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,560
 - There are a lot of bells, but this is the problem.

537
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,880
 Okay, this is exactly the problem

538
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,080
 with being a bell founder in this day and age,

539
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,280
 so this is from, I should say, it's from this brilliant article,

540
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,680
 it was a Guardian article long read by Hetty O'Brien,

541
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,640
 and it's about a place called the White Chapel Bell Foundry.

542
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,760
 Foundry is just a bell factory,

543
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
 and it went out of business a few years ago,

544
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,880
 and it had been in business since 1570.

545
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,880
 Queen Elizabeth I was on the throne when this place started up,

546
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,480
 and it was one of the last foundries in the country

547
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,520
 before it shut down, and the problem is

548
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
 that bells last forever.

549
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,440
 - Yeah.

550
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,280
 - Because...

551
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,640
 - It's not like an iPhone, is it?

552
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,040
 - No, that's why Steve Jobs didn't go into bell.

553
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,160
 He didn't come out and say, "We know you like the iPhones,

554
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,080
 "but here's our new thing, it's a 400 tonne bell."

555
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,400
 Yeah, it's a real problem.

556
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
 So they made the White Chapel Bell Foundry,

557
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,640
 made two bells for Westminster Abbey in 1583,

558
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,000
 which are fine, they're still working.

559
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,960
 They don't need upgrading, they don't need changing,

560
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,880
 they just...

561
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,560
 Yeah, so bell companies have a nightmare

562
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,960
 if we're not on a period of active church building.

563
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,840
 - Except, though, except when disaster strikes.

564
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,400
 So if, say, like World War II happened,

565
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,640
 that's fantastic for the bell industry,

566
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,960
 because so many churches are being destroyed,

567
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,600
 that suddenly they're back in business.

568
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
 - I heard that they were behind the whole thing,

569
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,000
 actually, the bell makers.

570
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,760
 - It was a big bell, wasn't it?

571
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,920
 - Big bell, yeah.

572
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,920
 - But that's the moment when they suddenly have popularity

573
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
 in business because...

574
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,040
 - That was the only time they made a profit

575
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,880
 in the 20th century.

576
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,960
 The entire 20th century, the only time they made a profit

577
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,120
 was the years after the Second World War.

578
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,600
 - And then, most recently, it was only because of Downton Abbey

579
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,920
 being so popular with their little ding-a-ding-a-ding.

580
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,760
 That suddenly they were back in business.

581
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,800
 - Those are not a glamour product for them to be selling.

582
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,320
 - So they're in trouble, aren't they?

583
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
 There's only one left, I think.

584
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,080
 - A Tailors of Loughborough.

585
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,880
 - That's correct, yes.

586
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,600
 - So, wait a minute, this is even worse.

587
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
 When Addy's at his party and you say, "Where's this bell from?"

588
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,160
 There's only one to choose from.

589
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,200
 Only if it's a new bell, you know, as in...

590
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,160
 - I don't know how many founders can do all 400

591
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,920
 which closed down over the last two centuries.

592
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,760
 Probably not.

593
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,520
 - Imagine there used to be 400 bell factories.

594
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,360
 - That's a lot, yeah.

595
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,480
 - So many.

596
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,080
 - I think, weirdly, Andy, if you hosted a TV quiz show

597
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,280
 which was merely identifying bongs of bells,

598
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,680
 I think I would watch it.

599
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,280
 I think it would actually be really great.

600
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,200
 - How many episodes would you actually watch?

601
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,040
 - I'm definitely watching the trailer.

602
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,840
 - I could imagine Andy being at a party

603
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,880
 and someone brings out a bong and Andy goes,

604
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,320
 "Oh, speaking of bongs."

605
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,560
 (laughing)

606
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,600
 - It took me a while to get that joke

607
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,720
 because I was so into bell law that you said bong

608
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
 and I thought, "Yes, brings out a bong of a bell."

609
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,400
 Someone does a bong.

610
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,320
 - I was devastated with an article about Tailors of Loughborough,

611
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,400
 now the only remaining bell foundry

612
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,040
 because during the government shutdown,

613
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,000
 during the whole COVID shutdown,

614
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
 then it was difficult for all industries,

615
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,640
 including the last remaining bell foundry.

616
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,800
 And the headline in the art newspaper

617
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,080
 was "Shutdown Test Metal of UK's Last Major Bell Foundry."

618
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,840
 And they didn't even spell metal like metal.

619
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,280
 They just spelled the M-E-T-L-E, like absolute chumps.

620
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,160
 (laughing)

621
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,320
 Come on the art newspaper,

622
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
 that's why you're not at household name.

623
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,440
 - Not like Peter Thornley.

624
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,160
 - I'm Peter Thornley.

625
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,440
 But they've just got this lottery funding.

626
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,760
 Why are we subsidising these non-profit making institutions?

627
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,880
 They just got 3.45 million pounds.

628
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,840
 - You're not gonna subsidise the profit-making companies, are you?

629
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,080
 - Why do you say subsidise PricewaterhouseCoopers?

630
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,920
 (laughing)

631
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,760
 I'd be happy about paying tax.

632
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,200
 - No, it is sad.

633
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,760
 It's a sad thing that this industry

634
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,560
 is no longer as big as it was.

635
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,680
 - Well, this Whitechapel place

636
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,520
 is completely shut down now as well.

637
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,600
 The Whitechapel bell foundry,

638
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,000
 which, as you say, has been going since the 1500s.

639
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,680
 And that's just happened because it looks like a hotel

640
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,080
 is gonna be moved in, in its place,

641
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
 a sort of hipster kind of hotel.

642
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,080
 And I agree, I think that is really sad.

643
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,640
 It's a huge part.

644
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,960
 Big Ben is from there.

645
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,800
 The Liberty Bell is from there.

646
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,560
 It's got huge history.

647
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,960
 - Both of those bells have famously got massive cracks

648
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,800
 in them, haven't they?

649
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,200
 - Yeah, they're not very good at what they do.

650
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,320
 (laughing)

651
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,640
 - It's amazingly lasted this long.

652
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,680
 - It's a 400-year con making shit bells.

653
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,000
 (laughing)

654
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,120
 So the Big Ben Bell, it was made in 1858,

655
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,160
 and it took, so once you pour the,

656
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,480
 it's molten tin and bronze, I think,

657
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,320
 it goes into a bell.

658
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,360
 Once you pour that into the cast,

659
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,960
 it takes, obviously, a day or two to cool down.

660
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
 This bell was so big, it took 20 days to cool down.

661
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
 It was still warm from the casting after that.

662
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,160
 And then it was taken to Parliament on a trolley

663
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,360
 pulled by 16 horses.

664
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
 It's incredibly ceremonial.

665
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,760
 It took 18 hours to get it from the base

666
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,640
 to the top of the tower.

667
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,600
 - Were they carrying it upstairs?

668
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
 Like, pivots, pivots?

669
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
 (laughing)

670
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,960
 - I thought horses couldn't go upstairs as well.

671
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
 - They can't go upstairs, they can't go downstairs.

672
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,120
 - They're still there.

673
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,680
 (laughing)

674
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,480
 - Who do you think's been dogging all the time on the bell?

675
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,740
 (laughing)

676
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,080
 - They did pull it up by hand.

677
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,920
 - Amazing.

678
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
 - Unbelievable.

679
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,580
 - Wow.

680
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,420
 - There's always absolutely tons,

681
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,840
 and it was just eight men who got it from the bottom to the top.

682
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,240
 - But they not have made it up there,

683
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,960
 rather than making it in a different place

684
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,040
 and then bringing it there.

685
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,400
 - If only you'd been around to advise on the project.

686
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,600
 - It wasn't just them carrying it,

687
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
 'cause obviously it literally weighs tons.

688
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,720
 They had a crank and they had built,

689
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,440
 and they had constructed an 1800 foot chain to attach it to,

690
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,960
 and then they had a timber cradle carrying the bell,

691
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,920
 and then they just had to turn this huge windlass,

692
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,560
 you know, around and around and around.

693
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,040
 I've gone into excess detail.

694
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,880
 - Yeah.

695
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
 - All right.

696
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,120
 - Have you ever looking for a crank in future?

697
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,040
 (laughing)

698
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,600
 When they bombed Big Ben during World War II,

699
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,240
 it was a problem, wasn't it?

700
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,600
 So, at first, the BBC News would be broadcast,

701
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,280
 and we broadcast, the Allies broadcast BBC News in Germany,

702
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
 and it was sort of a propaganda thing

703
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,120
 to, you know, kind of undermine the enemy,

704
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,880
 and on the hour before the news,

705
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,440
 they'd always do the Big Ben bongs live,

706
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,560
 and then they realized it was giving away

707
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,680
 what the weather was like,

708
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,360
 because the Germans who were listening

709
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,080
 were able to detect what the weather was like

710
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,720
 in London based on the sound of the bongs,

711
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
 because depending on the humidity of the air

712
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,440
 and depending on the temperature,

713
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
 the bongs make a slightly different noise,

714
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,040
 so I think moist air will absorb kind of higher frequencies.

715
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,000
 - That's exactly what the bell makers want, don't they?

716
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,560
 They want all the bells to be blown up,

717
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,640
 and they can make more.

718
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,000
 - Can your bong people tell that, Andy, the weather?

719
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,320
 - My bong people.

720
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,400
 (laughing)

721
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,560
 I don't know, I don't know.

722
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,920
 - It wasn't, they changed it, though,

723
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,840
 because they were figuring it out,

724
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,280
 so then they would play,

725
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,000
 the BBC started playing recorded bongs,

726
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,340
 so they wouldn't give away the weather.

727
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,360
 - So they'd trick the Nazis into thinking

728
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,440
 the weather was perfect for a bombing raid,

729
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,500
 when actually it was rainy?

730
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,480
 - No, no, you would trick them into thinking

731
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,520
 it's not perfect for a bombing raid.

732
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,800
 You wouldn't be like, oh, it's a glorious day,

733
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,280
 you can see where you're going.

734
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
 What a beautiful day for a bombing raid.

735
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,240
 (laughing)

736
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,640
 - The prime minister's in.

737
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,320
 - Jesus Christ, Andy.

738
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,240
 - This is why you were fired

739
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,760
 from Churchill's War Cabinet.

740
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,020
 (laughing)

741
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,160
 - Okay.

742
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,960
 - Bells used to be really important to people in Britain.

743
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,840
 They would, lots of different things.

744
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,940
 If you were living in a village or a town,

745
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,720
 really there wasn't much noise,

746
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,440
 there wasn't loads of traffic noise or anything like that,

747
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,240
 so really the bell was the loudest noise

748
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,500
 that you could hear from miles and miles around,

749
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,000
 and it would mean lots of different things.

750
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,840
 It was like a kind of language of the bells,

751
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,520
 so if it did certain bell rings,

752
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,880
 it would say you had to go into church,

753
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,480
 or it might say there's a fire and you need to run away,

754
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,040
 or it might be that there's been a death in the parish,

755
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,480
 or there was loads of different things,

756
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,440
 and it was basically, you would hear the bell

757
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,160
 and you would know what was happening in your town.

758
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,120
 - That's very cool.

759
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,440
 - Hey.

760
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,720
 - Is it gonna be a bombing raid?

761
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,080
 Do you do an unfortunate misunderstanding?

762
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,000
 (laughing)

763
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,240
 - But then during the Reformation,

764
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,960
 obviously bells associated maybe with Catholicism,

765
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,000
 and so they kind of banned the bell.

766
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,840
 - Wow.

767
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
 - And Edward VI made a law that said

768
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,440
 only one bell was allowed in each church.

769
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,120
 Okay, you allowed one bell.

770
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,280
 But a lot of the villagers,

771
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,000
 like they had such affection for their bells

772
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,280
 that they would bury them,

773
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,160
 hoping that the law would change in the future,

774
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,840
 and they'd be able to dig their bells back up

775
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,680
 and then put them up.

776
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,260
 - That's so cool.

777
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,360
 - And Edward VI, of course,

778
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
 is where we get the word bell end, isn't it?

779
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,280
 (laughing)

780
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,800
 - 'Cause he ended bells, yeah.

781
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,680
 - And they would throw him pissed off.

782
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,520
 - Very nice.

783
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,640
 - That's a great, so maybe some of them are still out there,

784
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,040
 you know, still in the ground.

785
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,880
 - That's just garbage.

786
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,720
 - Imagine that.

787
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
 If you were a metal detectorist,

788
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,280
 that would be the most exciting find of you.

789
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,120
 - It's the fucking jackpot.

790
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,080
 (laughing)

791
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,120
 - We're gonna have to move on in this life.

792
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,520
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

793
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,600
 - Really unprecedented move.

794
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,040
 We're gonna have to go back to the last act

795
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,440
 and do a more wrestling act stuff.

796
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,520
 - Can I tell you one more thing?

797
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,360
 - Yeah.

798
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,480
 - This is just a, I was looking up Guinness Records,

799
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,760
 and this is not about church bells.

800
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,120
 This is about the hotel bells, you know, the little ding,

801
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,920
 you know, when you get to the, yeah, those.

802
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,080
 Do you know what the record is

803
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,320
 for the most desk call bells rung with the chin

804
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,760
 inside one minute?

805
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,680
 - Okay, so I reckon I could do probably about 40.

806
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,720
 - Okay.

807
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,560
 - No, at least one a second.

808
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
 So 75. - Way more than a second.

809
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,120
 - That's the same bell you're doing there, Dan.

810
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,060
 - Yeah, you're doing, you can't ding the same bell.

811
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,680
 You have to have other bells, yeah.

812
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,520
 - Right.

813
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
 - They're all different bells, yeah.

814
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,720
 - So the concierge desk needs to be really long.

815
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,560
 You need a--

816
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,400
 - Exactly, yeah.

817
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,960
 So it's a guy called Cherry Yoshitake of Japan.

818
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,720
 He's known as Mr. Cherry as well.

819
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,200
 And he, this year, he broke this record.

820
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,720
 He dinged 149 bells with his chin in one minute.

821
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,560
 - Wow.

822
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,400
 - Unbelievable.

823
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,240
 - Wow.

824
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,600
 - It's almost like he had nothing better to do in 2020.

825
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,040
 (laughing)

826
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,080
 - I love that his nickname isn't even related

827
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,520
 to this insane thing that he,

828
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,160
 what else is he doing with cherries

829
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,720
 that is far more interesting?

830
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
 That's his nickname.

831
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,080
 - Can I quickly tell you about a suffragette bell ringer?

832
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,920
 - Oh yeah.

833
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,880
 - This was a lady called Mary Maloney.

834
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,600
 And when Winston Churchill was trying

835
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,720
 to regain his seat in parliament in Dundee in 1908,

836
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,200
 she wasn't very happy because he'd said some remarks

837
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,600
 about the suffrage movement.

838
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,440
 And so whenever he went to any kind of speech,

839
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,160
 she just stood right next to him and just rang a bell.

840
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,760
 (laughing)

841
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,320
 And then she'd stop and say, Mr. Churchill,

842
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,080
 do you want to apologize for the things she said

843
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,240
 about the suffrage movement?

844
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,080
 And he said, no.

845
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,120
 And she went, okay.

846
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,380
 (laughing)

847
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,800
 And she just would follow him

848
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,120
 and he'd kind of start getting flustered.

849
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,280
 And then he'd leave and go in his little carriage

850
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,640
 and she'd follow him.

851
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,880
 And then as soon as she got there,

852
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,280
 she'd start dinging again and dinging again.

853
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,560
 And there's an article in the London Evening News

854
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,400
 that said that Mr. Churchill struggled

855
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,720
 good humorously against the bell.

856
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,560
 But he said, if she thinks that this is a reasonable argument,

857
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
 she may use it.

858
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,720
 I don't care.

859
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,560
 I bid you good afternoon.

860
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,240
 And he left.

861
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,080
 But then according to the biography of Churchill

862
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,120
 by Michael Sheldon, so this is a bit biased,

863
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,760
 but he reckons that by the end of the week,

864
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,880
 everyone was so sick of this suffrage with her bell

865
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,560
 that they all kind of got on Churchill's side

866
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,200
 and he did win the election in the end.

867
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,840
 - Oh. - Really?

868
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,320
 Shot herself in the foot.

869
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,520
 - A little bit. - Foolish woman.

870
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,080
 That's suffragettes, you see?

871
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
 (laughing)

872
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,760
 Bunch of idiots.

873
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,720
 - I don't. - That wasn't the point

874
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,560
 of that story.

875
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,000
 (laughing)

876
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,280
 - Can't believe you're broadcasting

877
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,080
 this negative shit about the suffragettes.

878
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

879
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,160
 and that is James.

880
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,520
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in the 1930s,

881
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,240
 Canada's bowling alleys had to close

882
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,240
 on nine occasions due to strikes.

883
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,480
 (laughing)

884
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,560
 - Very good, very strong.

885
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,720
 - So this is a little bit of inside a lingo

886
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,640
 at what happens at QI.

887
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,560
 We call this a remote controlled fish.

888
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,360
 I'm not sure why we call it that,

889
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,800
 but basically you come up with the funny idea

890
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,480
 of a fact first and then you try and prove it's true.

891
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,880
 So I thought, wouldn't it be funny

892
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,360
 if there'd never been a strike in a bowling alley?

893
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,000
 And then I found this paper called

894
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Strikes, Bogies, Spares and Misses,

895
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,920
 Pinboy and Caddy Strikes in the 1930s by Ian McMillan

896
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,360
 that talks about all these amazing strikes in Canada.

897
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,600
 - I think it's more impressive

898
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,280
 that you found the strikes you were looking for

899
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,480
 'cause this was hard to research.

900
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,080
 If you just searched bowling alley strike,

901
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,240
 you don't get the industrial election

902
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,440
 side of things very early.

903
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,720
 So why were they striking?

904
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,840
 - So basically these were pinboys in bowling alleys.

905
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
 So these days if you got 10 pin bowling,

906
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,440
 there's a machine that picks up the pins

907
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,960
 and puts them back where they should be.

908
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,400
 When the olden days it would be adolescent workers,

909
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,080
 young lads who would do this job,

910
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,400
 they would sit on a little shelf behind the bowling alley

911
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,160
 and then once you've rolled they jump down

912
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,120
 and then they'd shift away the ones that you knocked down

913
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,080
 and put the other ones where they should be.

914
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,040
 And there was this one particular moment in Saskatchewan

915
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,240
 where they forced the pinboys to shovel snow

916
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,280
 outside the bowling alley but wouldn't pay them.

917
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,560
 And when they said they wouldn't do it,

918
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,600
 they fired them and they went,

919
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,800
 "No, we're gonna go on strike."

920
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,960
 And they were helped a bit by the Communist Party in Canada

921
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,960
 and they just continually for about a decade

922
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,680
 just kept going on strike.

923
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
 - Really? - Yeah.

924
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,080
 - I'm impressed because I thought that pinboys were,

925
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,560
 you say adolescent, but they were young, weren't they?

926
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,440
 And a lot of them, I think often who got pushed out

927
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,600
 with the photos for the promo shots were young,

928
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,800
 but they were pretty pubescent.

929
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,640
 And the idea of sort of a nine-year-old boy

930
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,560
 striking through the streets is very strange.

931
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,600
 - Yeah, that's true.

932
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,040
 - But yeah, they were put out of business,

933
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
 all of them eventually by the awesome machines

934
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,960
 you get in bowling alleys now, weren't they?

935
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,280
 - Let's see who's side you're on.

936
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,120
 - The pins.

937
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,240
 - Side of mechanization against the humble working child.

938
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,880
 - These nine-year-old luddites

939
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,400
 are gonna need to catch up with technology.

940
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,200
 - Can I ask you a question about the pinboys?

941
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,360
 Would they, so they would go down after the first bowl

942
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,720
 and the pins that were knocked down,

943
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,560
 they're moving out of the way.

944
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,600
 But obviously it's very important

945
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,920
 that the formation remains the same as the other ones,

946
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,320
 but they were popping them back into to be reset, weren't they?

947
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,360
 So they would have to make sure

948
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,200
 that they were placing them in the exact right spots, right?

949
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,000
 - So when you bowl once and then they get rid

950
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,680
 of the ones on the floor and then you get a chance

951
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,920
 to knock the rest of them down, they stay where they are.

952
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,240
 But then the next person would come

953
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,680
 and they'd have to put them right in the exact place.

954
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,800
 But if you tips them really well,

955
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,960
 they might put them in a slightly better position for you.

956
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,120
 So they kind of move the front pin a little bit closer

957
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,800
 and move the side ones in a little bit.

958
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000
 And the people who they didn't like,

959
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,080
 they would move them out so that they couldn't get them straight.

960
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,360
 And then one of the trick they would do

961
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,560
 is as well as putting the pins up,

962
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,160
 they would have to roll the bowls back to the bowler.

963
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,880
 And what they would often do if they were really skillful,

964
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,360
 if there was someone they didn't like,

965
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,080
 they put backspin on the bowl.

966
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,200
 So it went up towards them.

967
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,760
 And just before he's about to get it,

968
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,000
 he would spin that towards them.

969
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,360
 - That's amazing. - That's so good.

970
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,280
 I wrote one thing that they did, one of their duties,

971
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,000
 which was if... So they put the things in a setting machine.

972
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,760
 So the setting machine does put the pins out,

973
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,680
 but they are placing them there.

974
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,000
 But if sometimes they didn't work these setting machines,

975
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,760
 and if a pin came out wobbly,

976
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,640
 a pin boy would have to wriggle out onto the lane on his stomach

977
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,360
 and position it properly

978
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,120
 and just hope that they had seen at the other end

979
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,000
 that there was a wonky pin that was being fixed.

980
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,960
 And so you might get a ball chucked at you

981
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
 if they didn't see that.

982
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,600
 If your reactions aren't fast enough,

983
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,440
 at pubescent or pre-pubescent age,

984
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,400
 to avoid a bowling ball been chucked by some millionaire.

985
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,520
 And we have ascertained which side of the argument you are on.

986
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,600
 I'm going to say, me slagging off the suffragettes,

987
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,400
 he's looking a lot better, isn't he?

988
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,560
 The guy who invented the pin setting machine,

989
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,360
 which put all these boys out of business,

990
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
 was he did it in 1936.

991
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,400
 And the first pin setting machine

992
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,840
 was made of lampshades and flower pots.

993
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,840
 - Oh, wow. - And in a turkey house on his mate's farm,

994
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,160
 there's a guy called Gottfried Schmidt.

995
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,880
 And he'd heard about what hassle it was having these pin setters,

996
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,800
 because it takes a long time having a little boy

997
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,760
 kind of rearrange all your pins.

998
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,280
 So, yeah, he cobbled some lampshades and flower pots together.

999
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,920
 If you're laughing at that, then that's the problem with you.

1000
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,360
 I was like, "There must be a euphemism in there somewhere."

1001
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,800
 People desperately looking, laughed prematurely.

1002
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,360
 I thought, "I don't think there is, actually."

1003
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,240
 Hey, did you guys know this is just a quick modern bowling thing

1004
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,360
 that I didn't realise?

1005
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,520
 I enjoy bowling, and I do love getting the shoes,

1006
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,840
 putting the shoes on. It's always a fun element of it.

1007
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
 - Sure. - I didn't realise,

1008
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,400
 and I wonder how many people here did...

1009
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,240
 I do love it, James, don't laugh at it.

1010
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,720
 I mean, I've been bowling with you.

1011
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,600
 I can see that that would be your best bet.

1012
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,240
 My 30th birthday.

1013
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,000
 My 30th birthday, I had a bowling party.

1014
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,040
 James came and murdered me.

1015
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,000
 Murdered me in front of all my closest friends and family,

1016
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 who had not met him at this point.

1017
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,040
 So, they didn't know what a twat I was.

1018
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,640
 I didn't know you had a bowling party for your birthday.

1019
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,800
 I remember you working, putting the pins up.

1020
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,720
 - Quick, he's on his belly. Get him. - Quick, he's on his belly. Get him.

1021
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,720
 Thank you for that tip, James. It was extremely nicely...

1022
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,360
 - Well, bowling shoes... - Do you realise this?

1023
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,240
 - When you're out with your friends... - When I'm out with my best buds, sure.

1024
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,520
 They come as either left-handed bowling shoes or right-handed bowling shoes.

1025
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,160
 - What? - Yes.

1026
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,560
 - How does that work? - Well...

1027
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,160
 Wait, I was saying there's one left for the left foot and one for the right foot.

1028
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,720
 - Yeah, okay. - Like shoes?

1029
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,480
 - 'Cause... - Yeah!

1030
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,600
 - Oh, boy. - No, what it is...

1031
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,440
 If you haven't seen Don Tribe's amazing square normal shoes,

1032
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,040
 they are a sight to behold.

1033
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,320
 - What are you talking about? - That's my TV show.

1034
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,120
 - What will they think of next? - Check this out.

1035
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,720
 No, okay, so this is really interesting.

1036
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,840
 And obviously, if you go to a normal bowling alley,

1037
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,920
 they probably give you normal shoes, which probably hurts your game,

1038
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,960
 is what I'm guessing.

1039
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,480
 If you're a professional, you're right-handed or you're left-handed.

1040
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,400
 If you have a dominant leg, you have a dominant foot, that's going right.

1041
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,360
 So, one shoe of every bowling shoe has a sliding element to it,

1042
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,120
 and the other has a breaking element,

1043
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,840
 so that your back foot can break while your front is sliding.

1044
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,240
 - Wow, how interesting. - Yeah, so if you're bowling right-handed,

1045
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,400
 you need the slidey bit to be on your left foot.

1046
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,320
 And so, do you think you were maybe given some left-handed bowling shoes by accident,

1047
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,600
 and that's why you lost embarrassingly to James Arkin?

1048
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,520
 Just if my family and friends are listening, yes, I believe,

1049
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,960
 there was a conspiracy that night.

1050
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,840
 It's illegal to switch hands bowling, as well.

1051
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,120
 - Oh, shit, I think I did that. - You did it so many times!

1052
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,760
 - Switch hands. - No.

1053
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,680
 - I genuinely did. - Well, you are post-hoc disqualified.

1054
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,600
 - That is not allowed. - So sorry, bowling won't...

1055
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,080
 - Screw you, Arkin! - Oh, God!

1056
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,640
 (APPLAUSE)

1057
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
 Yes!

1058
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,000
 This is exciting, 'cause this has actually come up quite a lot over the years.

1059
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Yeah, you're not allowed to, 'cause you might be sandbagging.

1060
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,360
 Is that what you were doing? Were you sandbagging?

1061
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,200
 - I don't know what that means. - What's sandbagging?

1062
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,480
 - You were sandbagging. - I don't even want to do the rest of this podcast.

1063
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,920
 - It means cheating. - It means cheating, Andy.

1064
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,960
 Sandbagging is when, in professional tournaments,

1065
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,520
 this is why they ban in professional tournaments,

1066
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,920
 then you will try and get a better handicap by bowling with your other hand,

1067
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,560
 'cause it's quite hard to bowl badly, deliberately,

1068
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,400
 but without it being noticed with the hand that you're strongest with.

1069
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,280
 So if you bowl with your other hand, which some people often do,

1070
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,480
 then it tricks people into giving you a better handicap.

1071
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
 - It's like being a hustler. - I see.

1072
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
 - I wasn't doing that, but... - Wow.

1073
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,840
 You look like a sandbagger to me, Jim.

1074
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,560
 And that was a euphemism.

1075
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,680
 I've got a fact about the first bowling alley opened in the UK.

1076
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,400
 OK, so the first bowling alley in the classic American style that we think of

1077
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,280
 opened in Stamford Hill in North London in 1961.

1078
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,760
 It was opened by the American Machine and Foundry Company.

1079
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,920
 Oh, I've just seen Foundry again. Nice.

1080
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,120
 - Anyway, that's not what it's about. Don't worry. - Take him off stage.

1081
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,080
 But they, that company, they also made the underground launching system

1082
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,920
 for the Titan Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.

1083
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,120
 - Oh, my God. - But this is the sort of conspiracy I thought of,

1084
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,520
 because there's a bowling alley under the White House. We know this.

1085
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,880
 - Yeah, there is. - Yeah.

1086
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,320
 So is it possibly connected to the Intercontinental Ballistic...

1087
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
 Do you think they accidentally ordered the wrong product

1088
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,160
 from the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile providers?

1089
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,120
 And they were too embarrassed to say, "No, take it back."

1090
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,920
 Yeah, the vice president of the company that made a lot of very dangerous weapons,

1091
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,400
 a very dangerous time in history, said that the company's product

1092
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,080
 will make a great contribution to human happiness.

1093
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,760
 And there was such a good Guardian article on this, which you might have read,

1094
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,040
 which was, "Careful to specify, they meant the bowling alley

1095
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,240
 and not the missile launcher."

1096
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,440
 And at that event, the first person to bowl the first bowl,

1097
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,680
 so the first bowl ever bowled at bowling alley in Britain,

1098
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,120
 was a guy called Sir John Hunt, who led the British expedition up Everest.

1099
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,960
 And it's worth watching the footage, because he does, of course,

1100
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,800
 bowl it straight into the gutter.

1101
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,000
 - It's very awkward. - What an amazing, strange celebrity booking

1102
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,120
 to open your bowling alley.

1103
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,480
 - I know. Who else would you get, like... - Princess Margaret?

1104
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,920
 - That's... He went straight for Princess Margaret. - I think Aim High.

1105
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,800
 Do you think Princess Margaret would have used...

1106
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,960
 She would have used that thing where you pushed the bowl down

1107
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
 on the little skeleton thing, wouldn't she?

1108
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,440
 - There's no shame in using that, by the way. - The bumpers.

1109
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,120
 The bumpers, designed for kids, right? That was the invention.

1110
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,000
 The bumpers are designed for anyone who wants a more...

1111
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,600
 Actually, a more interesting style of gameplay.

1112
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,000
 Good point.

1113
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,360
 It takes quite a skill to bounce it off three times and then...

1114
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,480
 - And then still end up in the gutter. - Yes, actually.

1115
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,800
 And that's why you weren't at the 30th birthday party, Andy.

1116
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,000
 So, you know, that's designed for kids.

1117
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,280
 And I was amazed to learn that there's this club, which is the three...

1118
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,400
 I'm giving it its name as a club, the 300 Club,

1119
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,200
 but the idea is a perfect game in bowling is 300 points.

1120
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,880
 So you want all strikes, and that means nine strikes for the first nine.

1121
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,520
 And then on the 10th, you need three, because you get those extra goes.

1122
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,720
 So it adds up to 300 points that you get in total.

1123
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,800
 And the record holder of the youngest person ever to get that

1124
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,800
 is a nine-year-old girl at the time in 2013.

1125
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,640
 She's still the record holder called Hannah Deem.

1126
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,680
 And she took up the sport at age six when she was at a party,

1127
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,040
 and she was like, "Oh, I felt like this was a calling."

1128
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:37,720
 And by age nine, she had bowled a perfect game, 300, strikes the whole way.

1129
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,400
 And so you get a ring when that happens.

1130
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,640
 And if you bowl more, they add like a little rock to it each time and so on.

1131
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,400
 But they're very serious about whether or not to take it,

1132
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,520
 the fact that you've said you've got a 300.

1133
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,280
 There's a team that comes in, and in the early days,

1134
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,120
 they would confiscate the ball off you to suss out the ball

1135
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,120
 just to make sure that it was a proper ball that hadn't been cheated.

1136
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,040
 At the end of that day, they would shut down the bowling alley,

1137
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,520
 let no more games come, and someone would come,

1138
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,640
 and they would have a way of measuring the oil slickness of the lane

1139
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,200
 just to make sure that it wasn't too...

1140
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,080
 I want to talk that you haven't rigged it by and poured...

1141
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,680
 Yeah, there's all these things that they did.

1142
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,000
 So was she cheating? Had she poured mercury into her ball?

1143
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
 Had she covered the thing with oil?

1144
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,080
 She was clean. She was clean.

1145
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,240
 Go on, Hannah.

1146
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,840
 Go on, Hannah, you're all going to get enough mercury.

1147
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,520
 (LAUGHTER)

1148
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,320
 Since they stopped selling barometers and mercury thermometers,

1149
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,360
 it's very hard to get your hands on enough mercury.

1150
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,480
 It's a bold move to make a call back to an episode,

1151
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,520
 like 12 episodes ago, to a live crowd.

1152
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,080
 I thought there'd be one or two perometer fans.

1153
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
 Cool.

1154
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,960
 You mentioned the oil, so I didn't know how crucial oil is in bowling,

1155
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,360
 but this basically answered a question that's been bugging me for 20 years,

1156
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,280
 which is, you know, when you go to a bowling alley with friends,

1157
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,160
 and you get kind of a...

1158
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,120
 Like, if you're on a good roll, you get a bunch of strikes,

1159
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,760
 your friend gets loads of strikes, you think, "This is so effing easy.

1160
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,200
 How are there professionals in this game?

1161
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,600
 They must be getting strikes every time,

1162
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,160
 otherwise they're just idiots."

1163
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,200
 Well, turns out their game is way harder than ours.

1164
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,560
 So, in recreational bowling,

1165
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,160
 if you're going to Rowan's bowling alley down the road or wherever,

1166
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,000
 then they have the oil arranged in a certain way.

1167
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,160
 So, down a bowling lane, it has oil on it,

1168
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,320
 and it originally had oil on it to make it more slippy

1169
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,000
 so that the balls didn't crack the ground.

1170
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,960
 But it became apparent that oil obviously adjusts the way the ball goes,

1171
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,280
 so if there's oil down the middle, the ball slides very fast down that oil,

1172
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,360
 and then as soon as it goes off the oil,

1173
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,320
 so there's not as much oil nearer the pins,

1174
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,000
 then it starts going more slowly and friction acts more on the ball,

1175
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,160
 and it starts to spin, things like that.

1176
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,080
 So, bowling alleys for plebs like you and me

1177
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,840
 have the oil rigged so that it funnels the ball towards the pins.

1178
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,560
 - Oh, wow. - And that's why we're all getting strikes.

1179
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,320
 And if you go to a professional bowlers association bowling alley,

1180
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,200
 they do not have that.

1181
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,360
 They make sure that the oil is spread exactly evenly,

1182
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,640
 and I think if any of us tried to bowl down one of those,

1183
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,520
 it would just be straight in the gutter every time.

1184
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,320
 - Really? - Wow.

1185
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,160
 Is it possible that I've spent my life accidentally going to professional bowling alleys?

1186
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,200
 Do you think in those professional bowling alleys,

1187
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,040
 they would put the tubes on the side?

1188
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,840
 I guess it's possible.

1189
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,320
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1190
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,960
 and that is my fact.

1191
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,960
 My fact this week is trees fart.

1192
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,360
 (LAUGHTER)

1193
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
 Trees fart.

1194
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,040
 - It turns out... - Come on, Dan.

1195
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,760
 - Trees fart. - How often have you been on a lovely walk

1196
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,920
 in the forest and just hearing farts?

1197
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,640
 Well, the thing is, if a tree farts in the forest,

1198
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,680
 but there's no one around to smell it...

1199
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,560
 (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

1200
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,360
 So, this is, I mean, it's a real technical thing, isn't it,

1201
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,560
 in this case, because obviously they don't have anuses,

1202
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,280
 but they do.

1203
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,680
 Slow down, Professor.

1204
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,600
 (LAUGHTER)

1205
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,360
 Trees do release little bits of methane,

1206
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,640
 and that's obviously a big problem for global warming.

1207
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,400
 And the article that I was reading was talking...

1208
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,760
 This is how I learned the fact. It was in Science Alert.

1209
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,800
 It talks about ghost trees.

1210
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
 Ghost trees are trees that are dead,

1211
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,320
 and they still function, though, in certain areas,

1212
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,120
 so they can suck up soils and so on through them,

1213
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,120
 acting like a straw, and as a result,

1214
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,360
 ghost trees release sort of much bigger farts,

1215
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,760
 and they're much more dangerous.

1216
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,080
 But the thing is, like, a normal tree farts

1217
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,520
 or gives off methane, but it also kind of sucks in CO2

1218
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,960
 and photosynthesises and stuff, so it's kind of fine,

1219
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,720
 because it offsets it.

1220
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,480
 But the ghost trees, they don't have any leaves,

1221
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,240
 so they can't do it, so it's much worse.

1222
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,480
 These kind of dead trees that you get in marshes and stuff like that,

1223
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,880
 and they suck up this methane.

1224
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,600
 We think from the soil, although we're not quite sure

1225
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,120
 how they do it at the moment.

1226
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,280
 This recent study that was in the article,

1227
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,280
 they found that the amount of methane that comes up

1228
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,720
 is way more than you would expect

1229
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,120
 due to the amount that's in the ground,

1230
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,560
 and so there's something else happening.

1231
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
 We don't know what it is, and obviously it's quite important,

1232
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,360
 because lots more trees are dying

1233
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,360
 because the change is in the climate and stuff,

1234
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,560
 and this might cause problems in the future.

1235
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,520
 Yeah, and I think is it that when water or when sea levels rise,

1236
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,080
 sometimes you get forests near the coast,

1237
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,840
 which can't survive in those conditions,

1238
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,480
 so that adds to the effect as well.

1239
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,280
 So the sea comes in, it's more salty,

1240
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,480
 the trees die, and then they start doing all this farting.

1241
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,200
 Yeah, and I think we should say that,

1242
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,480
 because every single article and every single scientist

1243
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,240
 who looks into this says about 59 times an article, don't they?

1244
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,840
 We are not trying to say that trees are bad.

1245
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,600
 The overall impact of trees is still incredibly good.

1246
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,720
 Please, God, Daily Mail, don't print an article

1247
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,360
 saying that trees are bad for the environment.

1248
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,520
 They've got to go. That's what they're screaming at.

1249
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,440
 They've got to go. People of Kentish Town,

1250
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,080
 please do not go straight out to your nearest tree

1251
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,320
 and chop it down. That's not what we're saying.

1252
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,160
 You take those farting fucks out.

1253
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,640
 Don't, please! I'm begging you.

1254
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,080
 The whole methane thing is really interesting,

1255
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,600
 just sort of globally the methane thing,

1256
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,680
 because there is the American NOAA,

1257
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,280
 who are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Scientists,

1258
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,000
 they are in Colorado, and they are methane detectives.

1259
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,800
 They have a department which is methane detection.

1260
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,800
 So for the last 40 years, every single week,

1261
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,520
 they have received this consignment of flasks from around the world,

1262
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,160
 which are flasks of atmospheric air from all over the planet,

1263
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,360
 and they measure what's inside.

1264
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,680
 So they have been able to measure methane levels

1265
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,840
 around the planet for the last 40 years,

1266
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,000
 and they've been just studying atmospheric levels.

1267
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,840
 They've found that methane has been rising since 2007,

1268
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,840
 and no one really knows why.

1269
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,280
 I mean, it's our fault, clearly, but no one really...

1270
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,880
 They haven't pinned down exactly why.

1271
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,400
 It could be from wetlands, it could be this tree thing,

1272
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,480
 pig manure causes it, so, like, cattle cause a huge amount of it.

1273
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,480
 I'm not trying to pass blame, because I'm sure it is our fault,

1274
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,760
 but is there any chance it's Beaver's fault?

1275
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,800
 Because Beaver's are apparently an issue.

1276
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,280
 I thought you said Beaver.

1277
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,160
 I thought you were talking about it.

1278
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,800
 He gets private jets everywhere.

1279
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,080
 Beaver's, they're invading Alaska because waters are warming,

1280
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,400
 which means they can go much further north up into the Arctic Circle,

1281
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,520
 and so they're building lots of dams up in an area

1282
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,040
 that used to be frozen or extremely cold,

1283
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,880
 and then their dams are, like, big heat reservoirs

1284
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,360
 which warm up the surrounding soil, degrade the permafrost,

1285
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,080
 and there's loads of methane in the permafrost,

1286
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,760
 it's a massive problem methane being released from the permafrost,

1287
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,160
 and so that puts methane in the atmosphere.

1288
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,240
 Beaver's fault, I'm not responsible.

1289
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,000
 So what we're saying to the people of Kentish Town

1290
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,320
 is to go out and strangle a beaver.

1291
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,720
 Yeah.

1292
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,800
 Go down a tree and strangle a beaver, yeah.

1293
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,720
 I think that's responsible messaging.

1294
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,000
 There was a problem with animals and methane.

1295
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,320
 Specifically, our old friends, the sauropods,

1296
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,520
 the big dinosaurs that had lots of plant material,

1297
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,760
 there was some work done by David Wilkinson

1298
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,800
 of Liverpool John Moors University,

1299
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,640
 and he reckons, he's worked this out,

1300
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,000
 he reckoned that sauropod population,

1301
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,240
 when they were at the absolute biggest,

1302
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,600
 they were pumping out 520 million tonnes of methane a year,

1303
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,760
 which is about the same as the current emissions of greenhouse gases.

1304
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,480
 Really?

1305
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,080
 Yeah, so the sauropods, and they reckon that that did change the climate

1306
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,320
 as well through farting.

1307
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,240
 Wow.

1308
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,640
 So did the sauropod Green Party eventually get some steam behind it

1309
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,880
 and take power?

1310
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,960
 Eventually, someone stuck their neck out, you know.

1311
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,920
 Yeah, we first discovered that methane were in trees,

1312
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,480
 was in trees, in 1907.

1313
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,720
 And it was this professor, a chemistry professor in Kansas,

1314
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,440
 wandering around Kansas in 1907,

1315
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,960
 and he saw little bubbles in the sap of a tree,

1316
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,200
 a certain type of tree,

1317
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,000
 and he thought, I wonder what's causing them,

1318
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,440
 I wonder if it's methane, so he struck a match above it,

1319
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,160
 and it ignited and burped out.

1320
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,080
 So he basically lit the fart of the tree.

1321
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,200
 He lit the fart of the tree,

1322
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,280
 and apparently, if you're studying trees anywhere,

1323
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,320
 your tree professor will always do this, and you can do this.

1324
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,560
 You go through a tree, and you get the sap,

1325
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,080
 and it's burping out methane, so you can light it,

1326
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,160
 and it does a little burp.

1327
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,720
 Don't, like, if you're in Australia, please don't do that.

1328
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,200
 That's Jesus Christ.

1329
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,360
 This podcast is going to cause bushfires globally from that sentence.

1330
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,480
 Once you've finished strangling your beaver,

1331
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,000
 just set fire to the nearest tree, and science will win.

1332
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,960
 Here's a warning. Here's another warning.

1333
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,600
 If you hold a fart in for too long, it may leak out of your mouth.

1334
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,000
 It's got to go somewhere, isn't it?

1335
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 Exactly.

1336
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,160
 It's basically, it gets reabsorbed into your circulation,

1337
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,680
 just finds its way in, and whether you notice or not,

1338
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,520
 it's just going to slowly come out of your mouth.

1339
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,120
 It does... That sounds...

1340
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,640
 Everything you're saying sounds true,

1341
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,400
 but it does sound like one of those things that your mum says, doesn't it?

1342
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,640
 Well, if you keep your face like that, the wind will change,

1343
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,320
 and it'll get stuck, you know, or whatever.

1344
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,240
 It sounds like a sort of old, white tail of...

1345
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,920
 Your mum has got some amazing sayings, Andy.

1346
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,240
 What do you mean?

1347
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,760
 Have you farted enough today, Andy?

1348
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,280
 Because you know what will happen.

1349
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,400
 But how come they don't smell like sulfur?

1350
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,040
 Because the reason fart smell is because of sulfur,

1351
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,920
 which is in compounds that smell bad.

1352
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,920
 But when I burp, it doesn't smell like a fart, I don't think.

1353
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,960
 And I've never smelled anyone's burp smelling like a fart,

1354
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,960
 like a sulfuric fart.

1355
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,960
 No, I agree, yeah.

1356
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,720
 So something must have happened there.

1357
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,880
 It must... Maybe the sulfur is like only the arse,

1358
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,040
 but the other ones will come out of the mouth.

1359
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,040
 Maybe.

1360
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,400
 (LAUGHTER)

1361
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,400
 Hmm.

1362
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,520
 (LAUGHTER)

1363
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,400
 You've really given us something to think about there.

1364
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,720
 (LAUGHTER)

1365
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,520
 You'd be great on sulfur the day, right here.

1366
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,960
 Welcome to the moral maze on BBC Four.

1367
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
 (LAUGHTER)

1368
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
 Why does sulfur choose the anus?

1369
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,240
 (LAUGHTER)

1370
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,640
 Methane chooses the mouth, doesn't it?

1371
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,000
 As in, for cows, I thought that cow's methane was sort of

1372
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,160
 mostly like a split at each end of the cow,

1373
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,680
 whether it's burping or farting, whatever.

1374
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,120
 About, I think it's 95% of cattle methane comes from its mouth.

1375
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
 And this is...

1376
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,760
 This really is a genuinely huge problem,

1377
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,160
 because there are, I think, about a billion cows on the planet.

1378
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,760
 If they were a country, they'd be the sixth largest emitter of methane

1379
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
 in the world.

1380
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
 What a country.

1381
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,760
 (LAUGHTER)

1382
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,320
 In this country that's just cows, are they also running the place and stuff?

1383
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,840
 Do they have their own cow, their own minister and stuff?

1384
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,840
 Yeah.

1385
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,240
 Yeah, in this whimsical world, there's a kind of...

1386
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,040
 Andy, in that, if that was a country...

1387
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,040
 Yeah.

1388
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,040
 Is this a genuine question?

1389
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,040
 Yes.

1390
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,800
 If it was that dense of cows, like it's a country made of cows,

1391
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,960
 as you're saying, so the methane's huge.

1392
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,800
 If I lit a cigarette lighter, would the whole thing go up?

1393
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,800
 I don't know.

1394
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,320
 No, I don't think so.

1395
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,160
 It doesn't if you do it in the middle of a cow field.

1396
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,160
 It doesn't even if you do it.

1397
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160
 This is a country made of cows.

1398
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,160
 No, no.

1399
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,160
 A, it's not made of cows.

1400
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,160
 That's what Andy's saying.

1401
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,160
 There are loads of cows in it.

1402
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,160
 There are only cows in it.

1403
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,160
 It's a cow...

1404
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,160
 It depends how many there are.

1405
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,520
 If there is a billion cows and it's in the size of San Marino,

1406
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,560
 then that's a lot of cows and a lot of methane.

1407
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,840
 But if you're in the size of the Soviet Union, the old style,

1408
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
 then they'd be fine.

1409
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
 That's not my mistake.

1410
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,000
 If there are a billion cows in a country the size of San Marino,

1411
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,400
 there are bigger infrastructural problems to deal with.

1412
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,400
 How are the Italians keeping them out?

1413
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,200
 It's one very big cattle grid and they just can't get over it.

1414
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,160
 But yeah, of course, it depends how much methane you have,

1415
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,600
 but also how much oxygen you have, right?

1416
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,280
 So the methane will only set on fire if you have oxygen

1417
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,520
 because you need oxygen to make fire.

1418
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,400
 And that's the thing that on Uranus, there's a lot of methane.

1419
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,440
 The whole of the atmosphere is made of methane pretty much.

1420
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,880
 There's tons and tons of the stuff.

1421
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,960
 But you can't set it on fire because there's no oxygen.

1422
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,560
 But what that means is if you had a spaceship

1423
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,400
 and you went into the Uranus atmosphere,

1424
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,080
 you would need the oxygen there because you would have to breathe it.

1425
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,720
 As soon as you open the door, any kind of turn on the light switch

1426
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,800
 or any kind of naked flame, the whole place is going up.

1427
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,440
 And it's like a reverse Hindenburg.

1428
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,760
 So like the Hindenburg had the flammable gas on the inside,

1429
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,520
 but you've got the oxygen on the inside and it would just go, "Wow."

1430
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,520
 I thought that was very adult of you all, not to laugh every time.

1431
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,960
 James said Uranus.

1432
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,680
 Very proud of you all.

1433
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,600
 I wasn't planning on going there.

1434
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,480
 It's another good reason not to.

1435
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,280
 It is on the government green list, though, if anyone's interested.

1436
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,600
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1437
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,480
 Thank you so much for listening.

1438
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,600
