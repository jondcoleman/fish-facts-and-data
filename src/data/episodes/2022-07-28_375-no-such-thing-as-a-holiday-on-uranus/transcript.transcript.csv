00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:18,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:18,00:00:20,"and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:20,00:00:22,this week coming to you live
00:00:22,00:00:25,from the O2 Forum in Kentish Town.
00:00:25,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:32,(audience cheering)
00:00:32,00:00:33,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:33,00:00:35,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:35,00:00:37,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:00:37,00:00:40,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:40,00:00:43,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:43,00:00:46,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:46,00:00:50,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:50,00:00:53,- My fact this week is that one of the main villains
00:00:53,00:00:57,"in China's equivalent of WWE is Steve,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,the English as a second language teacher.
00:00:59,00:01:03,(audience laughing)
00:01:03,00:01:04,- That is terrifying.
00:01:04,00:01:07,- It's a frightening concept for a lot of Chinese people
00:01:07,00:01:08,trying to learn English.
00:01:08,00:01:13,"I think it's quite a small outfit compared to WWE,"
00:01:13,00:01:14,"which you may remember as WWF,"
00:01:14,00:01:17,but of course it's not allowed to be called that anymore
00:01:17,00:01:19,'cause the Wildlife Fund got that name.
00:01:19,00:01:19,"- Yes, absolutely."
00:01:19,00:01:20,"- And that was it, wasn't it?"
00:01:20,00:01:23,- It was a big fight with Hulk Hogan and the panda.
00:01:23,00:01:25,(audience laughing)
00:01:25,00:01:27,- Bizarrely the panda won that one.
00:01:27,00:01:30,"So this is Middle Kingdom Wrestling, MKE,"
00:01:30,00:01:33,which is the very nascent Chinese pro wrestling organization
00:01:33,00:01:35,that was started in 2015.
00:01:35,00:01:39,"And yeah, it's got some imaginative evil dudes."
00:01:39,00:01:41,"So Steve, the English as a second language teacher,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,he brings exam textbooks into the ring.
00:01:43,00:01:45,"- Oh, that's so cool."
00:01:45,00:01:46,- Does he like hit them with it?
00:01:46,00:01:47,"Us, he must be right."
00:01:47,00:01:48,"- I think he does a bit, yes he does."
00:01:48,00:01:49,- Does he?
00:01:49,00:01:49,- I thought he did.
00:01:49,00:01:50,- He probably does.
00:01:50,00:01:52,I was imagining he just opened it up in front of them
00:01:52,00:01:53,"and said, ""Answer these questions."""
00:01:53,00:01:55,(audience laughing)
00:01:55,00:01:55,- I don't know.
00:01:55,00:01:58,"- I read the article that you sent round about this, Anna,"
00:01:58,00:02:01,"I read something, it was in sixth tone, I think,"
00:02:01,00:02:02,was the website.
00:02:02,00:02:03,"- Yes, yeah."
00:02:03,00:02:06,"- And it said, ""Burger, burger,"""
00:02:06,00:02:09,"repeats the English language instructor,"
00:02:09,00:02:11,showing a picture of a hamburger to his opponent.
00:02:11,00:02:13,(audience laughing)
00:02:13,00:02:15,"And then the commentator says,"
00:02:15,00:02:19,"""Cowardly attack here by Steve, the ESL teacher,"
00:02:19,00:02:20,"""letting issues from his personal life"
00:02:20,00:02:23,"""creep into the business life again."""
00:02:23,00:02:25,(audience laughing)
00:02:25,00:02:27,"- Yeah, his wife cheated on him with a hamburger."
00:02:27,00:02:28,(audience laughing)
00:02:28,00:02:29,Very awkward.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"- But they do, I mean, it is like WWE,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"used to be WWF, you know, amazing characters."
00:02:34,00:02:36,"They've got the bamboo crusher,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"who's a guy who comes out with sort of,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,"it's basically, he's meant to be a panda"
00:02:40,00:02:43,"and he's just got two black marks around his eyes, yeah."
00:02:43,00:02:46,- There's another character who is the curry kid
00:02:46,00:02:49,"and he wears a devil mask, quite scary."
00:02:49,00:02:50,"And then on his head, there's a,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,I thought it was a weird looking hat.
00:02:52,00:02:54,And I zoomed right in and it's a paper plate
00:02:54,00:02:55,with rice on top.
00:02:55,00:02:56,(audience laughing)
00:02:56,00:02:57,I don't know if it's real rice
00:02:57,00:02:58,"and it's like finishing school,"
00:02:58,00:02:59,you have to balance it on your head
00:02:59,00:03:00,the whole way through.
00:03:00,00:03:01,- Wow.
00:03:01,00:03:02,- But that was him.
00:03:02,00:03:03,- That's amazing.
00:03:03,00:03:05,"- There's Queen Marie, who just wears a crown."
00:03:05,00:03:06,She's the only lady.
00:03:06,00:03:08,And there's Buffer Daboonbox.
00:03:08,00:03:12,"No, sorry, Buffer and Daboonbox,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,who carries a boombox.
00:03:14,00:03:15,- Wow.
00:03:15,00:03:15,- It's a great cast character.
00:03:15,00:03:17,- He's Buffer.
00:03:17,00:03:18,- He's Buffer.
00:03:18,00:03:19,- And Daboonbox.
00:03:19,00:03:21,"- And Daboonbox, it's his sidekick, yeah."
00:03:21,00:03:23,"- You said there was only one female wrestler there,"
00:03:23,00:03:26,does that mean she fights against the men or?
00:03:26,00:03:30,- I think they fight other wrestling outfits.
00:03:30,00:03:31,So there's another outfit called
00:03:31,00:03:33,the OWE Oriental Wrestling Entertainment
00:03:33,00:03:35,and I think they've interacted.
00:03:35,00:03:37,But I'm not sure what Queen Marie does.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"- Interesting, 'cause do you know that TV show,"
00:03:39,00:03:40,"Glow, that used to be on?"
00:03:40,00:03:41,- Yeah.
00:03:41,00:03:41,- Brilliant TV show.
00:03:41,00:03:44,"The gorgeous ladies of wrestling, it's called,"
00:03:44,00:03:45,"and it's about women's wrestling,"
00:03:45,00:03:48,but it was based on real life wrestling.
00:03:48,00:03:50,And they brought in all these women
00:03:50,00:03:52,who are mostly dancers and stuff like this.
00:03:52,00:03:55,And there was only one woman who had any wrestling experience.
00:03:55,00:03:59,She was called Dee Booher and she played Matilda the Hun.
00:03:59,00:04:03,"But when she was doing her wrestling,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,she wasn't allowed to fight against the men.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"And there were no other women who could fight against her,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,so they needed to find someone to fight her.
00:04:09,00:04:13,And they found a female bear.
00:04:13,00:04:14,- Okay.
00:04:14,00:04:15,(audience laughs)
00:04:15,00:04:16,- Who she fought.
00:04:16,00:04:20,"- It's Hulk who converted the panda all over again, so."
00:04:20,00:04:21,- And so she wasn't allowed to fight men.
00:04:21,00:04:23,They had to find a female.
00:04:23,00:04:24,They found a female bear.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"- Okay, so surely fighting a female bear"
00:04:27,00:04:29,is harder than fighting a man.
00:04:29,00:04:31,(audience laughs)
00:04:31,00:04:32,- Have you not seen that thing on Twitter
00:04:32,00:04:33,that's been doing the rounds
00:04:33,00:04:35,that most men think they can beat up a bear?
00:04:35,00:04:36,"- Yes, right."
00:04:36,00:04:38,"- Oh, I'm so glad that we've got onto this."
00:04:38,00:04:39,I didn't think we would.
00:04:39,00:04:40,"But it was really interesting,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,"because the question specified,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,"this was a YouGov poll,"
00:04:43,00:04:44,"which was, you know, what percent of men and women"
00:04:44,00:04:46,think they could beat which animals?
00:04:46,00:04:47,"And it was within the last week, wasn't it?"
00:04:47,00:04:50,And it was something like 38% of men
00:04:50,00:04:53,"think they could beat a chimpanzee, unarmed."
00:04:53,00:04:54,Chimpanzees are strong.
00:04:54,00:04:57,- It was like 7% of men thought they could beat a lion.
00:04:57,00:05:01,"- Yeah, and it was something like 8% of men."
00:05:01,00:05:02,"And women were the same number, weirdly."
00:05:02,00:05:04,"Both men and women, about 7% or 8%"
00:05:04,00:05:07,"think they could beat an elephant in a fight, if unarmed."
00:05:07,00:05:08,- Wow.
00:05:08,00:05:09,"I mean, what do you do?"
00:05:09,00:05:09,How do you fight?
00:05:09,00:05:10,- Yeah.
00:05:10,00:05:11,"- What, you grab the trunk, obviously."
00:05:11,00:05:13,"- You grab the trunk, and then."
00:05:13,00:05:13,- But then what?
00:05:13,00:05:15,"I mean, it submits, I guess."
00:05:15,00:05:16,"I mean, they're very sensitive."
00:05:16,00:05:17,Yeah.
00:05:18,00:05:20,"- This thing of the sort of the villain wrestlers,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,"the heels, you know, they're the sort of,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"and this thing of, which I don't really understand"
00:05:24,00:05:25,"'cause I'm not a wrestling fan,"
00:05:25,00:05:27,where you have to stay in character.
00:05:27,00:05:29,No one really acknowledges the.
00:05:29,00:05:30,"- Yeah, it's a."
00:05:30,00:05:31,"- Yeah, it's a whole thing."
00:05:31,00:05:34,You don't acknowledge the kind of fictional elements
00:05:34,00:05:36,"of the universe and, you know, all of this."
00:05:36,00:05:40,But this was such a big thing that wrestlers
00:05:40,00:05:42,in the 70s and 80s weren't allowed to travel
00:05:42,00:05:45,to matches together if they were on opposite sides
00:05:45,00:05:46,in the fictional universe of wrestling.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"- Oh, really? So like if two of them saw each other"
00:05:49,00:05:51,"on a plane, they'd have to get in a big fight?"
00:05:51,00:05:53,"- Yeah, exactly, basically, yeah."
00:05:53,00:05:56,And so there were two wrestlers called Hacksaw Jim Duggan.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"- Oh, yeah."
00:05:57,00:05:58,- Ba-ba-beats people up.
00:05:58,00:05:59,"- Okay, so."
00:05:59,00:05:59,- Hacksaw Jim Duggan.
00:05:59,00:06:02,"- I should just say, we very much have done"
00:06:02,00:06:04,specialist subjects in the section.
00:06:04,00:06:05,- That's not even his theme tune.
00:06:05,00:06:08,That was like a random WWF music album
00:06:08,00:06:10,that was released in 1995.
00:06:10,00:06:11,It's great.
00:06:11,00:06:12,"Brent the Hitman Heart has a love song on it,"
00:06:12,00:06:13,"""Much a man, Randy Savage."""
00:06:13,00:06:14,"Keep going, sorry."
00:06:14,00:06:15,- Thank you.
00:06:16,00:06:20,"- So he, CF, downs early a bit."
00:06:20,00:06:22,Hacksaw Jim Duggan and an evil character
00:06:22,00:06:24,called the Iron Shake.
00:06:24,00:06:24,- Ah!
00:06:24,00:06:25,(laughing)
00:06:25,00:06:26,- Classic.
00:06:26,00:06:27,- Huge.
00:06:27,00:06:29,"- Oh, I think I know what you're about to say."
00:06:29,00:06:30,He was at a conference.
00:06:30,00:06:33,The Iron Shake met up with the ultimate warrior
00:06:33,00:06:35,and he wanted to say hi.
00:06:35,00:06:37,And the ultimate warrior didn't want to say hi back.
00:06:37,00:06:39,And so the Iron Shake slapped the man
00:06:39,00:06:41,who said he would say hi.
00:06:41,00:06:42,It's very dramatic.
00:06:42,00:06:43,It's on YouTube.
00:06:43,00:06:44,- That's not what I was gonna say.
00:06:44,00:06:46,(laughing)
00:06:46,00:06:49,"- Anyway, this fact has received such a kicking from Dad."
00:06:49,00:06:50,But basically.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- I'm just giving background context.
00:06:51,00:06:53,- Hacksaw Jim Duggan.
00:06:53,00:06:54,- Mama beats people up.
00:06:54,00:06:54,- Thank you.
00:06:54,00:06:55,(laughing)
00:06:55,00:06:58,And the Iron Shake were arrested
00:06:58,00:07:01,while traveling in the same car in 1987.
00:07:01,00:07:02,"- Wait, because they were traveling in the same car?"
00:07:02,00:07:03,"- Admittedly, they weren't arrested"
00:07:03,00:07:05,because of the fictional universe of wrestling being breached.
00:07:05,00:07:07,They were arrested for possession of cocaine and marijuana.
00:07:07,00:07:08,But still.
00:07:08,00:07:10,(laughing)
00:07:10,00:07:11,- But I bet the police were bloody cross
00:07:11,00:07:15,"about the fictional world being breached as well, weren't they?"
00:07:15,00:07:17,- You guys shouldn't even be in the same room together.
00:07:17,00:07:19,(laughing)
00:07:19,00:07:23,"- Well, there was a guy, another famous pro wrestler"
00:07:23,00:07:25,"in Britain in the 60s, 70s."
00:07:25,00:07:27,"Actually, I think wrestled up to the late 80s, 90s"
00:07:27,00:07:30,"called Kendo Nagasaki, who actually,"
00:07:30,00:07:32,there are two Kendo Nagasaki's.
00:07:32,00:07:34,"One is a Japanese guy, which sounds about right,"
00:07:34,00:07:37,who is called Kazuo Sakurada.
00:07:37,00:07:39,But the famous one in Britain
00:07:39,00:07:41,is just this bloke called Peter Thornley.
00:07:41,00:07:43,(laughing)
00:07:43,00:07:45,"Now, Wikipedia describes Peter Thornley"
00:07:45,00:07:49,as someone who remains a household name in his home country.
00:07:49,00:07:52,'Cause anyone heard of Peter Thornley?
00:07:52,00:07:53,- No.
00:07:53,00:07:56,"- Right, so it's not, none of the households here tonight."
00:07:56,00:07:59,"But, yeah, so he was super committed to the role"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"and he wore a mask and his character was,"
00:08:01,00:08:02,he had these powers of hypnosis
00:08:02,00:08:04,and he was very dark and brooding
00:08:04,00:08:06,and had a very troubled past.
00:08:06,00:08:09,"And he's taking vengeance on everyone, et cetera, et cetera,"
00:08:09,00:08:10,lots of bullshit.
00:08:10,00:08:13,"And he never spoke, so he had to have with him"
00:08:13,00:08:15,a verbalizer at all times.
00:08:15,00:08:16,He was called Gorgeous George Gillette.
00:08:16,00:08:17,"- Oh, yeah."
00:08:17,00:08:20,"- But so basically this guy was like sooty,"
00:08:20,00:08:23,"Kendo Nagasaki, and Gorgeous George had to lean over"
00:08:23,00:08:25,"and say, ""What's that Kendo Nagasaki?"""
00:08:25,00:08:26,(laughing)
00:08:26,00:08:27,You're gonna beat the shit out of this guy.
00:08:27,00:08:30,"Well, I'll tell them, but I don't think they're gonna like it."
00:08:30,00:08:31,- He was very intimidating.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"- What do you think of that, Bison Girl?"
00:08:33,00:08:36,(laughing)
00:08:36,00:08:39,- So his life was essentially ruined in the late 70s
00:08:39,00:08:42,because he was sort of living with Gorgeous George
00:08:42,00:08:43,"at the time, it seems."
00:08:43,00:08:46,And his identity was fully hardcore secret.
00:08:46,00:08:47,No one knew he was.
00:08:47,00:08:48,And then their toilet broke
00:08:48,00:08:49,and they had to call a plumber in.
00:08:49,00:08:52,"And the plumber saw Gorgeous George answer the door,"
00:08:52,00:08:53,"put two and two together and was like,"
00:08:53,00:08:56,"""I bet that guy who's sitting there on the sofa"
00:08:56,00:08:58,"is Kendo Nagasaki."""
00:08:58,00:09:00,'Cause he's hanging out with Gorgeous George.
00:09:00,00:09:03,"And so he then printed loads of leaflets saying,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"""This is the real identity of Kendo Nagasaki"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"and this is the address he lives at."""
00:09:07,00:09:10,He used to hand them out at all the gigs they did.
00:09:10,00:09:10,- Really?
00:09:10,00:09:13,"- And whenever he'd put adverts in the newspaper,"
00:09:13,00:09:15,so there'd be a big ad that Kendo Nagasaki's having
00:09:15,00:09:18,"a big fight here, then just below it would appear,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"posted by this plumber, a thing saying,"
00:09:20,00:09:23,"""The above wrestler, Kendo Nagasaki, is Peter Thornley"
00:09:23,00:09:25,"and he lives at this address."""
00:09:25,00:09:26,- Right.
00:09:26,00:09:27,"- And everyone in the UK is going,"
00:09:27,00:09:30,"""We know who Peter Thornley is."""
00:09:30,00:09:30,(laughing)
00:09:30,00:09:31,- But that is the reality
00:09:31,00:09:33,when you've got these amazing characters
00:09:33,00:09:34,and then the real life.
00:09:34,00:09:38,"You know, Yokozuna, one of the greatest characters in WWF,"
00:09:38,00:09:40,he was a Japanese sumo wrestler.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"He wasn't, he was from Hawaii"
00:09:42,00:09:44,and his name was Rodney in real life.
00:09:44,00:09:47,"You know, Hulk Hogan, his name's Terry, you know?"
00:09:47,00:09:49,- Is it Terry Hogan?
00:09:49,00:09:52,"- No, it's called Belayah, something like that."
00:09:52,00:09:53,Belayah.
00:09:53,00:09:54,- I should have learned that you would know.
00:09:54,00:09:55,"- Yeah, Terry Belayah."
00:09:55,00:09:57,"- Okay, here's a quiz question for you Dan,"
00:09:57,00:09:59,as soon as you're such an expert.
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Okay.
00:10:00,00:10:03,- In which country do you think was the highest attended
00:10:03,00:10:05,wrestling performance in history?
00:10:05,00:10:10,"- Ooh, I'm gonna say Philippines."
00:10:10,00:10:12,"- Matthew, no."
00:10:12,00:10:13,Keep going.
00:10:13,00:10:14,- I'm gonna say America.
00:10:14,00:10:16,- You've got 193 countries in the world.
00:10:16,00:10:19,- I'm gonna say South Sudan.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"Andy, this is my game, sorry."
00:10:21,00:10:24,- It's pretty much one of the last places you would think of.
00:10:24,00:10:26,It's North Korea.
00:10:26,00:10:26,- What?
00:10:26,00:10:27,- Okay.
00:10:27,00:10:32,"And in 1995, there was a load of wrestlers from America,"
00:10:32,00:10:36,"from WWF, went over to North Korea with Muhammad Ali,"
00:10:36,00:10:39,"by the way, to do a big sort of wrestling show."
00:10:39,00:10:41,"One of them was Ric Flair, who I'm sure you will know."
00:10:41,00:10:44,"- Yeah, the nature boy, Ric Flair."
00:10:44,00:10:45,Always wore red when he was gonna lose.
00:10:45,00:10:47,No one knew that at the time.
00:10:47,00:10:49,- We've never done a podcast with live footnotes before.
00:10:49,00:10:50,(laughing)
00:10:50,00:10:52,And it's unbelievably annoying.
00:10:52,00:10:54,(laughing)
00:10:54,00:10:58,"- And he fought against this guy called Antonio Inoki,"
00:10:58,00:11:00,who was a Japanese wrestler.
00:11:00,00:11:03,"And he kind of had some connections in North Korea,"
00:11:03,00:11:04,so he could do it.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"But there were about 100,000 people"
00:11:07,00:11:09,who watched this wrestling match.
00:11:09,00:11:09,- Wow.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"- All North Koreans, and so didn't cheer."
00:11:12,00:11:16,They just sat in silence and watched this match happen.
00:11:16,00:11:18,"And then Ric Flair at the end,"
00:11:18,00:11:21,"they tried to force him into doing a statement saying,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,"oh, I can see why North Korea is so great,"
00:11:23,00:11:25,"and why America is so afraid of North Korea,"
00:11:25,00:11:26,and stuff like that.
00:11:26,00:11:29,But he refused to do that.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"But Inoki, who is the Japanese guy,"
00:11:31,00:11:33,he was also a politician.
00:11:33,00:11:37,And he once successfully negotiated with Saddam Hussein
00:11:37,00:11:40,"for the release of Japanese hostages, this wrestler."
00:11:40,00:11:41,- Wow.
00:11:41,00:11:42,- Isn't that amazing?
00:11:42,00:11:45,And he's so revered in the Japanese wrestling world
00:11:45,00:11:46,"that if you're a Japanese wrestler,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,you might request to be slapped in the face by him.
00:11:49,00:11:51,(laughing)
00:11:51,00:11:53,And that might give you some of his courage.
00:11:53,00:11:54,That's the idea.
00:11:54,00:11:56,- I didn't know that slapping in the face
00:11:56,00:11:58,is apparently a big wrestling move.
00:11:58,00:11:59,I'm learning tonight.
00:11:59,00:12:00,- Yeah.
00:12:00,00:12:01,- You're not supposed to do it with an open palm.
00:12:01,00:12:02,"Is that right, Dan?"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"- You, well, you don't do it with a fist."
00:12:04,00:12:05,You have to do it with open palm.
00:12:05,00:12:06,- You don't do it with a fist.
00:12:06,00:12:07,"It's an open palm so that you don't make,"
00:12:07,00:12:09,"it's a more, let's see that noise."
00:12:09,00:12:10,"- Yeah, thank you, yeah."
00:12:10,00:12:11,- You don't get that with the palm.
00:12:11,00:12:13,So it's more for the dramatics of it.
00:12:13,00:12:15,And it's obviously safer.
00:12:15,00:12:17,And you don't pull hair.
00:12:17,00:12:21,"But also, there was a tag team called the Bushwhackers,"
00:12:21,00:12:23,and they used to lick people's heads.
00:12:23,00:12:23,They were from New Zealand.
00:12:23,00:12:25,And I met them as a kid in public home.
00:12:25,00:12:26,"- Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:12:26,00:12:28,The New Zealand was your headline.
00:12:28,00:12:30,"But I think what you said just before,"
00:12:30,00:12:31,it was more interesting.
00:12:31,00:12:32,"- Oh, so they, yeah."
00:12:32,00:12:35,So their whole thing was they would lick people's heads.
00:12:35,00:12:37,- Was this pre-COVID or?
00:12:37,00:12:38,- Yes.
00:12:38,00:12:39,(laughing)
00:12:39,00:12:40,- Very safe at the time.
00:12:40,00:12:42,- It's not a winning move.
00:12:42,00:12:44,- I don't understand how that would come to take you.
00:12:44,00:12:46,- Did the two of them lick the head
00:12:46,00:12:48,"at the, the enemy's head at the same time?"
00:12:48,00:12:50,Like a sort of finishing move?
00:12:50,00:12:51,"- No, no, it wasn't a finishing move."
00:12:51,00:12:54,"No, it was just a mid-match cheeky lick on the head."
00:12:54,00:12:55,"- Come on, Annie."
00:12:55,00:12:56,That's foreplay.
00:12:56,00:12:58,"- That's it, that's coming first."
00:12:58,00:12:59,- It would be before matches.
00:12:59,00:13:01,It would be if they were being interviewed
00:13:01,00:13:04,"by the WWF, you know, ring announcers and so on."
00:13:04,00:13:05,"- Why would they, why would they,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,"what they would lick the heads of the people into,"
00:13:07,00:13:08,is this mid-match or is this an interview?
00:13:08,00:13:10,Just you'd lick the interviewer's head.
00:13:10,00:13:11,- They'd lick the interviewer's head.
00:13:11,00:13:13,Occasionally they'd be a mid-match lick.
00:13:13,00:13:15,If it called for it.
00:13:15,00:13:17,"My point is, is when I met them,"
00:13:17,00:13:19,I asked them to lick my head and they did.
00:13:19,00:13:19,And because--
00:13:19,00:13:21,- They licked your head?
00:13:21,00:13:21,"- Yeah, both of them."
00:13:21,00:13:22,I've got photos.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"I've got like a tongue, like really burrowing"
00:13:24,00:13:25,right next to the--
00:13:25,00:13:28,"- What, they had tongues that could burrow into your head?"
00:13:28,00:13:29,- Big-ass tongues.
00:13:29,00:13:31,Probably why they started licking heads professionally.
00:13:31,00:13:33,(laughing)
00:13:33,00:13:34,- That's amazing.
00:13:34,00:13:34,- Yeah.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"- Well, can I tell you my favorite fact I learned"
00:13:36,00:13:38,"about wrestlers, which will be of interest"
00:13:38,00:13:40,"to a very small proportion of people,"
00:13:40,00:13:41,but I'm gonna do it anyway.
00:13:41,00:13:42,- Probably done.
00:13:42,00:13:43,(laughing)
00:13:43,00:13:44,"- She may be not, right?"
00:13:44,00:13:47,"You know David Arquette, the actor who--"
00:13:47,00:13:49,- In Scream and--
00:13:49,00:13:50,"- In, well, and what?"
00:13:50,00:13:53,"It's very, very little else."
00:13:53,00:13:54,- Courtney Cox?
00:13:54,00:13:56,(laughing)
00:13:56,00:14:01,"- So, as Dan has specified, David Arquette,"
00:14:01,00:14:04,the actor famous for Scream and Courtney Cox.
00:14:04,00:14:07,"He, one of the reasons his career sort of disappeared"
00:14:07,00:14:09,is that he got really obsessed with wrestling.
00:14:09,00:14:12,So he played this character called Gordie Boggs
00:14:12,00:14:15,"in a film, a 2000 film about pro wrestling."
00:14:15,00:14:16,- Gordie Boggs?
00:14:16,00:14:18,- That Gordie Boggs.
00:14:18,00:14:18,"- Oh, sorry."
00:14:18,00:14:19,"It just sounded like Gordie Boggs,"
00:14:19,00:14:20,which sounds like Courtney Cox.
00:14:20,00:14:21,And I just wondered if--
00:14:21,00:14:22,(laughing)
00:14:22,00:14:25,- That was before or after he met Courtney Cox.
00:14:25,00:14:27,"- Well, this is after, but this is what's interesting."
00:14:27,00:14:29,"They were together, they were married at this point."
00:14:29,00:14:31,"He played this character, he got obsessed with pro wrestling."
00:14:31,00:14:34,"He was actually crowned the champion of pro wrestling,"
00:14:34,00:14:36,which was extremely controversial in the wrestling world
00:14:36,00:14:38,"'cause they were like, ""He can't even wrestle."""
00:14:38,00:14:41,But he got so into it that it became really embarrassing.
00:14:41,00:14:43,"And Courtney Cox, as I said in interviews,"
00:14:43,00:14:45,it was a lot to handle to be with David
00:14:45,00:14:46,and to see David at this point.
00:14:46,00:14:48,'Cause he suddenly got all consumed by that.
00:14:48,00:14:50,He was going to wrestling matches and being loud
00:14:50,00:14:52,"and screaming, and it was kind of insane."
00:14:52,00:14:53,I remember feeling embarrassed.
00:14:53,00:14:55,"Now, what is effing weird about that,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,is that is a plot in Friends three years
00:14:58,00:15:00,"before it happened in real life, right?"
00:15:00,00:15:00,Who remembers that plot?
00:15:00,00:15:03,"- Wait, her boyfriend, Tom Selleck,"
00:15:03,00:15:06,wants to be the ultimate fighting champion?
00:15:06,00:15:08,"- It's not Tom Selleck, thank you for that, my God."
00:15:08,00:15:10,"- It is Tom Selleck, isn't it?"
00:15:10,00:15:11,"- No, it's not Tom Selleck."
00:15:11,00:15:14,"No, he is also Monica's lover in Friends, but--"
00:15:14,00:15:16,- John Favreau?
00:15:16,00:15:17,"- Yes, it's that guy, yeah."
00:15:17,00:15:18,- Wow.
00:15:18,00:15:19,"- Anyway, how weird is that?"
00:15:19,00:15:20,"Three years before it happened,"
00:15:20,00:15:21,this happened to Monica in Friends
00:15:21,00:15:23,and then happened to Courtney Cox in real life.
00:15:23,00:15:24,"- Yeah, that is weird."
00:15:24,00:15:26,- What a roller coaster.
00:15:26,00:15:28,"But now, David Arquette, in 2018,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,decided to take up pro wrestling
00:15:29,00:15:31,'cause he wants to redeem his name
00:15:31,00:15:32,in the wrestling communities.
00:15:32,00:15:33,"- Wow, how is that a roller coaster"
00:15:33,00:15:35,if the same thing is happening?
00:15:35,00:15:36,(laughing)
00:15:36,00:15:39,"A roller coaster, you want different things to happen."
00:15:39,00:15:41,- It's a shit roller coaster.
00:15:41,00:15:42,- What a monorail.
00:15:42,00:15:45,(laughing)
00:15:45,00:15:47,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:47,00:15:50,and that is Andy.
00:15:50,00:15:52,My fact is that expert bell makers
00:15:52,00:15:54,can tell where a bell was made
00:15:54,00:15:56,just from listening to the bong.
00:15:56,00:15:58,(laughing)
00:15:58,00:16:00,"- Yeah, I mean, pretty cool."
00:16:00,00:16:02,"- Is that a useful skill, would you say?"
00:16:02,00:16:02,- Uh...
00:16:02,00:16:07,"- I mean, how often are you in a party?"
00:16:07,00:16:08,(laughing)
00:16:08,00:16:11,"And someone's got a massive church bells, I guess, right?"
00:16:11,00:16:12,"- You church bells, yeah."
00:16:12,00:16:13,"- Yeah, and someone's like,"
00:16:13,00:16:16,"hey, Andy, come over here and tell us where this is from."
00:16:16,00:16:18,"- It's a party, it's more of a party trick"
00:16:18,00:16:20,"unless you're a professional founder,"
00:16:20,00:16:22,"which is that you're right, you're absolutely right."
00:16:22,00:16:24,- How do you verify it in the moment?
00:16:24,00:16:26,"How do you, if you said that's from, you know,"
00:16:26,00:16:29,"this small foundry in-- - Not, yeah, yeah."
00:16:29,00:16:30,I don't know how you verify it.
00:16:30,00:16:32,I guess the person asking you
00:16:32,00:16:35,"where was this bell made knows, and you don't."
00:16:35,00:16:36,"- So they're being forced into the game,"
00:16:36,00:16:37,they're not just bringing it up.
00:16:37,00:16:38,- So you're telling someone something
00:16:38,00:16:41,"they already know in effect, aren't you?"
00:16:41,00:16:43,"- No, well, no, you're saying,"
00:16:43,00:16:46,"come and listen to my bell if you're a vicar, say."
00:16:46,00:16:49,"You get the founder into your church, they listen to the bell,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,"they say, oh, that was made at the White Chapel Bell Foundry,"
00:16:51,00:16:52,or whatever.
00:16:52,00:16:54,"- By the way, if a vicar ever says to you,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,"come and listen to my bell, do not go with him."
00:16:56,00:16:57,(audience laughing)
00:16:57,00:16:58,"- Oh, my God."
00:16:58,00:17:02,"Oh, dear."
00:17:02,00:17:03,"- I mean, there aren't that many places,"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"and I don't mean to belittle this,"
00:17:05,00:17:06,but there are not that many places
00:17:06,00:17:08,"a bell could have been made in this day and age, are there?"
00:17:08,00:17:09,- That's right.
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- Yeah, but we have a lot of old bells."
00:17:11,00:17:11,- There are a lot of old bells.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"- There are a lot of bells, but this is the problem."
00:17:13,00:17:14,"Okay, this is exactly the problem"
00:17:14,00:17:17,"with being a bell founder in this day and age,"
00:17:17,00:17:20,"so this is from, I should say, it's from this brilliant article,"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"it was a Guardian article long read by Hetty O'Brien,"
00:17:22,00:17:25,and it's about a place called the White Chapel Bell Foundry.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"Foundry is just a bell factory,"
00:17:27,00:17:30,"and it went out of business a few years ago,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,and it had been in business since 1570.
00:17:32,00:17:37,"Queen Elizabeth I was on the throne when this place started up,"
00:17:37,00:17:41,and it was one of the last foundries in the country
00:17:41,00:17:43,"before it shut down, and the problem is"
00:17:43,00:17:45,that bells last forever.
00:17:45,00:17:46,- Yeah.
00:17:46,00:17:47,- Because...
00:17:47,00:17:48,"- It's not like an iPhone, is it?"
00:17:48,00:17:52,"- No, that's why Steve Jobs didn't go into bell."
00:17:52,00:17:55,"He didn't come out and say, ""We know you like the iPhones,"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"""but here's our new thing, it's a 400 tonne bell."""
00:17:58,00:18:00,"Yeah, it's a real problem."
00:18:00,00:18:02,"So they made the White Chapel Bell Foundry,"
00:18:02,00:18:04,"made two bells for Westminster Abbey in 1583,"
00:18:04,00:18:07,"which are fine, they're still working."
00:18:07,00:18:08,"They don't need upgrading, they don't need changing,"
00:18:08,00:18:09,they just...
00:18:09,00:18:12,"Yeah, so bell companies have a nightmare"
00:18:12,00:18:14,if we're not on a period of active church building.
00:18:14,00:18:17,"- Except, though, except when disaster strikes."
00:18:17,00:18:21,"So if, say, like World War II happened,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"that's fantastic for the bell industry,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,"because so many churches are being destroyed,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,that suddenly they're back in business.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- I heard that they were behind the whole thing,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,"actually, the bell makers."
00:18:31,00:18:32,"- It was a big bell, wasn't it?"
00:18:32,00:18:33,"- Big bell, yeah."
00:18:33,00:18:36,- But that's the moment when they suddenly have popularity
00:18:36,00:18:37,in business because...
00:18:37,00:18:39,- That was the only time they made a profit
00:18:39,00:18:39,in the 20th century.
00:18:39,00:18:41,"The entire 20th century, the only time they made a profit"
00:18:41,00:18:43,was the years after the Second World War.
00:18:43,00:18:45,"- And then, most recently, it was only because of Downton Abbey"
00:18:45,00:18:47,being so popular with their little ding-a-ding-a-ding.
00:18:47,00:18:49,That suddenly they were back in business.
00:18:49,00:18:52,- Those are not a glamour product for them to be selling.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"- So they're in trouble, aren't they?"
00:18:54,00:18:55,"There's only one left, I think."
00:18:55,00:18:57,- A Tailors of Loughborough.
00:18:57,00:18:58,"- That's correct, yes."
00:18:58,00:19:00,"- So, wait a minute, this is even worse."
00:19:00,00:19:03,"When Addy's at his party and you say, ""Where's this bell from?"""
00:19:03,00:19:05,There's only one to choose from.
00:19:05,00:19:09,"Only if it's a new bell, you know, as in..."
00:19:09,00:19:12,- I don't know how many founders can do all 400
00:19:12,00:19:13,which closed down over the last two centuries.
00:19:13,00:19:14,Probably not.
00:19:14,00:19:16,- Imagine there used to be 400 bell factories.
00:19:16,00:19:17,"- That's a lot, yeah."
00:19:17,00:19:18,- So many.
00:19:18,00:19:22,"- I think, weirdly, Andy, if you hosted a TV quiz show"
00:19:22,00:19:25,"which was merely identifying bongs of bells,"
00:19:25,00:19:26,I think I would watch it.
00:19:26,00:19:29,I think it would actually be really great.
00:19:29,00:19:32,- How many episodes would you actually watch?
00:19:32,00:19:33,- I'm definitely watching the trailer.
00:19:33,00:19:34,- I could imagine Andy being at a party
00:19:34,00:19:36,"and someone brings out a bong and Andy goes,"
00:19:36,00:19:38,"""Oh, speaking of bongs."""
00:19:38,00:19:40,(laughing)
00:19:40,00:19:43,- It took me a while to get that joke
00:19:43,00:19:46,because I was so into bell law that you said bong
00:19:46,00:19:48,"and I thought, ""Yes, brings out a bong of a bell."""
00:19:48,00:19:49,Someone does a bong.
00:19:49,00:19:55,"- I was devastated with an article about Tailors of Loughborough,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,now the only remaining bell foundry
00:19:57,00:20:00,"because during the government shutdown,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"during the whole COVID shutdown,"
00:20:02,00:20:03,"then it was difficult for all industries,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,including the last remaining bell foundry.
00:20:05,00:20:07,And the headline in the art newspaper
00:20:07,00:20:12,"was ""Shutdown Test Metal of UK's Last Major Bell Foundry."""
00:20:12,00:20:14,And they didn't even spell metal like metal.
00:20:14,00:20:18,"They just spelled the M-E-T-L-E, like absolute chumps."
00:20:18,00:20:21,(laughing)
00:20:21,00:20:22,"Come on the art newspaper,"
00:20:22,00:20:24,that's why you're not at household name.
00:20:24,00:20:26,- Not like Peter Thornley.
00:20:26,00:20:28,- I'm Peter Thornley.
00:20:28,00:20:29,But they've just got this lottery funding.
00:20:29,00:20:33,Why are we subsidising these non-profit making institutions?
00:20:33,00:20:35,They just got 3.45 million pounds.
00:20:35,00:20:38,"- You're not gonna subsidise the profit-making companies, are you?"
00:20:38,00:20:41,- Why do you say subsidise PricewaterhouseCoopers?
00:20:41,00:20:41,(laughing)
00:20:41,00:20:44,I'd be happy about paying tax.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"- No, it is sad."
00:20:46,00:20:47,It's a sad thing that this industry
00:20:47,00:20:49,is no longer as big as it was.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"- Well, this Whitechapel place"
00:20:50,00:20:52,is completely shut down now as well.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"The Whitechapel bell foundry,"
00:20:54,00:20:57,"which, as you say, has been going since the 1500s."
00:20:57,00:21:00,And that's just happened because it looks like a hotel
00:21:00,00:21:02,"is gonna be moved in, in its place,"
00:21:02,00:21:03,a sort of hipster kind of hotel.
00:21:03,00:21:05,"And I agree, I think that is really sad."
00:21:05,00:21:06,It's a huge part.
00:21:06,00:21:07,Big Ben is from there.
00:21:07,00:21:09,The Liberty Bell is from there.
00:21:09,00:21:11,It's got huge history.
00:21:11,00:21:13,- Both of those bells have famously got massive cracks
00:21:13,00:21:14,"in them, haven't they?"
00:21:14,00:21:16,"- Yeah, they're not very good at what they do."
00:21:16,00:21:17,(laughing)
00:21:17,00:21:18,- It's amazingly lasted this long.
00:21:18,00:21:20,- It's a 400-year con making shit bells.
00:21:20,00:21:23,(laughing)
00:21:23,00:21:26,"So the Big Ben Bell, it was made in 1858,"
00:21:26,00:21:29,"and it took, so once you pour the,"
00:21:29,00:21:31,"it's molten tin and bronze, I think,"
00:21:31,00:21:32,it goes into a bell.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"Once you pour that into the cast,"
00:21:33,00:21:36,"it takes, obviously, a day or two to cool down."
00:21:36,00:21:40,"This bell was so big, it took 20 days to cool down."
00:21:40,00:21:42,It was still warm from the casting after that.
00:21:42,00:21:45,And then it was taken to Parliament on a trolley
00:21:45,00:21:47,pulled by 16 horses.
00:21:47,00:21:49,It's incredibly ceremonial.
00:21:49,00:21:52,It took 18 hours to get it from the base
00:21:52,00:21:55,to the top of the tower.
00:21:55,00:21:57,- Were they carrying it upstairs?
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Like, pivots, pivots?"
00:21:59,00:22:00,(laughing)
00:22:00,00:22:02,- I thought horses couldn't go upstairs as well.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"- They can't go upstairs, they can't go downstairs."
00:22:05,00:22:06,- They're still there.
00:22:06,00:22:08,(laughing)
00:22:08,00:22:11,- Who do you think's been dogging all the time on the bell?
00:22:11,00:22:13,(laughing)
00:22:13,00:22:18,- They did pull it up by hand.
00:22:18,00:22:18,- Amazing.
00:22:18,00:22:19,- Unbelievable.
00:22:19,00:22:20,- Wow.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"- There's always absolutely tons,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,and it was just eight men who got it from the bottom to the top.
00:22:24,00:22:26,"- But they not have made it up there,"
00:22:26,00:22:27,rather than making it in a different place
00:22:27,00:22:29,and then bringing it there.
00:22:29,00:22:32,- If only you'd been around to advise on the project.
00:22:32,00:22:33,"- It wasn't just them carrying it,"
00:22:33,00:22:35,'cause obviously it literally weighs tons.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"They had a crank and they had built,"
00:22:37,00:22:41,"and they had constructed an 1800 foot chain to attach it to,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,"and then they had a timber cradle carrying the bell,"
00:22:43,00:22:45,"and then they just had to turn this huge windlass,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"you know, around and around and around."
00:22:47,00:22:49,I've gone into excess detail.
00:22:49,00:22:49,- Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:50,- All right.
00:22:50,00:22:52,- Have you ever looking for a crank in future?
00:22:52,00:22:55,(laughing)
00:22:55,00:22:58,"When they bombed Big Ben during World War II,"
00:22:58,00:23:00,"it was a problem, wasn't it?"
00:23:00,00:23:03,"So, at first, the BBC News would be broadcast,"
00:23:03,00:23:08,"and we broadcast, the Allies broadcast BBC News in Germany,"
00:23:08,00:23:10,and it was sort of a propaganda thing
00:23:10,00:23:13,"to, you know, kind of undermine the enemy,"
00:23:13,00:23:14,"and on the hour before the news,"
00:23:14,00:23:18,"they'd always do the Big Ben bongs live,"
00:23:18,00:23:20,and then they realized it was giving away
00:23:20,00:23:21,"what the weather was like,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,because the Germans who were listening
00:23:23,00:23:25,were able to detect what the weather was like
00:23:25,00:23:26,"in London based on the sound of the bongs,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,because depending on the humidity of the air
00:23:28,00:23:29,"and depending on the temperature,"
00:23:29,00:23:31,"the bongs make a slightly different noise,"
00:23:31,00:23:34,so I think moist air will absorb kind of higher frequencies.
00:23:34,00:23:37,"- That's exactly what the bell makers want, don't they?"
00:23:37,00:23:38,"They want all the bells to be blown up,"
00:23:38,00:23:39,and they can make more.
00:23:39,00:23:43,"- Can your bong people tell that, Andy, the weather?"
00:23:43,00:23:44,- My bong people.
00:23:44,00:23:45,(laughing)
00:23:45,00:23:47,"I don't know, I don't know."
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- It wasn't, they changed it, though,"
00:23:48,00:23:50,"because they were figuring it out,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,"so then they would play,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,"the BBC started playing recorded bongs,"
00:23:54,00:23:55,so they wouldn't give away the weather.
00:23:55,00:23:58,- So they'd trick the Nazis into thinking
00:23:58,00:24:00,"the weather was perfect for a bombing raid,"
00:24:00,00:24:01,when actually it was rainy?
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- No, no, you would trick them into thinking"
00:24:03,00:24:05,it's not perfect for a bombing raid.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"You wouldn't be like, oh, it's a glorious day,"
00:24:07,00:24:10,you can see where you're going.
00:24:10,00:24:12,What a beautiful day for a bombing raid.
00:24:12,00:24:14,(laughing)
00:24:14,00:24:15,- The prime minister's in.
00:24:15,00:24:19,"- Jesus Christ, Andy."
00:24:19,00:24:20,- This is why you were fired
00:24:20,00:24:21,from Churchill's War Cabinet.
00:24:21,00:24:24,(laughing)
00:24:24,00:24:28,- Okay.
00:24:28,00:24:31,- Bells used to be really important to people in Britain.
00:24:31,00:24:33,"They would, lots of different things."
00:24:33,00:24:35,"If you were living in a village or a town,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,"really there wasn't much noise,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,"there wasn't loads of traffic noise or anything like that,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,so really the bell was the loudest noise
00:24:41,00:24:43,"that you could hear from miles and miles around,"
00:24:43,00:24:45,and it would mean lots of different things.
00:24:45,00:24:46,"It was like a kind of language of the bells,"
00:24:46,00:24:48,"so if it did certain bell rings,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"it would say you had to go into church,"
00:24:50,00:24:54,"or it might say there's a fire and you need to run away,"
00:24:54,00:24:57,"or it might be that there's been a death in the parish,"
00:24:57,00:24:58,"or there was loads of different things,"
00:24:58,00:25:00,"and it was basically, you would hear the bell"
00:25:00,00:25:03,and you would know what was happening in your town.
00:25:03,00:25:04,- That's very cool.
00:25:04,00:25:05,- Hey.
00:25:05,00:25:06,- Is it gonna be a bombing raid?
00:25:06,00:25:09,Do you do an unfortunate misunderstanding?
00:25:09,00:25:11,(laughing)
00:25:11,00:25:13,"- But then during the Reformation,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"obviously bells associated maybe with Catholicism,"
00:25:15,00:25:18,and so they kind of banned the bell.
00:25:18,00:25:18,- Wow.
00:25:18,00:25:20,- And Edward VI made a law that said
00:25:20,00:25:24,only one bell was allowed in each church.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"Okay, you allowed one bell."
00:25:26,00:25:27,"But a lot of the villagers,"
00:25:27,00:25:29,like they had such affection for their bells
00:25:29,00:25:30,"that they would bury them,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"hoping that the law would change in the future,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,and they'd be able to dig their bells back up
00:25:33,00:25:34,and then put them up.
00:25:34,00:25:36,- That's so cool.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"- And Edward VI, of course,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,"is where we get the word bell end, isn't it?"
00:25:39,00:25:40,(laughing)
00:25:40,00:25:41,"- 'Cause he ended bells, yeah."
00:25:41,00:25:42,- And they would throw him pissed off.
00:25:42,00:25:43,- Very nice.
00:25:43,00:25:46,"- That's a great, so maybe some of them are still out there,"
00:25:46,00:25:49,"you know, still in the ground."
00:25:49,00:25:49,- That's just garbage.
00:25:49,00:25:50,- Imagine that.
00:25:50,00:25:51,"If you were a metal detectorist,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,that would be the most exciting find of you.
00:25:53,00:25:54,- It's the fucking jackpot.
00:25:54,00:25:57,(laughing)
00:25:57,00:25:58,- We're gonna have to move on in this life.
00:25:58,00:26:01,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:26:01,00:26:02,- Really unprecedented move.
00:26:02,00:26:04,We're gonna have to go back to the last act
00:26:04,00:26:06,and do a more wrestling act stuff.
00:26:06,00:26:07,- Can I tell you one more thing?
00:26:07,00:26:08,- Yeah.
00:26:08,00:26:10,"- This is just a, I was looking up Guinness Records,"
00:26:10,00:26:11,and this is not about church bells.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"This is about the hotel bells, you know, the little ding,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,"you know, when you get to the, yeah, those."
00:26:16,00:26:18,Do you know what the record is
00:26:18,00:26:21,for the most desk call bells rung with the chin
00:26:21,00:26:22,inside one minute?
00:26:23,00:26:28,"- Okay, so I reckon I could do probably about 40."
00:26:28,00:26:29,- Okay.
00:26:29,00:26:31,"- No, at least one a second."
00:26:31,00:26:33,So 75. - Way more than a second.
00:26:33,00:26:35,"- That's the same bell you're doing there, Dan."
00:26:35,00:26:37,"- Yeah, you're doing, you can't ding the same bell."
00:26:37,00:26:38,"You have to have other bells, yeah."
00:26:38,00:26:39,- Right.
00:26:39,00:26:40,"- They're all different bells, yeah."
00:26:40,00:26:42,- So the concierge desk needs to be really long.
00:26:42,00:26:43,You need a--
00:26:43,00:26:44,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:26:44,00:26:47,So it's a guy called Cherry Yoshitake of Japan.
00:26:47,00:26:49,He's known as Mr. Cherry as well.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"And he, this year, he broke this record."
00:26:52,00:26:55,He dinged 149 bells with his chin in one minute.
00:26:55,00:26:56,- Wow.
00:26:56,00:26:57,- Unbelievable.
00:26:57,00:26:58,- Wow.
00:26:58,00:27:00,- It's almost like he had nothing better to do in 2020.
00:27:00,00:27:03,(laughing)
00:27:03,00:27:05,- I love that his nickname isn't even related
00:27:05,00:27:06,"to this insane thing that he,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,what else is he doing with cherries
00:27:08,00:27:09,that is far more interesting?
00:27:09,00:27:11,That's his nickname.
00:27:11,00:27:17,- Can I quickly tell you about a suffragette bell ringer?
00:27:17,00:27:17,- Oh yeah.
00:27:17,00:27:19,- This was a lady called Mary Maloney.
00:27:19,00:27:21,And when Winston Churchill was trying
00:27:21,00:27:25,"to regain his seat in parliament in Dundee in 1908,"
00:27:25,00:27:28,she wasn't very happy because he'd said some remarks
00:27:28,00:27:29,about the suffrage movement.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"And so whenever he went to any kind of speech,"
00:27:32,00:27:35,she just stood right next to him and just rang a bell.
00:27:35,00:27:36,(laughing)
00:27:36,00:27:39,"And then she'd stop and say, Mr. Churchill,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,do you want to apologize for the things she said
00:27:41,00:27:42,about the suffrage movement?
00:27:42,00:27:43,"And he said, no."
00:27:43,00:27:44,"And she went, okay."
00:27:44,00:27:46,(laughing)
00:27:46,00:27:48,And she just would follow him
00:27:48,00:27:51,and he'd kind of start getting flustered.
00:27:51,00:27:53,And then he'd leave and go in his little carriage
00:27:53,00:27:54,and she'd follow him.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"And then as soon as she got there,"
00:27:55,00:27:58,she'd start dinging again and dinging again.
00:27:58,00:28:00,And there's an article in the London Evening News
00:28:00,00:28:03,that said that Mr. Churchill struggled
00:28:03,00:28:05,good humorously against the bell.
00:28:05,00:28:08,"But he said, if she thinks that this is a reasonable argument,"
00:28:08,00:28:09,she may use it.
00:28:09,00:28:10,I don't care.
00:28:10,00:28:12,I bid you good afternoon.
00:28:12,00:28:14,And he left.
00:28:14,00:28:16,But then according to the biography of Churchill
00:28:16,00:28:18,"by Michael Sheldon, so this is a bit biased,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,"but he reckons that by the end of the week,"
00:28:19,00:28:22,everyone was so sick of this suffrage with her bell
00:28:22,00:28:24,that they all kind of got on Churchill's side
00:28:24,00:28:26,and he did win the election in the end.
00:28:26,00:28:27,- Oh. - Really?
00:28:27,00:28:29,Shot herself in the foot.
00:28:29,00:28:30,- A little bit. - Foolish woman.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"That's suffragettes, you see?"
00:28:32,00:28:32,(laughing)
00:28:32,00:28:33,Bunch of idiots.
00:28:33,00:28:35,- I don't. - That wasn't the point
00:28:35,00:28:36,of that story.
00:28:36,00:28:38,(laughing)
00:28:38,00:28:39,- Can't believe you're broadcasting
00:28:39,00:28:42,this negative shit about the suffragettes.
00:28:42,00:28:44,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:28:44,00:28:47,and that is James.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in the 1930s,"
00:28:50,00:28:53,Canada's bowling alleys had to close
00:28:53,00:28:56,on nine occasions due to strikes.
00:28:56,00:28:58,(laughing)
00:28:58,00:29:04,"- Very good, very strong."
00:29:04,00:29:07,- So this is a little bit of inside a lingo
00:29:07,00:29:08,at what happens at QI.
00:29:08,00:29:10,We call this a remote controlled fish.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"I'm not sure why we call it that,"
00:29:12,00:29:14,but basically you come up with the funny idea
00:29:14,00:29:18,of a fact first and then you try and prove it's true.
00:29:18,00:29:19,"So I thought, wouldn't it be funny"
00:29:19,00:29:22,if there'd never been a strike in a bowling alley?
00:29:22,00:29:24,And then I found this paper called
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Strikes, Bogies, Spares and Misses,"
00:29:26,00:29:29,Pinboy and Caddy Strikes in the 1930s by Ian McMillan
00:29:29,00:29:32,that talks about all these amazing strikes in Canada.
00:29:32,00:29:33,- I think it's more impressive
00:29:33,00:29:36,that you found the strikes you were looking for
00:29:36,00:29:37,'cause this was hard to research.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"If you just searched bowling alley strike,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,you don't get the industrial election
00:29:41,00:29:43,side of things very early.
00:29:43,00:29:45,So why were they striking?
00:29:45,00:29:49,- So basically these were pinboys in bowling alleys.
00:29:49,00:29:52,"So these days if you got 10 pin bowling,"
00:29:52,00:29:53,there's a machine that picks up the pins
00:29:53,00:29:54,and puts them back where they should be.
00:29:54,00:29:57,"When the olden days it would be adolescent workers,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,"young lads who would do this job,"
00:29:59,00:30:02,they would sit on a little shelf behind the bowling alley
00:30:02,00:30:04,and then once you've rolled they jump down
00:30:04,00:30:06,and then they'd shift away the ones that you knocked down
00:30:06,00:30:08,and put the other ones where they should be.
00:30:08,00:30:11,And there was this one particular moment in Saskatchewan
00:30:11,00:30:14,where they forced the pinboys to shovel snow
00:30:14,00:30:17,outside the bowling alley but wouldn't pay them.
00:30:17,00:30:18,"And when they said they wouldn't do it,"
00:30:18,00:30:19,"they fired them and they went,"
00:30:19,00:30:20,"""No, we're gonna go on strike."""
00:30:20,00:30:23,And they were helped a bit by the Communist Party in Canada
00:30:23,00:30:26,and they just continually for about a decade
00:30:26,00:30:28,just kept going on strike.
00:30:28,00:30:29,- Really? - Yeah.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"- I'm impressed because I thought that pinboys were,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,"you say adolescent, but they were young, weren't they?"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"And a lot of them, I think often who got pushed out"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"with the photos for the promo shots were young,"
00:30:38,00:30:39,but they were pretty pubescent.
00:30:39,00:30:41,And the idea of sort of a nine-year-old boy
00:30:41,00:30:44,striking through the streets is very strange.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:30:45,00:30:47,"- But yeah, they were put out of business,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,all of them eventually by the awesome machines
00:30:49,00:30:51,"you get in bowling alleys now, weren't they?"
00:30:51,00:30:53,- Let's see who's side you're on.
00:30:53,00:30:54,- The pins.
00:30:54,00:30:57,- Side of mechanization against the humble working child.
00:30:57,00:30:59,- These nine-year-old luddites
00:30:59,00:31:02,are gonna need to catch up with technology.
00:31:02,00:31:04,- Can I ask you a question about the pinboys?
00:31:04,00:31:07,"Would they, so they would go down after the first bowl"
00:31:07,00:31:09,"and the pins that were knocked down,"
00:31:09,00:31:10,they're moving out of the way.
00:31:10,00:31:11,But obviously it's very important
00:31:11,00:31:13,"that the formation remains the same as the other ones,"
00:31:13,00:31:17,"but they were popping them back into to be reset, weren't they?"
00:31:17,00:31:19,So they would have to make sure
00:31:19,00:31:22,"that they were placing them in the exact right spots, right?"
00:31:22,00:31:25,- So when you bowl once and then they get rid
00:31:25,00:31:26,of the ones on the floor and then you get a chance
00:31:26,00:31:28,"to knock the rest of them down, they stay where they are."
00:31:28,00:31:30,But then the next person would come
00:31:30,00:31:32,and they'd have to put them right in the exact place.
00:31:32,00:31:34,"But if you tips them really well,"
00:31:34,00:31:37,they might put them in a slightly better position for you.
00:31:37,00:31:41,So they kind of move the front pin a little bit closer
00:31:41,00:31:42,and move the side ones in a little bit.
00:31:42,00:31:44,"And the people who they didn't like,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,they would move them out so that they couldn't get them straight.
00:31:47,00:31:48,And then one of the trick they would do
00:31:48,00:31:50,"is as well as putting the pins up,"
00:31:50,00:31:53,they would have to roll the bowls back to the bowler.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"And what they would often do if they were really skillful,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"if there was someone they didn't like,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,they put backspin on the bowl.
00:31:59,00:32:00,So it went up towards them.
00:32:00,00:32:01,"And just before he's about to get it,"
00:32:01,00:32:05,he would spin that towards them.
00:32:05,00:32:07,- That's amazing. - That's so good.
00:32:07,00:32:10,"I wrote one thing that they did, one of their duties,"
00:32:10,00:32:13,which was if... So they put the things in a setting machine.
00:32:13,00:32:14,"So the setting machine does put the pins out,"
00:32:14,00:32:15,but they are placing them there.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"But if sometimes they didn't work these setting machines,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,"and if a pin came out wobbly,"
00:32:19,00:32:23,a pin boy would have to wriggle out onto the lane on his stomach
00:32:23,00:32:25,and position it properly
00:32:25,00:32:28,and just hope that they had seen at the other end
00:32:28,00:32:30,that there was a wonky pin that was being fixed.
00:32:30,00:32:32,And so you might get a ball chucked at you
00:32:32,00:32:33,if they didn't see that.
00:32:33,00:32:35,"If your reactions aren't fast enough,"
00:32:35,00:32:37,"at pubescent or pre-pubescent age,"
00:32:37,00:32:40,to avoid a bowling ball been chucked by some millionaire.
00:32:40,00:32:43,And we have ascertained which side of the argument you are on.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"I'm going to say, me slagging off the suffragettes,"
00:32:45,00:32:47,"he's looking a lot better, isn't he?"
00:32:47,00:32:51,"The guy who invented the pin setting machine,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"which put all these boys out of business,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,was he did it in 1936.
00:32:55,00:32:57,And the first pin setting machine
00:32:57,00:32:59,was made of lampshades and flower pots.
00:32:59,00:33:03,"- Oh, wow. - And in a turkey house on his mate's farm,"
00:33:03,00:33:06,there's a guy called Gottfried Schmidt.
00:33:06,00:33:09,"And he'd heard about what hassle it was having these pin setters,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,because it takes a long time having a little boy
00:33:11,00:33:13,kind of rearrange all your pins.
00:33:13,00:33:17,"So, yeah, he cobbled some lampshades and flower pots together."
00:33:17,00:33:19,"If you're laughing at that, then that's the problem with you."
00:33:19,00:33:26,"I was like, ""There must be a euphemism in there somewhere."""
00:33:26,00:33:28,"People desperately looking, laughed prematurely."
00:33:28,00:33:31,"I thought, ""I don't think there is, actually."""
00:33:31,00:33:35,"Hey, did you guys know this is just a quick modern bowling thing"
00:33:35,00:33:36,that I didn't realise?
00:33:36,00:33:39,"I enjoy bowling, and I do love getting the shoes,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,putting the shoes on. It's always a fun element of it.
00:33:41,00:33:44,"- Sure. - I didn't realise,"
00:33:44,00:33:45,and I wonder how many people here did...
00:33:45,00:33:47,"I do love it, James, don't laugh at it."
00:33:47,00:33:48,"I mean, I've been bowling with you."
00:33:48,00:33:50,I can see that that would be your best bet.
00:33:50,00:33:53,My 30th birthday.
00:33:53,00:33:57,"My 30th birthday, I had a bowling party."
00:33:57,00:34:00,James came and murdered me.
00:34:00,00:34:03,"Murdered me in front of all my closest friends and family,"
00:34:03,00:34:05,who had not met him at this point.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"So, they didn't know what a twat I was."
00:34:07,00:34:10,I didn't know you had a bowling party for your birthday.
00:34:10,00:34:16,"I remember you working, putting the pins up."
00:34:16,00:34:20,"- Quick, he's on his belly. Get him. - Quick, he's on his belly. Get him."
00:34:20,00:34:24,"Thank you for that tip, James. It was extremely nicely..."
00:34:24,00:34:27,"- Well, bowling shoes... - Do you realise this?"
00:34:27,00:34:30,"- When you're out with your friends... - When I'm out with my best buds, sure."
00:34:30,00:34:35,They come as either left-handed bowling shoes or right-handed bowling shoes.
00:34:35,00:34:37,- What? - Yes.
00:34:37,00:34:38,- How does that work? - Well...
00:34:38,00:34:41,"Wait, I was saying there's one left for the left foot and one for the right foot."
00:34:41,00:34:42,"- Yeah, okay. - Like shoes?"
00:34:42,00:34:44,- 'Cause... - Yeah!
00:34:44,00:34:46,"- Oh, boy. - No, what it is..."
00:34:46,00:34:49,"If you haven't seen Don Tribe's amazing square normal shoes,"
00:34:49,00:34:51,they are a sight to behold.
00:34:51,00:34:54,- What are you talking about? - That's my TV show.
00:34:54,00:34:57,- What will they think of next? - Check this out.
00:34:57,00:34:59,"No, okay, so this is really interesting."
00:34:59,00:35:02,"And obviously, if you go to a normal bowling alley,"
00:35:02,00:35:05,"they probably give you normal shoes, which probably hurts your game,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,is what I'm guessing.
00:35:07,00:35:10,"If you're a professional, you're right-handed or you're left-handed."
00:35:10,00:35:13,"If you have a dominant leg, you have a dominant foot, that's going right."
00:35:13,00:35:17,"So, one shoe of every bowling shoe has a sliding element to it,"
00:35:17,00:35:19,"and the other has a breaking element,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,so that your back foot can break while your front is sliding.
00:35:21,00:35:24,"- Wow, how interesting. - Yeah, so if you're bowling right-handed,"
00:35:24,00:35:26,you need the slidey bit to be on your left foot.
00:35:26,00:35:29,"And so, do you think you were maybe given some left-handed bowling shoes by accident,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,and that's why you lost embarrassingly to James Arkin?
00:35:31,00:35:34,"Just if my family and friends are listening, yes, I believe,"
00:35:34,00:35:36,there was a conspiracy that night.
00:35:36,00:35:39,"It's illegal to switch hands bowling, as well."
00:35:39,00:35:43,"- Oh, shit, I think I did that. - You did it so many times!"
00:35:43,00:35:45,- Switch hands. - No.
00:35:45,00:35:49,"- I genuinely did. - Well, you are post-hoc disqualified."
00:35:49,00:35:51,"- That is not allowed. - So sorry, bowling won't..."
00:35:51,00:35:54,"- Screw you, Arkin! - Oh, God!"
00:35:54,00:35:57,(APPLAUSE)
00:35:57,00:35:59,Yes!
00:35:59,00:36:03,"This is exciting, 'cause this has actually come up quite a lot over the years."
00:36:03,00:36:05,"Yeah, you're not allowed to, 'cause you might be sandbagging."
00:36:05,00:36:06,Is that what you were doing? Were you sandbagging?
00:36:06,00:36:08,- I don't know what that means. - What's sandbagging?
00:36:08,00:36:10,- You were sandbagging. - I don't even want to do the rest of this podcast.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"- It means cheating. - It means cheating, Andy."
00:36:12,00:36:14,"Sandbagging is when, in professional tournaments,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"this is why they ban in professional tournaments,"
00:36:16,00:36:19,"then you will try and get a better handicap by bowling with your other hand,"
00:36:19,00:36:22,"'cause it's quite hard to bowl badly, deliberately,"
00:36:22,00:36:25,but without it being noticed with the hand that you're strongest with.
00:36:25,00:36:28,"So if you bowl with your other hand, which some people often do,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,then it tricks people into giving you a better handicap.
00:36:30,00:36:32,- It's like being a hustler. - I see.
00:36:32,00:36:34,"- I wasn't doing that, but... - Wow."
00:36:34,00:36:36,"You look like a sandbagger to me, Jim."
00:36:36,00:36:39,And that was a euphemism.
00:36:39,00:36:45,I've got a fact about the first bowling alley opened in the UK.
00:36:45,00:36:49,"OK, so the first bowling alley in the classic American style that we think of"
00:36:49,00:36:52,opened in Stamford Hill in North London in 1961.
00:36:52,00:36:55,It was opened by the American Machine and Foundry Company.
00:36:55,00:36:57,"Oh, I've just seen Foundry again. Nice."
00:36:57,00:37:03,"- Anyway, that's not what it's about. Don't worry. - Take him off stage."
00:37:03,00:37:07,"But they, that company, they also made the underground launching system"
00:37:07,00:37:09,for the Titan Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.
00:37:09,00:37:13,"- Oh, my God. - But this is the sort of conspiracy I thought of,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,because there's a bowling alley under the White House. We know this.
00:37:15,00:37:16,"- Yeah, there is. - Yeah."
00:37:16,00:37:20,So is it possibly connected to the Intercontinental Ballistic...
00:37:20,00:37:22,Do you think they accidentally ordered the wrong product
00:37:22,00:37:25,from the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile providers?
00:37:25,00:37:28,"And they were too embarrassed to say, ""No, take it back."""
00:37:28,00:37:32,"Yeah, the vice president of the company that made a lot of very dangerous weapons,"
00:37:32,00:37:37,"a very dangerous time in history, said that the company's product"
00:37:37,00:37:40,will make a great contribution to human happiness.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"And there was such a good Guardian article on this, which you might have read,"
00:37:42,00:37:46,"which was, ""Careful to specify, they meant the bowling alley"
00:37:46,00:37:48,"and not the missile launcher."""
00:37:48,00:37:52,"And at that event, the first person to bowl the first bowl,"
00:37:52,00:37:54,"so the first bowl ever bowled at bowling alley in Britain,"
00:37:54,00:37:58,"was a guy called Sir John Hunt, who led the British expedition up Everest."
00:37:58,00:38:00,"And it's worth watching the footage, because he does, of course,"
00:38:00,00:38:02,bowl it straight into the gutter.
00:38:02,00:38:08,"- It's very awkward. - What an amazing, strange celebrity booking"
00:38:08,00:38:10,to open your bowling alley.
00:38:10,00:38:14,"- I know. Who else would you get, like... - Princess Margaret?"
00:38:15,00:38:19,- That's... He went straight for Princess Margaret. - I think Aim High.
00:38:19,00:38:22,Do you think Princess Margaret would have used...
00:38:22,00:38:24,She would have used that thing where you pushed the bowl down
00:38:24,00:38:27,"on the little skeleton thing, wouldn't she?"
00:38:27,00:38:30,"- There's no shame in using that, by the way. - The bumpers."
00:38:30,00:38:33,"The bumpers, designed for kids, right? That was the invention."
00:38:33,00:38:37,The bumpers are designed for anyone who wants a more...
00:38:37,00:38:39,"Actually, a more interesting style of gameplay."
00:38:39,00:38:41,Good point.
00:38:41,00:38:44,It takes quite a skill to bounce it off three times and then...
00:38:44,00:38:47,"- And then still end up in the gutter. - Yes, actually."
00:38:47,00:38:50,"And that's why you weren't at the 30th birthday party, Andy."
00:38:50,00:38:53,"So, you know, that's designed for kids."
00:38:53,00:38:57,"And I was amazed to learn that there's this club, which is the three..."
00:38:57,00:38:59,"I'm giving it its name as a club, the 300 Club,"
00:38:59,00:39:04,but the idea is a perfect game in bowling is 300 points.
00:39:04,00:39:08,"So you want all strikes, and that means nine strikes for the first nine."
00:39:08,00:39:11,"And then on the 10th, you need three, because you get those extra goes."
00:39:11,00:39:14,So it adds up to 300 points that you get in total.
00:39:14,00:39:17,And the record holder of the youngest person ever to get that
00:39:17,00:39:20,is a nine-year-old girl at the time in 2013.
00:39:20,00:39:23,She's still the record holder called Hannah Deem.
00:39:23,00:39:27,"And she took up the sport at age six when she was at a party,"
00:39:27,00:39:30,"and she was like, ""Oh, I felt like this was a calling."""
00:39:30,00:39:37,"And by age nine, she had bowled a perfect game, 300, strikes the whole way."
00:39:37,00:39:40,And so you get a ring when that happens.
00:39:40,00:39:44,"And if you bowl more, they add like a little rock to it each time and so on."
00:39:44,00:39:47,"But they're very serious about whether or not to take it,"
00:39:47,00:39:49,the fact that you've said you've got a 300.
00:39:49,00:39:52,"There's a team that comes in, and in the early days,"
00:39:52,00:39:55,they would confiscate the ball off you to suss out the ball
00:39:55,00:39:59,just to make sure that it was a proper ball that hadn't been cheated.
00:39:59,00:40:03,"At the end of that day, they would shut down the bowling alley,"
00:40:03,00:40:05,"let no more games come, and someone would come,"
00:40:05,00:40:10,and they would have a way of measuring the oil slickness of the lane
00:40:10,00:40:12,just to make sure that it wasn't too...
00:40:12,00:40:14,I want to talk that you haven't rigged it by and poured...
00:40:14,00:40:15,"Yeah, there's all these things that they did."
00:40:15,00:40:18,So was she cheating? Had she poured mercury into her ball?
00:40:18,00:40:19,Had she covered the thing with oil?
00:40:19,00:40:21,She was clean. She was clean.
00:40:21,00:40:22,"Go on, Hannah."
00:40:22,00:40:23,"Go on, Hannah, you're all going to get enough mercury."
00:40:23,00:40:25,(LAUGHTER)
00:40:25,00:40:30,"Since they stopped selling barometers and mercury thermometers,"
00:40:30,00:40:32,it's very hard to get your hands on enough mercury.
00:40:32,00:40:34,"It's a bold move to make a call back to an episode,"
00:40:34,00:40:37,"like 12 episodes ago, to a live crowd."
00:40:37,00:40:41,I thought there'd be one or two perometer fans.
00:40:41,00:40:42,Cool.
00:40:42,00:40:45,"You mentioned the oil, so I didn't know how crucial oil is in bowling,"
00:40:45,00:40:50,"but this basically answered a question that's been bugging me for 20 years,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,"which is, you know, when you go to a bowling alley with friends,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,and you get kind of a...
00:40:54,00:40:56,"Like, if you're on a good roll, you get a bunch of strikes,"
00:40:56,00:40:59,"your friend gets loads of strikes, you think, ""This is so effing easy."
00:40:59,00:41:02,How are there professionals in this game?
00:41:02,00:41:03,"They must be getting strikes every time,"
00:41:03,00:41:05,"otherwise they're just idiots."""
00:41:05,00:41:08,"Well, turns out their game is way harder than ours."
00:41:08,00:41:09,"So, in recreational bowling,"
00:41:09,00:41:12,"if you're going to Rowan's bowling alley down the road or wherever,"
00:41:12,00:41:15,then they have the oil arranged in a certain way.
00:41:15,00:41:19,"So, down a bowling lane, it has oil on it,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,and it originally had oil on it to make it more slippy
00:41:21,00:41:24,so that the balls didn't crack the ground.
00:41:24,00:41:27,"But it became apparent that oil obviously adjusts the way the ball goes,"
00:41:27,00:41:32,"so if there's oil down the middle, the ball slides very fast down that oil,"
00:41:32,00:41:34,"and then as soon as it goes off the oil,"
00:41:34,00:41:36,"so there's not as much oil nearer the pins,"
00:41:36,00:41:39,"then it starts going more slowly and friction acts more on the ball,"
00:41:39,00:41:41,"and it starts to spin, things like that."
00:41:41,00:41:44,"So, bowling alleys for plebs like you and me"
00:41:44,00:41:48,have the oil rigged so that it funnels the ball towards the pins.
00:41:48,00:41:51,"- Oh, wow. - And that's why we're all getting strikes."
00:41:51,00:41:55,"And if you go to a professional bowlers association bowling alley,"
00:41:55,00:41:56,they do not have that.
00:41:56,00:41:59,"They make sure that the oil is spread exactly evenly,"
00:41:59,00:42:01,"and I think if any of us tried to bowl down one of those,"
00:42:01,00:42:03,it would just be straight in the gutter every time.
00:42:03,00:42:04,- Really? - Wow.
00:42:04,00:42:10,Is it possible that I've spent my life accidentally going to professional bowling alleys?
00:42:10,00:42:12,"Do you think in those professional bowling alleys,"
00:42:12,00:42:15,they would put the tubes on the side?
00:42:15,00:42:17,I guess it's possible.
00:42:17,00:42:20,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:42:20,00:42:21,and that is my fact.
00:42:21,00:42:25,My fact this week is trees fart.
00:42:25,00:42:28,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:28,00:42:29,Trees fart.
00:42:29,00:42:31,"- It turns out... - Come on, Dan."
00:42:31,00:42:33,- Trees fart. - How often have you been on a lovely walk
00:42:33,00:42:37,in the forest and just hearing farts?
00:42:37,00:42:40,"Well, the thing is, if a tree farts in the forest,"
00:42:40,00:42:43,but there's no one around to smell it...
00:42:43,00:42:47,(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
00:42:47,00:42:50,"So, this is, I mean, it's a real technical thing, isn't it,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,"in this case, because obviously they don't have anuses,"
00:42:52,00:42:54,but they do.
00:42:54,00:42:55,"Slow down, Professor."
00:42:55,00:42:57,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:57,00:43:00,"Trees do release little bits of methane,"
00:43:00,00:43:03,and that's obviously a big problem for global warming.
00:43:03,00:43:06,And the article that I was reading was talking...
00:43:06,00:43:08,This is how I learned the fact. It was in Science Alert.
00:43:08,00:43:10,It talks about ghost trees.
00:43:10,00:43:13,"Ghost trees are trees that are dead,"
00:43:13,00:43:17,"and they still function, though, in certain areas,"
00:43:17,00:43:20,"so they can suck up soils and so on through them,"
00:43:20,00:43:22,"acting like a straw, and as a result,"
00:43:22,00:43:25,"ghost trees release sort of much bigger farts,"
00:43:25,00:43:27,and they're much more dangerous.
00:43:27,00:43:30,"But the thing is, like, a normal tree farts"
00:43:30,00:43:33,"or gives off methane, but it also kind of sucks in CO2"
00:43:33,00:43:35,"and photosynthesises and stuff, so it's kind of fine,"
00:43:35,00:43:37,because it offsets it.
00:43:37,00:43:39,"But the ghost trees, they don't have any leaves,"
00:43:39,00:43:41,"so they can't do it, so it's much worse."
00:43:41,00:43:44,"These kind of dead trees that you get in marshes and stuff like that,"
00:43:44,00:43:45,and they suck up this methane.
00:43:45,00:43:48,"We think from the soil, although we're not quite sure"
00:43:48,00:43:50,how they do it at the moment.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"This recent study that was in the article,"
00:43:52,00:43:55,they found that the amount of methane that comes up
00:43:55,00:43:56,is way more than you would expect
00:43:56,00:43:58,"due to the amount that's in the ground,"
00:43:58,00:43:59,and so there's something else happening.
00:43:59,00:44:01,"We don't know what it is, and obviously it's quite important,"
00:44:01,00:44:03,because lots more trees are dying
00:44:03,00:44:06,"because the change is in the climate and stuff,"
00:44:06,00:44:08,and this might cause problems in the future.
00:44:08,00:44:12,"Yeah, and I think is it that when water or when sea levels rise,"
00:44:12,00:44:14,"sometimes you get forests near the coast,"
00:44:14,00:44:15,"which can't survive in those conditions,"
00:44:15,00:44:17,so that adds to the effect as well.
00:44:17,00:44:19,"So the sea comes in, it's more salty,"
00:44:19,00:44:22,"the trees die, and then they start doing all this farting."
00:44:22,00:44:25,"Yeah, and I think we should say that,"
00:44:25,00:44:27,because every single article and every single scientist
00:44:27,00:44:31,"who looks into this says about 59 times an article, don't they?"
00:44:31,00:44:33,We are not trying to say that trees are bad.
00:44:33,00:44:36,The overall impact of trees is still incredibly good.
00:44:36,00:44:38,"Please, God, Daily Mail, don't print an article"
00:44:38,00:44:40,saying that trees are bad for the environment.
00:44:40,00:44:42,They've got to go. That's what they're screaming at.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"They've got to go. People of Kentish Town,"
00:44:44,00:44:47,please do not go straight out to your nearest tree
00:44:47,00:44:49,and chop it down. That's not what we're saying.
00:44:49,00:44:51,You take those farting fucks out.
00:44:51,00:44:54,"Don't, please! I'm begging you."
00:44:54,00:44:58,"The whole methane thing is really interesting,"
00:44:58,00:44:59,"just sort of globally the methane thing,"
00:44:59,00:45:02,"because there is the American NOAA,"
00:45:02,00:45:06,"who are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Scientists,"
00:45:06,00:45:09,"they are in Colorado, and they are methane detectives."
00:45:09,00:45:11,They have a department which is methane detection.
00:45:11,00:45:14,"So for the last 40 years, every single week,"
00:45:14,00:45:18,"they have received this consignment of flasks from around the world,"
00:45:18,00:45:22,"which are flasks of atmospheric air from all over the planet,"
00:45:22,00:45:23,and they measure what's inside.
00:45:23,00:45:25,So they have been able to measure methane levels
00:45:25,00:45:27,"around the planet for the last 40 years,"
00:45:27,00:45:31,and they've been just studying atmospheric levels.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"They've found that methane has been rising since 2007,"
00:45:33,00:45:35,and no one really knows why.
00:45:35,00:45:39,"I mean, it's our fault, clearly, but no one really..."
00:45:39,00:45:40,They haven't pinned down exactly why.
00:45:40,00:45:43,"It could be from wetlands, it could be this tree thing,"
00:45:43,00:45:47,"pig manure causes it, so, like, cattle cause a huge amount of it."
00:45:47,00:45:50,"I'm not trying to pass blame, because I'm sure it is our fault,"
00:45:50,00:45:52,but is there any chance it's Beaver's fault?
00:45:52,00:45:55,Because Beaver's are apparently an issue.
00:45:55,00:45:57,I thought you said Beaver.
00:45:57,00:46:00,I thought you were talking about it.
00:46:00,00:46:03,He gets private jets everywhere.
00:46:03,00:46:08,"Beaver's, they're invading Alaska because waters are warming,"
00:46:08,00:46:11,"which means they can go much further north up into the Arctic Circle,"
00:46:11,00:46:14,and so they're building lots of dams up in an area
00:46:14,00:46:16,"that used to be frozen or extremely cold,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,"and then their dams are, like, big heat reservoirs"
00:46:18,00:46:22,"which warm up the surrounding soil, degrade the permafrost,"
00:46:22,00:46:24,"and there's loads of methane in the permafrost,"
00:46:24,00:46:26,"it's a massive problem methane being released from the permafrost,"
00:46:26,00:46:29,and so that puts methane in the atmosphere.
00:46:29,00:46:32,"Beaver's fault, I'm not responsible."
00:46:32,00:46:34,So what we're saying to the people of Kentish Town
00:46:34,00:46:36,is to go out and strangle a beaver.
00:46:36,00:46:37,Yeah.
00:46:37,00:46:40,"Go down a tree and strangle a beaver, yeah."
00:46:40,00:46:42,I think that's responsible messaging.
00:46:42,00:46:45,There was a problem with animals and methane.
00:46:45,00:46:48,"Specifically, our old friends, the sauropods,"
00:46:48,00:46:51,"the big dinosaurs that had lots of plant material,"
00:46:51,00:46:53,there was some work done by David Wilkinson
00:46:53,00:46:55,"of Liverpool John Moors University,"
00:46:55,00:46:57,"and he reckons, he's worked this out,"
00:46:57,00:47:00,"he reckoned that sauropod population,"
00:47:00,00:47:02,"when they were at the absolute biggest,"
00:47:02,00:47:07,"they were pumping out 520 million tonnes of methane a year,"
00:47:07,00:47:11,which is about the same as the current emissions of greenhouse gases.
00:47:11,00:47:12,Really?
00:47:12,00:47:16,"Yeah, so the sauropods, and they reckon that that did change the climate"
00:47:16,00:47:17,as well through farting.
00:47:17,00:47:18,Wow.
00:47:18,00:47:22,So did the sauropod Green Party eventually get some steam behind it
00:47:22,00:47:23,and take power?
00:47:23,00:47:26,"Eventually, someone stuck their neck out, you know."
00:47:26,00:47:29,"Yeah, we first discovered that methane were in trees,"
00:47:29,00:47:32,"was in trees, in 1907."
00:47:32,00:47:35,"And it was this professor, a chemistry professor in Kansas,"
00:47:35,00:47:37,"wandering around Kansas in 1907,"
00:47:37,00:47:41,"and he saw little bubbles in the sap of a tree,"
00:47:41,00:47:43,"a certain type of tree,"
00:47:43,00:47:45,"and he thought, I wonder what's causing them,"
00:47:45,00:47:48,"I wonder if it's methane, so he struck a match above it,"
00:47:48,00:47:51,and it ignited and burped out.
00:47:51,00:47:54,So he basically lit the fart of the tree.
00:47:54,00:47:55,"He lit the fart of the tree,"
00:47:55,00:47:58,"and apparently, if you're studying trees anywhere,"
00:47:58,00:48:01,"your tree professor will always do this, and you can do this."
00:48:01,00:48:03,"You go through a tree, and you get the sap,"
00:48:03,00:48:06,"and it's burping out methane, so you can light it,"
00:48:06,00:48:07,and it does a little burp.
00:48:07,00:48:10,"Don't, like, if you're in Australia, please don't do that."
00:48:10,00:48:13,That's Jesus Christ.
00:48:13,00:48:18,This podcast is going to cause bushfires globally from that sentence.
00:48:18,00:48:20,"Once you've finished strangling your beaver,"
00:48:20,00:48:25,"just set fire to the nearest tree, and science will win."
00:48:25,00:48:26,Here's a warning. Here's another warning.
00:48:26,00:48:32,"If you hold a fart in for too long, it may leak out of your mouth."
00:48:32,00:48:34,"It's got to go somewhere, isn't it?"
00:48:34,00:48:35,Exactly.
00:48:35,00:48:38,"It's basically, it gets reabsorbed into your circulation,"
00:48:38,00:48:40,"just finds its way in, and whether you notice or not,"
00:48:40,00:48:42,it's just going to slowly come out of your mouth.
00:48:42,00:48:45,It does... That sounds...
00:48:45,00:48:46,"Everything you're saying sounds true,"
00:48:46,00:48:49,"but it does sound like one of those things that your mum says, doesn't it?"
00:48:49,00:48:51,"Well, if you keep your face like that, the wind will change,"
00:48:51,00:48:53,"and it'll get stuck, you know, or whatever."
00:48:53,00:48:56,"It sounds like a sort of old, white tail of..."
00:48:56,00:48:58,"Your mum has got some amazing sayings, Andy."
00:48:58,00:49:01,What do you mean?
00:49:01,00:49:02,"Have you farted enough today, Andy?"
00:49:02,00:49:05,Because you know what will happen.
00:49:05,00:49:07,But how come they don't smell like sulfur?
00:49:07,00:49:10,"Because the reason fart smell is because of sulfur,"
00:49:10,00:49:11,which is in compounds that smell bad.
00:49:11,00:49:14,"But when I burp, it doesn't smell like a fart, I don't think."
00:49:14,00:49:16,"And I've never smelled anyone's burp smelling like a fart,"
00:49:16,00:49:17,like a sulfuric fart.
00:49:17,00:49:18,"No, I agree, yeah."
00:49:18,00:49:20,So something must have happened there.
00:49:20,00:49:23,"It must... Maybe the sulfur is like only the arse,"
00:49:23,00:49:27,but the other ones will come out of the mouth.
00:49:27,00:49:28,Maybe.
00:49:28,00:49:30,(LAUGHTER)
00:49:30,00:49:31,Hmm.
00:49:31,00:49:33,(LAUGHTER)
00:49:33,00:49:35,You've really given us something to think about there.
00:49:35,00:49:37,(LAUGHTER)
00:49:37,00:49:41,"You'd be great on sulfur the day, right here."
00:49:41,00:49:43,Welcome to the moral maze on BBC Four.
00:49:43,00:49:44,(LAUGHTER)
00:49:44,00:49:46,Why does sulfur choose the anus?
00:49:46,00:49:49,(LAUGHTER)
00:49:49,00:49:50,"Methane chooses the mouth, doesn't it?"
00:49:50,00:49:55,"As in, for cows, I thought that cow's methane was sort of"
00:49:55,00:49:57,"mostly like a split at each end of the cow,"
00:49:57,00:49:58,"whether it's burping or farting, whatever."
00:49:58,00:50:03,"About, I think it's 95% of cattle methane comes from its mouth."
00:50:03,00:50:04,And this is...
00:50:04,00:50:05,"This really is a genuinely huge problem,"
00:50:05,00:50:09,"because there are, I think, about a billion cows on the planet."
00:50:09,00:50:12,"If they were a country, they'd be the sixth largest emitter of methane"
00:50:12,00:50:13,in the world.
00:50:13,00:50:14,What a country.
00:50:14,00:50:15,(LAUGHTER)
00:50:15,00:50:20,"In this country that's just cows, are they also running the place and stuff?"
00:50:20,00:50:22,"Do they have their own cow, their own minister and stuff?"
00:50:22,00:50:23,Yeah.
00:50:23,00:50:27,"Yeah, in this whimsical world, there's a kind of..."
00:50:27,00:50:29,"Andy, in that, if that was a country..."
00:50:29,00:50:30,Yeah.
00:50:30,00:50:31,Is this a genuine question?
00:50:31,00:50:32,Yes.
00:50:32,00:50:35,"If it was that dense of cows, like it's a country made of cows,"
00:50:35,00:50:37,"as you're saying, so the methane's huge."
00:50:37,00:50:42,"If I lit a cigarette lighter, would the whole thing go up?"
00:50:42,00:50:43,I don't know.
00:50:43,00:50:45,"No, I don't think so."
00:50:45,00:50:47,It doesn't if you do it in the middle of a cow field.
00:50:47,00:50:48,It doesn't even if you do it.
00:50:48,00:50:50,This is a country made of cows.
00:50:50,00:50:51,"No, no."
00:50:51,00:50:52,"A, it's not made of cows."
00:50:52,00:50:53,That's what Andy's saying.
00:50:53,00:50:54,There are loads of cows in it.
00:50:54,00:50:55,There are only cows in it.
00:50:55,00:50:56,It's a cow...
00:50:56,00:50:57,It depends how many there are.
00:50:57,00:51:01,"If there is a billion cows and it's in the size of San Marino,"
00:51:01,00:51:03,then that's a lot of cows and a lot of methane.
00:51:03,00:51:06,"But if you're in the size of the Soviet Union, the old style,"
00:51:06,00:51:07,then they'd be fine.
00:51:07,00:51:08,That's not my mistake.
00:51:08,00:51:11,"If there are a billion cows in a country the size of San Marino,"
00:51:11,00:51:15,there are bigger infrastructural problems to deal with.
00:51:15,00:51:18,How are the Italians keeping them out?
00:51:18,00:51:24,It's one very big cattle grid and they just can't get over it.
00:51:24,00:51:27,"But yeah, of course, it depends how much methane you have,"
00:51:27,00:51:29,"but also how much oxygen you have, right?"
00:51:29,00:51:32,So the methane will only set on fire if you have oxygen
00:51:32,00:51:34,because you need oxygen to make fire.
00:51:34,00:51:38,"And that's the thing that on Uranus, there's a lot of methane."
00:51:38,00:51:41,The whole of the atmosphere is made of methane pretty much.
00:51:41,00:51:42,There's tons and tons of the stuff.
00:51:42,00:51:45,But you can't set it on fire because there's no oxygen.
00:51:45,00:51:48,But what that means is if you had a spaceship
00:51:48,00:51:52,"and you went into the Uranus atmosphere,"
00:51:52,00:51:55,you would need the oxygen there because you would have to breathe it.
00:51:55,00:51:58,"As soon as you open the door, any kind of turn on the light switch"
00:51:58,00:52:01,"or any kind of naked flame, the whole place is going up."
00:52:01,00:52:03,And it's like a reverse Hindenburg.
00:52:03,00:52:06,"So like the Hindenburg had the flammable gas on the inside,"
00:52:06,00:52:10,"but you've got the oxygen on the inside and it would just go, ""Wow."""
00:52:10,00:52:14,"I thought that was very adult of you all, not to laugh every time."
00:52:14,00:52:16,James said Uranus.
00:52:16,00:52:20,Very proud of you all.
00:52:20,00:52:22,I wasn't planning on going there.
00:52:22,00:52:24,It's another good reason not to.
00:52:24,00:52:28,"It is on the government green list, though, if anyone's interested."
00:52:32,00:52:34,"OK, that is it. That is all of our facts."
00:52:34,00:52:36,Thank you so much for listening.
00:52:36,00:52:38,If you would... Thank you.
