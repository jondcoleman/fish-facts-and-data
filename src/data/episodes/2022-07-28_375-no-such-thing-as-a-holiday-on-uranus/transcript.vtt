00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.000
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.880
 and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.240
 this week coming to you live

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.000
 from the O2 Forum in Kentish Town.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.160
 (audience cheering)

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.560
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.720
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.440
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.320
 - My fact this week is that one of the main villains

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.400
 in China's equivalent of WWE is Steve,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.600
 the English as a second language teacher.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.120
 (audience laughing)

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.680
 - That is terrifying.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.600
 - It's a frightening concept for a lot of Chinese people

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.520
 trying to learn English.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.320
 I think it's quite a small outfit compared to WWE,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 which you may remember as WWF,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.040
 but of course it's not allowed to be called that anymore

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 'cause the Wildlife Fund got that name.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 - Yes, absolutely.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.740
 - And that was it, wasn't it?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.200
 - It was a big fight with Hulk Hogan and the panda.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.000
 (audience laughing)

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.080
 - Bizarrely the panda won that one.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 So this is Middle Kingdom Wrestling, MKE,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.800
 which is the very nascent Chinese pro wrestling organization

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.480
 that was started in 2015.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.120
 And yeah, it's got some imaginative evil dudes.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.160
 So Steve, the English as a second language teacher,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.600
 he brings exam textbooks into the ring.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.080
 - Oh, that's so cool.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.200
 - Does he like hit them with it?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.040
 Us, he must be right.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.200
 - I think he does a bit, yes he does.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.040
 - Does he?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.880
 - I thought he did.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.720
 - He probably does.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.200
 I was imagining he just opened it up in front of them

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.560
 and said, "Answer these questions."

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.000
 (audience laughing)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.840
 - I don't know.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.520
 - I read the article that you sent round about this, Anna,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.360
 I read something, it was in sixth tone, I think,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.200
 was the website.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.040
 - Yes, yeah.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.960
 - And it said, "Burger, burger,"

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.160
 repeats the English language instructor,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.840
 showing a picture of a hamburger to his opponent.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 (audience laughing)

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.520
 And then the commentator says,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.000
 "Cowardly attack here by Steve, the ESL teacher,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.960
 "letting issues from his personal life

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.200
 "creep into the business life again."

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.520
 (audience laughing)

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.680
 - Yeah, his wife cheated on him with a hamburger.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680
 (audience laughing)

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.520
 Very awkward.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.200
 - But they do, I mean, it is like WWE,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.720
 used to be WWF, you know, amazing characters.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.360
 They've got the bamboo crusher,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.440
 who's a guy who comes out with sort of,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.080
 it's basically, he's meant to be a panda

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.560
 and he's just got two black marks around his eyes, yeah.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.160
 - There's another character who is the curry kid

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
 and he wears a devil mask, quite scary.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.800
 And then on his head, there's a,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.080
 I thought it was a weird looking hat.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.120
 And I zoomed right in and it's a paper plate

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.560
 with rice on top.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.600
 (audience laughing)

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.680
 I don't know if it's real rice

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 and it's like finishing school,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.800
 you have to balance it on your head

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 the whole way through.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.640
 - Wow.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.480
 - But that was him.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.320
 - That's amazing.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.200
 - There's Queen Marie, who just wears a crown.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.600
 She's the only lady.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.520
 And there's Buffer Daboonbox.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.520
 No, sorry, Buffer and Daboonbox,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.240
 who carries a boombox.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.080
 - Wow.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.920
 - It's a great cast character.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.120
 - He's Buffer.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.360
 - He's Buffer.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.200
 - And Daboonbox.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.360
 - And Daboonbox, it's his sidekick, yeah.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.440
 - You said there was only one female wrestler there,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.840
 does that mean she fights against the men or?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.200
 - I think they fight other wrestling outfits.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 So there's another outfit called

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.320
 the OWE Oriental Wrestling Entertainment

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.160
 and I think they've interacted.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.200
 But I'm not sure what Queen Marie does.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.000
 - Interesting, 'cause do you know that TV show,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.240
 Glow, that used to be on?

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.080
 - Yeah.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.960
 - Brilliant TV show.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.720
 The gorgeous ladies of wrestling, it's called,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.800
 and it's about women's wrestling,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.800
 but it was based on real life wrestling.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.760
 And they brought in all these women

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.480
 who are mostly dancers and stuff like this.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.520
 And there was only one woman who had any wrestling experience.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.360
 She was called Dee Booher and she played Matilda the Hun.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.240
 But when she was doing her wrestling,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.760
 she wasn't allowed to fight against the men.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.840
 And there were no other women who could fight against her,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.920
 so they needed to find someone to fight her.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.320
 And they found a female bear.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.160
 - Okay.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.000
 (audience laughs)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.080
 - Who she fought.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.200
 - It's Hulk who converted the panda all over again, so.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.920
 - And so she wasn't allowed to fight men.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.200
 They had to find a female.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.680
 They found a female bear.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.520
 - Okay, so surely fighting a female bear

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.120
 is harder than fighting a man.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.000
 (audience laughs)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.720
 - Have you not seen that thing on Twitter

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.560
 that's been doing the rounds

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.760
 that most men think they can beat up a bear?

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.720
 - Yes, right.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.360
 - Oh, I'm so glad that we've got onto this.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.920
 I didn't think we would.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.920
 But it was really interesting,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.240
 because the question specified,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.080
 this was a YouGov poll,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.960
 which was, you know, what percent of men and women

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.240
 think they could beat which animals?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.800
 And it was within the last week, wasn't it?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.680
 And it was something like 38% of men

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.520
 think they could beat a chimpanzee, unarmed.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.640
 Chimpanzees are strong.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.680
 - It was like 7% of men thought they could beat a lion.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.080
 - Yeah, and it was something like 8% of men.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.880
 And women were the same number, weirdly.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.480
 Both men and women, about 7% or 8%

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.320
 think they could beat an elephant in a fight, if unarmed.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.160
 - Wow.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.080
 I mean, what do you do?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.920
 How do you fight?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.760
 - Yeah.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.600
 - What, you grab the trunk, obviously.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.080
 - You grab the trunk, and then.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.920
 - But then what?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.320
 I mean, it submits, I guess.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.840
 I mean, they're very sensitive.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.680
 Yeah.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.720
 - This thing of the sort of the villain wrestlers,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.600
 the heels, you know, they're the sort of,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.720
 and this thing of, which I don't really understand

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.560
 'cause I'm not a wrestling fan,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.760
 where you have to stay in character.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.800
 No one really acknowledges the.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.920
 - Yeah, it's a.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.880
 - Yeah, it's a whole thing.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.160
 You don't acknowledge the kind of fictional elements

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.520
 of the universe and, you know, all of this.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.240
 But this was such a big thing that wrestlers

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.320
 in the 70s and 80s weren't allowed to travel

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.440
 to matches together if they were on opposite sides

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.960
 in the fictional universe of wrestling.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.040
 - Oh, really? So like if two of them saw each other

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.320
 on a plane, they'd have to get in a big fight?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.400
 - Yeah, exactly, basically, yeah.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.280
 And so there were two wrestlers called Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.120
 - Oh, yeah.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.200
 - Ba-ba-beats people up.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.040
 - Okay, so.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.880
 - Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.400
 - I should just say, we very much have done

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.600
 specialist subjects in the section.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.760
 - That's not even his theme tune.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.160
 That was like a random WWF music album

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.520
 that was released in 1995.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.360
 It's great.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.560
 Brent the Hitman Heart has a love song on it,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.800
 "Much a man, Randy Savage."

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.640
 Keep going, sorry.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.480
 - Thank you.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.240
 - So he, CF, downs early a bit.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.840
 Hacksaw Jim Duggan and an evil character

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.120
 called the Iron Shake.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.960
 - Ah!

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.800
 (laughing)

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.960
 - Classic.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.800
 - Huge.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.360
 - Oh, I think I know what you're about to say.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.720
 He was at a conference.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.600
 The Iron Shake met up with the ultimate warrior

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.160
 and he wanted to say hi.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.120
 And the ultimate warrior didn't want to say hi back.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.240
 And so the Iron Shake slapped the man

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.440
 who said he would say hi.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.280
 It's very dramatic.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.120
 It's on YouTube.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.480
 - That's not what I was gonna say.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.360
 (laughing)

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.640
 - Anyway, this fact has received such a kicking from Dad.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.720
 But basically.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.840
 - I'm just giving background context.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.040
 - Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.040
 - Mama beats people up.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.880
 - Thank you.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.720
 (laughing)

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.240
 And the Iron Shake were arrested

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.000
 while traveling in the same car in 1987.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.440
 - Wait, because they were traveling in the same car?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.520
 - Admittedly, they weren't arrested

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.600
 because of the fictional universe of wrestling being breached.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.760
 They were arrested for possession of cocaine and marijuana.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.600
 But still.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.520
 (laughing)

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.840
 - But I bet the police were bloody cross

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.000
 about the fictional world being breached as well, weren't they?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.040
 - You guys shouldn't even be in the same room together.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.080
 (laughing)

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.000
 - Well, there was a guy, another famous pro wrestler

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.560
 in Britain in the 60s, 70s.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.640
 Actually, I think wrestled up to the late 80s, 90s

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.840
 called Kendo Nagasaki, who actually,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.360
 there are two Kendo Nagasaki's.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.680
 One is a Japanese guy, which sounds about right,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.960
 who is called Kazuo Sakurada.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.760
 But the famous one in Britain

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.840
 is just this bloke called Peter Thornley.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.720
 (laughing)

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.880
 Now, Wikipedia describes Peter Thornley

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.960
 as someone who remains a household name in his home country.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.320
 'Cause anyone heard of Peter Thornley?

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.160
 - No.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.560
 - Right, so it's not, none of the households here tonight.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.000
 But, yeah, so he was super committed to the role

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.400
 and he wore a mask and his character was,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.680
 he had these powers of hypnosis

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.280
 and he was very dark and brooding

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.560
 and had a very troubled past.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.400
 And he's taking vengeance on everyone, et cetera, et cetera,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.560
 lots of bullshit.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.760
 And he never spoke, so he had to have with him

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.280
 a verbalizer at all times.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.920
 He was called Gorgeous George Gillette.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.760
 - Oh, yeah.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.160
 - But so basically this guy was like sooty,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.480
 Kendo Nagasaki, and Gorgeous George had to lean over

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.160
 and say, "What's that Kendo Nagasaki?"

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.360
 (laughing)

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.920
 You're gonna beat the shit out of this guy.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.280
 Well, I'll tell them, but I don't think they're gonna like it.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.960
 - He was very intimidating.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.760
 - What do you think of that, Bison Girl?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.360
 (laughing)

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.600
 - So his life was essentially ruined in the late 70s

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.600
 because he was sort of living with Gorgeous George

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.680
 at the time, it seems.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.160
 And his identity was fully hardcore secret.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.120
 No one knew he was.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.240
 And then their toilet broke

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.800
 and they had to call a plumber in.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.200
 And the plumber saw Gorgeous George answer the door,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.600
 put two and two together and was like,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.200
 "I bet that guy who's sitting there on the sofa

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.640
 is Kendo Nagasaki."

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.400
 'Cause he's hanging out with Gorgeous George.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.760
 And so he then printed loads of leaflets saying,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.720
 "This is the real identity of Kendo Nagasaki

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.400
 and this is the address he lives at."

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.120
 He used to hand them out at all the gigs they did.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.960
 - Really?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.280
 - And whenever he'd put adverts in the newspaper,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.800
 so there'd be a big ad that Kendo Nagasaki's having

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.840
 a big fight here, then just below it would appear,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.800
 posted by this plumber, a thing saying,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.560
 "The above wrestler, Kendo Nagasaki, is Peter Thornley

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.200
 and he lives at this address."

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.760
 - Right.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.960
 - And everyone in the UK is going,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.000
 "We know who Peter Thornley is."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.840
 (laughing)

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.800
 - But that is the reality

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.520
 when you've got these amazing characters

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.360
 and then the real life.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.560
 You know, Yokozuna, one of the greatest characters in WWF,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.760
 he was a Japanese sumo wrestler.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.320
 He wasn't, he was from Hawaii

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.920
 and his name was Rodney in real life.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.960
 You know, Hulk Hogan, his name's Terry, you know?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.920
 - Is it Terry Hogan?

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.680
 - No, it's called Belayah, something like that.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.520
 Belayah.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.680
 - I should have learned that you would know.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.760
 - Yeah, Terry Belayah.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.240
 - Okay, here's a quiz question for you Dan,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.400
 as soon as you're such an expert.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400
 - Okay.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.320
 - In which country do you think was the highest attended

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.560
 wrestling performance in history?

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.240
 - Ooh, I'm gonna say Philippines.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.160
 - Matthew, no.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.000
 Keep going.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.320
 - I'm gonna say America.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.840
 - You've got 193 countries in the world.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.160
 - I'm gonna say South Sudan.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.520
 Andy, this is my game, sorry.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.400
 - It's pretty much one of the last places you would think of.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.000
 It's North Korea.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.840
 - What?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.680
 - Okay.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.680
 And in 1995, there was a load of wrestlers from America,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.720
 from WWF, went over to North Korea with Muhammad Ali,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.520
 by the way, to do a big sort of wrestling show.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.760
 One of them was Ric Flair, who I'm sure you will know.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.360
 - Yeah, the nature boy, Ric Flair.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.960
 Always wore red when he was gonna lose.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.120
 No one knew that at the time.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.640
 - We've never done a podcast with live footnotes before.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.480
 (laughing)

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.600
 And it's unbelievably annoying.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.840
 (laughing)

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.480
 - And he fought against this guy called Antonio Inoki,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.520
 who was a Japanese wrestler.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.560
 And he kind of had some connections in North Korea,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.400
 so he could do it.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.320
 But there were about 100,000 people

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.080
 who watched this wrestling match.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.920
 - Wow.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.240
 - All North Koreans, and so didn't cheer.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.400
 They just sat in silence and watched this match happen.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.080
 And then Ric Flair at the end,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.120
 they tried to force him into doing a statement saying,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.280
 oh, I can see why North Korea is so great,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.440
 and why America is so afraid of North Korea,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.880
 and stuff like that.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.320
 But he refused to do that.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.720
 But Inoki, who is the Japanese guy,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.360
 he was also a politician.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.320
 And he once successfully negotiated with Saddam Hussein

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.280
 for the release of Japanese hostages, this wrestler.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.120
 - Wow.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.100
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.200
 And he's so revered in the Japanese wrestling world

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.680
 that if you're a Japanese wrestler,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.520
 you might request to be slapped in the face by him.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.000
 (laughing)

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.120
 And that might give you some of his courage.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.520
 That's the idea.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.640
 - I didn't know that slapping in the face

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.600
 is apparently a big wrestling move.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.440
 I'm learning tonight.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.280
 - Yeah.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.960
 - You're not supposed to do it with an open palm.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.800
 Is that right, Dan?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.560
 - You, well, you don't do it with a fist.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.400
 You have to do it with open palm.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.240
 - You don't do it with a fist.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.200
 It's an open palm so that you don't make,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.560
 it's a more, let's see that noise.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.800
 - Yeah, thank you, yeah.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.760
 - You don't get that with the palm.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.540
 So it's more for the dramatics of it.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.160
 And it's obviously safer.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
 And you don't pull hair.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.400
 But also, there was a tag team called the Bushwhackers,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.040
 and they used to lick people's heads.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:23.880
 They were from New Zealand.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.220
 And I met them as a kid in public home.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.440
 - Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.800
 The New Zealand was your headline.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.140
 But I think what you said just before,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.520
 it was more interesting.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.680
 - Oh, so they, yeah.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.840
 So their whole thing was they would lick people's heads.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.400
 - Was this pre-COVID or?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.240
 - Yes.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.080
 (laughing)

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.460
 - Very safe at the time.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.640
 - It's not a winning move.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.640
 - I don't understand how that would come to take you.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.120
 - Did the two of them lick the head

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.680
 at the, the enemy's head at the same time?

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.080
 Like a sort of finishing move?

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.360
 - No, no, it wasn't a finishing move.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.520
 No, it was just a mid-match cheeky lick on the head.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.360
 - Come on, Annie.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.200
 That's foreplay.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.560
 - That's it, that's coming first.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.920
 - It would be before matches.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.360
 It would be if they were being interviewed

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.040
 by the WWF, you know, ring announcers and so on.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.040
 - Why would they, why would they,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 what they would lick the heads of the people into,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.880
 is this mid-match or is this an interview?

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.280
 Just you'd lick the interviewer's head.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.120
 - They'd lick the interviewer's head.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.720
 Occasionally they'd be a mid-match lick.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.440
 If it called for it.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.120
 My point is, is when I met them,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.120
 I asked them to lick my head and they did.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.960
 And because--

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.040
 - They licked your head?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.880
 - Yeah, both of them.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.720
 I've got photos.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.520
 I've got like a tongue, like really burrowing

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.640
 right next to the--

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.240
 - What, they had tongues that could burrow into your head?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.080
 - Big-ass tongues.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.200
 Probably why they started licking heads professionally.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.000
 (laughing)

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 - That's amazing.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.840
 - Yeah.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.200
 - Well, can I tell you my favorite fact I learned

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.200
 about wrestlers, which will be of interest

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.080
 to a very small proportion of people,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.760
 but I'm gonna do it anyway.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.600
 - Probably done.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.480
 (laughing)

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.920
 - She may be not, right?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.960
 You know David Arquette, the actor who--

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.280
 - In Scream and--

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.760
 - In, well, and what?

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.440
 It's very, very little else.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.280
 - Courtney Cox?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.520
 (laughing)

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.360
 - So, as Dan has specified, David Arquette,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.560
 the actor famous for Scream and Courtney Cox.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.960
 He, one of the reasons his career sort of disappeared

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.600
 is that he got really obsessed with wrestling.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.320
 So he played this character called Gordie Boggs

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.240
 in a film, a 2000 film about pro wrestling.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.560
 - Gordie Boggs?

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.040
 - That Gordie Boggs.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.880
 - Oh, sorry.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.720
 It just sounded like Gordie Boggs,

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.800
 which sounds like Courtney Cox.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.680
 And I just wondered if--

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.800
 (laughing)

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.360
 - That was before or after he met Courtney Cox.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.640
 - Well, this is after, but this is what's interesting.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.520
 They were together, they were married at this point.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.600
 He played this character, he got obsessed with pro wrestling.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.160
 He was actually crowned the champion of pro wrestling,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.440
 which was extremely controversial in the wrestling world

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.440
 'cause they were like, "He can't even wrestle."

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.200
 But he got so into it that it became really embarrassing.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.240
 And Courtney Cox, as I said in interviews,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.120
 it was a lot to handle to be with David

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.680
 and to see David at this point.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.520
 'Cause he suddenly got all consumed by that.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.440
 He was going to wrestling matches and being loud

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.200
 and screaming, and it was kind of insane.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.800
 I remember feeling embarrassed.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.960
 Now, what is effing weird about that,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.160
 is that is a plot in Friends three years

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.120
 before it happened in real life, right?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.960
 Who remembers that plot?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.640
 - Wait, her boyfriend, Tom Selleck,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.360
 wants to be the ultimate fighting champion?

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.600
 - It's not Tom Selleck, thank you for that, my God.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.000
 - It is Tom Selleck, isn't it?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.360
 - No, it's not Tom Selleck.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.760
 No, he is also Monica's lover in Friends, but--

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.160
 - John Favreau?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.840
 - Yes, it's that guy, yeah.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.680
 - Wow.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.520
 - Anyway, how weird is that?

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.360
 Three years before it happened,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.560
 this happened to Monica in Friends

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.880
 and then happened to Courtney Cox in real life.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.720
 - Yeah, that is weird.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.280
 - What a roller coaster.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.520
 But now, David Arquette, in 2018,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.960
 decided to take up pro wrestling

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.240
 'cause he wants to redeem his name

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.360
 in the wrestling communities.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.640
 - Wow, how is that a roller coaster

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.320
 if the same thing is happening?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.920
 (laughing)

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.840
 A roller coaster, you want different things to happen.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.680
 - It's a shit roller coaster.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.800
 - What a monorail.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.040
 (laughing)

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.840
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.000
 and that is Andy.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.560
 My fact is that expert bell makers

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.520
 can tell where a bell was made

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.640
 just from listening to the bong.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.000
 (laughing)

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.120
 - Yeah, I mean, pretty cool.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.040
 - Is that a useful skill, would you say?

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.880
 - Uh...

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.760
 - I mean, how often are you in a party?

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.680
 (laughing)

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.400
 And someone's got a massive church bells, I guess, right?

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.240
 - You church bells, yeah.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.920
 - Yeah, and someone's like,

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.680
 hey, Andy, come over here and tell us where this is from.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.440
 - It's a party, it's more of a party trick

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.240
 unless you're a professional founder,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.040
 which is that you're right, you're absolutely right.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.200
 - How do you verify it in the moment?

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.920
 How do you, if you said that's from, you know,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.120
 this small foundry in-- - Not, yeah, yeah.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.840
 I don't know how you verify it.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.280
 I guess the person asking you

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.360
 where was this bell made knows, and you don't.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.720
 - So they're being forced into the game,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.560
 they're not just bringing it up.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.880
 - So you're telling someone something

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.200
 they already know in effect, aren't you?

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.040
 - No, well, no, you're saying,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.120
 come and listen to my bell if you're a vicar, say.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.600
 You get the founder into your church, they listen to the bell,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.640
 they say, oh, that was made at the White Chapel Bell Foundry,

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640
 or whatever.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.040
 - By the way, if a vicar ever says to you,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.040
 come and listen to my bell, do not go with him.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.800
 (audience laughing)

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800
 - Oh, my God.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.220
 Oh, dear.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.960
 - I mean, there aren't that many places,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.280
 and I don't mean to belittle this,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.400
 but there are not that many places

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.480
 a bell could have been made in this day and age, are there?

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.320
 - That's right.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.080
 - Yeah, but we have a lot of old bells.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:11.920
 - There are a lot of old bells.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.560
 - There are a lot of bells, but this is the problem.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.880
 Okay, this is exactly the problem

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.080
 with being a bell founder in this day and age,

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.280
 so this is from, I should say, it's from this brilliant article,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.680
 it was a Guardian article long read by Hetty O'Brien,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.640
 and it's about a place called the White Chapel Bell Foundry.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.760
 Foundry is just a bell factory,

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.160
 and it went out of business a few years ago,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.880
 and it had been in business since 1570.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.880
 Queen Elizabeth I was on the throne when this place started up,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.480
 and it was one of the last foundries in the country

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.520
 before it shut down, and the problem is

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.600
 that bells last forever.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.440
 - Yeah.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.280
 - Because...

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.640
 - It's not like an iPhone, is it?

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.040
 - No, that's why Steve Jobs didn't go into bell.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.160
 He didn't come out and say, "We know you like the iPhones,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.080
 "but here's our new thing, it's a 400 tonne bell."

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.400
 Yeah, it's a real problem.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.400
 So they made the White Chapel Bell Foundry,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.640
 made two bells for Westminster Abbey in 1583,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.000
 which are fine, they're still working.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.960
 They don't need upgrading, they don't need changing,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.880
 they just...

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.560
 Yeah, so bell companies have a nightmare

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.960
 if we're not on a period of active church building.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.840
 - Except, though, except when disaster strikes.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.400
 So if, say, like World War II happened,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.640
 that's fantastic for the bell industry,

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.960
 because so many churches are being destroyed,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.600
 that suddenly they're back in business.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.600
 - I heard that they were behind the whole thing,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.000
 actually, the bell makers.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.760
 - It was a big bell, wasn't it?

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.920
 - Big bell, yeah.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.920
 - But that's the moment when they suddenly have popularity

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920
 in business because...

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.040
 - That was the only time they made a profit

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.880
 in the 20th century.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.960
 The entire 20th century, the only time they made a profit

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.120
 was the years after the Second World War.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.600
 - And then, most recently, it was only because of Downton Abbey

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.920
 being so popular with their little ding-a-ding-a-ding.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.760
 That suddenly they were back in business.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.800
 - Those are not a glamour product for them to be selling.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.320
 - So they're in trouble, aren't they?

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.760
 There's only one left, I think.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.080
 - A Tailors of Loughborough.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.880
 - That's correct, yes.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.600
 - So, wait a minute, this is even worse.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.600
 When Addy's at his party and you say, "Where's this bell from?"

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.160
 There's only one to choose from.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.200
 Only if it's a new bell, you know, as in...

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.160
 - I don't know how many founders can do all 400

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.920
 which closed down over the last two centuries.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.760
 Probably not.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.520
 - Imagine there used to be 400 bell factories.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.360
 - That's a lot, yeah.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.480
 - So many.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.080
 - I think, weirdly, Andy, if you hosted a TV quiz show

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.280
 which was merely identifying bongs of bells,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.680
 I think I would watch it.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.280
 I think it would actually be really great.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.200
 - How many episodes would you actually watch?

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.040
 - I'm definitely watching the trailer.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.840
 - I could imagine Andy being at a party

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.880
 and someone brings out a bong and Andy goes,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.320
 "Oh, speaking of bongs."

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.560
 (laughing)

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.600
 - It took me a while to get that joke

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.720
 because I was so into bell law that you said bong

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.320
 and I thought, "Yes, brings out a bong of a bell."

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.400
 Someone does a bong.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:55.320
 - I was devastated with an article about Tailors of Loughborough,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.400
 now the only remaining bell foundry

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.040
 because during the government shutdown,

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.000
 during the whole COVID shutdown,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.440
 then it was difficult for all industries,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.640
 including the last remaining bell foundry.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.800
 And the headline in the art newspaper

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.080
 was "Shutdown Test Metal of UK's Last Major Bell Foundry."

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.840
 And they didn't even spell metal like metal.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.280
 They just spelled the M-E-T-L-E, like absolute chumps.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.160
 (laughing)

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.320
 Come on the art newspaper,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.480
 that's why you're not at household name.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.440
 - Not like Peter Thornley.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.160
 - I'm Peter Thornley.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.440
 But they've just got this lottery funding.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.760
 Why are we subsidising these non-profit making institutions?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.880
 They just got 3.45 million pounds.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.840
 - You're not gonna subsidise the profit-making companies, are you?

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.080
 - Why do you say subsidise PricewaterhouseCoopers?

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.920
 (laughing)

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.760
 I'd be happy about paying tax.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.200
 - No, it is sad.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.760
 It's a sad thing that this industry

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.560
 is no longer as big as it was.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.680
 - Well, this Whitechapel place

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.520
 is completely shut down now as well.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.600
 The Whitechapel bell foundry,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.000
 which, as you say, has been going since the 1500s.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.680
 And that's just happened because it looks like a hotel

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.080
 is gonna be moved in, in its place,

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.520
 a sort of hipster kind of hotel.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.080
 And I agree, I think that is really sad.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.640
 It's a huge part.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.960
 Big Ben is from there.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.800
 The Liberty Bell is from there.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.560
 It's got huge history.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.960
 - Both of those bells have famously got massive cracks

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.800
 in them, haven't they?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.200
 - Yeah, they're not very good at what they do.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.320
 (laughing)

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.640
 - It's amazingly lasted this long.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.680
 - It's a 400-year con making shit bells.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.000
 (laughing)

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.120
 So the Big Ben Bell, it was made in 1858,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.160
 and it took, so once you pour the,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.480
 it's molten tin and bronze, I think,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.320
 it goes into a bell.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.360
 Once you pour that into the cast,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.960
 it takes, obviously, a day or two to cool down.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.480
 This bell was so big, it took 20 days to cool down.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.960
 It was still warm from the casting after that.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.160
 And then it was taken to Parliament on a trolley

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.360
 pulled by 16 horses.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.600
 It's incredibly ceremonial.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.760
 It took 18 hours to get it from the base

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.640
 to the top of the tower.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.600
 - Were they carrying it upstairs?

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.000
 Like, pivots, pivots?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.200
 (laughing)

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.960
 - I thought horses couldn't go upstairs as well.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.280
 - They can't go upstairs, they can't go downstairs.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.120
 - They're still there.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.680
 (laughing)

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.480
 - Who do you think's been dogging all the time on the bell?

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.740
 (laughing)

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.080
 - They did pull it up by hand.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.920
 - Amazing.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.760
 - Unbelievable.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.580
 - Wow.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.420
 - There's always absolutely tons,

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.840
 and it was just eight men who got it from the bottom to the top.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.240
 - But they not have made it up there,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.960
 rather than making it in a different place

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.040
 and then bringing it there.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.400
 - If only you'd been around to advise on the project.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.600
 - It wasn't just them carrying it,

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.000
 'cause obviously it literally weighs tons.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.720
 They had a crank and they had built,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.440
 and they had constructed an 1800 foot chain to attach it to,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.960
 and then they had a timber cradle carrying the bell,

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.920
 and then they just had to turn this huge windlass,

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.560
 you know, around and around and around.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.040
 I've gone into excess detail.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.880
 - Yeah.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.720
 - All right.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.120
 - Have you ever looking for a crank in future?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.040
 (laughing)

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.600
 When they bombed Big Ben during World War II,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.240
 it was a problem, wasn't it?

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.600
 So, at first, the BBC News would be broadcast,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.280
 and we broadcast, the Allies broadcast BBC News in Germany,

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.280
 and it was sort of a propaganda thing

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.120
 to, you know, kind of undermine the enemy,

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.880
 and on the hour before the news,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.440
 they'd always do the Big Ben bongs live,

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.560
 and then they realized it was giving away

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.680
 what the weather was like,

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.360
 because the Germans who were listening

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.080
 were able to detect what the weather was like

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.720
 in London based on the sound of the bongs,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.320
 because depending on the humidity of the air

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.440
 and depending on the temperature,

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.120
 the bongs make a slightly different noise,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.040
 so I think moist air will absorb kind of higher frequencies.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.000
 - That's exactly what the bell makers want, don't they?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.560
 They want all the bells to be blown up,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.640
 and they can make more.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.000
 - Can your bong people tell that, Andy, the weather?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.320
 - My bong people.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.400
 (laughing)

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.560
 I don't know, I don't know.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.920
 - It wasn't, they changed it, though,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.840
 because they were figuring it out,

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.280
 so then they would play,

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.000
 the BBC started playing recorded bongs,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.340
 so they wouldn't give away the weather.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.360
 - So they'd trick the Nazis into thinking

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.440
 the weather was perfect for a bombing raid,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.500
 when actually it was rainy?

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.480
 - No, no, you would trick them into thinking

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.520
 it's not perfect for a bombing raid.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.800
 You wouldn't be like, oh, it's a glorious day,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.280
 you can see where you're going.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.280
 What a beautiful day for a bombing raid.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.240
 (laughing)

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.640
 - The prime minister's in.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.320
 - Jesus Christ, Andy.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.240
 - This is why you were fired

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.760
 from Churchill's War Cabinet.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.020
 (laughing)

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.160
 - Okay.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.960
 - Bells used to be really important to people in Britain.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.840
 They would, lots of different things.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.940
 If you were living in a village or a town,

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.720
 really there wasn't much noise,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.440
 there wasn't loads of traffic noise or anything like that,

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.240
 so really the bell was the loudest noise

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.500
 that you could hear from miles and miles around,

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.000
 and it would mean lots of different things.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.840
 It was like a kind of language of the bells,

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.520
 so if it did certain bell rings,

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.880
 it would say you had to go into church,

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.480
 or it might say there's a fire and you need to run away,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.040
 or it might be that there's been a death in the parish,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.480
 or there was loads of different things,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.440
 and it was basically, you would hear the bell

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.160
 and you would know what was happening in your town.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.120
 - That's very cool.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.440
 - Hey.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.720
 - Is it gonna be a bombing raid?

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.080
 Do you do an unfortunate misunderstanding?

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.000
 (laughing)

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.240
 - But then during the Reformation,

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.960
 obviously bells associated maybe with Catholicism,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.000
 and so they kind of banned the bell.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.840
 - Wow.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.840
 - And Edward VI made a law that said

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.440
 only one bell was allowed in each church.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.120
 Okay, you allowed one bell.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.280
 But a lot of the villagers,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.000
 like they had such affection for their bells

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.280
 that they would bury them,

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.160
 hoping that the law would change in the future,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.840
 and they'd be able to dig their bells back up

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.680
 and then put them up.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.260
 - That's so cool.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.360
 - And Edward VI, of course,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.320
 is where we get the word bell end, isn't it?

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.280
 (laughing)

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.800
 - 'Cause he ended bells, yeah.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.680
 - And they would throw him pissed off.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.520
 - Very nice.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.640
 - That's a great, so maybe some of them are still out there,

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.040
 you know, still in the ground.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.880
 - That's just garbage.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.720
 - Imagine that.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720
 If you were a metal detectorist,

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.280
 that would be the most exciting find of you.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.120
 - It's the fucking jackpot.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.080
 (laughing)

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.120
 - We're gonna have to move on in this life.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.520
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.600
 - Really unprecedented move.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.040
 We're gonna have to go back to the last act

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.440
 and do a more wrestling act stuff.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.520
 - Can I tell you one more thing?

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.360
 - Yeah.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.480
 - This is just a, I was looking up Guinness Records,

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.760
 and this is not about church bells.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.120
 This is about the hotel bells, you know, the little ding,

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.920
 you know, when you get to the, yeah, those.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.080
 Do you know what the record is

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.320
 for the most desk call bells rung with the chin

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.760
 inside one minute?

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.680
 - Okay, so I reckon I could do probably about 40.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.720
 - Okay.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.560
 - No, at least one a second.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.560
 So 75. - Way more than a second.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.120
 - That's the same bell you're doing there, Dan.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.060
 - Yeah, you're doing, you can't ding the same bell.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.680
 You have to have other bells, yeah.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.520
 - Right.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520
 - They're all different bells, yeah.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.720
 - So the concierge desk needs to be really long.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.560
 You need a--

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.400
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.960
 So it's a guy called Cherry Yoshitake of Japan.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.720
 He's known as Mr. Cherry as well.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.200
 And he, this year, he broke this record.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.720
 He dinged 149 bells with his chin in one minute.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.560
 - Wow.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.400
 - Unbelievable.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.240
 - Wow.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.600
 - It's almost like he had nothing better to do in 2020.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.040
 (laughing)

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.080
 - I love that his nickname isn't even related

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.520
 to this insane thing that he,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.160
 what else is he doing with cherries

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.720
 that is far more interesting?

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.720
 That's his nickname.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:17.080
 - Can I quickly tell you about a suffragette bell ringer?

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.920
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.880
 - This was a lady called Mary Maloney.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.600
 And when Winston Churchill was trying

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.720
 to regain his seat in parliament in Dundee in 1908,

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.200
 she wasn't very happy because he'd said some remarks

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.600
 about the suffrage movement.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.440
 And so whenever he went to any kind of speech,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.160
 she just stood right next to him and just rang a bell.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.760
 (laughing)

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.320
 And then she'd stop and say, Mr. Churchill,

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.080
 do you want to apologize for the things she said

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.240
 about the suffrage movement?

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.080
 And he said, no.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.120
 And she went, okay.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.380
 (laughing)

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.800
 And she just would follow him

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.120
 and he'd kind of start getting flustered.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.280
 And then he'd leave and go in his little carriage

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.640
 and she'd follow him.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.880
 And then as soon as she got there,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.280
 she'd start dinging again and dinging again.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.560
 And there's an article in the London Evening News

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.400
 that said that Mr. Churchill struggled

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.720
 good humorously against the bell.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.560
 But he said, if she thinks that this is a reasonable argument,

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.560
 she may use it.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.720
 I don't care.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.560
 I bid you good afternoon.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.240
 And he left.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.080
 But then according to the biography of Churchill

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.120
 by Michael Sheldon, so this is a bit biased,

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.760
 but he reckons that by the end of the week,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.880
 everyone was so sick of this suffrage with her bell

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.560
 that they all kind of got on Churchill's side

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.200
 and he did win the election in the end.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.840
 - Oh. - Really?

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.320
 Shot herself in the foot.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.520
 - A little bit. - Foolish woman.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.080
 That's suffragettes, you see?

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.920
 (laughing)

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.760
 Bunch of idiots.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.720
 - I don't. - That wasn't the point

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.560
 of that story.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.000
 (laughing)

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.280
 - Can't believe you're broadcasting

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.080
 this negative shit about the suffragettes.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.160
 and that is James.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.520
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in the 1930s,

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.240
 Canada's bowling alleys had to close

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.240
 on nine occasions due to strikes.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.480
 (laughing)

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.560
 - Very good, very strong.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.720
 - So this is a little bit of inside a lingo

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.640
 at what happens at QI.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.560
 We call this a remote controlled fish.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.360
 I'm not sure why we call it that,

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.800
 but basically you come up with the funny idea

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.480
 of a fact first and then you try and prove it's true.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.880
 So I thought, wouldn't it be funny

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.360
 if there'd never been a strike in a bowling alley?

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.000
 And then I found this paper called

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Strikes, Bogies, Spares and Misses,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.920
 Pinboy and Caddy Strikes in the 1930s by Ian McMillan

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.360
 that talks about all these amazing strikes in Canada.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.600
 - I think it's more impressive

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.280
 that you found the strikes you were looking for

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.480
 'cause this was hard to research.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.080
 If you just searched bowling alley strike,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.240
 you don't get the industrial election

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.440
 side of things very early.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.720
 So why were they striking?

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.840
 - So basically these were pinboys in bowling alleys.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.080
 So these days if you got 10 pin bowling,

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.440
 there's a machine that picks up the pins

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.960
 and puts them back where they should be.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.400
 When the olden days it would be adolescent workers,

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.080
 young lads who would do this job,

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.400
 they would sit on a little shelf behind the bowling alley

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.160
 and then once you've rolled they jump down

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.120
 and then they'd shift away the ones that you knocked down

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.080
 and put the other ones where they should be.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.040
 And there was this one particular moment in Saskatchewan

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.240
 where they forced the pinboys to shovel snow

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.280
 outside the bowling alley but wouldn't pay them.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.560
 And when they said they wouldn't do it,

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.600
 they fired them and they went,

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.800
 "No, we're gonna go on strike."

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.960
 And they were helped a bit by the Communist Party in Canada

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.960
 and they just continually for about a decade

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.680
 just kept going on strike.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.080
 - I'm impressed because I thought that pinboys were,

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.560
 you say adolescent, but they were young, weren't they?

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.440
 And a lot of them, I think often who got pushed out

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.600
 with the photos for the promo shots were young,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.800
 but they were pretty pubescent.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.640
 And the idea of sort of a nine-year-old boy

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.560
 striking through the streets is very strange.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.600
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.040
 - But yeah, they were put out of business,

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.040
 all of them eventually by the awesome machines

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.960
 you get in bowling alleys now, weren't they?

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.280
 - Let's see who's side you're on.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.120
 - The pins.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.240
 - Side of mechanization against the humble working child.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.880
 - These nine-year-old luddites

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.400
 are gonna need to catch up with technology.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.200
 - Can I ask you a question about the pinboys?

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.360
 Would they, so they would go down after the first bowl

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.720
 and the pins that were knocked down,

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.560
 they're moving out of the way.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.600
 But obviously it's very important

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.920
 that the formation remains the same as the other ones,

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.320
 but they were popping them back into to be reset, weren't they?

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.360
 So they would have to make sure

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.200
 that they were placing them in the exact right spots, right?

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.000
 - So when you bowl once and then they get rid

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.680
 of the ones on the floor and then you get a chance

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.920
 to knock the rest of them down, they stay where they are.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.240
 But then the next person would come

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.680
 and they'd have to put them right in the exact place.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.800
 But if you tips them really well,

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.960
 they might put them in a slightly better position for you.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.120
 So they kind of move the front pin a little bit closer

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.800
 and move the side ones in a little bit.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.000
 And the people who they didn't like,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.080
 they would move them out so that they couldn't get them straight.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.360
 And then one of the trick they would do

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.560
 is as well as putting the pins up,

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.160
 they would have to roll the bowls back to the bowler.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.880
 And what they would often do if they were really skillful,

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.360
 if there was someone they didn't like,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.080
 they put backspin on the bowl.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.200
 So it went up towards them.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.760
 And just before he's about to get it,

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.000
 he would spin that towards them.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.360
 - That's amazing. - That's so good.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.280
 I wrote one thing that they did, one of their duties,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.000
 which was if... So they put the things in a setting machine.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.760
 So the setting machine does put the pins out,

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.680
 but they are placing them there.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.000
 But if sometimes they didn't work these setting machines,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.760
 and if a pin came out wobbly,

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.640
 a pin boy would have to wriggle out onto the lane on his stomach

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.360
 and position it properly

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.120
 and just hope that they had seen at the other end

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.000
 that there was a wonky pin that was being fixed.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.960
 And so you might get a ball chucked at you

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960
 if they didn't see that.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.600
 If your reactions aren't fast enough,

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.440
 at pubescent or pre-pubescent age,

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.400
 to avoid a bowling ball been chucked by some millionaire.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.520
 And we have ascertained which side of the argument you are on.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.600
 I'm going to say, me slagging off the suffragettes,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.400
 he's looking a lot better, isn't he?

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.560
 The guy who invented the pin setting machine,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.360
 which put all these boys out of business,

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.360
 was he did it in 1936.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.400
 And the first pin setting machine

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.840
 was made of lampshades and flower pots.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.840
 - Oh, wow. - And in a turkey house on his mate's farm,

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.160
 there's a guy called Gottfried Schmidt.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.880
 And he'd heard about what hassle it was having these pin setters,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.800
 because it takes a long time having a little boy

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.760
 kind of rearrange all your pins.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.280
 So, yeah, he cobbled some lampshades and flower pots together.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.920
 If you're laughing at that, then that's the problem with you.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:26.360
 I was like, "There must be a euphemism in there somewhere."

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.800
 People desperately looking, laughed prematurely.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.360
 I thought, "I don't think there is, actually."

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.240
 Hey, did you guys know this is just a quick modern bowling thing

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.360
 that I didn't realise?

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.520
 I enjoy bowling, and I do love getting the shoes,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.840
 putting the shoes on. It's always a fun element of it.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.000
 - Sure. - I didn't realise,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.400
 and I wonder how many people here did...

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.240
 I do love it, James, don't laugh at it.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.720
 I mean, I've been bowling with you.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.600
 I can see that that would be your best bet.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.240
 My 30th birthday.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.000
 My 30th birthday, I had a bowling party.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.040
 James came and murdered me.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.000
 Murdered me in front of all my closest friends and family,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 who had not met him at this point.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.040
 So, they didn't know what a twat I was.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.640
 I didn't know you had a bowling party for your birthday.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:16.800
 I remember you working, putting the pins up.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.720
 - Quick, he's on his belly. Get him. - Quick, he's on his belly. Get him.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.720
 Thank you for that tip, James. It was extremely nicely...

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.360
 - Well, bowling shoes... - Do you realise this?

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.240
 - When you're out with your friends... - When I'm out with my best buds, sure.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.520
 They come as either left-handed bowling shoes or right-handed bowling shoes.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.160
 - What? - Yes.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.560
 - How does that work? - Well...

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.160
 Wait, I was saying there's one left for the left foot and one for the right foot.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.720
 - Yeah, okay. - Like shoes?

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.480
 - 'Cause... - Yeah!

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.600
 - Oh, boy. - No, what it is...

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.440
 If you haven't seen Don Tribe's amazing square normal shoes,

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.040
 they are a sight to behold.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.320
 - What are you talking about? - That's my TV show.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.120
 - What will they think of next? - Check this out.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.720
 No, okay, so this is really interesting.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.840
 And obviously, if you go to a normal bowling alley,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.920
 they probably give you normal shoes, which probably hurts your game,

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.960
 is what I'm guessing.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.480
 If you're a professional, you're right-handed or you're left-handed.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.400
 If you have a dominant leg, you have a dominant foot, that's going right.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.360
 So, one shoe of every bowling shoe has a sliding element to it,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.120
 and the other has a breaking element,

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.840
 so that your back foot can break while your front is sliding.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.240
 - Wow, how interesting. - Yeah, so if you're bowling right-handed,

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.400
 you need the slidey bit to be on your left foot.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.320
 And so, do you think you were maybe given some left-handed bowling shoes by accident,

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.600
 and that's why you lost embarrassingly to James Arkin?

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.520
 Just if my family and friends are listening, yes, I believe,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.960
 there was a conspiracy that night.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.840
 It's illegal to switch hands bowling, as well.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.120
 - Oh, shit, I think I did that. - You did it so many times!

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.760
 - Switch hands. - No.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.680
 - I genuinely did. - Well, you are post-hoc disqualified.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.600
 - That is not allowed. - So sorry, bowling won't...

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.080
 - Screw you, Arkin! - Oh, God!

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.640
 (APPLAUSE)

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.640
 Yes!

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.000
 This is exciting, 'cause this has actually come up quite a lot over the years.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Yeah, you're not allowed to, 'cause you might be sandbagging.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.360
 Is that what you were doing? Were you sandbagging?

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.200
 - I don't know what that means. - What's sandbagging?

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.480
 - You were sandbagging. - I don't even want to do the rest of this podcast.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.920
 - It means cheating. - It means cheating, Andy.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.960
 Sandbagging is when, in professional tournaments,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.520
 this is why they ban in professional tournaments,

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.920
 then you will try and get a better handicap by bowling with your other hand,

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.560
 'cause it's quite hard to bowl badly, deliberately,

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.400
 but without it being noticed with the hand that you're strongest with.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.280
 So if you bowl with your other hand, which some people often do,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.480
 then it tricks people into giving you a better handicap.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.240
 - It's like being a hustler. - I see.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.000
 - I wasn't doing that, but... - Wow.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.840
 You look like a sandbagger to me, Jim.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.560
 And that was a euphemism.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:45.680
 I've got a fact about the first bowling alley opened in the UK.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.400
 OK, so the first bowling alley in the classic American style that we think of

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.280
 opened in Stamford Hill in North London in 1961.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.760
 It was opened by the American Machine and Foundry Company.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.920
 Oh, I've just seen Foundry again. Nice.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.120
 - Anyway, that's not what it's about. Don't worry. - Take him off stage.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.080
 But they, that company, they also made the underground launching system

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.920
 for the Titan Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.120
 - Oh, my God. - But this is the sort of conspiracy I thought of,

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.520
 because there's a bowling alley under the White House. We know this.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.880
 - Yeah, there is. - Yeah.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.320
 So is it possibly connected to the Intercontinental Ballistic...

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.800
 Do you think they accidentally ordered the wrong product

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.160
 from the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile providers?

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.120
 And they were too embarrassed to say, "No, take it back."

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.920
 Yeah, the vice president of the company that made a lot of very dangerous weapons,

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.400
 a very dangerous time in history, said that the company's product

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.080
 will make a great contribution to human happiness.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.760
 And there was such a good Guardian article on this, which you might have read,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.040
 which was, "Careful to specify, they meant the bowling alley

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.240
 and not the missile launcher."

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.440
 And at that event, the first person to bowl the first bowl,

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.680
 so the first bowl ever bowled at bowling alley in Britain,

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.120
 was a guy called Sir John Hunt, who led the British expedition up Everest.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.960
 And it's worth watching the footage, because he does, of course,

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.800
 bowl it straight into the gutter.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:08.000
 - It's very awkward. - What an amazing, strange celebrity booking

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.120
 to open your bowling alley.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.480
 - I know. Who else would you get, like... - Princess Margaret?

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.920
 - That's... He went straight for Princess Margaret. - I think Aim High.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.800
 Do you think Princess Margaret would have used...

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.960
 She would have used that thing where you pushed the bowl down

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.200
 on the little skeleton thing, wouldn't she?

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.440
 - There's no shame in using that, by the way. - The bumpers.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.120
 The bumpers, designed for kids, right? That was the invention.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.000
 The bumpers are designed for anyone who wants a more...

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.600
 Actually, a more interesting style of gameplay.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.000
 Good point.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.360
 It takes quite a skill to bounce it off three times and then...

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.480
 - And then still end up in the gutter. - Yes, actually.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.800
 And that's why you weren't at the 30th birthday party, Andy.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.000
 So, you know, that's designed for kids.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.280
 And I was amazed to learn that there's this club, which is the three...

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.400
 I'm giving it its name as a club, the 300 Club,

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.200
 but the idea is a perfect game in bowling is 300 points.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.880
 So you want all strikes, and that means nine strikes for the first nine.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.520
 And then on the 10th, you need three, because you get those extra goes.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.720
 So it adds up to 300 points that you get in total.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.800
 And the record holder of the youngest person ever to get that

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.800
 is a nine-year-old girl at the time in 2013.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.640
 She's still the record holder called Hannah Deem.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.680
 And she took up the sport at age six when she was at a party,

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.040
 and she was like, "Oh, I felt like this was a calling."

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:37.720
 And by age nine, she had bowled a perfect game, 300, strikes the whole way.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.400
 And so you get a ring when that happens.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.640
 And if you bowl more, they add like a little rock to it each time and so on.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.400
 But they're very serious about whether or not to take it,

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.520
 the fact that you've said you've got a 300.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.280
 There's a team that comes in, and in the early days,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.120
 they would confiscate the ball off you to suss out the ball

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.120
 just to make sure that it was a proper ball that hadn't been cheated.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.040
 At the end of that day, they would shut down the bowling alley,

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.520
 let no more games come, and someone would come,

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.640
 and they would have a way of measuring the oil slickness of the lane

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.200
 just to make sure that it wasn't too...

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.080
 I want to talk that you haven't rigged it by and poured...

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.680
 Yeah, there's all these things that they did.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.000
 So was she cheating? Had she poured mercury into her ball?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.360
 Had she covered the thing with oil?

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.080
 She was clean. She was clean.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.240
 Go on, Hannah.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.840
 Go on, Hannah, you're all going to get enough mercury.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.320
 Since they stopped selling barometers and mercury thermometers,

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.360
 it's very hard to get your hands on enough mercury.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.480
 It's a bold move to make a call back to an episode,

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.520
 like 12 episodes ago, to a live crowd.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.080
 I thought there'd be one or two perometer fans.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.080
 Cool.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.960
 You mentioned the oil, so I didn't know how crucial oil is in bowling,

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.360
 but this basically answered a question that's been bugging me for 20 years,

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.280
 which is, you know, when you go to a bowling alley with friends,

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.160
 and you get kind of a...

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.120
 Like, if you're on a good roll, you get a bunch of strikes,

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.760
 your friend gets loads of strikes, you think, "This is so effing easy.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.200
 How are there professionals in this game?

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.600
 They must be getting strikes every time,

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.160
 otherwise they're just idiots."

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.200
 Well, turns out their game is way harder than ours.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.560
 So, in recreational bowling,

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.160
 if you're going to Rowan's bowling alley down the road or wherever,

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.000
 then they have the oil arranged in a certain way.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.160
 So, down a bowling lane, it has oil on it,

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.320
 and it originally had oil on it to make it more slippy

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.000
 so that the balls didn't crack the ground.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.960
 But it became apparent that oil obviously adjusts the way the ball goes,

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.280
 so if there's oil down the middle, the ball slides very fast down that oil,

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.360
 and then as soon as it goes off the oil,

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.320
 so there's not as much oil nearer the pins,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.000
 then it starts going more slowly and friction acts more on the ball,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.160
 and it starts to spin, things like that.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.080
 So, bowling alleys for plebs like you and me

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.840
 have the oil rigged so that it funnels the ball towards the pins.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.560
 - Oh, wow. - And that's why we're all getting strikes.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:55.320
 And if you go to a professional bowlers association bowling alley,

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.200
 they do not have that.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.360
 They make sure that the oil is spread exactly evenly,

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.640
 and I think if any of us tried to bowl down one of those,

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.520
 it would just be straight in the gutter every time.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.320
 - Really? - Wow.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.160
 Is it possible that I've spent my life accidentally going to professional bowling alleys?

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.200
 Do you think in those professional bowling alleys,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.040
 they would put the tubes on the side?

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.840
 I guess it's possible.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.320
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.960
 and that is my fact.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.960
 My fact this week is trees fart.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.360
 Trees fart.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.040
 - It turns out... - Come on, Dan.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.760
 - Trees fart. - How often have you been on a lovely walk

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.920
 in the forest and just hearing farts?

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.640
 Well, the thing is, if a tree farts in the forest,

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.680
 but there's no one around to smell it...

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.560
 (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.360
 So, this is, I mean, it's a real technical thing, isn't it,

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.560
 in this case, because obviously they don't have anuses,

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.280
 but they do.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.680
 Slow down, Professor.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.360
 Trees do release little bits of methane,

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.640
 and that's obviously a big problem for global warming.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.400
 And the article that I was reading was talking...

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.760
 This is how I learned the fact. It was in Science Alert.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.800
 It talks about ghost trees.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.800
 Ghost trees are trees that are dead,

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.320
 and they still function, though, in certain areas,

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.120
 so they can suck up soils and so on through them,

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.120
 acting like a straw, and as a result,

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.360
 ghost trees release sort of much bigger farts,

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.760
 and they're much more dangerous.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.080
 But the thing is, like, a normal tree farts

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.520
 or gives off methane, but it also kind of sucks in CO2

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.960
 and photosynthesises and stuff, so it's kind of fine,

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.720
 because it offsets it.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.480
 But the ghost trees, they don't have any leaves,

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.240
 so they can't do it, so it's much worse.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.480
 These kind of dead trees that you get in marshes and stuff like that,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.880
 and they suck up this methane.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.600
 We think from the soil, although we're not quite sure

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.120
 how they do it at the moment.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.280
 This recent study that was in the article,

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.280
 they found that the amount of methane that comes up

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.720
 is way more than you would expect

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.120
 due to the amount that's in the ground,

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.560
 and so there's something else happening.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.560
 We don't know what it is, and obviously it's quite important,

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.360
 because lots more trees are dying

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.360
 because the change is in the climate and stuff,

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.560
 and this might cause problems in the future.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.520
 Yeah, and I think is it that when water or when sea levels rise,

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.080
 sometimes you get forests near the coast,

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.840
 which can't survive in those conditions,

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.480
 so that adds to the effect as well.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.280
 So the sea comes in, it's more salty,

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.480
 the trees die, and then they start doing all this farting.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.200
 Yeah, and I think we should say that,

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.480
 because every single article and every single scientist

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.240
 who looks into this says about 59 times an article, don't they?

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.840
 We are not trying to say that trees are bad.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.600
 The overall impact of trees is still incredibly good.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.720
 Please, God, Daily Mail, don't print an article

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.360
 saying that trees are bad for the environment.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.520
 They've got to go. That's what they're screaming at.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.440
 They've got to go. People of Kentish Town,

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.080
 please do not go straight out to your nearest tree

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.320
 and chop it down. That's not what we're saying.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.160
 You take those farting fucks out.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.640
 Don't, please! I'm begging you.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.080
 The whole methane thing is really interesting,

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.600
 just sort of globally the methane thing,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.680
 because there is the American NOAA,

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.280
 who are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Scientists,

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.000
 they are in Colorado, and they are methane detectives.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.800
 They have a department which is methane detection.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.800
 So for the last 40 years, every single week,

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.520
 they have received this consignment of flasks from around the world,

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.160
 which are flasks of atmospheric air from all over the planet,

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.360
 and they measure what's inside.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.680
 So they have been able to measure methane levels

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.840
 around the planet for the last 40 years,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.000
 and they've been just studying atmospheric levels.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.840
 They've found that methane has been rising since 2007,

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.840
 and no one really knows why.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.280
 I mean, it's our fault, clearly, but no one really...

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.880
 They haven't pinned down exactly why.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.400
 It could be from wetlands, it could be this tree thing,

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.480
 pig manure causes it, so, like, cattle cause a huge amount of it.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.480
 I'm not trying to pass blame, because I'm sure it is our fault,

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.760
 but is there any chance it's Beaver's fault?

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.800
 Because Beaver's are apparently an issue.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.280
 I thought you said Beaver.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.160
 I thought you were talking about it.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.800
 He gets private jets everywhere.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.080
 Beaver's, they're invading Alaska because waters are warming,

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.400
 which means they can go much further north up into the Arctic Circle,

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.520
 and so they're building lots of dams up in an area

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.040
 that used to be frozen or extremely cold,

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.880
 and then their dams are, like, big heat reservoirs

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.360
 which warm up the surrounding soil, degrade the permafrost,

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.080
 and there's loads of methane in the permafrost,

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.760
 it's a massive problem methane being released from the permafrost,

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.160
 and so that puts methane in the atmosphere.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.240
 Beaver's fault, I'm not responsible.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.000
 So what we're saying to the people of Kentish Town

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.320
 is to go out and strangle a beaver.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.720
 Yeah.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.800
 Go down a tree and strangle a beaver, yeah.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.720
 I think that's responsible messaging.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.000
 There was a problem with animals and methane.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.320
 Specifically, our old friends, the sauropods,

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.520
 the big dinosaurs that had lots of plant material,

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.760
 there was some work done by David Wilkinson

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.800
 of Liverpool John Moors University,

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.640
 and he reckons, he's worked this out,

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.000
 he reckoned that sauropod population,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.240
 when they were at the absolute biggest,

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:07.600
 they were pumping out 520 million tonnes of methane a year,

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.760
 which is about the same as the current emissions of greenhouse gases.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.480
 Really?

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.080
 Yeah, so the sauropods, and they reckon that that did change the climate

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.320
 as well through farting.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.240
 Wow.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.640
 So did the sauropod Green Party eventually get some steam behind it

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.880
 and take power?

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.960
 Eventually, someone stuck their neck out, you know.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.920
 Yeah, we first discovered that methane were in trees,

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.480
 was in trees, in 1907.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.720
 And it was this professor, a chemistry professor in Kansas,

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.440
 wandering around Kansas in 1907,

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.960
 and he saw little bubbles in the sap of a tree,

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.200
 a certain type of tree,

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.000
 and he thought, I wonder what's causing them,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.440
 I wonder if it's methane, so he struck a match above it,

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.160
 and it ignited and burped out.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.080
 So he basically lit the fart of the tree.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.200
 He lit the fart of the tree,

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.280
 and apparently, if you're studying trees anywhere,

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.320
 your tree professor will always do this, and you can do this.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.560
 You go through a tree, and you get the sap,

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.080
 and it's burping out methane, so you can light it,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.160
 and it does a little burp.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.720
 Don't, like, if you're in Australia, please don't do that.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.200
 That's Jesus Christ.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:18.360
 This podcast is going to cause bushfires globally from that sentence.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.480
 Once you've finished strangling your beaver,

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.000
 just set fire to the nearest tree, and science will win.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.960
 Here's a warning. Here's another warning.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:32.600
 If you hold a fart in for too long, it may leak out of your mouth.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.000
 It's got to go somewhere, isn't it?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 Exactly.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.160
 It's basically, it gets reabsorbed into your circulation,

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.680
 just finds its way in, and whether you notice or not,

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.520
 it's just going to slowly come out of your mouth.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.120
 It does... That sounds...

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.640
 Everything you're saying sounds true,

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.400
 but it does sound like one of those things that your mum says, doesn't it?

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.640
 Well, if you keep your face like that, the wind will change,

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.320
 and it'll get stuck, you know, or whatever.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.240
 It sounds like a sort of old, white tail of...

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.920
 Your mum has got some amazing sayings, Andy.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.240
 What do you mean?

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.760
 Have you farted enough today, Andy?

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.280
 Because you know what will happen.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.400
 But how come they don't smell like sulfur?

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.040
 Because the reason fart smell is because of sulfur,

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.920
 which is in compounds that smell bad.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.920
 But when I burp, it doesn't smell like a fart, I don't think.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.960
 And I've never smelled anyone's burp smelling like a fart,

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.960
 like a sulfuric fart.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.960
 No, I agree, yeah.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.720
 So something must have happened there.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.880
 It must... Maybe the sulfur is like only the arse,

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.040
 but the other ones will come out of the mouth.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.040
 Maybe.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.400
 Hmm.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.400
 You've really given us something to think about there.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.720
 (LAUGHTER)

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.520
 You'd be great on sulfur the day, right here.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.960
 Welcome to the moral maze on BBC Four.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.960
 Why does sulfur choose the anus?

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.240
 (LAUGHTER)

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.640
 Methane chooses the mouth, doesn't it?

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:55.000
 As in, for cows, I thought that cow's methane was sort of

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.160
 mostly like a split at each end of the cow,

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.680
 whether it's burping or farting, whatever.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:03.120
 About, I think it's 95% of cattle methane comes from its mouth.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.120
 And this is...

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.760
 This really is a genuinely huge problem,

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.160
 because there are, I think, about a billion cows on the planet.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.760
 If they were a country, they'd be the sixth largest emitter of methane

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.760
 in the world.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.760
 What a country.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.760
 (LAUGHTER)

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:20.320
 In this country that's just cows, are they also running the place and stuff?

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.840
 Do they have their own cow, their own minister and stuff?

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.840
 Yeah.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.240
 Yeah, in this whimsical world, there's a kind of...

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.040
 Andy, in that, if that was a country...

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.040
 Yeah.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.040
 Is this a genuine question?

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.040
 Yes.

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:35.800
 If it was that dense of cows, like it's a country made of cows,

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.960
 as you're saying, so the methane's huge.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.800
 If I lit a cigarette lighter, would the whole thing go up?

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800
 I don't know.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.320
 No, I don't think so.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.160
 It doesn't if you do it in the middle of a cow field.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.160
 It doesn't even if you do it.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.160
 This is a country made of cows.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.160
 No, no.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.160
 A, it's not made of cows.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.160
 That's what Andy's saying.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.160
 There are loads of cows in it.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.160
 There are only cows in it.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.160
 It's a cow...

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.160
 It depends how many there are.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.520
 If there is a billion cows and it's in the size of San Marino,

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.560
 then that's a lot of cows and a lot of methane.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.840
 But if you're in the size of the Soviet Union, the old style,

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.840
 then they'd be fine.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.840
 That's not my mistake.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.000
 If there are a billion cows in a country the size of San Marino,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.400
 there are bigger infrastructural problems to deal with.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.400
 How are the Italians keeping them out?

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:24.200
 It's one very big cattle grid and they just can't get over it.

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.160
 But yeah, of course, it depends how much methane you have,

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.600
 but also how much oxygen you have, right?

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.280
 So the methane will only set on fire if you have oxygen

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.520
 because you need oxygen to make fire.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.400
 And that's the thing that on Uranus, there's a lot of methane.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.440
 The whole of the atmosphere is made of methane pretty much.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.880
 There's tons and tons of the stuff.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.960
 But you can't set it on fire because there's no oxygen.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.560
 But what that means is if you had a spaceship

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.400
 and you went into the Uranus atmosphere,

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.080
 you would need the oxygen there because you would have to breathe it.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.720
 As soon as you open the door, any kind of turn on the light switch

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.800
 or any kind of naked flame, the whole place is going up.

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.440
 And it's like a reverse Hindenburg.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.760
 So like the Hindenburg had the flammable gas on the inside,

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.520
 but you've got the oxygen on the inside and it would just go, "Wow."

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.520
 I thought that was very adult of you all, not to laugh every time.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.960
 James said Uranus.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.680
 Very proud of you all.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.600
 I wasn't planning on going there.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.480
 It's another good reason not to.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.280
 It is on the government green list, though, if anyone's interested.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.600
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.480
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.600
 If you would... Thank you.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.080
 Thanks for being here.
