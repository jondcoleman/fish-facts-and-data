00:00:04,00:00:07,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:07,00:00:22,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:00:22,00:00:26,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live"
00:00:26,00:00:29,from Berlin.
00:00:29,00:00:32,[CHEERING]
00:00:32,00:00:36,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:36,00:00:39,"I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:39,00:00:41,and James Harkin.
00:00:41,00:00:43,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:43,00:00:46,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:46,00:00:50,"And in a particular order, here, we go, starting with you."
00:00:50,00:00:54,"Andy, my fact is that pigeons make better coast gods"
00:00:54,00:00:57,than people.
00:00:57,00:01:02,"Well, in one specific way, what you're saying"
00:01:02,00:01:04,"is they can fly down and pull people out of the sea, maybe."
00:01:04,00:01:05,Wouldn't that be nice?
00:01:05,00:01:07,They look good in a red swimsuit.
00:01:07,00:01:10,"No, they definitely do."
00:01:10,00:01:13,So this was an experiment that was
00:01:13,00:01:17,done by the United States Coast Guard in 1976.
00:01:17,00:01:20,"They knew that pigeons have really good eyesight,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,and they started training them to spot people
00:01:22,00:01:23,who were lost at sea.
00:01:23,00:01:26,"So the coast god will fly up in a helicopter,"
00:01:26,00:01:28,and they had a little observation bubble
00:01:28,00:01:30,on the bottom of the helicopter.
00:01:30,00:01:33,"And they put a pigeon in there, and the pigeon"
00:01:33,00:01:36,was strapped on a special couch.
00:01:36,00:01:41,"So like on a sofa, they were on a little mini sofa."
00:01:41,00:01:43,And you must have been half terrified
00:01:43,00:01:45,and half very comfortable.
00:01:45,00:01:47,Yeah.
00:01:47,00:01:50,And they were trained these pigeons
00:01:50,00:01:53,"to, whenever they saw in the ocean below them, a tiny scrap"
00:01:53,00:01:58,"of colored fabric, representing a person floating in the sea,"
00:01:58,00:01:59,they were trained to pick a button.
00:01:59,00:02:02,And that hit a light in the cockpit.
00:02:02,00:02:05,"And the pilot would know, OK, there might be someone down there."
00:02:05,00:02:08,Pigeons could do it 93% of the time.
00:02:08,00:02:09,They saw the bit of fabric.
00:02:09,00:02:12,Humans only managed it 38% of the time.
00:02:12,00:02:12,Wow.
00:02:12,00:02:14,There's a huge difference.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"Although, wasn't there a thing in this where humans"
00:02:16,00:02:19,"managed it 38% of the time, the first time round?"
00:02:19,00:02:21,And then they were told that the pigeons were beating them.
00:02:21,00:02:25,"And then the next time round, they managed it just over 50% of the time."
00:02:25,00:02:27,"Yeah, that's true."
00:02:27,00:02:28,That's crazy.
00:02:28,00:02:29,It's a good way to motivate people as to tell them
00:02:29,00:02:32,"a pigeon is doing better than you at this, you know, over the game."
00:02:32,00:02:32,OK.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"The thing, though, the problem is, is I didn't realize"
00:02:34,00:02:35,they were on sofas.
00:02:35,00:02:38,"The problem is, as a sofa, it's a very comfortable seating"
00:02:38,00:02:41,position that you often fall asleep in as you're hanging out.
00:02:41,00:02:44,"What they thought of this, so they're kidding."
00:02:44,00:02:49,"Well, were you on this scientific team, Dan?"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"The pigeons in the helicopters, they"
00:02:51,00:02:55,had to be kept at a very specific level of hunger.
00:02:55,00:02:58,They needed to be kept ambitious for food.
00:02:58,00:03:00,So that was how they did it.
00:03:00,00:03:02,But it was really-- it was a very successful operation.
00:03:02,00:03:05,"And five years later, in 1981, it was officially"
00:03:05,00:03:09,recommended that pigeons should be inducted into the US Coast Guard.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"And that's why, if you're in the scene now,"
00:03:11,00:03:13,"and you look back, you always see them on the top of those ladders,"
00:03:13,00:03:16,"you don't know, on the beach, with their jackets."
00:03:16,00:03:17,So exactly.
00:03:17,00:03:18,Why are we not seeing that?
00:03:18,00:03:22,"I think technology improved, and pigeons"
00:03:22,00:03:26,have not improved at the same speed as technology.
00:03:26,00:03:27,It was real shame.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"Also, couldn't they only spot--"
00:03:29,00:03:31,"they were only trained to spot three colors, weren't they?"
00:03:31,00:03:34,"Like, red-- was it red, orange, and yellow?"
00:03:34,00:03:35,They were trained to spot.
00:03:35,00:03:37,So-- and that was the colors that they were trained to pick
00:03:37,00:03:39,when they saw them out of sea.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"So it's only if someone is drowning, wearing red, orange,"
00:03:42,00:03:43,or yellow.
00:03:43,00:03:47,"Yeah, but those are three of the big colors."
00:03:47,00:03:50,"It's not like they trained them to spot move, and teal,"
00:03:50,00:03:50,and--
00:03:50,00:03:51,"No, you're right."
00:03:51,00:03:54,"--a serulian, that would obviously"
00:03:54,00:03:55,be a waste of resources.
00:03:55,00:03:57,You're totally right.
00:03:57,00:04:00,"And also, if you're wearing blue, at sea,"
00:04:00,00:04:01,"and you fall in, then--"
00:04:01,00:04:02,--if you're on fault.
00:04:02,00:04:03,Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:05,00:04:08,So pigeons are good at a lot of things.
00:04:08,00:04:09,A lot of other things.
00:04:09,00:04:11,They can be trained to identify breast cancer
00:04:11,00:04:14,by looking at images of biopsies.
00:04:14,00:04:15,"And once they're trained, they can get"
00:04:15,00:04:20,an average diagnostic accuracy of 85%.
00:04:20,00:04:23,"But when you do a flock-sourcing system,"
00:04:23,00:04:25,"well, basically, you get a load of pigeons,"
00:04:25,00:04:29,and you get them to agree whether there's a problem there or not.
00:04:29,00:04:31,They can get up to 99%.
00:04:31,00:04:32,What?
00:04:32,00:04:33,Whoa!
00:04:33,00:04:35,So what you're comparing individual responses?
00:04:35,00:04:36,"Yeah, so you get a load of pigeons,"
00:04:36,00:04:37,"and you know, what do you think of this?"
00:04:37,00:04:39,"No, you're not getting--"
00:04:39,00:04:43,you're not getting a load of pigeons to vote on.
00:04:43,00:04:47,Tell me it's worse than that current system.
00:04:47,00:04:50,"Don't worry, we've got a top team working on this."
00:04:50,00:04:52,They're on their little coats.
00:04:52,00:04:56,And have they tried motivating doctors to do better
00:04:56,00:04:59,by telling them that pigeons are more efficient than they are?
00:04:59,00:05:01,Because I think we should start doing this on the podcast.
00:05:01,00:05:03,I actually think we should set up a company
00:05:03,00:05:05,"where you get little speakers in workplaces that just go,"
00:05:05,00:05:09,"""Cool."""
00:05:09,00:05:13,"And that sort of means, ""I'm after your job."""
00:05:13,00:05:14,They were amazing in their pigeons.
00:05:14,00:05:17,"So I saw a pigeon do something so cool the other day,"
00:05:17,00:05:20,"and I really, really messaged you guys."
00:05:20,00:05:21,Really?
00:05:21,00:05:23,This is really into a fact.
00:05:23,00:05:26,"So I saw a pigeon do a submissal,"
00:05:26,00:05:29,and I'd forgotten that this happens.
00:05:29,00:05:31,And I remembered that we'd mentioned that geese wiffle
00:05:31,00:05:33,they split to the side.
00:05:33,00:05:34,"So I was about to send you a message saying,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"""There's a pigeon impersonating a geese."""
00:05:36,00:05:37,A geese? Sure.
00:05:37,00:05:38,A geese.
00:05:38,00:05:43,"""You're German, you don't know our plurals, do you?"""
00:05:43,00:05:44,So it wasn't a land-based submissal.
00:05:44,00:05:45,It was an airborne--
00:05:45,00:05:47,"Well, it wasn't an airborne one."
00:05:47,00:05:49,So they can do the airborne submissals.
00:05:49,00:05:51,"But then, yeah, you've got these Birmingham rollers"
00:05:51,00:05:54,who submissal for living.
00:05:54,00:05:57,So that's a kind of pigeon.
00:05:57,00:05:58,"A Birmingham roller is a kind of pigeon,"
00:05:58,00:06:02,"and they can't fly beyond a few months old,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,but they can do constant back flips.
00:06:04,00:06:08,"And what I read says, they do involuntary back flips."
00:06:08,00:06:11,How annoying is that doing involuntary back flips?
00:06:11,00:06:13,"And they have races, so they are pigeons"
00:06:13,00:06:15,that compete in a lot of competitions.
00:06:15,00:06:18,"Well, humans compete using them,"
00:06:18,00:06:20,and to see how far they can backflip.
00:06:20,00:06:24,And I think the record is just over 200 meters.
00:06:24,00:06:26,But the pigeon is repeatedly doing back flips.
00:06:26,00:06:29,"And this is what you saw the other day, a 200 meter long."
00:06:29,00:06:31,"No, I just saw a pigeon do a submissal,"
00:06:31,00:06:33,"and it made me think, that's funny."
00:06:33,00:06:35,"That would be, I would feel,"
00:06:35,00:06:36,"imagine you went to see your pigeon doctor,"
00:06:36,00:06:39,and he did a back flip just before he told you your news.
00:06:39,00:06:42,You'd think it was going to be good.
00:06:42,00:06:43,So it was a good--
00:06:43,00:06:46,I'm afraid that was an involuntary back flip.
00:06:46,00:06:50,And he was very bad.
00:06:50,00:06:51,"Oh, no, it got to pigeon."
00:06:51,00:06:54,"And this is why they haven't got far in the medical profession,"
00:06:54,00:06:57,because it's seen as incense to visit.
00:06:57,00:07:01,"Wow, well, that's very cool."
00:07:01,00:07:02,What a special thing to see.
00:07:02,00:07:05,"Yeah, so cool."
00:07:05,00:07:08,"They are also very useful, generally, and have been--"
00:07:08,00:07:09,"Hey, it's a cool thing."
00:07:09,00:07:11,"You know, when pigeons are walking on the street,"
00:07:11,00:07:14,"and you see them bobbin away like that,"
00:07:14,00:07:15,I think we've mentioned this on QI.
00:07:15,00:07:17,"I don't think we've done it on the podcast,"
00:07:17,00:07:18,"but if you put them on a treadmill,"
00:07:18,00:07:20,they stop bobbing their head.
00:07:20,00:07:25,"So if anyone ever wants to see a bobbless pigeon,"
00:07:25,00:07:27,"pop them on a treadmill, do we know why?"
00:07:27,00:07:28,Yeah.
00:07:28,00:07:29,OK?
00:07:29,00:07:29,I mean--
00:07:29,00:07:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:31,00:07:36,"Well, the scientists know why I--"
00:07:36,00:07:37,I read a bit.
00:07:37,00:07:38,What did it say in the headline?
00:07:38,00:07:42,It didn't say it in the headline.
00:07:42,00:07:45,"But hang on, hang on."
00:07:45,00:07:49,"OK, so what it is, is it turns out they're not doing it"
00:07:49,00:07:52,as a part of a movement need for equilibrium as they're
00:07:52,00:07:53,walking.
00:07:53,00:07:58,What it is is visually to understand the space around them.
00:07:58,00:07:58,They need to do it.
00:07:58,00:08:00,It's purely for spatial awareness.
00:08:00,00:08:02,So what it is is we have saccade in our eyes.
00:08:02,00:08:03,I think this is it.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"So our eyes kind of move around all the time,"
00:08:05,00:08:06,and that's how we can see things.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"If they always stay completely still,"
00:08:08,00:08:10,you won't be able to see anything.
00:08:10,00:08:12,"Now, pigeons and most birds don't have that."
00:08:12,00:08:15,And so the way they see things is by always moving their head
00:08:15,00:08:15,around.
00:08:15,00:08:16,Yes.
00:08:16,00:08:18,And then when you put them on a treadmill--
00:08:18,00:08:18,Yeah.
00:08:18,00:08:20,--and that's why I stopped reading the article.
00:08:20,00:08:22,But where is the one?
00:08:22,00:08:23,That doesn't make--
00:08:23,00:08:27,The surroundings will stay the same if they're on a treadmill.
00:08:27,00:08:27,Who knows?
00:08:27,00:08:30,But they still got to see.
00:08:30,00:08:32,What if a threat comes?
00:08:32,00:08:34,"They can't just stop being able to see,"
00:08:34,00:08:35,because you put them on a treadmill.
00:08:35,00:08:39,"Well, when have you ever seen an eagle on a treadmill?"
00:08:39,00:08:40,"Mate, she's seen a pigeon submissile."
00:08:40,00:08:43,I think she's probably seen everything.
00:08:43,00:08:45,I go to a very specialist gym.
00:08:45,00:08:51,Sorry?
00:08:51,00:08:53,It's the other way around.
00:08:53,00:08:54,They put the treadmill on the bridge.
00:08:54,00:08:56,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:56,00:08:58,They do a forward submissile.
00:08:58,00:09:01,Which one are we wrong about?
00:09:01,00:09:11,[INAUDIBLE]
00:09:11,00:09:12,"You know, most comedy gives you go to."
00:09:12,00:09:15,"It's just, you're a shit."
00:09:15,00:09:17,"Do you know, I think that was a long wind of wave saying"
00:09:17,00:09:18,you're a shit to be honest.
00:09:18,00:09:26,So another use for pigeons.
00:09:26,00:09:27,Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:30,You can use pigeons as fireworks.
00:09:30,00:09:31,What?
00:09:31,00:09:33,But it's frowned on.
00:09:33,00:09:34,It's very much not frowned on.
00:09:34,00:09:38,And the reason is that fireworks are very bad for the environment.
00:09:38,00:09:39,OK.
00:09:39,00:09:42,"So what you can do, but if you still want lights in the sky,"
00:09:42,00:09:44,"and you don't mind a little bit of animal cruelty,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,then you can attach--
00:09:46,00:09:49,Keep talking.
00:09:49,00:09:52,You can attach lights to the legs of trained pigeons
00:09:52,00:09:54,and get them to fly in certain formations.
00:09:54,00:09:55,"And it gives you the lights in the sky,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,but without the fireworks stuff.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"Oh, that's cool."
00:09:58,00:09:59,That's very cool.
00:09:59,00:10:01,That happened in Brooklyn a few years ago.
00:10:01,00:10:02,Cool.
00:10:02,00:10:04,We need to move on in a second to our next fact.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"Oh, I've got a few more things about the way"
00:10:06,00:10:08,"is animal sea, because it's about animal vision."
00:10:08,00:10:10,So I never knew this before.
00:10:10,00:10:12,Swallowtail butterflies.
00:10:12,00:10:14,There is a particular species of butterfly.
00:10:14,00:10:18,They have eyes on their penises
00:10:18,00:10:22,to help them position themselves during sex.
00:10:22,00:10:25,"And the females also have genital eyes,"
00:10:25,00:10:28,so they can position themselves.
00:10:28,00:10:28,And they try--
00:10:28,00:10:31,They kind of make sense when you think they're there.
00:10:31,00:10:31,Yeah.
00:10:31,00:10:33,And they make-- because they also--
00:10:33,00:10:35,You could just attach your GoPro to yours.
00:10:35,00:10:39,And then they would do the same thing.
00:10:39,00:10:42,These problem for these butterflies
00:10:42,00:10:44,is they mate facing away from each other.
00:10:44,00:10:46,"So it's very hard for them to know, even"
00:10:46,00:10:49,if they're in the same room as the partner.
00:10:49,00:10:52,And the way they found this out was
00:10:52,00:10:57,that they tried blindfolding Swallowtail butterfly penises.
00:10:57,00:11:00,And they found that a successful mating collapsed.
00:11:00,00:11:02,"Oh, my God."
00:11:02,00:11:04,Wow.
00:11:04,00:11:06,Do they use the eyes for other things?
00:11:06,00:11:08,"Like, if you're married, can they be like,"
00:11:08,00:11:13,I saw you throw that in the non-recycling bin.
00:11:13,00:11:15,But what will you do with your cock at the recycling bin?
00:11:20,00:11:23,"OK, we should probably move on to our next fact."
00:11:23,00:11:25,I don't know what's going on tonight.
00:11:25,00:11:26,This is--
00:11:26,00:11:33,It is time for fact number two.
00:11:33,00:11:35,And that is my fact.
00:11:35,00:11:39,My fact this week is that concrete is stronger
00:11:39,00:11:42,if you make it with carrots.
00:11:42,00:11:44,This is a new finding.
00:11:44,00:11:46,This is from Lancaster University.
00:11:46,00:11:48,And they did these tests where they
00:11:48,00:11:51,started blending up extracts from carrots and other root
00:11:51,00:11:56,vegetables into just a household blender with concrete.
00:11:56,00:11:57,And they mixed it up.
00:11:57,00:11:58,And they used it.
00:11:58,00:12:01,And they found that it has incredible--
00:12:01,00:12:03,"it has resistance to cracks, which is far higher"
00:12:03,00:12:06,than you would get in your average concrete.
00:12:06,00:12:09,And it's 80% stronger than what you would buy in a shop
00:12:09,00:12:11,as an average concrete.
00:12:11,00:12:13,"So this is in early stages for testing,"
00:12:13,00:12:17,but possibly the concrete of the future will be carrot based.
00:12:17,00:12:17,That's really good.
00:12:17,00:12:19,And one big advantage of it is when
00:12:19,00:12:22,"you put these little molecules in there,"
00:12:22,00:12:24,"because they're like plants, basically,"
00:12:24,00:12:27,they can lock up more CO2 than normal concrete would do.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"So actually, it's good for the environments as well."
00:12:29,00:12:31,"Oh, that is good."
00:12:31,00:12:34,"Yeah, massively, because concrete is very bad for the environment."
00:12:34,00:12:35,"Yeah, it is."
00:12:35,00:12:36,It's really bad.
00:12:36,00:12:37,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:37,00:12:39,"It's very, very bad."
00:12:39,00:12:43,You don't need to tell the people about how bad concrete is.
00:12:43,00:12:47,"Get this. So humans have been making concrete for 9,000 years."
00:12:47,00:12:49,And that's-- yeah.
00:12:49,00:12:51,But the oldest concrete in the world
00:12:51,00:12:54,is 12 million years old.
00:12:54,00:12:56,Wait.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Yes.
00:12:57,00:12:58,It is.
00:12:58,00:13:02,Was that the same person from before?
00:13:02,00:13:04,She won't believe anything we say.
00:13:04,00:13:08,"On nemesis, the expert in everything has arrived."
00:13:08,00:13:10,Who was making that then?
00:13:10,00:13:14,"Pigeons. No, no."
00:13:14,00:13:15,It's naturally occurring.
00:13:15,00:13:19,So it's from a place where there was some limestone
00:13:19,00:13:21,and some oil combusted naturally.
00:13:21,00:13:23,I think it's in Israel is where this site has been found.
00:13:23,00:13:25,And they found this basically natural concrete.
00:13:25,00:13:26,That's really good.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"Is it, presumably, it's bad for the environment,"
00:13:28,00:13:30,"so I'll just go back to that, because there's just so much of it."
00:13:30,00:13:32,So it's the manufacturing process.
00:13:32,00:13:35,"It produces a lot of carbon dioxide, the manufacturing."
00:13:35,00:13:38,"Yeah, because I didn't realize it is the most widely used"
00:13:38,00:13:40,"material in the world, concrete."
00:13:40,00:13:41,Which is kind of extraordinary.
00:13:41,00:13:43,And they do this amazing thing with it.
00:13:43,00:13:47,"So I was reading about the building of the Burj Khalifa, which"
00:13:47,00:13:49,"is still the tallest building in the world, isn't it?"
00:13:49,00:13:50,The Burj Khalifa.
00:13:50,00:13:54,And so that is six-- so that's almost entirely made of concrete.
00:13:54,00:13:58,"And the way they do it, the way they get concrete to the top of it,"
00:13:58,00:14:00,used to be that you'd have these big blocks of concrete.
00:14:00,00:14:02,And you'd have to transport them to the top of a building
00:14:02,00:14:03,and dump them on top.
00:14:03,00:14:06,But now there's the technology for you
00:14:06,00:14:09,to pump up liquid concrete to the top of a building.
00:14:09,00:14:12,"And so they had a vertical concrete tube,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"and they just pump up concrete, 606 meters."
00:14:15,00:14:17,It's incredible.
00:14:17,00:14:18,So you need an enormous amount of pressure
00:14:18,00:14:20,for this fluid to be pumped.
00:14:20,00:14:22,"But yeah, and there's obviously the technology behind that"
00:14:22,00:14:22,is bizarre.
00:14:22,00:14:27,"Like, even carrying this tube, carrying the weight of 606 meters"
00:14:27,00:14:29,worth of concrete is pretty incredible.
00:14:29,00:14:31,And I was really an interviewer and engineer who
00:14:31,00:14:32,"worked on it, actually."
00:14:32,00:14:35,And he was explaining how they trialled the system
00:14:35,00:14:37,on the Burj Khalifa by doing it horizontally
00:14:37,00:14:39,through pipes in the desert first.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"And then he said they had to source the pump from Germany,"
00:14:42,00:14:46,"obviously, he said, we used a good German pump"
00:14:46,00:14:49,from someone who's stuck out.
00:14:49,00:14:58,"And the pump itself is called Putzmeister, which, as he pointed out,"
00:14:58,00:15:02,is a great name for a pump.
00:15:02,00:15:04,So the Putzmeister made the Burj Khalifa.
00:15:04,00:15:08,"Speaking of concrete, Dan, do you know any animals"
00:15:08,00:15:11,that can dig through concrete?
00:15:11,00:15:12,I do.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"Because you've said this once on the podcast, haven't you?"
00:15:14,00:15:18,I have said this on the podcast.
00:15:18,00:15:23,"So here's the fact, which these three question the truth of."
00:15:23,00:15:26,"If you corner a badger in a car park,"
00:15:26,00:15:30,it can escape you by digging through the concrete within--
00:15:30,00:15:34,"yes, way-- within 30 seconds."
00:15:34,00:15:35,That's very strong.
00:15:35,00:15:36,Yeah.
00:15:36,00:15:38,That is a concrete abadge.
00:15:38,00:15:39,"Yeah, it's impossible."
00:15:39,00:15:39,Why?
00:15:39,00:15:41,They've got incredibly sharp nails.
00:15:41,00:15:41,I bet they have.
00:15:41,00:15:43,But they have.
00:15:43,00:15:44,Of course they have.
00:15:44,00:15:46,But concrete's really hard.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"Anyway, I'm going to hand over to my colleague"
00:15:48,00:15:50,who I think has more information than me.
00:15:50,00:15:52,"So I know that you've said this on the podcast,"
00:15:52,00:15:55,and we always take the Mickey out of you for it.
00:15:55,00:15:57,But I did find that there is an animal that
00:15:57,00:15:58,can dig through concrete.
00:15:58,00:16:00,And that is the Indian pangolin.
00:16:00,00:16:02,And they have been reported digging through concrete
00:16:02,00:16:03,and into houses.
00:16:03,00:16:05,They have extremely powerful claws
00:16:05,00:16:09,that they would normally use for opening up thermite nests.
00:16:09,00:16:11,So there is an animal that can dig through concrete.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"Wait, so do you believe that?"
00:16:13,00:16:14,"Well, this is true."
00:16:14,00:16:21,Let's put facts aside for a second.
00:16:21,00:16:26,And I was also looking into if there was any--
00:16:26,00:16:28,"I really, really did look to see if badgers"
00:16:28,00:16:29,could go through concrete.
00:16:29,00:16:30,I really did look.
00:16:30,00:16:32,And the best I could find is there
00:16:32,00:16:34,was a story in the news a few years ago
00:16:34,00:16:36,about an American badger who was captured
00:16:36,00:16:38,burying the carcass of a cow.
00:16:38,00:16:40,"Oh, it was a true concrete."
00:16:40,00:16:43,But he just basically found his dead cow.
00:16:43,00:16:46,And he spent about three or four nights digging a hole
00:16:46,00:16:48,so that he could put the cow into it
00:16:48,00:16:50,and then cover it all over so that no one could find it.
00:16:50,00:16:50,Exactly.
00:16:50,00:16:53,It's to stop predators from being able to eat it.
00:16:53,00:16:55,"So they think, oh, it's not like a dead cow was here."
00:16:55,00:16:55,"Oh, it's gone."
00:16:55,00:16:56,And then they go away.
00:16:56,00:16:59,And then the badger will go down underneath and eat it.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"See, I know a lot about badgers."
00:17:01,00:17:04,So I'm telling you that this is a true thing.
00:17:04,00:17:06,Have you guys heard of--
00:17:06,00:17:08,"this is not the technical term, but ""crunchable concrete."""
00:17:08,00:17:09,No.
00:17:09,00:17:11,This is-- I find this amazing.
00:17:11,00:17:15,So do you remember there's been some cases where
00:17:15,00:17:17,"planes, as they've landed or are taking off,"
00:17:17,00:17:19,have overshot the runway?
00:17:19,00:17:21,"That's a big problem, because there's no method"
00:17:21,00:17:22,to stop them at that kind of speed.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"So a concrete has been invented,"
00:17:24,00:17:26,"which has been nicknamed ""crunchable concrete,"""
00:17:26,00:17:28,"has been around for a while, which"
00:17:28,00:17:33,is it's an extra stretch of a runway for an airport.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"But the concrete is made a bit softer, which"
00:17:36,00:17:38,means it can't hold the weight of an airplane.
00:17:38,00:17:40,"So as soon as the airplane overshoots,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,"and it goes on to this crunchable concrete,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"it's the equivalent of, say, riding a bicycle"
00:17:44,00:17:46,that you can't stop into sand.
00:17:46,00:17:49,It slowly starts slowing you down by the fact
00:17:49,00:17:51,that you are slowly dipping into it.
00:17:51,00:17:52,And that's the thing that they have at many airports
00:17:52,00:17:53,around the world.
00:17:53,00:17:54,Wow.
00:17:54,00:17:54,That's really clever.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"Surprise, Mark."
00:17:56,00:18:01,Do you know why washing machines are so heavy?
00:18:01,00:18:03,Is it because they have concrete in them?
00:18:03,00:18:05,Yes.
00:18:05,00:18:08,"No, I've told this the wrong way around."
00:18:08,00:18:10,Have you just think of any household items
00:18:10,00:18:12,that might have concrete in it?
00:18:12,00:18:12,Brilliant.
00:18:12,00:18:14,Yes.
00:18:14,00:18:16,Is it a washing machine?
00:18:16,00:18:18,"Yeah, it's a washing machine."
00:18:18,00:18:20,"I didn't know this, and this is a bit sort of--"
00:18:20,00:18:21,I've never heard this.
00:18:21,00:18:22,I've not heard this.
00:18:22,00:18:23,This is not a very sexy fact.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"But most washing machines have, in the top of them,"
00:18:26,00:18:30,"a 25 kilo block of concrete, which"
00:18:30,00:18:32,is to hold it steady when it's spinning
00:18:32,00:18:34,in the later stages of the cycle.
00:18:34,00:18:35,That's what makes a washing machine so heavy.
00:18:35,00:18:37,"They're not very heavy, except they've all"
00:18:37,00:18:39,got this massive lump of concrete.
00:18:39,00:18:41,And this is obviously very inefficient
00:18:41,00:18:44,"because transporting washing machines,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"because they're so heavy, it uses a lot more fuel."
00:18:46,00:18:50,So a student in Nottingham has invented--
00:18:50,00:18:52,or he's thought of this system--
00:18:52,00:18:56,where you replace the concrete with an empty plastic container.
00:18:56,00:18:59,And then you can just fill that up with water
00:18:59,00:19:01,when you need 25 kilos weight at the top of the machine.
00:19:01,00:19:04,And then you can just empty it out at the end of the cycle.
00:19:04,00:19:05,So it's lighter to transport.
00:19:05,00:19:07,It would save thousands of tons of carbon dioxide
00:19:07,00:19:08,just shipping it around.
00:19:08,00:19:09,We don't need just thought of that.
00:19:09,00:19:11,We only just thought of that.
00:19:11,00:19:16,We need to put pigeons on more and actually apply us to sign jobs.
00:19:16,00:19:17,We have to move on in a second.
00:19:17,00:19:20,"Oh, concrete-- you know, reinforced concrete."
00:19:20,00:19:23,"Most buildings with concrete are made of reinforced concrete,"
00:19:23,00:19:25,which is concrete with big metal bars all the way
00:19:25,00:19:27,through a metal framework.
00:19:27,00:19:30,That was initially used only for flower pots.
00:19:30,00:19:32,No one thought of using it for buildings.
00:19:32,00:19:33,Wow.
00:19:33,00:19:33,Yeah.
00:19:33,00:19:34,That's amazing.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"There was a French gardener contrastive money,"
00:19:36,00:19:38,and he was unhappy with the flower pots available to him.
00:19:38,00:19:40,"And he thought, I need a really tough flower pot."
00:19:40,00:19:42,And he devised a new version with steel mesh.
00:19:42,00:19:44,And that was the first reinforced concrete.
00:19:44,00:19:47,"Just quickly on water and concrete,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,water actually is really good for concrete at the start.
00:19:49,00:19:51,So it hardens it because it's having the concrete reacts
00:19:51,00:19:53,with the water and it causes it to harden.
00:19:53,00:19:56,But this is actually related to something
00:19:56,00:19:59,"we've said on the show before, which I have to update."
00:19:59,00:20:02,"So in episode 44, we pointed out that"
00:20:02,00:20:04,Roman concrete is better than ours.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"So concrete that was made 2,000, more than 2,000 years ago,"
00:20:07,00:20:08,is stronger than ours.
00:20:08,00:20:09,And we don't know why.
00:20:09,00:20:11,And we have since found out why.
00:20:11,00:20:13,And it's because it's made of this combination
00:20:13,00:20:18,"of volcanic ash and seawater and lumps of volcanic rock,"
00:20:18,00:20:19,which is called potelana.
00:20:19,00:20:23,And the volcanic rock actually reacts with the seawater.
00:20:23,00:20:25,And it hardens it.
00:20:25,00:20:27,So the seawater creates different chemical bonds
00:20:27,00:20:30,within the concrete and it hardens it.
00:20:30,00:20:32,So we know how they did that now.
00:20:32,00:20:33,"So does that mean, sorry, to interrupt?"
00:20:33,00:20:36,"Does that mean at the start, it wasn't as good as ours."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"And over the years, it's gotten much better."
00:20:38,00:20:39,Because the seawater has hardened it.
00:20:39,00:20:41,"It was basically jelly, the pantheon at the start."
00:20:41,00:20:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:44,00:20:46,"The pantheon is still 2,000 years old."
00:20:46,00:20:49,The largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world.
00:20:49,00:20:50,It is incredible.
00:20:50,00:20:54,And then we just forgot how to make proper concrete.
00:20:54,00:20:57,"And we've just remembered, so that's celebrate."
00:20:57,00:21:00,[APPLAUSE]
00:21:00,00:21:03,"OK, it is time for us to move on to fact number three."
00:21:03,00:21:05,And that is James.
00:21:05,00:21:08,"OK, my fact this week is that head allows clinics."
00:21:08,00:21:14,Always see an uptick in business when a new Pixar movie comes out.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Why is this?
00:21:15,00:21:17,Is it because children are sitting near each other or changing?
00:21:17,00:21:20,"Well, to children all in the same place."
00:21:20,00:21:22,You're going to get lots of nits and headlights.
00:21:22,00:21:24,And this is a real thing.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"So this was an interview with a lady called Melissa Shalide,"
00:21:26,00:21:30,who owns two hair salons in California.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"And she says that whenever these children movies come out,"
00:21:33,00:21:34,you get all children who go together
00:21:34,00:21:37,and the lice they go from one head to another.
00:21:37,00:21:38,And it's not just that.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"It's selfies is another thing, which"
00:21:40,00:21:43,is causing lots of head lice in young people.
00:21:43,00:21:46,Another thing is playing on a sports team.
00:21:46,00:21:49,"So when you get in a huddle, if they like to jump"
00:21:49,00:21:52,"between one head and another, and also during Halloween,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,because people try on Halloween costumes
00:21:54,00:21:56,and they just pass them on to each other.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"Although we should say so, they don't jump."
00:21:58,00:21:59,They don't jump.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"So they don't jump from one head to another, which is something"
00:22:01,00:22:05,"I always find bizarre that I don't have children,"
00:22:05,00:22:09,so I don't know if they spend their time rubbing heads constantly.
00:22:09,00:22:12,But I just can't believe that happens that often.
00:22:12,00:22:13,So they can't jump.
00:22:13,00:22:14,They can't fly.
00:22:14,00:22:16,They just have to walk.
00:22:16,00:22:18,And children are jamming their heads together long enough.
00:22:18,00:22:20,All these things are just walkie-walkie-walkie.
00:22:20,00:22:21,Yeah.
00:22:21,00:22:22,On to another head.
00:22:22,00:22:26,"I always had head lice in Australia, like constantly."
00:22:26,00:22:30,I had like in my genuinely constantly in my bathroom.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"I had a normal brush, and I had my head lice brush."
00:22:32,00:22:35,"Every day, I would just do a quick extra swoop."
00:22:35,00:22:38,And I can't remember putting my head next to other heads.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"Oh, thank God for that."
00:22:40,00:22:42,But what was I doing with it?
00:22:42,00:22:43,"Because I'd get rid of it, it'd be gone."
00:22:43,00:22:45,"And then suddenly, I'm capped in lice again."
00:22:45,00:22:48,And I don't know what that was.
00:22:48,00:22:49,"Yeah, weird."
00:22:49,00:22:50,I became quite fond of them.
00:22:50,00:22:53,"I became quite fond of them, really."
00:22:53,00:22:53,Yeah.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"Because you can see with lice, if they--"
00:22:55,00:22:57,"because they suck on blood, obviously."
00:22:57,00:22:58,You can see the bit of red that fills it up.
00:22:58,00:23:01,And I would-- mine were well fed.
00:23:01,00:23:03,"Well, the other thing with head lice"
00:23:03,00:23:06,is not everyone gets itchy with them.
00:23:06,00:23:08,It's only if you're allergic to the saliva
00:23:08,00:23:10,that you get head lice.
00:23:10,00:23:10,You winch your heads.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"And actually, that is most people."
00:23:12,00:23:14,But there are some people who aren't allergic to it.
00:23:14,00:23:16,And those people wouldn't know that they had head lice
00:23:16,00:23:19,until the head starts crawling around.
00:23:19,00:23:19,"Yes, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:20,OK.
00:23:20,00:23:24,"But we should say, you listening to this now,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,you will feel your head itching now.
00:23:27,00:23:28,That is normal.
00:23:28,00:23:29,You don't have lice.
00:23:29,00:23:33,There is a condition called delusional parasitosis
00:23:33,00:23:35,where you think you're infested even if you're not.
00:23:35,00:23:36,So that's a proper condition.
00:23:36,00:23:41,But what you're feeling is normal.
00:23:41,00:23:43,Although we've got-- so we've got three kinds of lice.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"We've got head lice, which live in the hair."
00:23:46,00:23:49,"There are body lice, which actually live in the seams"
00:23:49,00:23:50,of your clothing.
00:23:50,00:23:53,"So as long as you change your clothing more than once a month,"
00:23:53,00:23:55,you're basically fine.
00:23:55,00:23:59,What's the date today?
00:23:59,00:24:03,"And of course, there's our old chums, the pubic lice."
00:24:03,00:24:06,Why are you?
00:24:06,00:24:09,"As they get called, trouser shrimps."
00:24:09,00:24:11,So--
00:24:11,00:24:14,But they are two branches of the same family
00:24:14,00:24:18,"that they split about 80,000 years ago."
00:24:18,00:24:21,"And one went north and one went south, basically."
00:24:21,00:24:25,And they can't-- this is something I found out.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"Because they are now so different in their physicality,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"apparently, they won't interbreed"
00:24:30,00:24:34,except under laboratory conditions.
00:24:34,00:24:36,So you can make it happen when there's
00:24:36,00:24:39,a nice sofa there for them to have.
00:24:39,00:24:42,"I think they can't go on the other part of hair,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"because the claws are the wrong shapes, right?"
00:24:44,00:24:45,"Yeah, is that right?"
00:24:45,00:24:46,"Yeah, they're the wrong size."
00:24:46,00:24:49,"Yeah, what's interesting, as well, is that as we get older,"
00:24:49,00:24:53,"as we become adults, our heads become a bit more acidic"
00:24:53,00:24:54,and lice don't like that.
00:24:54,00:24:57,That's why they're predominantly found in children.
00:24:57,00:24:59,And so you get any groups of children getting together.
00:24:59,00:25:00,That happens.
00:25:00,00:25:02,And James read out a list of places
00:25:02,00:25:03,where that is likely to happen.
00:25:03,00:25:06,Another place that happened was on the set of Harry Potter
00:25:06,00:25:07,and the Chamber of Secrets.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"Oh, no."
00:25:08,00:25:09,Yeah.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"The kids, all of the kids, got so infested"
00:25:11,00:25:13,with a lice outbreak that was happening
00:25:13,00:25:15,that they had to hold to them.
00:25:15,00:25:19,"That's why in the third film, they've all got shaved heads."
00:25:19,00:25:22,I never thought of that before.
00:25:22,00:25:24,"Yeah, it's not in the books."
00:25:24,00:25:26,"So yeah, so they had to halt filming"
00:25:26,00:25:29,and they brought nurses in who had to spend ages
00:25:29,00:25:30,delousing them all.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"And they have specific nurses, apparently."
00:25:33,00:25:36,"So there are lice doctors, which is, in fact,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"lice doctors is one chain of lice pickers,"
00:25:38,00:25:41,"professional lice pickers, and they're one of many."
00:25:41,00:25:43,"And in fact, there was a study into lice,"
00:25:43,00:25:47,into how immune they are to various treatments in 2015.
00:25:47,00:25:51,"And they recruited lots of professional lice comers,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,"which is weird, because you don't have to be very skilled"
00:25:53,00:25:54,to comb lice out of your hair.
00:25:54,00:25:56,But this is what people are doing.
00:25:56,00:25:57,This is present day.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"Present day, yeah."
00:25:58,00:26:00,"Because in the Victorian times, there was a role in hospitals"
00:26:00,00:26:04,"which was chief bug catcher, and it was for lice."
00:26:04,00:26:07,"And they, at the time, in the 18th century,"
00:26:07,00:26:11,were paid more than surgeons were paid.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"According to a very good source, Lindsay E. Fitzpatrick,"
00:26:14,00:26:18,"who writes about this era and medical curiosities,"
00:26:18,00:26:19,"she said that there was a guy called Andrew Cook,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,"who claimed to have cleaned up more than 20,000 beds"
00:26:22,00:26:25,that were all lice ridden.
00:26:25,00:26:26,"And yes, it was a huge--"
00:26:26,00:26:27,It makes sense.
00:26:27,00:26:29,It was a massive disease cause.
00:26:29,00:26:30,"I mean, you would focus on that."
00:26:30,00:26:31,But we should be clear.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Headlights can't do anything.
00:26:32,00:26:33,I don't know why people make such a fuss about them.
00:26:33,00:26:35,They can't harm you at all.
00:26:35,00:26:38,"And in fact, other cultures and other people in history"
00:26:38,00:26:40,have been much more sensible about them.
00:26:40,00:26:43,So they used to be given as gifts between friends and lovers.
00:26:43,00:26:44,So for sure.
00:26:44,00:26:45,What?
00:26:45,00:26:49,There's a thing in the Aztec period.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"Montezuma, you know, the great Aztec emperor,"
00:26:52,00:26:53,he used to collect lice.
00:26:53,00:26:55,And people would give them to him as offerings.
00:26:55,00:26:58,"And in fact, he eventually employed someone"
00:26:58,00:27:00,to go and collect head lice off his subjects
00:27:00,00:27:03,and bring them to him so he could keep them in boxes.
00:27:03,00:27:06,"So I think, in fact, when the Europeans got there,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,they saw all these all-nate boxes.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"And thought, you must have pearls and jewelry in there."
00:27:10,00:27:11,And they opened them.
00:27:11,00:27:13,They were just full of dead lice.
00:27:13,00:27:15,Because it was a nice thing to collect.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"Well, apparently with the Incas,"
00:27:17,00:27:19,there was a thing of tax collectors at the time.
00:27:19,00:27:22,"And one of the things for older people who, for goods,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,"bought and so on, they didn't want to tax as highly,"
00:27:24,00:27:27,it would be a symbolic handing over of lice to them.
00:27:27,00:27:28,"As a, that would be the tax."
00:27:28,00:27:30,You can have six of my lice.
00:27:30,00:27:31,"To be introduced, post-Brexit, actually,"
00:27:31,00:27:35,when no one can afford actual money.
00:27:35,00:27:36,I'm going to be rich.
00:27:36,00:27:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:38,00:27:41,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:27:41,00:27:43,And that is Anna.
00:27:43,00:27:47,"My fact this week is that, in 1926, Poland"
00:27:47,00:27:50,sent the US a birthday card that was signed
00:27:50,00:27:54,"by a sixth of its population, which was very generous."
00:27:54,00:27:55,That's incredible.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Of them.
00:27:56,00:27:57,So this was this amazing moment.
00:27:57,00:28:01,It was back in the time when Poland was incredibly grateful
00:28:01,00:28:03,to America because it considered America
00:28:03,00:28:06,as having basically saved its skin in First World War
00:28:06,00:28:11,and given it independence for the first time in about 150 years.
00:28:11,00:28:14,"And so it-- and then afterwards, Poland"
00:28:14,00:28:17,"would have been destitute, as would almost all of Europe"
00:28:17,00:28:19,had America not given a lot of charity money.
00:28:19,00:28:24,"So as this thank you, they sent a 30,000-page long card"
00:28:24,00:28:25,on the 4th of July.
00:28:25,00:28:26,"30,000 pages?"
00:28:26,00:28:27,"It was 30,000 pages long."
00:28:27,00:28:29,Or it was actually late because it took a long time
00:28:29,00:28:30,to get the signatures.
00:28:30,00:28:32,So it arrived in October.
00:28:32,00:28:34,It was meant to arrive on the 4th of July.
00:28:34,00:28:37,"We all do that for birthdays, that's fine."
00:28:37,00:28:39,"I was just thinking in the office, whenever it's someone's birthday,"
00:28:39,00:28:42,"and they give you a card, and you have to sign it."
00:28:42,00:28:45,And by the time five people have done all the different possible
00:28:45,00:28:48,"ways of saying happy birthday, you've got nothing left to say,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,"what up to 30,000 people have said it?"
00:28:50,00:28:54,"Yeah, imagine the imagination of a 30,000-pull."
00:28:54,00:28:57,"Imagine having a great one to do, and you read through them all,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,and the last one before you finally hit it.
00:28:59,00:29:00,"No, wait, it's more than 30,000 people."
00:29:00,00:29:02,"Sorry, that's how many pages."
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:08,"So it was 30,000 pages, and it was 5.5 million people sign it."
00:29:08,00:29:09,What?
00:29:09,00:29:10,It's really got around.
00:29:10,00:29:15,They delivered it in the form of 111 bound volumes.
00:29:15,00:29:19,"But it's quite useful now, because it's all been digitized,"
00:29:19,00:29:24,"and Polish Americans can do family history research,"
00:29:24,00:29:27,"and they can look up where their ancestors were,"
00:29:27,00:29:29,and which cities and towns they came from.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"But the thing is, a lot of the people who signed"
00:29:31,00:29:34,were children who were being forced to sign it.
00:29:34,00:29:36,"Yeah, they sent blank pages."
00:29:36,00:29:38,"So they had this massive book they were going to send,"
00:29:38,00:29:41,and various pages went to various different bits of Poland.
00:29:41,00:29:46,"And they sent it to the army, and to cycling clubs,"
00:29:46,00:29:47,and to banks.
00:29:47,00:29:50,"Loot singers, apparently, gave a very good offering,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,and they all sent back stuff that was quite personal to them.
00:29:52,00:29:54,So some of Poland's most famous artists
00:29:54,00:29:56,did works of art in there.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Cool.
00:29:57,00:30:01,"Just some greeting cards, and being sent a lot of them."
00:30:01,00:30:03,Do you know there's a Guinness World record for the person
00:30:03,00:30:05,who has received most--
00:30:05,00:30:06,"OK, look at those birthday cards."
00:30:06,00:30:08,Most get well cards.
00:30:08,00:30:10,"Oh, get well cards, yeah."
00:30:10,00:30:13,"So just for the idea of being sent a card,"
00:30:13,00:30:14,there's a Guinness World record.
00:30:14,00:30:15,It's a guy called Craig Shurgold.
00:30:15,00:30:18,"He was very ill, and his friends decided"
00:30:18,00:30:23,"to do a chain letter, and this was, I think, in 1991,"
00:30:23,00:30:25,"that went out on the internet that said,"
00:30:25,00:30:28,"send a get well card or a greeting card to Craig,"
00:30:28,00:30:31,and let him know that you're thinking of him.
00:30:31,00:30:36,"He eventually, by May 1991, received 33 million cards."
00:30:36,00:30:38,It just went so massive.
00:30:38,00:30:39,It went so big.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"But the biggest problem was, is that he actually"
00:30:41,00:30:43,"got better, which was fantastic."
00:30:43,00:30:44,It was amazing.
00:30:44,00:30:46,And he was really ill.
00:30:46,00:30:48,"He shouldn't have got better by, according to the doctors."
00:30:48,00:30:49,And he did.
00:30:49,00:30:50,It's fantastic.
00:30:50,00:30:54,The doctor is doing back flips all over the place.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Are you happy that I'm better?
00:30:55,00:30:59,"No, no, these are all involuntary."
00:30:59,00:31:00,"No, but so he received."
00:31:00,00:31:04,"In that time, 33 million, but the chain letter"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"kept going around to different countries,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,the name kept changing on it as well.
00:31:08,00:31:12,So he just kept receiving different bits of cards
00:31:12,00:31:14,from people all around the world.
00:31:14,00:31:18,"And so it said that since 1989, he has now"
00:31:18,00:31:22,received 350 million greeting cards.
00:31:22,00:31:23,"It got, unfortunately, he died when"
00:31:23,00:31:27,he was crushed to death by a big pile of greeting cards.
00:31:27,00:31:30,It got so big that the royal mail gave him
00:31:30,00:31:32,"his own postal code for his house,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,because it was just such a deluge.
00:31:35,00:31:38,And he used to give interviews about how exciting it wasn't
00:31:38,00:31:38,stuff.
00:31:38,00:31:39,He doesn't.
00:31:39,00:31:41,He's gone behind the scenes now.
00:31:41,00:31:42,He's not a public figure.
00:31:42,00:31:44,The only time he really comes out and talks to the press
00:31:44,00:31:48,"is to say, please stop sending me comments."
00:31:48,00:31:52,"Well, at least you haven't republicized it tonight."
00:31:52,00:31:54,There were a couple of guys in 2016.
00:31:54,00:31:57,"They were American inventors, sort of inventors"
00:31:57,00:31:59,of fun silly products.
00:31:59,00:32:00,They came up with a greetings card
00:32:00,00:32:02,that you can send to new parents.
00:32:02,00:32:05,And it has a button inside.
00:32:05,00:32:06,"And when you press it, it starts"
00:32:06,00:32:09,"to play the sound of a baby screaming,"
00:32:09,00:32:13,"which lasts for three hours, and which will keep going,"
00:32:13,00:32:16,even if you destroy the card.
00:32:16,00:32:18,"And every time you press the button again to make it stop,"
00:32:18,00:32:20,it gets slightly louder.
00:32:20,00:32:24,Wow.
00:32:24,00:32:27,And where can I buy this card?
00:32:27,00:32:28,They sold out.
00:32:28,00:32:29,I don't know.
00:32:29,00:32:31,That is amazing.
00:32:31,00:32:35,That should actually win an award
00:32:35,00:32:38,in the International Cards Award Ceremony.
00:32:38,00:32:39,That is the best card I've ever heard of.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Is that a thing?
00:32:40,00:32:41,And that is a thing.
00:32:41,00:32:44,So what do you get for congratulations
00:32:44,00:32:47,if you win it from your friends?
00:32:47,00:32:49,You get the screamer.
00:32:49,00:32:53,"No, this is the International greetings card awards competition"
00:32:53,00:32:56,"or the Louise, as they're known."
00:32:56,00:32:57,So they're held in America.
00:32:57,00:32:59,They have been since 1988.
00:32:59,00:33:01,And they seem to be quite a big deal.
00:33:01,00:33:04,They're named after the father or the grandfather
00:33:04,00:33:06,"of greetings cards, who was actually"
00:33:06,00:33:10,a German immigrant to America called Louise Prang.
00:33:10,00:33:14,And he made the first line of Christmas cards in about 1875.
00:33:14,00:33:16,"And so yeah, they have this big competition."
00:33:16,00:33:19,And the winners are announced in May
00:33:19,00:33:22,"during the National Stationary Show, which I know"
00:33:22,00:33:25,will all be attending next year.
00:33:25,00:33:26,"We've missed it this year, sadly."
00:33:26,00:33:28,It was a few days ago.
00:33:28,00:33:32,"But the greetings cards association director said,"
00:33:32,00:33:35,there is nothing like the genuine and lasting connection
00:33:35,00:33:38,you get from receiving and sending a greetings card.
00:33:38,00:33:44,"And he is called Pete Dockety, which I really like to think"
00:33:44,00:33:45,that Pete Dockety has been moonlighting
00:33:45,00:33:47,as the head of a greetings card.
00:33:47,00:33:50,"Well, baby shambles have played on this stage."
00:33:50,00:33:51,How do they?
00:33:51,00:33:51,"Yeah, really."
00:33:51,00:33:53,"Well, but not recently, because he's"
00:33:53,00:33:55,been very busy at the National Stationary Competition.
00:33:55,00:33:58,"Just on Christmas cards, just while we're talking about it."
00:33:58,00:34:01,"If you're an atheist or a skeptic, obviously,"
00:34:01,00:34:02,Christmas cards isn't your thing.
00:34:02,00:34:05,So there's an alternative that's been created.
00:34:05,00:34:08,And it is celebrating the fact that Isaac Newton
00:34:08,00:34:10,was born on the 25th of December.
00:34:10,00:34:13,So it's called Newtonmas.
00:34:13,00:34:15,And Newtonmas is a--
00:34:15,00:34:18,the skeptic society have a party around Christmas time.
00:34:18,00:34:19,And that's what it will celebrate.
00:34:19,00:34:22,And they send each other Newtonmas cards as well.
00:34:22,00:34:25,"And inside, it reads, ""Reasons greetings."""
00:34:25,00:34:29,[APPLAUSE]
00:34:29,00:34:31,The smallest greetings card in the world
00:34:31,00:34:34,is so small that you could fit 200 million of them
00:34:34,00:34:36,on a single stamp.
00:34:36,00:34:37,Wow.
00:34:37,00:34:40,It's been made by some scientists.
00:34:40,00:34:43,It's not a practical thing.
00:34:43,00:34:45,But there's also the world's biggest card.
00:34:45,00:34:47,So the world's biggest greetings card
00:34:47,00:34:50,is 18 meters tall and 13 meters across.
00:34:50,00:34:54,It was in India that it was created by a housing company
00:34:54,00:34:57,for more publicity.
00:34:57,00:35:00,"But so I found that on the biggest card,"
00:35:00,00:35:03,you could fit 46 million stamps.
00:35:03,00:35:04,So I wondered how many times you could
00:35:04,00:35:08,fit the smallest card in the world
00:35:08,00:35:09,onto the largest known card in the world.
00:35:09,00:35:11,And that's a simple multiplication.
00:35:11,00:35:12,Yes.
00:35:12,00:35:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:13,00:35:14,"Well, let's hear it anyway."
00:35:14,00:35:17,"Well, no, no, it's just simple multiplication."
00:35:17,00:35:19,It actually is a really big number.
00:35:19,00:35:22,And your calculator probably doesn't go that high.
00:35:22,00:35:23,My calculator didn't go that high.
00:35:23,00:35:25,I had to go to a special online calculator
00:35:25,00:35:28,and then really carefully check the answer
00:35:28,00:35:30,and that I thought I was getting it wrong.
00:35:30,00:35:30,I'm so sorry.
00:35:30,00:35:32,I've misjudged this whole situation.
00:35:32,00:35:33,That does sound quite good.
00:35:33,00:35:36,I feel like I have.
00:35:36,00:35:37,Just give us a fucking answer.
00:35:37,00:35:41,The smallest card ever made could fit on the largest card ever
00:35:41,00:35:45,"made 9,200 trillion times."
00:35:45,00:35:47,"Oh, is that all?"
00:35:47,00:35:50,Yeah.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"Anyway, that's a sum I did earlier today."
00:35:51,00:35:53,Cool.
00:35:53,00:35:57,"The oldest Valentine's card, the oldest Valentine's card in England,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,was from 1477.
00:35:59,00:36:03,"And it was from Marjorie Brews to her fiancé, John Pastin."
00:36:03,00:36:05,"And in it, she says a few things."
00:36:05,00:36:07,"And then she says, I beseech you that this bill"
00:36:07,00:36:10,be not seen by non-earthly creatures
00:36:10,00:36:12,save only yourself.
00:36:12,00:36:14,"Anyway, that's on display in the British Library."
00:36:14,00:36:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:16,00:36:21,"And we're going to have to wrap up, guys."
00:36:21,00:36:23,"Well, can I just do it like a really nice birthday card"
00:36:23,00:36:26,"facts from Britain, in fact, which is the--"
00:36:26,00:36:30,so Britain's two oldest men are called Al Smith and Bob
00:36:30,00:36:31,Waiten.
00:36:31,00:36:34,"And they're both 111 now, I think."
00:36:34,00:36:36,And they were born by coincidence
00:36:36,00:36:39,on the same day in 1908.
00:36:39,00:36:42,So Waiten sends Smith a birthday card every year.
00:36:42,00:36:44,And Smith sends Waiten a birthday card every year.
00:36:44,00:36:47,And they send these really sweet messages in them.
00:36:47,00:36:49,"So they interviewed one of them recently, actually."
00:36:49,00:36:51,"They interviewed Waiten on his birthday, which"
00:36:51,00:36:53,was the day we were supposed to leave the EU.
00:36:53,00:36:54,And he said--
00:36:54,00:36:55,Which one?
00:36:55,00:36:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:58,00:37:00,I've lost track.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"He actually said, 111 year old man said,"
00:37:02,00:37:05,my own feeling is that there were defects.
00:37:05,00:37:08,But we shouldn't negotiate from the inside rather than walking
00:37:08,00:37:10,"off the field with the cricket ball and saying,"
00:37:10,00:37:11,I'm not playing.
00:37:11,00:37:13,Which didn't make me think we should start having
00:37:13,00:37:15,over 100-year-olds in government.
00:37:15,00:37:16,But they sent each other these sweet cards.
00:37:16,00:37:19,"So he sent the other guy cards saying, do keep in touch."
00:37:19,00:37:21,I wish we'd known about each other earlier.
00:37:21,00:37:23,And then we did it.
00:37:23,00:37:24,How much is that?
00:37:24,00:37:26,That is very cool.
00:37:26,00:37:29,"But if they'd known about each other like 50 years earlier,"
00:37:29,00:37:30,it would have just been two random men
00:37:30,00:37:32,sending each other cards for no reason.
00:37:32,00:37:33,Yes.
00:37:33,00:37:35,The whole ceremony can only function
00:37:35,00:37:37,because the two of them are the oldest men in the country.
00:37:37,00:37:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:40,00:37:42,I just saw one more thing.
00:37:42,00:37:44,No.
00:37:44,00:37:45,"Yeah, of course, of course."
00:37:45,00:37:46,Of course.
00:37:46,00:37:47,Just because this is about America's birth--
00:37:47,00:37:48,"It's not either the sum, is it?"
00:37:48,00:37:49,It's another sum.
00:37:49,00:37:51,"No, it's not."
00:37:51,00:37:52,"This is about America's birthday, right?"
00:37:52,00:37:55,"So the 1926 birthday, which was what?"
00:37:55,00:37:56,150 years of America.
00:37:56,00:38:00,So good calculation.
00:38:00,00:38:04,"Did you have to go online for that one, as well?"
00:38:04,00:38:07,"So 50 years before that would have been 1876,"
00:38:07,00:38:11,"which was the 100th birthday of America, right?"
00:38:11,00:38:13,This is not the fact.
00:38:13,00:38:14,This is not the fact.
00:38:14,00:38:15,It's just the setup.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:38:17,00:38:20,You sarcastic people.
00:38:20,00:38:21,Right.
00:38:21,00:38:23,So they celebrated with a thing called
00:38:23,00:38:25,the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.
00:38:25,00:38:28,"It was this massive, you know, thing"
00:38:28,00:38:30,"that affair, basically, they had a human achievement."
00:38:30,00:38:32,It was in Philadelphia.
00:38:32,00:38:36,10 million people visited a fifth of the American population.
00:38:36,00:38:37,There were massive displays.
00:38:37,00:38:38,They had all kinds of stuff.
00:38:38,00:38:40,The biggest building in the world.
00:38:40,00:38:42,It was where they first had Heinz catch up.
00:38:42,00:38:44,They first had--
00:38:44,00:38:46,"like, they had the arm of the Statue of Liberty"
00:38:46,00:38:48,because they hadn't afforded all the money
00:38:48,00:38:49,for the actual statue.
00:38:49,00:38:53,So you could just pay to go up the arm.
00:38:53,00:38:55,The best thing there was the inventions.
00:38:55,00:38:58,"And the inventions included the first typewriter,"
00:38:58,00:39:01,"Alexander Graham Bell's telephone, a calculator,"
00:39:01,00:39:03,"a mechanical calculator, which--"
00:39:03,00:39:06,"Now I see why you wanted to tell this fact,"
00:39:06,00:39:09,"which measured five foot by eight foot,"
00:39:09,00:39:13,which would have come in handy earlier today.
00:39:13,00:39:17,But the best invention was something called
00:39:17,00:39:20,"the convertible portmanteau, which was a suitcase made"
00:39:20,00:39:22,"of rubbercloth, which converted into a bath."
00:39:22,00:39:29,"If you were traveling and there were no baths available,"
00:39:29,00:39:32,you could just have your suitcase which folded into a bath.
00:39:32,00:39:36,"Well, your laptop's going to get wet."
00:39:36,00:39:38,"It feels like you do have to unpack the suitcase first,"
00:39:38,00:39:40,which you would never see.
00:39:40,00:39:43,I don't know all suitcase is converted into baths.
00:39:43,00:39:47,"If you want them to, I could run the tap in my suitcase."
00:39:47,00:39:50,"Yeah, I hadn't fully considered that."
00:39:50,00:39:52,Yeah.
00:39:52,00:39:55,"Well, look, thank you for that, eh?"
00:39:55,00:39:57,"OK, that is it."
00:39:57,00:39:58,That is all of our facts.
00:39:58,00:40:00,Thank you so much for listening.
00:40:00,00:40:03,If you would like to get in contact with any of us
00:40:03,00:40:04,about the things that we have said over the course
00:40:04,00:40:07,"of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts."
00:40:07,00:40:09,"I'm on our Schreiberland, Andy."

00:40:10,00:40:11,At James Harkin.

00:40:14,00:40:16,"Yep, or you can go to our group account, which"
00:40:16,00:40:18,is @nosuchthing or our website.
00:40:18,00:40:19,Nosuchthing is a fish.com.
00:40:19,00:40:22,We've got everything up there from our previous episodes.
00:40:22,00:40:23,We've got upcoming tour dates.
00:40:23,00:40:25,We have bits of merchandise.
00:40:25,00:40:26,"Thank you so much, Berlin."
00:40:26,00:40:28,That has been absolutely awesome.
00:40:28,00:40:29,We'll see you again.
00:40:29,00:40:30,Good night.
