 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,560
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,560
 from Berlin.

 [CHEERING]

00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,860
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,920
 I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,040
 and James Harkin.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,800
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,720
 And in a particular order, here, we go, starting with you.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,640
 Andy, my fact is that pigeons make better coast gods

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,640
 than people.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,120
 Well, in one specific way, what you're saying

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,840
 is they can fly down and pull people out of the sea, maybe.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,760
 Wouldn't that be nice?

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
 They look good in a red swimsuit.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,160
 No, they definitely do.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,280
 So this was an experiment that was

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,760
 done by the United States Coast Guard in 1976.

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,280
 They knew that pigeons have really good eyesight,

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,240
 and they started training them to spot people

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,440
 who were lost at sea.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,640
 So the coast god will fly up in a helicopter,

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,400
 and they had a little observation bubble

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,040
 on the bottom of the helicopter.

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,600
 And they put a pigeon in there, and the pigeon

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 was strapped on a special couch.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,000
 So like on a sofa, they were on a little mini sofa.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,760
 And you must have been half terrified

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,000
 and half very comfortable.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,240
 Yeah.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,080
 And they were trained these pigeons

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,480
 to, whenever they saw in the ocean below them, a tiny scrap

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,240
 of colored fabric, representing a person floating in the sea,

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
 they were trained to pick a button.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,160
 And that hit a light in the cockpit.

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,600
 And the pilot would know, OK, there might be someone down there.

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,200
 Pigeons could do it 93% of the time.

42
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,440
 They saw the bit of fabric.

43
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,200
 Humans only managed it 38% of the time.

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,720
 Wow.

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,120
 There's a huge difference.

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,400
 Although, wasn't there a thing in this where humans

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,640
 managed it 38% of the time, the first time round?

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,800
 And then they were told that the pigeons were beating them.

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,200
 And then the next time round, they managed it just over 50% of the time.

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
 Yeah, that's true.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
 That's crazy.

52
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,920
 It's a good way to motivate people as to tell them

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,360
 a pigeon is doing better than you at this, you know, over the game.

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,880
 OK.

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,600
 The thing, though, the problem is, is I didn't realize

56
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
 they were on sofas.

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,160
 The problem is, as a sofa, it's a very comfortable seating

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
 position that you often fall asleep in as you're hanging out.

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,880
 What they thought of this, so they're kidding.

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,760
 Well, were you on this scientific team, Dan?

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
 The pigeons in the helicopters, they

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,400
 had to be kept at a very specific level of hunger.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,840
 They needed to be kept ambitious for food.

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,240
 So that was how they did it.

65
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,440
 But it was really-- it was a very successful operation.

66
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,280
 And five years later, in 1981, it was officially

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,920
 recommended that pigeons should be inducted into the US Coast Guard.

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,800
 And that's why, if you're in the scene now,

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,920
 and you look back, you always see them on the top of those ladders,

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,880
 you don't know, on the beach, with their jackets.

71
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,600
 So exactly.

72
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,880
 Why are we not seeing that?

73
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,800
 I think technology improved, and pigeons

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,200
 have not improved at the same speed as technology.

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,880
 It was real shame.

76
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,120
 Also, couldn't they only spot--

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,560
 they were only trained to spot three colors, weren't they?

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,080
 Like, red-- was it red, orange, and yellow?

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
 They were trained to spot.

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,960
 So-- and that was the colors that they were trained to pick

81
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
 when they saw them out of sea.

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,760
 So it's only if someone is drowning, wearing red, orange,

83
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,960
 or yellow.

84
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,160
 Yeah, but those are three of the big colors.

85
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,160
 It's not like they trained them to spot move, and teal,

86
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,640
 and--

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
 No, you're right.

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,200
 --a serulian, that would obviously

89
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,480
 be a waste of resources.

90
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,160
 You're totally right.

91
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,320
 And also, if you're wearing blue, at sea,

92
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,720
 and you fall in, then--

93
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,440
 --if you're on fault.

94
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
 Yeah.

95
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,920
 [LAUGHTER]

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
 So pigeons are good at a lot of things.

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
 A lot of other things.

98
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,680
 They can be trained to identify breast cancer

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,040
 by looking at images of biopsies.

100
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,920
 And once they're trained, they can get

101
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,200
 an average diagnostic accuracy of 85%.

102
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,800
 But when you do a flock-sourcing system,

103
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,760
 well, basically, you get a load of pigeons,

104
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,640
 and you get them to agree whether there's a problem there or not.

105
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,840
 They can get up to 99%.

106
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
 What?

107
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,360
 Whoa!

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,240
 So what you're comparing individual responses?

109
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,680
 Yeah, so you get a load of pigeons,

110
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,960
 and you know, what do you think of this?

111
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,000
 No, you're not getting--

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,240
 you're not getting a load of pigeons to vote on.

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,240
 Tell me it's worse than that current system.

114
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,640
 Don't worry, we've got a top team working on this.

115
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,880
 They're on their little coats.

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
 And have they tried motivating doctors to do better

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,080
 by telling them that pigeons are more efficient than they are?

118
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,240
 Because I think we should start doing this on the podcast.

119
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
 I actually think we should set up a company

120
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,840
 where you get little speakers in workplaces that just go,

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,400
 "Cool."

122
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,680
 And that sort of means, "I'm after your job."

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,800
 They were amazing in their pigeons.

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,400
 So I saw a pigeon do something so cool the other day,

125
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,200
 and I really, really messaged you guys.

126
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
 Really?

127
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,920
 This is really into a fact.

128
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,760
 So I saw a pigeon do a submissal,

129
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,640
 and I'd forgotten that this happens.

130
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,840
 And I remembered that we'd mentioned that geese wiffle

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
 they split to the side.

132
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,640
 So I was about to send you a message saying,

133
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,800
 "There's a pigeon impersonating a geese."

134
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,920
 A geese? Sure.

135
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
 A geese.

136
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,120
 "You're German, you don't know our plurals, do you?"

137
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,840
 So it wasn't a land-based submissal.

138
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,800
 It was an airborne--

139
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
 Well, it wasn't an airborne one.

140
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,280
 So they can do the airborne submissals.

141
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,560
 But then, yeah, you've got these Birmingham rollers

142
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,720
 who submissal for living.

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
 So that's a kind of pigeon.

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
 A Birmingham roller is a kind of pigeon,

145
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
 and they can't fly beyond a few months old,

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
 but they can do constant back flips.

147
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,160
 And what I read says, they do involuntary back flips.

148
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,400
 How annoying is that doing involuntary back flips?

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,720
 And they have races, so they are pigeons

150
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,760
 that compete in a lot of competitions.

151
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,200
 Well, humans compete using them,

152
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,320
 and to see how far they can backflip.

153
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,000
 And I think the record is just over 200 meters.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
 But the pigeon is repeatedly doing back flips.

155
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,480
 And this is what you saw the other day, a 200 meter long.

156
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,360
 No, I just saw a pigeon do a submissal,

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,400
 and it made me think, that's funny.

158
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,040
 That would be, I would feel,

159
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,720
 imagine you went to see your pigeon doctor,

160
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,640
 and he did a back flip just before he told you your news.

161
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,520
 You'd think it was going to be good.

162
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
 So it was a good--

163
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,920
 I'm afraid that was an involuntary back flip.

164
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,200
 And he was very bad.

165
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,920
 Oh, no, it got to pigeon.

166
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,600
 And this is why they haven't got far in the medical profession,

167
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,120
 because it's seen as incense to visit.

168
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,280
 Wow, well, that's very cool.

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,440
 What a special thing to see.

170
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,440
 Yeah, so cool.

171
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,280
 They are also very useful, generally, and have been--

172
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,640
 Hey, it's a cool thing.

173
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,880
 You know, when pigeons are walking on the street,

174
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,480
 and you see them bobbin away like that,

175
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,720
 I think we've mentioned this on QI.

176
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
 I don't think we've done it on the podcast,

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,560
 but if you put them on a treadmill,

178
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,200
 they stop bobbing their head.

179
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,040
 So if anyone ever wants to see a bobbless pigeon,

180
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,640
 pop them on a treadmill, do we know why?

181
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,400
 Yeah.

182
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,120
 OK?

183
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,960
 I mean--

184
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
 [LAUGHTER]

185
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,320
 Well, the scientists know why I--

186
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,000
 I read a bit.

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,680
 What did it say in the headline?

188
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,720
 It didn't say it in the headline.

189
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,680
 But hang on, hang on.

190
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,440
 OK, so what it is, is it turns out they're not doing it

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,840
 as a part of a movement need for equilibrium as they're

192
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,360
 walking.

193
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,040
 What it is is visually to understand the space around them.

194
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,960
 They need to do it.

195
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,520
 It's purely for spatial awareness.

196
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,840
 So what it is is we have saccade in our eyes.

197
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,520
 I think this is it.

198
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,840
 So our eyes kind of move around all the time,

199
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,920
 and that's how we can see things.

200
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,600
 If they always stay completely still,

201
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,160
 you won't be able to see anything.

202
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,440
 Now, pigeons and most birds don't have that.

203
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,080
 And so the way they see things is by always moving their head

204
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,600
 around.

205
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,200
 Yes.

206
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,080
 And then when you put them on a treadmill--

207
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,600
 Yeah.

208
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,320
 --and that's why I stopped reading the article.

209
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,840
 But where is the one?

210
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,760
 That doesn't make--

211
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,320
 The surroundings will stay the same if they're on a treadmill.

212
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,920
 Who knows?

213
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,400
 But they still got to see.

214
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,200
 What if a threat comes?

215
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,440
 They can't just stop being able to see,

216
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,800
 because you put them on a treadmill.

217
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,160
 Well, when have you ever seen an eagle on a treadmill?

218
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,720
 Mate, she's seen a pigeon submissile.

219
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,520
 I think she's probably seen everything.

220
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,280
 I go to a very specialist gym.

221
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,000
 Sorry?

222
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,120
 It's the other way around.

223
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,800
 They put the treadmill on the bridge.

224
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 Oh, yeah.

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,920
 They do a forward submissile.

226
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,000
 Which one are we wrong about?

227
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

228
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
 You know, most comedy gives you go to.

229
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
 It's just, you're a shit.

230
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
 Do you know, I think that was a long wind of wave saying

231
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,240
 you're a shit to be honest.

232
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,800
 So another use for pigeons.

233
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,560
 Yeah.

234
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,240
 You can use pigeons as fireworks.

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,080
 What?

236
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,400
 But it's frowned on.

237
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,960
 It's very much not frowned on.

238
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,080
 And the reason is that fireworks are very bad for the environment.

239
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,320
 OK.

240
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,320
 So what you can do, but if you still want lights in the sky,

241
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
 and you don't mind a little bit of animal cruelty,

242
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,960
 then you can attach--

243
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
 Keep talking.

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,160
 You can attach lights to the legs of trained pigeons

245
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,200
 and get them to fly in certain formations.

246
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,640
 And it gives you the lights in the sky,

247
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,280
 but without the fireworks stuff.

248
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,320
 Oh, that's cool.

249
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
 That's very cool.

250
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,400
 That happened in Brooklyn a few years ago.

251
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,200
 Cool.

252
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 We need to move on in a second to our next fact.

253
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,720
 Oh, I've got a few more things about the way

254
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,960
 is animal sea, because it's about animal vision.

255
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
 So I never knew this before.

256
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,520
 Swallowtail butterflies.

257
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,640
 There is a particular species of butterfly.

258
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
 They have eyes on their penises

259
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,840
 to help them position themselves during sex.

260
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,520
 And the females also have genital eyes,

261
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,160
 so they can position themselves.

262
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,840
 And they try--

263
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,040
 They kind of make sense when you think they're there.

264
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,840
 Yeah.

265
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,520
 And they make-- because they also--

266
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,600
 You could just attach your GoPro to yours.

267
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,960
 And then they would do the same thing.

268
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,120
 These problem for these butterflies

269
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,040
 is they mate facing away from each other.

270
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,520
 So it's very hard for them to know, even

271
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,920
 if they're in the same room as the partner.

272
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,360
 And the way they found this out was

273
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,440
 that they tried blindfolding Swallowtail butterfly penises.

274
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
 And they found that a successful mating collapsed.

275
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,040
 Oh, my God.

276
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
 Wow.

277
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,320
 Do they use the eyes for other things?

278
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,280
 Like, if you're married, can they be like,

279
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,040
 I saw you throw that in the non-recycling bin.

280
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,480
 But what will you do with your cock at the recycling bin?

281
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,960
 OK, we should probably move on to our next fact.

282
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,400
 I don't know what's going on tonight.

283
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
 This is--

284
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:33,440
 It is time for fact number two.

285
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,400
 And that is my fact.

286
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,200
 My fact this week is that concrete is stronger

287
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,880
 if you make it with carrots.

288
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,440
 This is a new finding.

289
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,840
 This is from Lancaster University.

290
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,560
 And they did these tests where they

291
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,840
 started blending up extracts from carrots and other root

292
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,000
 vegetables into just a household blender with concrete.

293
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,160
 And they mixed it up.

294
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 And they used it.

295
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,000
 And they found that it has incredible--

296
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,400
 it has resistance to cracks, which is far higher

297
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,040
 than you would get in your average concrete.

298
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,720
 And it's 80% stronger than what you would buy in a shop

299
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
 as an average concrete.

300
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,640
 So this is in early stages for testing,

301
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,000
 but possibly the concrete of the future will be carrot based.

302
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,840
 That's really good.

303
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,760
 And one big advantage of it is when

304
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,440
 you put these little molecules in there,

305
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
 because they're like plants, basically,

306
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,840
 they can lock up more CO2 than normal concrete would do.

307
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
 So actually, it's good for the environments as well.

308
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,120
 Oh, that is good.

309
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,600
 Yeah, massively, because concrete is very bad for the environment.

310
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,320
 Yeah, it is.

311
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,200
 It's really bad.

312
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,000
 Yeah, yeah.

313
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,240
 It's very, very bad.

314
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,600
 You don't need to tell the people about how bad concrete is.

315
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
 Get this. So humans have been making concrete for 9,000 years.

316
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,440
 And that's-- yeah.

317
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,880
 But the oldest concrete in the world

318
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,880
 is 12 million years old.

319
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
 Wait.

320
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,400
 Yes.

321
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,480
 It is.

322
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,160
 Was that the same person from before?

323
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,200
 She won't believe anything we say.

324
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,680
 On nemesis, the expert in everything has arrived.

325
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
 Who was making that then?

326
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,600
 Pigeons. No, no.

327
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,960
 It's naturally occurring.

328
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,360
 So it's from a place where there was some limestone

329
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
 and some oil combusted naturally.

330
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,680
 I think it's in Israel is where this site has been found.

331
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,960
 And they found this basically natural concrete.

332
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,880
 That's really good.

333
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
 Is it, presumably, it's bad for the environment,

334
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,800
 so I'll just go back to that, because there's just so much of it.

335
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,640
 So it's the manufacturing process.

336
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,040
 It produces a lot of carbon dioxide, the manufacturing.

337
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,080
 Yeah, because I didn't realize it is the most widely used

338
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,600
 material in the world, concrete.

339
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,960
 Which is kind of extraordinary.

340
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,920
 And they do this amazing thing with it.

341
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,560
 So I was reading about the building of the Burj Khalifa, which

342
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,000
 is still the tallest building in the world, isn't it?

343
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,280
 The Burj Khalifa.

344
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,760
 And so that is six-- so that's almost entirely made of concrete.

345
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,000
 And the way they do it, the way they get concrete to the top of it,

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,280
 used to be that you'd have these big blocks of concrete.

347
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,240
 And you'd have to transport them to the top of a building

348
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,440
 and dump them on top.

349
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,200
 But now there's the technology for you

350
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,840
 to pump up liquid concrete to the top of a building.

351
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,440
 And so they had a vertical concrete tube,

352
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,960
 and they just pump up concrete, 606 meters.

353
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
 It's incredible.

354
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,680
 So you need an enormous amount of pressure

355
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,080
 for this fluid to be pumped.

356
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,120
 But yeah, and there's obviously the technology behind that

357
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,680
 is bizarre.

358
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,200
 Like, even carrying this tube, carrying the weight of 606 meters

359
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,600
 worth of concrete is pretty incredible.

360
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,480
 And I was really an interviewer and engineer who

361
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,400
 worked on it, actually.

362
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,240
 And he was explaining how they trialled the system

363
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,720
 on the Burj Khalifa by doing it horizontally

364
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,640
 through pipes in the desert first.

365
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,840
 And then he said they had to source the pump from Germany,

366
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,920
 obviously, he said, we used a good German pump

367
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,040
 from someone who's stuck out.

368
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:58,800
 And the pump itself is called Putzmeister, which, as he pointed out,

369
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,120
 is a great name for a pump.

370
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,480
 So the Putzmeister made the Burj Khalifa.

371
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,880
 Speaking of concrete, Dan, do you know any animals

372
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,280
 that can dig through concrete?

373
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,640
 I do.

374
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,800
 Because you've said this once on the podcast, haven't you?

375
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,320
 I have said this on the podcast.

376
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
 So here's the fact, which these three question the truth of.

377
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
 If you corner a badger in a car park,

378
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,960
 it can escape you by digging through the concrete within--

379
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,920
 yes, way-- within 30 seconds.

380
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,720
 That's very strong.

381
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,240
 Yeah.

382
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,200
 That is a concrete abadge.

383
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
 Yeah, it's impossible.

384
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,760
 Why?

385
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,080
 They've got incredibly sharp nails.

386
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,920
 I bet they have.

387
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,600
 But they have.

388
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,240
 Of course they have.

389
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,600
 But concrete's really hard.

390
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,080
 Anyway, I'm going to hand over to my colleague

391
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,920
 who I think has more information than me.

392
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,800
 So I know that you've said this on the podcast,

393
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
 and we always take the Mickey out of you for it.

394
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,200
 But I did find that there is an animal that

395
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,480
 can dig through concrete.

396
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800
 And that is the Indian pangolin.

397
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,920
 And they have been reported digging through concrete

398
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,960
 and into houses.

399
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
 They have extremely powerful claws

400
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,000
 that they would normally use for opening up thermite nests.

401
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,160
 So there is an animal that can dig through concrete.

402
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
 Wait, so do you believe that?

403
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,000
 Well, this is true.

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,160
 Let's put facts aside for a second.

405
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,280
 And I was also looking into if there was any--

406
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,600
 I really, really did look to see if badgers

407
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,560
 could go through concrete.

408
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,760
 I really did look.

409
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,600
 And the best I could find is there

410
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,080
 was a story in the news a few years ago

411
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
 about an American badger who was captured

412
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,800
 burying the carcass of a cow.

413
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
 Oh, it was a true concrete.

414
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,200
 But he just basically found his dead cow.

415
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,240
 And he spent about three or four nights digging a hole

416
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,200
 so that he could put the cow into it

417
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,320
 and then cover it all over so that no one could find it.

418
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,840
 Exactly.

419
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,120
 It's to stop predators from being able to eat it.

420
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,200
 So they think, oh, it's not like a dead cow was here.

421
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,880
 Oh, it's gone.

422
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,680
 And then they go away.

423
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,760
 And then the badger will go down underneath and eat it.

424
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,240
 See, I know a lot about badgers.

425
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,040
 So I'm telling you that this is a true thing.

426
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,080
 Have you guys heard of--

427
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,960
 this is not the technical term, but "crunchable concrete."

428
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,760
 No.

429
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,880
 This is-- I find this amazing.

430
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,600
 So do you remember there's been some cases where

431
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,880
 planes, as they've landed or are taking off,

432
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,440
 have overshot the runway?

433
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,040
 That's a big problem, because there's no method

434
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,920
 to stop them at that kind of speed.

435
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,760
 So a concrete has been invented,

436
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,960
 which has been nicknamed "crunchable concrete,"

437
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
 has been around for a while, which

438
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,080
 is it's an extra stretch of a runway for an airport.

439
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,040
 But the concrete is made a bit softer, which

440
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,320
 means it can't hold the weight of an airplane.

441
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,560
 So as soon as the airplane overshoots,

442
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,240
 and it goes on to this crunchable concrete,

443
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
 it's the equivalent of, say, riding a bicycle

444
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,880
 that you can't stop into sand.

445
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
 It slowly starts slowing you down by the fact

446
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,080
 that you are slowly dipping into it.

447
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,920
 And that's the thing that they have at many airports

448
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,600
 around the world.

449
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,120
 Wow.

450
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,960
 That's really clever.

451
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,920
 Surprise, Mark.

452
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,720
 Do you know why washing machines are so heavy?

453
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,880
 Is it because they have concrete in them?

454
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,920
 Yes.

455
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,880
 No, I've told this the wrong way around.

456
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,920
 Have you just think of any household items

457
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,440
 that might have concrete in it?

458
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,720
 Brilliant.

459
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,680
 Yes.

460
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,160
 Is it a washing machine?

461
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,120
 Yeah, it's a washing machine.

462
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,480
 I didn't know this, and this is a bit sort of--

463
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,800
 I've never heard this.

464
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,560
 I've not heard this.

465
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
 This is not a very sexy fact.

466
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,640
 But most washing machines have, in the top of them,

467
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,080
 a 25 kilo block of concrete, which

468
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,320
 is to hold it steady when it's spinning

469
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
 in the later stages of the cycle.

470
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,920
 That's what makes a washing machine so heavy.

471
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,160
 They're not very heavy, except they've all

472
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,000
 got this massive lump of concrete.

473
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,320
 And this is obviously very inefficient

474
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,560
 because transporting washing machines,

475
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,760
 because they're so heavy, it uses a lot more fuel.

476
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,680
 So a student in Nottingham has invented--

477
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,440
 or he's thought of this system--

478
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,360
 where you replace the concrete with an empty plastic container.

479
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,040
 And then you can just fill that up with water

480
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,800
 when you need 25 kilos weight at the top of the machine.

481
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,000
 And then you can just empty it out at the end of the cycle.

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,320
 So it's lighter to transport.

483
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
 It would save thousands of tons of carbon dioxide

484
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,160
 just shipping it around.

485
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,800
 We don't need just thought of that.

486
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,920
 We only just thought of that.

487
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,200
 We need to put pigeons on more and actually apply us to sign jobs.

488
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,360
 We have to move on in a second.

489
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,440
 Oh, concrete-- you know, reinforced concrete.

490
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,080
 Most buildings with concrete are made of reinforced concrete,

491
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,960
 which is concrete with big metal bars all the way

492
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,320
 through a metal framework.

493
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,320
 That was initially used only for flower pots.

494
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,520
 No one thought of using it for buildings.

495
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,120
 Wow.

496
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,960
 Yeah.

497
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,480
 That's amazing.

498
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,200
 There was a French gardener contrastive money,

499
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,880
 and he was unhappy with the flower pots available to him.

500
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
 And he thought, I need a really tough flower pot.

501
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,800
 And he devised a new version with steel mesh.

502
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,960
 And that was the first reinforced concrete.

503
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,040
 Just quickly on water and concrete,

504
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,480
 water actually is really good for concrete at the start.

505
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,960
 So it hardens it because it's having the concrete reacts

506
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,880
 with the water and it causes it to harden.

507
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,360
 But this is actually related to something

508
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,520
 we've said on the show before, which I have to update.

509
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,240
 So in episode 44, we pointed out that

510
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,480
 Roman concrete is better than ours.

511
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,680
 So concrete that was made 2,000, more than 2,000 years ago,

512
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,840
 is stronger than ours.

513
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,800
 And we don't know why.

514
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,840
 And we have since found out why.

515
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,880
 And it's because it's made of this combination

516
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,080
 of volcanic ash and seawater and lumps of volcanic rock,

517
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,880
 which is called potelana.

518
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,600
 And the volcanic rock actually reacts with the seawater.

519
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,160
 And it hardens it.

520
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,960
 So the seawater creates different chemical bonds

521
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,560
 within the concrete and it hardens it.

522
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,080
 So we know how they did that now.

523
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,880
 So does that mean, sorry, to interrupt?

524
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,640
 Does that mean at the start, it wasn't as good as ours.

525
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,200
 And over the years, it's gotten much better.

526
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,560
 Because the seawater has hardened it.

527
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,920
 It was basically jelly, the pantheon at the start.

528
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,400
 [LAUGHTER]

529
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,280
 The pantheon is still 2,000 years old.

530
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,640
 The largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world.

531
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,880
 It is incredible.

532
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,720
 And then we just forgot how to make proper concrete.

533
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,040
 And we've just remembered, so that's celebrate.

534
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,480
 [APPLAUSE]

535
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,800
 OK, it is time for us to move on to fact number three.

536
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,320
 And that is James.

537
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,680
 OK, my fact this week is that head allows clinics.

538
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,560
 Always see an uptick in business when a new Pixar movie comes out.

539
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,240
 Why is this?

540
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,920
 Is it because children are sitting near each other or changing?

541
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,200
 Well, to children all in the same place.

542
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,960
 You're going to get lots of nits and headlights.

543
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
 And this is a real thing.

544
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,960
 So this was an interview with a lady called Melissa Shalide,

545
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,160
 who owns two hair salons in California.

546
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,080
 And she says that whenever these children movies come out,

547
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,920
 you get all children who go together

548
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,560
 and the lice they go from one head to another.

549
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,480
 And it's not just that.

550
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
 It's selfies is another thing, which

551
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,560
 is causing lots of head lice in young people.

552
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,120
 Another thing is playing on a sports team.

553
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,160
 So when you get in a huddle, if they like to jump

554
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,120
 between one head and another, and also during Halloween,

555
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,160
 because people try on Halloween costumes

556
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,360
 and they just pass them on to each other.

557
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,520
 Although we should say so, they don't jump.

558
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,440
 They don't jump.

559
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,400
 So they don't jump from one head to another, which is something

560
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,960
 I always find bizarre that I don't have children,

561
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,920
 so I don't know if they spend their time rubbing heads constantly.

562
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
 But I just can't believe that happens that often.

563
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,440
 So they can't jump.

564
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,720
 They can't fly.

565
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,440
 They just have to walk.

566
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,800
 And children are jamming their heads together long enough.

567
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,960
 All these things are just walkie-walkie-walkie.

568
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,800
 Yeah.

569
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,840
 On to another head.

570
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,200
 I always had head lice in Australia, like constantly.

571
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,320
 I had like in my genuinely constantly in my bathroom.

572
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,360
 I had a normal brush, and I had my head lice brush.

573
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,960
 Every day, I would just do a quick extra swoop.

574
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,960
 And I can't remember putting my head next to other heads.

575
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
 Oh, thank God for that.

576
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
 But what was I doing with it?

577
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,680
 Because I'd get rid of it, it'd be gone.

578
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,920
 And then suddenly, I'm capped in lice again.

579
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,360
 And I don't know what that was.

580
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,200
 Yeah, weird.

581
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,920
 I became quite fond of them.

582
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,280
 I became quite fond of them, really.

583
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,800
 Yeah.

584
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,560
 Because you can see with lice, if they--

585
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,040
 because they suck on blood, obviously.

586
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,800
 You can see the bit of red that fills it up.

587
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,280
 And I would-- mine were well fed.

588
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,040
 Well, the other thing with head lice

589
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,200
 is not everyone gets itchy with them.

590
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,680
 It's only if you're allergic to the saliva

591
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,000
 that you get head lice.

592
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
 You winch your heads.

593
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,360
 And actually, that is most people.

594
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,200
 But there are some people who aren't allergic to it.

595
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,440
 And those people wouldn't know that they had head lice

596
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,080
 until the head starts crawling around.

597
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,800
 Yes, yeah.

598
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,320
 OK.

599
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,000
 But we should say, you listening to this now,

600
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,280
 you will feel your head itching now.

601
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,120
 That is normal.

602
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,600
 You don't have lice.

603
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,280
 There is a condition called delusional parasitosis

604
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
 where you think you're infested even if you're not.

605
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,840
 So that's a proper condition.

606
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,000
 But what you're feeling is normal.

607
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,960
 Although we've got-- so we've got three kinds of lice.

608
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,600
 We've got head lice, which live in the hair.

609
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,680
 There are body lice, which actually live in the seams

610
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,800
 of your clothing.

611
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,640
 So as long as you change your clothing more than once a month,

612
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,720
 you're basically fine.

613
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,520
 What's the date today?

614
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,800
 And of course, there's our old chums, the pubic lice.

615
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,080
 Why are you?

616
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,960
 As they get called, trouser shrimps.

617
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,720
 So--

618
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,960
 But they are two branches of the same family

619
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,040
 that they split about 80,000 years ago.

620
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,880
 And one went north and one went south, basically.

621
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,600
 And they can't-- this is something I found out.

622
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,640
 Because they are now so different in their physicality,

623
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
 apparently, they won't interbreed

624
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,120
 except under laboratory conditions.

625
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,080
 So you can make it happen when there's

626
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,040
 a nice sofa there for them to have.

627
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,200
 I think they can't go on the other part of hair,

628
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,520
 because the claws are the wrong shapes, right?

629
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,360
 Yeah, is that right?

630
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,560
 Yeah, they're the wrong size.

631
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,320
 Yeah, what's interesting, as well, is that as we get older,

632
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,240
 as we become adults, our heads become a bit more acidic

633
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,680
 and lice don't like that.

634
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,440
 That's why they're predominantly found in children.

635
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,560
 And so you get any groups of children getting together.

636
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,360
 That happens.

637
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,400
 And James read out a list of places

638
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,960
 where that is likely to happen.

639
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,560
 Another place that happened was on the set of Harry Potter

640
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
 and the Chamber of Secrets.

641
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
 Oh, no.

642
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,060
 Yeah.

643
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,440
 The kids, all of the kids, got so infested

644
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
 with a lice outbreak that was happening

645
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,240
 that they had to hold to them.

646
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,120
 That's why in the third film, they've all got shaved heads.

647
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,120
 I never thought of that before.

648
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,520
 Yeah, it's not in the books.

649
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,200
 So yeah, so they had to halt filming

650
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,160
 and they brought nurses in who had to spend ages

651
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,200
 delousing them all.

652
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,440
 And they have specific nurses, apparently.

653
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,560
 So there are lice doctors, which is, in fact,

654
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,680
 lice doctors is one chain of lice pickers,

655
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,480
 professional lice pickers, and they're one of many.

656
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,960
 And in fact, there was a study into lice,

657
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,360
 into how immune they are to various treatments in 2015.

658
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,080
 And they recruited lots of professional lice comers,

659
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,200
 which is weird, because you don't have to be very skilled

660
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,640
 to comb lice out of your hair.

661
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,280
 But this is what people are doing.

662
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,600
 This is present day.

663
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,400
 Present day, yeah.

664
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,920
 Because in the Victorian times, there was a role in hospitals

665
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,920
 which was chief bug catcher, and it was for lice.

666
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,720
 And they, at the time, in the 18th century,

667
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,000
 were paid more than surgeons were paid.

668
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,720
 According to a very good source, Lindsay E. Fitzpatrick,

669
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,120
 who writes about this era and medical curiosities,

670
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,880
 she said that there was a guy called Andrew Cook,

671
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,760
 who claimed to have cleaned up more than 20,000 beds

672
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,320
 that were all lice ridden.

673
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,520
 And yes, it was a huge--

674
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,200
 It makes sense.

675
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
 It was a massive disease cause.

676
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,080
 I mean, you would focus on that.

677
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,000
 But we should be clear.

678
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,320
 Headlights can't do anything.

679
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,880
 I don't know why people make such a fuss about them.

680
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,160
 They can't harm you at all.

681
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,320
 And in fact, other cultures and other people in history

682
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,360
 have been much more sensible about them.

683
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,320
 So they used to be given as gifts between friends and lovers.

684
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,160
 So for sure.

685
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,920
 What?

686
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,680
 There's a thing in the Aztec period.

687
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,080
 Montezuma, you know, the great Aztec emperor,

688
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,800
 he used to collect lice.

689
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,720
 And people would give them to him as offerings.

690
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,240
 And in fact, he eventually employed someone

691
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,520
 to go and collect head lice off his subjects

692
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,680
 and bring them to him so he could keep them in boxes.

693
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,720
 So I think, in fact, when the Europeans got there,

694
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
 they saw all these all-nate boxes.

695
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,840
 And thought, you must have pearls and jewelry in there.

696
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,520
 And they opened them.

697
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,640
 They were just full of dead lice.

698
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,280
 Because it was a nice thing to collect.

699
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,080
 Well, apparently with the Incas,

700
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,240
 there was a thing of tax collectors at the time.

701
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,320
 And one of the things for older people who, for goods,

702
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,160
 bought and so on, they didn't want to tax as highly,

703
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,120
 it would be a symbolic handing over of lice to them.

704
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,640
 As a, that would be the tax.

705
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,080
 You can have six of my lice.

706
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,960
 To be introduced, post-Brexit, actually,

707
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,120
 when no one can afford actual money.

708
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,160
 I'm going to be rich.

709
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,400
 [LAUGHTER]

710
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,360
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

711
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,560
 And that is Anna.

712
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,520
 My fact this week is that, in 1926, Poland

713
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,200
 sent the US a birthday card that was signed

714
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,480
 by a sixth of its population, which was very generous.

715
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,080
 That's incredible.

716
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,280
 Of them.

717
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,720
 So this was this amazing moment.

718
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,160
 It was back in the time when Poland was incredibly grateful

719
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,200
 to America because it considered America

720
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,120
 as having basically saved its skin in First World War

721
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,760
 and given it independence for the first time in about 150 years.

722
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,400
 And so it-- and then afterwards, Poland

723
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,040
 would have been destitute, as would almost all of Europe

724
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,280
 had America not given a lot of charity money.

725
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,000
 So as this thank you, they sent a 30,000-page long card

726
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,320
 on the 4th of July.

727
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,160
 30,000 pages?

728
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,800
 It was 30,000 pages long.

729
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,880
 Or it was actually late because it took a long time

730
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,640
 to get the signatures.

731
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,120
 So it arrived in October.

732
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,760
 It was meant to arrive on the 4th of July.

733
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,160
 We all do that for birthdays, that's fine.

734
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,960
 I was just thinking in the office, whenever it's someone's birthday,

735
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,240
 and they give you a card, and you have to sign it.

736
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,240
 And by the time five people have done all the different possible

737
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,200
 ways of saying happy birthday, you've got nothing left to say,

738
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,960
 what up to 30,000 people have said it?

739
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,440
 Yeah, imagine the imagination of a 30,000-pull.

740
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,000
 Imagine having a great one to do, and you read through them all,

741
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,040
 and the last one before you finally hit it.

742
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,840
 No, wait, it's more than 30,000 people.

743
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,600
 Sorry, that's how many pages.

744
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,680
 Yeah.

745
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,680
 So it was 30,000 pages, and it was 5.5 million people sign it.

746
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
 What?

747
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,920
 It's really got around.

748
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,400
 They delivered it in the form of 111 bound volumes.

749
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,880
 But it's quite useful now, because it's all been digitized,

750
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,480
 and Polish Americans can do family history research,

751
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,120
 and they can look up where their ancestors were,

752
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,480
 and which cities and towns they came from.

753
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,440
 But the thing is, a lot of the people who signed

754
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,720
 were children who were being forced to sign it.

755
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,280
 Yeah, they sent blank pages.

756
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,560
 So they had this massive book they were going to send,

757
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,360
 and various pages went to various different bits of Poland.

758
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,080
 And they sent it to the army, and to cycling clubs,

759
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,240
 and to banks.

760
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,000
 Loot singers, apparently, gave a very good offering,

761
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,600
 and they all sent back stuff that was quite personal to them.

762
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,560
 So some of Poland's most famous artists

763
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,400
 did works of art in there.

764
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,640
 Cool.

765
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,120
 Just some greeting cards, and being sent a lot of them.

766
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,400
 Do you know there's a Guinness World record for the person

767
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,080
 who has received most--

768
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,640
 OK, look at those birthday cards.

769
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,560
 Most get well cards.

770
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,240
 Oh, get well cards, yeah.

771
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,000
 So just for the idea of being sent a card,

772
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 there's a Guinness World record.

773
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,880
 It's a guy called Craig Shurgold.

774
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,880
 He was very ill, and his friends decided

775
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,320
 to do a chain letter, and this was, I think, in 1991,

776
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,000
 that went out on the internet that said,

777
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,080
 send a get well card or a greeting card to Craig,

778
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,080
 and let him know that you're thinking of him.

779
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,640
 He eventually, by May 1991, received 33 million cards.

780
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,280
 It just went so massive.

781
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,360
 It went so big.

782
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,880
 But the biggest problem was, is that he actually

783
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,320
 got better, which was fantastic.

784
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,640
 It was amazing.

785
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,120
 And he was really ill.

786
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,640
 He shouldn't have got better by, according to the doctors.

787
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,160
 And he did.

788
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
 It's fantastic.

789
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,280
 The doctor is doing back flips all over the place.

790
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,760
 Are you happy that I'm better?

791
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,400
 No, no, these are all involuntary.

792
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,840
 No, but so he received.

793
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,200
 In that time, 33 million, but the chain letter

794
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,080
 kept going around to different countries,

795
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,280
 the name kept changing on it as well.

796
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,440
 So he just kept receiving different bits of cards

797
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,160
 from people all around the world.

798
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,080
 And so it said that since 1989, he has now

799
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,040
 received 350 million greeting cards.

800
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,520
 It got, unfortunately, he died when

801
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,080
 he was crushed to death by a big pile of greeting cards.

802
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,080
 It got so big that the royal mail gave him

803
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,640
 his own postal code for his house,

804
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,080
 because it was just such a deluge.

805
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,680
 And he used to give interviews about how exciting it wasn't

806
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:38,880
 stuff.

807
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,600
 He doesn't.

808
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,160
 He's gone behind the scenes now.

809
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,120
 He's not a public figure.

810
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,600
 The only time he really comes out and talks to the press

811
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,120
 is to say, please stop sending me comments.

812
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,600
 Well, at least you haven't republicized it tonight.

813
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,520
 There were a couple of guys in 2016.

814
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,520
 They were American inventors, sort of inventors

815
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,200
 of fun silly products.

816
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,600
 They came up with a greetings card

817
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,640
 that you can send to new parents.

818
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,200
 And it has a button inside.

819
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,920
 And when you press it, it starts

820
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,720
 to play the sound of a baby screaming,

821
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,880
 which lasts for three hours, and which will keep going,

822
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,280
 even if you destroy the card.

823
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,920
 And every time you press the button again to make it stop,

824
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,120
 it gets slightly louder.

825
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,800
 Wow.

826
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,000
 And where can I buy this card?

827
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,240
 They sold out.

828
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,520
 I don't know.

829
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,800
 That is amazing.

830
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,000
 That should actually win an award

831
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,160
 in the International Cards Award Ceremony.

832
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,920
 That is the best card I've ever heard of.

833
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,600
 Is that a thing?

834
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,720
 And that is a thing.

835
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,560
 So what do you get for congratulations

836
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,960
 if you win it from your friends?

837
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,680
 You get the screamer.

838
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,640
 No, this is the International greetings card awards competition

839
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,160
 or the Louise, as they're known.

840
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,720
 So they're held in America.

841
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,520
 They have been since 1988.

842
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,080
 And they seem to be quite a big deal.

843
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,520
 They're named after the father or the grandfather

844
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,400
 of greetings cards, who was actually

845
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,280
 a German immigrant to America called Louise Prang.

846
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,080
 And he made the first line of Christmas cards in about 1875.

847
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,960
 And so yeah, they have this big competition.

848
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,240
 And the winners are announced in May

849
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,440
 during the National Stationary Show, which I know

850
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,400
 will all be attending next year.

851
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,840
 We've missed it this year, sadly.

852
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,160
 It was a few days ago.

853
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,920
 But the greetings cards association director said,

854
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,600
 there is nothing like the genuine and lasting connection

855
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,760
 you get from receiving and sending a greetings card.

856
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,000
 And he is called Pete Dockety, which I really like to think

857
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,640
 that Pete Dockety has been moonlighting

858
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,800
 as the head of a greetings card.

859
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,040
 Well, baby shambles have played on this stage.

860
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,160
 How do they?

861
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,920
 Yeah, really.

862
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,160
 Well, but not recently, because he's

863
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,880
 been very busy at the National Stationary Competition.

864
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,520
 Just on Christmas cards, just while we're talking about it.

865
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,440
 If you're an atheist or a skeptic, obviously,

866
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,840
 Christmas cards isn't your thing.

867
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,360
 So there's an alternative that's been created.

868
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,760
 And it is celebrating the fact that Isaac Newton

869
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,960
 was born on the 25th of December.

870
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,160
 So it's called Newtonmas.

871
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,200
 And Newtonmas is a--

872
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,360
 the skeptic society have a party around Christmas time.

873
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,960
 And that's what it will celebrate.

874
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,960
 And they send each other Newtonmas cards as well.

875
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,760
 And inside, it reads, "Reasons greetings."

876
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,520
 [APPLAUSE]

877
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,680
 The smallest greetings card in the world

878
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,840
 is so small that you could fit 200 million of them

879
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,880
 on a single stamp.

880
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,800
 Wow.

881
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,840
 It's been made by some scientists.

882
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,880
 It's not a practical thing.

883
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,480
 But there's also the world's biggest card.

884
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,760
 So the world's biggest greetings card

885
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,680
 is 18 meters tall and 13 meters across.

886
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,280
 It was in India that it was created by a housing company

887
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,440
 for more publicity.

888
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,520
 But so I found that on the biggest card,

889
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,520
 you could fit 46 million stamps.

890
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,800
 So I wondered how many times you could

891
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,000
 fit the smallest card in the world

892
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,600
 onto the largest known card in the world.

893
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,160
 And that's a simple multiplication.

894
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,000
 Yes.

895
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,320
 [LAUGHTER]

896
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,480
 Well, let's hear it anyway.

897
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,200
 Well, no, no, it's just simple multiplication.

898
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,640
 It actually is a really big number.

899
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,080
 And your calculator probably doesn't go that high.

900
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,520
 My calculator didn't go that high.

901
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,640
 I had to go to a special online calculator

902
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,280
 and then really carefully check the answer

903
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,040
 and that I thought I was getting it wrong.

904
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,960
 I'm so sorry.

905
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,720
 I've misjudged this whole situation.

906
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,480
 That does sound quite good.

907
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,080
 I feel like I have.

908
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,400
 Just give us a fucking answer.

909
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,680
 The smallest card ever made could fit on the largest card ever

910
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,960
 made 9,200 trillion times.

911
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,160
 Oh, is that all?

912
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,000
 Yeah.

913
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,960
 Anyway, that's a sum I did earlier today.

914
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,360
 Cool.

915
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,200
 The oldest Valentine's card, the oldest Valentine's card in England,

916
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,360
 was from 1477.

917
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,560
 And it was from Marjorie Brews to her fiancé, John Pastin.

918
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,400
 And in it, she says a few things.

919
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,800
 And then she says, I beseech you that this bill

920
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,200
 be not seen by non-earthly creatures

921
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,360
 save only yourself.

922
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,400
 Anyway, that's on display in the British Library.

923
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,680
 [LAUGHTER]

924
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,120
 And we're going to have to wrap up, guys.

925
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,880
 Well, can I just do it like a really nice birthday card

926
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,520
 facts from Britain, in fact, which is the--

927
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,720
 so Britain's two oldest men are called Al Smith and Bob

928
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,440
 Waiten.

929
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,400
 And they're both 111 now, I think.

930
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
 And they were born by coincidence

931
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,640
 on the same day in 1908.

932
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,560
 So Waiten sends Smith a birthday card every year.

933
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,960
 And Smith sends Waiten a birthday card every year.

934
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,000
 And they send these really sweet messages in them.

935
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,080
 So they interviewed one of them recently, actually.

936
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,040
 They interviewed Waiten on his birthday, which

937
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,640
 was the day we were supposed to leave the EU.

938
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,560
 And he said--

939
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,160
 Which one?

940
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,320
 [LAUGHTER]

941
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,400
 I've lost track.

942
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,920
 He actually said, 111 year old man said,

943
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,800
 my own feeling is that there were defects.

944
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,840
 But we shouldn't negotiate from the inside rather than walking

945
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,720
 off the field with the cricket ball and saying,

946
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,960
 I'm not playing.

947
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,760
 Which didn't make me think we should start having

948
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,480
 over 100-year-olds in government.

949
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,920
 But they sent each other these sweet cards.

950
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,400
 So he sent the other guy cards saying, do keep in touch.

951
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
 I wish we'd known about each other earlier.

952
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
 And then we did it.

953
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,840
 How much is that?

954
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,160
 That is very cool.

955
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,200
 But if they'd known about each other like 50 years earlier,

956
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,720
 it would have just been two random men

957
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,960
 sending each other cards for no reason.

958
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,640
 Yes.

959
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,520
 The whole ceremony can only function

960
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,760
 because the two of them are the oldest men in the country.

961
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,240
 [LAUGHTER]

962
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
 I just saw one more thing.

963
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
 No.

964
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
 Yeah, of course, of course.

965
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,040
 Of course.

966
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,680
 Just because this is about America's birth--

967
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,840
 It's not either the sum, is it?

968
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,800
 It's another sum.

969
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,400
 No, it's not.

970
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,920
 This is about America's birthday, right?

971
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,360
 So the 1926 birthday, which was what?

972
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,960
 150 years of America.

973
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,280
 So good calculation.

974
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,680
 Did you have to go online for that one, as well?

975
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,760
 So 50 years before that would have been 1876,

976
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,920
 which was the 100th birthday of America, right?

977
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
 This is not the fact.

978
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,080
 This is not the fact.

979
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
 It's just the setup.

980
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,920
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

981
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,960
 You sarcastic people.

982
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,760
 Right.

983
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,520
 So they celebrated with a thing called

984
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,800
 the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.

985
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,360
 It was this massive, you know, thing

986
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,960
 that affair, basically, they had a human achievement.

987
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,360
 It was in Philadelphia.

988
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,160
 10 million people visited a fifth of the American population.

989
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,120
 There were massive displays.

990
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,280
 They had all kinds of stuff.

991
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,120
 The biggest building in the world.

992
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,840
 It was where they first had Heinz catch up.

993
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,320
 They first had--

994
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,440
 like, they had the arm of the Statue of Liberty

995
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,400
 because they hadn't afforded all the money

996
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,720
 for the actual statue.

997
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,240
 So you could just pay to go up the arm.

998
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,160
 The best thing there was the inventions.

999
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,080
 And the inventions included the first typewriter,

1000
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,040
 Alexander Graham Bell's telephone, a calculator,

1001
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,600
 a mechanical calculator, which--

1002
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,200
 Now I see why you wanted to tell this fact,

1003
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,840
 which measured five foot by eight foot,

1004
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,280
 which would have come in handy earlier today.

1005
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,040
 But the best invention was something called

1006
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,120
 the convertible portmanteau, which was a suitcase made

1007
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,720
 of rubbercloth, which converted into a bath.

1008
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,520
 If you were traveling and there were no baths available,

1009
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,440
 you could just have your suitcase which folded into a bath.

1010
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,280
 Well, your laptop's going to get wet.

1011
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,560
 It feels like you do have to unpack the suitcase first,

1012
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,800
 which you would never see.

1013
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,280
 I don't know all suitcase is converted into baths.

1014
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,440
 If you want them to, I could run the tap in my suitcase.

1015
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,000
 Yeah, I hadn't fully considered that.

1016
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,200
 Yeah.

1017
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,840
 Well, look, thank you for that, eh?

1018
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,120
 OK, that is it.

1019
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,520
 That is all of our facts.

1020
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,880
 Thank you so much for listening.

1021
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,040

 Thank you so much, Berlin.

1036
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,400
 That has been absolutely awesome.

1037
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,240
 We'll see you again.

1038
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,400
 Good night.
