00:00:00,00:00:04,"It's still a little bit hard to walk, isn't it?"
00:00:04,00:00:10,"It's still a little bit hard to walk, isn't it?"
00:00:10,00:00:19,"Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a QI podcast coming to you from our offices here in Covern, Gardurn."
00:00:19,00:00:22,Dan Shriver is still a way that we are working on the pronunciation.
00:00:22,00:00:26,My name is Andrew Murray and I'm here with three of the other QI elves.
00:00:26,00:00:33,"We are Ann Miller, James Harkin and Anna Tajinsky and we have gathered around the microphone to bring you our four favourite facts"
00:00:33,00:00:37,from the last seven days and there are a lot of other facts we found out off the back of those.
00:00:37,00:00:44,"So, let's get going. The first fact of today is Anna."
00:00:44,00:00:51,My fact is that from the year 800 to the year 1349 the Colosseum was used as an apartment block.
00:00:51,00:00:52,Really?
00:00:52,00:01:04,"Yeah, but yeah, we only discovered this a couple of years ago, a bunch of archaeology was done at the Colosseum and they excavated it and they discovered things like sewage pipes and that is evidence that it used to be a block of flats."
00:01:04,00:01:11,"And we know it was owned, it was bought by monks and then they would rent it out to normal people who would take a flat there."
00:01:11,00:01:12,That's good.
00:01:12,00:01:21,That's what happened and the space where they all did all the fighting and the back in the ancient world was a communal living space where they'd have their market space
00:01:21,00:01:23,or where they'd graze their animals or where they'd just hang out.
00:01:23,00:01:24,Have a barbecue.
00:01:24,00:01:27,"Have a barbie of a Sunday afternoon, yeah?"
00:01:27,00:01:31,"It was used for a lot of things, wasn't it? It wasn't just an apartment block once it had fallen into disrepair."
00:01:31,00:01:42,I read that it was used for lots of trades like cobblers and blacksmiths and also glue makers and also a fortress for 12th century wallards called the Frangie Pernie.
00:01:42,00:01:44,"Oh, man, thanks."
00:01:44,00:01:47,"Yeah, that was their main weapon of choice."
00:01:47,00:01:51,"I think the old place they just smothered people with delicious, delicious, comestibles."
00:01:51,00:02:01,"I think it was used as a dumping ground so between when all the vicious sports were banned there in the 5th century and when it was bought up by these monks about 500 years later,"
00:02:01,00:02:05,it was used as just a garbage dump where everyone dumped their old detritus.
00:02:05,00:02:08,"I mean, I guess you've got a big story century, you might as well put stuff in it."
00:02:08,00:02:12,"Yeah, it's weird there. They obviously didn't have much respect for this amazing edifice."
00:02:12,00:02:15,"I think that happens in general around the world, doesn't it?"
00:02:15,00:02:23,"Something will go slightly into disrepair and then people will just steal bits of it to build their own houses and whatever you use, what you can, don't you?"
00:02:23,00:02:25,"Yeah, there is actually in the St Andrews."
00:02:25,00:02:29,We have so quite a lot of St Andrews is places to visit and blew down because it's quite a windy place.
00:02:29,00:02:30,So the castle blew down.
00:02:30,00:02:31,The castle blew down.
00:02:31,00:02:32,The castle blew down.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"They shouldn't have made that a straw, shouldn't they?"
00:02:34,00:02:35,It was on the coast.
00:02:35,00:02:37,The cathedral blew down and they built it back at blew down again.
00:02:37,00:02:43,But they've got this room bowl sort of bits they found around the town and there's one bit this statue that would be on top of a tomb
00:02:43,00:02:46,and they found that used to be made someone's windowsill on one of the town streets.
00:02:46,00:02:47,Oh really?
00:02:47,00:02:49,"They found it like hang on, this belongs to the cathedral and then take it back."
00:02:49,00:02:51,"So they didn't call the Colosseum the Colosseum, did they?"
00:02:51,00:02:52,No.
00:02:52,00:02:54,That's a medieval name for it.
00:02:54,00:03:00,They called it the Flavian amphitheater and also the name Colosseum comes from word for big.
00:03:00,00:03:04,"But it's not because that's big, it's because it's next to another statue which happened to be big."
00:03:04,00:03:05,Really?
00:03:05,00:03:06,What?
00:03:06,00:03:12,There was a huge statue of nearby and that was so big that the area became known as the big statue place.
00:03:12,00:03:13,That's great.
00:03:13,00:03:16,The Pantheon burnt down twice.
00:03:16,00:03:23,"So the Pantheon, the inscription on it reads, ""Marcus the Gripper, son of Lucius, consul for the third time, built this."""
00:03:23,00:03:29,When actually he died about a hundred years before it was built because he built the initial one but it just kept burning down.
00:03:29,00:03:31,We shouldn't have made it out of sticks.
00:03:31,00:03:33,People in building materials.
00:03:33,00:03:38,He's talking as available for architectural consultancy to any little pigs listening.
00:03:38,00:03:45,"So in the Colosseum itself when you were having games there, the person who organised and paid for the games was called the editor."
00:03:45,00:03:46,Which I did not know.
00:03:46,00:03:47,That's rather nice.
00:03:47,00:03:50,So he was selecting who played or was he...?
00:03:50,00:03:54,"Well, I think he definitely got to choose who lived and who died."
00:03:54,00:03:55,So obviously it didn't.
00:03:55,00:03:56,"Oh, it's fake."
00:03:56,00:04:02,"If it's someone who decides who lives and who dies, that means it's kind of fixed a bit like WWF wrestling."
00:04:02,00:04:10,To think people complained about that a lot and there was a genuine wrestling place around the corner.
00:04:10,00:04:12,These guys are really injured.
00:04:12,00:04:16,Well Greco-Roman wrestling is not from Greece or Rome.
00:04:16,00:04:18,It's from France.
00:04:18,00:04:19,Great.
00:04:19,00:04:25,It's invented in France and they gave it the name because they thought it was probably similar to what they did in classical times.
00:04:25,00:04:26,That's very fun.
00:04:26,00:04:27,So when was it invented?
00:04:27,00:04:29,A couple of hundred years ago.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"Oh, okay."
00:04:30,00:04:34,"It was based on, like, there's a French wrestling."
00:04:34,00:04:36,"Oh gosh, I wish I could remember what it's called."
00:04:36,00:04:38,"I think it's called ""Savat"" or something."
00:04:38,00:04:45,And what happens is you kind of crouch down like a crab and then you kick people like that.
00:04:45,00:04:47,And it was done on ships.
00:04:47,00:04:52,"And because the ships rock all the time, you had to hold onto like a bar so you didn't fall over."
00:04:52,00:04:54,And so you do all your wrestling with your feet.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"Now, this is all coming from memory."
00:04:56,00:04:58,This is how you all be completely wrong.
00:04:58,00:05:00,"It's like your shin kicking, isn't it?"
00:05:00,00:05:02,"But that was they were in barrels, they couldn't fall over."
00:05:02,00:05:07,I don't understand how big the barrel must be for you to get two of you in it kicking each other.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"Well, if it's like ones they make whiskey in like 40 years, they're pretty big, aren't they?"
00:05:11,00:05:12,"Yeah, I suppose so."
00:05:12,00:05:16,"But then also, there's no fun for any contestants unless you ever see through barrel."
00:05:16,00:05:21,It's like having a football match where you can only see the waist up of all the players.
00:05:21,00:05:22,"Well, maybe you're looking down into it."
00:05:22,00:05:24,"Well, Diogenes lived in a barrel."
00:05:24,00:05:26,So they must be quite big.
00:05:26,00:05:28,You can't have people round much.
00:05:28,00:05:30,They're a barbecues.
00:05:30,00:05:32,Your plays are mine.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"I think mine again, if that's okay."
00:05:34,00:05:36,Diogenes.
00:05:36,00:05:42,And this is another thing I learned about this week about the Greeks.
00:05:42,00:05:46,"The ancient Greeks used to paint obscene pictures on the inside of their drinking vessels,"
00:05:46,00:05:50,"of their wine glasses, and then they would reveal themselves to you as you drunk."
00:05:50,00:05:54,"So there's pictures of a man, and then his willy is in the bottom of the glass."
00:05:54,00:05:56,"And as you drink it, you can't see it."
00:05:56,00:05:58,"Sorry, it's a picture of his willy."
00:05:58,00:06:02,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:06:02,00:06:04,"Yeah, it's not, yeah."
00:06:04,00:06:06,I used to have a pen like that.
00:06:06,00:06:08,"I remember they made those pens where you'd tell them upside down,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,and a picture is either rude or normal depending on that.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"I'm just imagining someone coming round going,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,"""I'm going to read your tea leaves."""
00:06:14,00:06:16,Oh my god!
00:06:16,00:06:18,That is rude.
00:06:18,00:06:22,"And also they used to paint eyes on the bottom of the glass,"
00:06:22,00:06:26,so that when you drank it looked like you were wearing a mask.
00:06:26,00:06:28,"See, they're making a combo."
00:06:28,00:06:30,"I bought my brother party cups, so they got novelty noses."
00:06:30,00:06:32,"So when you drink, he got like a beaker or a pig's lower."
00:06:32,00:06:34,"Honestly, 2000 years too late."
00:06:34,00:06:36,That's amazing from the Greeks.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"I read a thing about the Colosseum as well,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,"which is that in the 1500s,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,it was inspired by the previous people who lived in the Colosseum.
00:06:42,00:06:44,"Pope Sixthus the Fifth wanted to turn it into a wool factory,"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"so the factory would be on the ground floor,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,and then living quarters on the top.
00:06:48,00:06:50,But he died and they ran out of money and didn't get made.
00:06:50,00:06:52,I like Sixthus the Fifth as well.
00:06:52,00:06:54,Was there a Sixthus the Sixth?
00:06:54,00:06:56,I can't even say that.
00:06:56,00:06:58,"It's too much of a tongue twister, that's why."
00:06:58,00:07:00,"He was actually the Sixth, he just had to say it was the Fifth."
00:07:00,00:07:02,No one could pronounce Sixthus the Sixth.
00:07:02,00:07:06,"Sixthus the Fourth, Sixthus the Fifth, Sixthus the Seventh."
00:07:06,00:07:08,"Roman Concrete is quite interesting,"
00:07:08,00:07:12,"the material that they made the Colosseum out of,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"in that we don't know how it's lasted so long,"
00:07:14,00:07:18,and we've sort of lost the exact formula for Roman Concrete
00:07:18,00:07:19,and how they made it.
00:07:19,00:07:21,So the concrete that we use now is stronger
00:07:21,00:07:23,than what the Colosseum is made out of.
00:07:23,00:07:25,"But it wouldn't last nearly as long, it roads much faster."
00:07:25,00:07:29,"And they think it's because it uses a lot of volcanic ash,"
00:07:29,00:07:31,and that's much harder to erode.
00:07:31,00:07:33,And then they also used animal fat and milk and blood
00:07:33,00:07:35,"to kind of adhere it together, didn't they?"
00:07:35,00:07:37,I guess the Colosseum had first supplies.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"Scuba nuts, builders and play."
00:07:39,00:07:41,That's amazing.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"Yeah, quite cool."
00:07:43,00:07:45,"And all this is cool, in ancient China,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,they used to use sticky rice as a building material
00:07:47,00:07:51,to stick stuff together in their concrete equivalent.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"Did it work? Yeah, worked really well."
00:07:53,00:07:55,It's still standing. Still standing.
00:07:55,00:07:57,"If you think about it though,"
00:07:57,00:07:59,"if you have like a Chinese takeaway,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"and then the day after it's on a plate,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,"and the rice is still on the plate,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,"it's pretty hard to get off its sticks a lot, yeah."
00:08:05,00:08:07,"On the Colosseum, just a couple of things I thought you might like."
00:08:07,00:08:11,"So two American tourists chipped off a bit of the Colosseum in Rome,"
00:08:11,00:08:13,"and they later returned it,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,but they returned it 25 years later in 2009.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"They felt really bad about it, every time they look at it,"
00:08:17,00:08:21,in their collection of things they've stolen from Lama.
00:08:21,00:08:25,"Do you know that people often steal bits of Uluru,"
00:08:25,00:08:27,which is Ezra.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:29,00:08:31,"But they almost always send it back,"
00:08:31,00:08:33,"and they get these very often,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,they get these bits of Uluru sent through the post
00:08:35,00:08:37,to the National Park.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"And the reason is, because people steal it,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"and then they have some bad luck,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,and they always blame it on the fact that they stole this from
00:08:43,00:08:45,as rough as so they always send it back.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"You know there's gladiator guys who hang around outside it,"
00:08:47,00:08:49,asking tourists if they want to have their photo taken.
00:08:49,00:08:51,Wolf and Shadow and...
00:08:51,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:55,So I love this story.
00:08:55,00:08:57,Italian police arrested 20 of them recently
00:08:57,00:08:59,"in an undercover operation,"
00:08:59,00:09:01,because they were intimidating all the rival gladiators
00:09:01,00:09:03,and being physically aggressive with them.
00:09:03,00:09:05,"Yes, that's brilliant."
00:09:05,00:09:07,How did they arrest them with like a net?
00:09:07,00:09:09,That's the thing.
00:09:09,00:09:11,Some police officers had to dress as gladiators
00:09:11,00:09:13,to get evidence of them being intimidating.
00:09:13,00:09:15,And then they took down the...
00:09:15,00:09:17,I just think it's the funniest story.
00:09:17,00:09:19,So an elaborate sting operation?
00:09:19,00:09:21,Arresting them for being aggressive
00:09:21,00:09:23,when they are dressed as gladiators.
00:09:23,00:09:25,Arresting them for fighting each other as well.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:27,00:09:29,I think they get in trouble because they sort of say
00:09:29,00:09:31,"I'll post for a picture, then like demand 30 euros or something."
00:09:31,00:09:33,And then the story is that some of the rogue ones
00:09:33,00:09:35,would like take your camera and then wouldn't give it back
00:09:35,00:09:37,until you paid them a certain amount of money.
00:09:37,00:09:39,Because they need to pay for their freedom.
00:09:39,00:09:39,Otherwise they'll be gladiators for life.
00:09:39,00:09:41,And that's no life.
00:09:41,00:09:43,They used to die the sand in the coliseum red.
00:09:43,00:09:45,Didn't they to make it blend in with all the blood?
00:09:45,00:09:47,No.
00:09:47,00:09:49,Have they died?
00:09:49,00:09:51,I'm not sure with blood.
00:09:51,00:09:53,The walls were made out of blood.
00:09:53,00:09:55,An animal that's on whatever.
00:09:55,00:09:57,I think there's not enough blood in this area.
00:09:57,00:10:01,"Okay, so what about some unusual places to live?"
00:10:01,00:10:03,Yeah.
00:10:03,00:10:07,There was a guy in Morocco called azayadine old barja
00:10:07,00:10:11,and he and his family listed city toilets as their official address.
00:10:11,00:10:13,So they were living in a toilet block.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"Fed up with his situation, he went to his local newspaper to tell his story"
00:10:17,00:10:19,but then the local authorities read the article
00:10:19,00:10:23,and then blocked up the toilet's entrance with cement and concrete
00:10:23,00:10:25,so he couldn't live there anymore.
00:10:25,00:10:27,Wow.
00:10:27,00:10:29,Isn't that the saddest story you've ever heard?
00:10:29,00:10:31,Was he going from stall to stall?
00:10:31,00:10:33,Did he have a bedroom stall and a living room stall
00:10:33,00:10:35,and a library stall?
00:10:35,00:10:37,A library stall and a bathroom.
00:10:37,00:10:39,Does anyone have anything else?
00:10:39,00:10:41,"Oh, I just had that one, just unusual housing."
00:10:41,00:10:43,That's a story that did the rounds a while ago
00:10:43,00:10:45,about a woman who's found living in a man's cupboard in Japan.
00:10:45,00:10:47,Then he only found out when food started vanishing from his fridge
00:10:47,00:10:51,and then he set up cameras and she moved in to his cupboard.
00:10:51,00:10:53,What?
00:10:53,00:10:55,Japanese times are quite small generally.
00:10:55,00:10:57,You would notice.
00:10:57,00:10:59,It was a cubby hole in the cupboard area
00:10:59,00:11:01,and she said she'd been there for a year but only on and off.
00:11:01,00:11:03,Oh my god.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"So if you have a cupboard you don't go into, just check them every now and again."
00:11:05,00:11:07,Which then cement her cupboard up.
00:11:07,00:11:09,Maybe I could get back in.
00:11:09,00:11:13,"Okay guys, and let's move on to fact number two"
00:11:13,00:11:15,which this week comes from James.
00:11:15,00:11:20,"Okay, my fact this week is that you can be find for swearing in Australia"
00:11:20,00:11:25,and in the last financial year people in Australia's Northern Territory
00:11:25,00:11:29,"paid $48,372 in fines."
00:11:29,00:11:31,Fuck off.
00:11:31,00:11:33,That's unpredictable.
00:11:33,00:11:35,Why are people being fined for swearing?
00:11:35,00:11:37,"Yeah, I mean it's actually been against law"
00:11:37,00:11:39,in lots of different countries at different times.
00:11:39,00:11:41,Yeah.
00:11:41,00:11:47,"It's illegal in this country to use threatening, insulting or abusive behaviour"
00:11:47,00:11:49,especially against police
00:11:49,00:11:51,but that's not necessarily swearing.
00:11:51,00:11:53,You could still swearing not be abusive.
00:11:53,00:11:55,But you're tone.
00:11:55,00:11:59,"He said banana in a really menacing way, like in trouble."
00:11:59,00:12:01,Tell some of the F-off quite friendlyly.
00:12:01,00:12:05,When Australia introduced this law there were lots of sweary protests
00:12:05,00:12:07,and one of them was called the fuck walk.
00:12:07,00:12:11,I found a quotation from it which was from a green MP
00:12:11,00:12:15,in the Victoria State Parliament called Colleen Hartland.
00:12:15,00:12:19,"She said, is farty poo bum a swear word?"
00:12:19,00:12:21,Is windy bottom a swear word?
00:12:21,00:12:23,"Yeah, it's a very valid point"
00:12:23,00:12:25,because you can just say very very mild things
00:12:25,00:12:27,but it's all about the intent as you say the banana.
00:12:27,00:12:29,Where were we?
00:12:29,00:12:33,I read this fact on a website called Nothing to Do With Our Broath.
00:12:33,00:12:37,It's a blog of weird news from around the world.
00:12:37,00:12:41,In the article that I read they had an interview with local man Jack Bullen
00:12:41,00:12:45,"who said, I find those words slip into my vocabulary even when they shouldn't."
00:12:45,00:12:49,I think the heat contributes to people being more aggressive
00:12:49,00:12:51,but swearing isn't really a sign of aggression.
00:12:51,00:12:53,It's more of a communication tool.
00:12:53,00:12:55,Mr. Bullen has lost his job at the primary school.
00:12:55,00:12:59,And then the article goes on.
00:12:59,00:13:03,Some residents said they had no idea letting loose a foul malty raid
00:13:03,00:13:05,could cost them a fine.
00:13:05,00:13:07,Others just didn't give a shit.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"It's been, it's gone back for centuries being fine for swearing."
00:13:11,00:13:13,Oh yeah. Don't expect to the 18th century?
00:13:13,00:13:15,I think no centuries at all.
00:13:15,00:13:17,The purest of all.
00:13:17,00:13:19,And this is quite interesting.
00:13:19,00:13:23,"The finds that you got very, according to your social class"
00:13:23,00:13:26,so the profane oaths act of 1745.
00:13:26,00:13:29,You got to find five shillings if you were a gentleman
00:13:29,00:13:32,or above two shillings if you were below that.
00:13:32,00:13:35,And only one shilling if you were a day worker or a common soldier
00:13:35,00:13:37,or a tailor or something like that.
00:13:37,00:13:39,So it was worse if you were well bred to be.
00:13:39,00:13:41,"Yeah, that was the idea."
00:13:41,00:13:43,Or it could be just that you could afford more.
00:13:43,00:13:45,Or so you'd like her and that more.
00:13:45,00:13:49,Is it in Sweden where you're driving fine depends on how much you earn?
00:13:49,00:13:51,Yeah.
00:13:51,00:13:53,So it means tested finding.
00:13:53,00:13:55,In Sydney you can get the fine went up a couple of years ago
00:13:55,00:13:59,for swearing from $150 to $500.
00:13:59,00:14:01,Oh wow.
00:14:01,00:14:03,But the worst thing is as soon as you get fine
00:14:03,00:14:05,and they tell you that you're the swearing out.
00:14:05,00:14:07,Double fine.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"I was reading this brilliant book,"
00:14:09,00:14:11,except from a book online about history of swearing
00:14:11,00:14:14,"and said that so in the original OED, just 1888,"
00:14:14,00:14:17,"they just got bloody as like the worst, most terrible word."
00:14:17,00:14:19,But being Victoria they didn't list the affinities.
00:14:19,00:14:21,Bloody was the worst word they could put in the OED.
00:14:21,00:14:23,So it's just that this is the worst of them.
00:14:23,00:14:25,The ones that were the ones that were list.
00:14:25,00:14:27,But then it's better.
00:14:27,00:14:29,So there's another book which is in 1785.
00:14:29,00:14:31,The classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue
00:14:31,00:14:33,"included the word ""huffle"","
00:14:33,00:14:35,which was too filthy for explanation.
00:14:35,00:14:37,And in a later book there's another book
00:14:37,00:14:39,that wouldn't describe what bagpiping was.
00:14:39,00:14:41,What is bagpiping?
00:14:41,00:14:43,I think they were both for Felatius.
00:14:43,00:14:45,The Victorians were not impressed.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"But halfling and bagpiping, ""huffle""."
00:14:47,00:14:51,They were originally called House Felatio.
00:14:51,00:14:55,"Actually, Felatio does sound like a magic word."
00:14:55,00:14:57,That's what I'm talking about.
00:14:57,00:14:59,That's Felatio.
00:14:59,00:15:01,I don't know what would happen.
00:15:01,00:15:03,I can't do it.
00:15:03,00:15:09,"So the bloody was really bad, wasn't it?"
00:15:09,00:15:11,And when Pigmalion came out
00:15:11,00:15:13,"and Elizadolittle said the word ""bloody"","
00:15:13,00:15:15,there was like a big scandal about it.
00:15:15,00:15:19,"So Elizadolittle, in Pigmalion, said,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,"""Walk, not bloody likely in this podcast."""
00:15:21,00:15:23,"And the quote is,"
00:15:23,00:15:27,"""The first night's audience greeted the word with a few seconds"
00:15:27,00:15:29,"of stunned, disbelieving silence"
00:15:29,00:15:33,"and then hysterical laughter for at least a minute and a quarter."""
00:15:33,00:15:35,That's what I think is so nice.
00:15:35,00:15:37,These stories of when swear words weren't as bad.
00:15:37,00:15:41,"I think we've kind of missed out on words of really, really uncommon,"
00:15:41,00:15:43,unless you're a soldier or a sailor or something.
00:15:43,00:15:45,"Maybe there are words, and we just don't know them."
00:15:45,00:15:47,Huffling.
00:15:47,00:15:49,We don't know for a minute.
00:15:49,00:15:51,The army has new top secret swear words.
00:15:51,00:15:55,"So yes, swearing was worse in medieval times, wasn't it?"
00:15:55,00:15:57,Because they were always blasphemous.
00:15:57,00:15:59,But in blasphemy was obviously a terrible thing.
00:15:59,00:16:01,"And you could, I think you could be killed for it."
00:16:01,00:16:03,"Yeah, probably."
00:16:03,00:16:07,"But the user thing that swearing would physically hurt,"
00:16:07,00:16:09,"like blasphemy, would physically hurt Jesus Christ."
00:16:09,00:16:11,So the words that you could possibly say was Jesus Christ's nails.
00:16:11,00:16:13,And that was absolutely horrific.
00:16:13,00:16:17,And that's because he's up in heaven and you physically hurt him every time you say that.
00:16:17,00:16:21,"Or if you say, ""By Christ's blood,"" then, you know, I don't know, he leads."
00:16:21,00:16:23,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:23,00:16:25,"I think that's where bloody comes from, isn't it, from the blood of Christ, probably."
00:16:25,00:16:29,I think so. I'm not sure what sounds come from the phrase God's wounds.
00:16:29,00:16:33,"Sorry, sorry. What's this word, what's that you're telling us?"
00:16:33,00:16:35,You must have heard it before.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"Yeah, we've heard it, but you say it as though it's a standard parlance."
00:16:37,00:16:41,"So ever there's links. Yeah, it's like in a comic in Scooby-Doo."
00:16:41,00:16:45,"Yeah. Well, yeah, that's probably a palliative version of sounds."
00:16:45,00:16:49,So these are what's called minced oats.
00:16:49,00:16:51,"So, all right, good ducks."
00:16:51,00:16:53,Have you heard the word good ducks?
00:16:53,00:16:55,"God's hooks, no."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"Okay, it's another old school swear word."
00:16:57,00:16:59,"And it was, yeah, exactly by God's hooks."
00:16:59,00:17:03,"Yeah, that could be where zikes comes from, then. God's hooks."
00:17:03,00:17:05,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it might be."
00:17:05,00:17:07,"And so it's a minced, both of them, minced oats itself."
00:17:07,00:17:13,"Yeah. And there were things like slid, which was from the late 16th century,"
00:17:13,00:17:15,which was by God's eyelid.
00:17:15,00:17:17,"Really, it's foot by God's foot."
00:17:17,00:17:19,"It's just taking all these body parts, right?"
00:17:19,00:17:23,About 0.7% of the words we use are swear words.
00:17:23,00:17:27,"Which doesn't sound like very much, but, apparently, that's the same as pronums."
00:17:27,00:17:31,"So we swear on our fridge as much as we're saying, like,"
00:17:31,00:17:35,your hour or hour sales a lot.
00:17:35,00:17:37,"It is quite a lot, isn't it?"
00:17:37,00:17:39,I don't even know if they're including sounds.
00:17:39,00:17:45,"Time for fact number three, which is my one this week."
00:17:45,00:17:49,"And it is that when the first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858,"
00:17:49,00:17:55,the reception on it was so bad that it took 17 hours to send the first message across.
00:17:55,00:17:57,Wow. Yeah.
00:17:57,00:17:59,Similar to our Wi-Fi in this episode.
00:17:59,00:18:03,It's a message from Queen Victoria to President Buchanan Urgent.
00:18:03,00:18:05,Probably not.
00:18:05,00:18:07,But depends. It was a 98 word to be fair.
00:18:07,00:18:09,So it was longer than your average text.
00:18:09,00:18:11,Are there any swear words in that?
00:18:11,00:18:15,There's fervently reciprocal and pleasure.
00:18:15,00:18:17,"But they're not. So wait a minute, wait a minute."
00:18:17,00:18:23,The Queen sent a message to the president about reciprocal pleasure.
00:18:23,00:18:25,It was the first sex. I think we believe.
00:18:25,00:18:29,The friendship is founded on their common interests and reciprocal as steam.
00:18:29,00:18:33,The Queen has much pleasure in thus directly communicating with a lot of internationalist flannel.
00:18:33,00:18:37,The first time they could communicate directly over 17 hours.
00:18:37,00:18:39,Before that it would have taken something like 12 days to get a message across.
00:18:39,00:18:41,So it was an incredible achievement.
00:18:41,00:18:45,But the story of how they installed the first cable is just unbelievable.
00:18:45,00:18:47,They had one across the English Channel.
00:18:47,00:18:49,That was the first one.
00:18:49,00:18:53,And this was after decades of people just testing it out in ponds and things like that.
00:18:53,00:18:55,So the first apps were just people with their garden ponds.
00:18:55,00:18:59,They just put a load of cable in the ponds and see it saw if they could get a message from one end to the other.
00:18:59,00:19:01,And they could.
00:19:01,00:19:03,I know that there was a whale scare in that laying of the first one.
00:19:03,00:19:05,They wrote that they saw a whale swimming over the cable.
00:19:05,00:19:07,"And they thought, ""Oh my god, it's going to ruin it."""
00:19:07,00:19:11,And then it brushed up against it and swam on its way.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"But it was quite rubbish, wasn't it?"
00:19:13,00:19:15,The reception wasn't good for the one you're talking about the first one.
00:19:15,00:19:17,Because it just wasn't successful.
00:19:17,00:19:19,"So it was broken within a month, I think,"
00:19:19,00:19:25,"by this guy called Wildman White House, who applied excessive voltage to it trying to get the signal better,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,"I guess, and trying to make it take less than 17 hours."
00:19:27,00:19:29,His full name is amazing.
00:19:29,00:19:31,It was Edward Orange Wildman White House.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"And actually, the Victoria one wasn't the very first message."
00:19:33,00:19:37,"The very first ever transatlantic message read,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,"""Laws, White House received five-minute signal."
00:19:39,00:19:41,"Coil signals, two-week delay."
00:19:41,00:19:43,Try drive slow and regular.
00:19:43,00:19:45,I have put intermediate pulley.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"Reply by coils."""
00:19:47,00:19:50,"There's always, like, the first telegraph was supposedly what God hath wrought."
00:19:50,00:19:52,"And actually, it wasn't. It was telegraph test."
00:19:52,00:19:53,"Yeah, exactly."
00:19:53,00:19:57,"Yeah, and the first words on the moon were supposed to be one small step."
00:19:57,00:19:59,"But actually, it was contact light."
00:19:59,00:20:00,Yeah.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"Oh, but you know the Alexander Graham Bell thing."
00:20:02,00:20:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:03,00:20:07,"So, 40 years after that first seminal phone call,"
00:20:07,00:20:09,"there was the first ever transcontinental phone call,"
00:20:09,00:20:13,which went from Boston to San Francisco.
00:20:13,00:20:15,"And they tested it several months before,"
00:20:15,00:20:16,so it wasn't the first actual contact.
00:20:16,00:20:20,But they did a ceremony where Alexander Graham Bell and Watson
00:20:20,00:20:23,spoke by telephone to each other over the same connection.
00:20:23,00:20:26,And they did a reprise of the original conversation.
00:20:26,00:20:29,"So, he said, ""Mr. Watson, come here, I want you."""
00:20:29,00:20:33,"And then Watson replied, ""It would take me a week to get to you this time."""
00:20:33,00:20:34,It's not cool.
00:20:34,00:20:36,"""Mr. Watson, come here, I want you."""
00:20:36,00:20:39,I think that was the first sexting.
00:20:39,00:20:41,That was the first booty call.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:47,"So, the first time they used cables in a telephone conversation"
00:20:47,00:20:51,between the US and Britain was in 1927.
00:20:51,00:20:54,And the Guardian has quite a funny description of it.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"So, it relays the conversation."
00:20:56,00:20:58,We don't know who took part in this conversation.
00:20:58,00:21:01,"But the Guardian says, ""Conversation is quite unordered"
00:21:01,00:21:03,"by the marvel in which they were taking part,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"fell back as we all do on the weather,"
00:21:05,00:21:08,which was quite bad enough on either side to make a strong bond of sympathy.
00:21:08,00:21:10,"Indeed, a more pleasantly futile dialogue"
00:21:10,00:21:13,could hardly have taken place over a suburban party wall
00:21:13,00:21:15,"in dullich or Trolton come hardy."""
00:21:15,00:21:18,"And that, which so astonishingly bridged the ocean."
00:21:18,00:21:20,"This is quite interesting, though, actually."
00:21:20,00:21:23,"Only one unusual item of small talk broke its commonplace flow,"
00:21:23,00:21:27,"and we may take it that in trans-oceanic gossiping,"
00:21:27,00:21:30,what's the time with you has come to stay as an addition of conversation.
00:21:30,00:21:32,"Suddenly, the idea of a time difference,"
00:21:32,00:21:35,"which had never been considered before, became a thing."
00:21:35,00:21:37,"It would be like, ""What is a different time of day?"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"Hadn't crossed my mind, and people were apparently astonished by this."""
00:21:40,00:21:42,It's still now if you ring people up in another country.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"It's like, ""What time is it there?"""
00:21:43,00:21:45,"Exactly, so that was quite a good prediction, wasn't it?"
00:21:45,00:21:46,I've been up for eight.
00:21:46,00:21:48,I still find it amazing that most of the internet
00:21:48,00:21:51,is going around the world in undersea cables.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"Yeah, it's odd."
00:21:52,00:21:54,It's really odd.
00:21:54,00:21:58,There are nearly 300 communications cables under the sea around the world.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"And there are these vast things,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,and lots of them are not even on.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"There are 20 which are not yet in use,"
00:22:04,00:22:05,which are called dark cables.
00:22:05,00:22:08,"Eventually, they will be in use if our bandwidth increases,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,and they cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:22:10,00:22:14,"So the first message that was sent over the ARPANET,"
00:22:14,00:22:17,which was like the pre-carser to the internet.
00:22:17,00:22:19,It was where the internet started.
00:22:19,00:22:21,It was in 1969. Do you know what the message was?
00:22:21,00:22:23,What time is it with you?
00:22:23,00:22:25,It was not that.
00:22:25,00:22:27,Was it Ed Bowles?
00:22:27,00:22:30,Was it Logan?
00:22:30,00:22:32,"It wasn't even, it wasn't Logan."
00:22:32,00:22:34,It was supposed to be because that was the first command
00:22:34,00:22:37,"they were giving, but the system broke down after two letters."
00:22:37,00:22:39,So it was just low.
00:22:39,00:22:40,So how do you know he's going to say log in?
00:22:40,00:22:42,He might be trying to say low.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:44,First message.
00:22:44,00:22:46,"Well, I don't think he should have admitted that it was wrong,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,because low could have just been low.
00:22:48,00:22:49,"You know, low."
00:22:49,00:22:51,You are familiar with like really old schoolers
00:22:51,00:22:52,that no one uses any more.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Oh, God's looks I am."
00:22:53,00:22:54,Dinks.
00:22:54,00:22:56,"You say low all the time, right?"
00:22:56,00:22:58,"Low, we're out of teeth."
00:22:58,00:22:59,That's a real slumber.
00:22:59,00:23:01,What I'm like around the author.
00:23:01,00:23:03,What he means is the level of teeth is low.
00:23:03,00:23:05,He means the level of teeth is low.
00:23:05,00:23:06,Yeah.
00:23:06,00:23:08,I know we need to get more supplies.
00:23:08,00:23:10,The guy who sent the first email doesn't remember
00:23:10,00:23:11,what it says.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Oh no.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"I bet he does, but he's embarrassed."
00:23:14,00:23:17,I think he wrote something embarrassing about a colleague
00:23:17,00:23:19,and accidentally sent it to the colleague.
00:23:19,00:23:21,I don't want anybody to know.
00:23:21,00:23:23,I think Dave is an arse.
00:23:23,00:23:26,"But at that time, there will be two email addresses here today."
00:23:26,00:23:28,"Dave's like, come on."
00:23:28,00:23:30,The second email is dear Dave.
00:23:30,00:23:32,I think there may have been a bit of a mistake.
00:23:32,00:23:37,"I was talking, of course, about Dave in accounts."
00:23:37,00:23:38,Yeah.
00:23:38,00:23:40,I just think people should plan this.
00:23:40,00:23:42,I was thinking about this because we talk about the first text
00:23:42,00:23:43,of the phone calls and the cables.
00:23:43,00:23:44,And you should plan.
00:23:44,00:23:47,"If you're sending the first email, make sure it's something funny"
00:23:47,00:23:48,or weird.
00:23:48,00:23:50,Or that people are going to be writing down your books
00:23:50,00:23:51,and repeating on podcasts.
00:23:51,00:23:54,My first purpose was it to equivalent if you meet someone
00:23:54,00:23:56,because they become your best friend or your other half.
00:23:56,00:23:57,And you don't know.
00:23:57,00:23:59,So you don't take something profound.
00:23:59,00:24:00,You just say like five or more.
00:24:00,00:24:03,I say something profound to every single woman I meet.
00:24:03,00:24:04,You have to.
00:24:04,00:24:05,Just in case they become.
00:24:05,00:24:06,That's the story for the wedding.
00:24:06,00:24:07,"You're like, well, actually, we've had something lovely."
00:24:07,00:24:08,I am married.
00:24:08,00:24:09,So.
00:24:09,00:24:10,Yeah.
00:24:10,00:24:13,It worked eventually.
00:24:13,00:24:14,OK.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"Time for fact number four, which comes from Anne."
00:24:16,00:24:17,Yes.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"Last year, I just celebrated World Vegan Day."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"Peter, the animal charity, asked fry up in Yorkshire"
00:24:22,00:24:24,to change its name to vegan fry up.
00:24:24,00:24:25,And did they do that?
00:24:25,00:24:26,No.
00:24:26,00:24:28,It was a fair offer.
00:24:28,00:24:29,Peter did say he only had to do it for one day.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"And if they did so, they provide the whole town village"
00:24:32,00:24:35,"with a free vegan breakfast, vegan sausages and vegan bacon."
00:24:35,00:24:36,Try it pleasantly.
00:24:36,00:24:37,It's called faken.
00:24:37,00:24:39,Town didn't go for the offer.
00:24:39,00:24:41,"One of the councillors said, first of all,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,there's not really anyone in charge of the town's name.
00:24:43,00:24:44,So it'd be quite hard to get everyone to agree.
00:24:44,00:24:47,"And that they're not named after an actual fry up after the goddess figure,"
00:24:47,00:24:48,who's Anglo-Saxon pig.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Yeah.
00:24:49,00:24:50,Yeah.
00:24:50,00:24:51,After whom fry day is named?
00:24:51,00:24:52,Yes.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Not the breakfast.
00:24:53,00:24:55,"It really is an indictment of veganism, isn't it?"
00:24:55,00:24:58,When an entire village says they're not willing to change their name
00:24:58,00:25:01,for one day to all get a free vegan fry up.
00:25:01,00:25:04,People do not want vegan fry up.
00:25:04,00:25:06,No matter how much bacon you put in them.
00:25:06,00:25:07,Yeah.
00:25:07,00:25:08,Great fry up.
00:25:08,00:25:09,It's not a very exciting place.
00:25:09,00:25:11,I tried to find an exciting place.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"I felt a little fry up nearby, isn't it?"
00:25:13,00:25:14,There is.
00:25:14,00:25:16,That's even smaller and I think less exciting.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"It has no shops, not even a pub, according to Wikipedia."
00:25:18,00:25:22,"It has a telephone box, a post box, a village hall and an outdoor centre."
00:25:22,00:25:26,And it also has a local cricket pitch and a quits pitch.
00:25:26,00:25:30,And I think if you're having to claim a brag about your quits pitch.
00:25:30,00:25:33,But I like the idea of the being a great fry up and a little fry up.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Yeah.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"Because it's like an option for breakfast, isn't it?"
00:25:36,00:25:37,Yeah.
00:25:37,00:25:39,But you want to get one sausage for this one.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Yeah.
00:25:40,00:25:42,All the health con just people live in a little fry up.
00:25:42,00:25:43,Yeah.
00:25:43,00:25:44,Do you read about?
00:25:44,00:25:45,Do you read this horrible thing as a caffeine?
00:25:45,00:25:46,Gregorne sells the kids breakfast.
00:25:46,00:25:47,KID said.
00:25:47,00:25:48,Not for kids.
00:25:48,00:25:49,It weighs the same as a child.
00:25:49,00:25:51,Nine pounds of cut over.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"Basically, yeah."
00:25:52,00:25:55,"Six eggs, 12 bacon pieces, 12 sausages."
00:25:55,00:25:57,It weighs the same as a child.
00:25:57,00:26:03,But then the worst thing is that people who are to the quits breakfast might be kids if they don't realise that.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Yeah.
00:26:04,00:26:06,And so they get a breakfast which is the same size as that.
00:26:06,00:26:09,I can possibly beat that though for terrible food ideas.
00:26:09,00:26:12,"So this is again, I'm very proud to say this is my hometown did this."
00:26:12,00:26:13,Made the news last year.
00:26:13,00:26:16,Because the local hospital is selling a fry up pie for £1.50.
00:26:16,00:26:18,And the hospital can't see that.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Wow.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Sounds delicious.
00:26:20,00:26:21,That sounds great.
00:26:21,00:26:25,"Well, one of the bakery said, well, we're already making a full Scottish breakfast in a wrap."
00:26:25,00:26:26,So we thought.
00:26:26,00:26:28,I'm not trying to reply.
00:26:28,00:26:33,"I've always thought when having a full Scottish breakfast, there's not enough carbohydrate."
00:26:33,00:26:35,So keep me going until 11th is.
00:26:35,00:26:39,"In Bolton, we would have, like, pasty barms."
00:26:39,00:26:41,It's quite common or a pie bar.
00:26:41,00:26:42,Oh yeah.
00:26:42,00:26:43,In Wig and they'd have that.
00:26:43,00:26:44,What's that?
00:26:44,00:26:45,Is that something you rub on yourself?
00:26:45,00:26:46,Pie bar.
00:26:46,00:26:52,Soot your cracked lips.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"Yeah, a pastry into every orbit of your body."
00:26:55,00:26:59,"No, a barms and a barm cake has in a bread roll or whatever you would call that."
00:26:59,00:27:01,So it's like a pie sandwich.
00:27:01,00:27:02,It's meat and potatoes.
00:27:02,00:27:08,"So you've got carbs there with your potatoes inside pastry, which is more carbs inside a bread, which is more carb."
00:27:08,00:27:11,"In the new Hampshire, you can buy a scratch card."
00:27:11,00:27:13,"Well, when you scratch it, it gives off the smell of bacon."
00:27:13,00:27:17,It's called the eye heart bacon scratch ticket.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"Well, that is a very imaginative name."
00:27:20,00:27:22,"What do we call it, guys?"
00:27:22,00:27:24,They should have called it pork scratchings.
00:27:24,00:27:25,Oh no!
00:27:25,00:27:27,"Come on, people."
00:27:27,00:27:28,You're so right.
00:27:28,00:27:29,It's really good.
00:27:29,00:27:31,"There's bacon perfume, isn't there?"
00:27:31,00:27:32,As well.
00:27:32,00:27:33,You can get bacon tender perfume.
00:27:33,00:27:34,"Well, I think it's good."
00:27:34,00:27:37,They won't go well with my pie bar and then I will.
00:27:37,00:27:40,Peter tried to change loads of different places names.
00:27:40,00:27:41,Haven't they?
00:27:41,00:27:49,"A few years ago, it might have been even this year, they tried to get Nottingham City Council to change the name to Not Eating Ham."
00:27:49,00:27:50,Oh my goodness.
00:27:50,00:27:52,How does this ever work?
00:27:52,00:27:54,"Well, I think it does work."
00:27:54,00:27:57,"Yeah, it does work because it gets them in the newspapers."
00:27:57,00:28:04,The mayor of Fishkill was asked if it's near New York City if they change it to Fish Save.
00:28:04,00:28:08,Did they contact the mayor of Dead Cow burger meat?
00:28:08,00:28:19,"There's a place called Feather Bed Rocks, which is near Siem and they wanted to call it Synthetic Feather Bed Rocks."
00:28:19,00:28:24,"And also, the pet shop boys, they asked them to change their name to the rescue shelter boys."
00:28:24,00:28:26,"Oh yeah, because they hate pets, don't they?"
00:28:26,00:28:27,They're against pets.
00:28:27,00:28:31,Did they ask the super furry animals to change their name to the super synthetic furry animals?
00:28:31,00:28:32,They should have done something.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:44,"The other thing they tried to change Peter was, I think we mentioned it on the TV show, which is they tried to change fish into sea kittens in the hope that people wouldn't eat them as much."
00:28:44,00:28:46,"Well, that's not an insane idea."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"I mean, obviously, it's an insane idea."
00:28:48,00:28:52,"But the name does severely alter your perception of something, doesn't it?"
00:28:52,00:28:54,"Yeah, so for instance, there are other fish."
00:28:54,00:28:56,There's a fish called a slime head.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"And if you eat that, actually, it's called an orange ruffy."
00:29:00,00:29:06,"So if you eat orange ruffy, the original name of that fish was a slime head fish, but it changed it so that people would eat it."
00:29:06,00:29:09,So what would it take to agree to change your town's name?
00:29:09,00:29:10,Would you go for it?
00:29:10,00:29:17,"So there was the town of Clark, Texas, renamed itself Dish, after the Echo Star Communications Dish Network."
00:29:17,00:29:19,And they all got free satellite dishes on their houses.
00:29:19,00:29:20,"Oh, that's good."
00:29:20,00:29:23,It's a shame that Clark isn't in Kent.
00:29:23,00:29:28,"I'd be happy to have to change Hack Me into Sky Spots, if they gave me free Sky Spots."
00:29:28,00:29:32,"Yeah, I think I'd sell my town's name immediately for a bag of sweets."
00:29:32,00:29:37,"There was a place in Texas which the mayor and the members of the Chamber of Commerce,"
00:29:37,00:29:40,they wanted voters to approve the name change they had in mind.
00:29:40,00:29:41,This was in 2005.
00:29:41,00:29:44,The place is called White Settlement.
00:29:44,00:29:49,The measure was voted on and was defeated by 9-1.
00:29:49,00:29:53,"As one resident said, why don't they go ahead and change the name of the White House to the West House?"
00:29:53,00:29:54,It's all a bunch of poppycock.
00:29:54,00:30:02,"The thing is, the White Settlement is named from the 1840s when a community of White Settlers occupied an area surrounded by several Native American villages."
00:30:02,00:30:04,"Right, so it's not an Inners index."
00:30:04,00:30:05,"Sorry, sorry."
00:30:05,00:30:07,It's not like being called Mr White.
00:30:07,00:30:19,"There is a village in Spain called Castillo Matajudios, which translates as ""Fort Kill the Jews""."
00:30:19,00:30:24,They voted last year to change their name and it went through.
00:30:24,00:30:27,It takes about a year for the process to go through.
00:30:27,00:30:31,So by around June or July this year they should change their name.
00:30:31,00:30:33,You've got to be not interested.
00:30:33,00:30:35,"I mean, I know it's offensive, but it is interesting."
00:30:35,00:30:36,It's really interesting.
00:30:36,00:30:37,You've got to wonder why I took them so long.
00:30:37,00:30:44,"Yeah, it dates back from the expulsion of the Jews in 1492 by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella."
00:30:44,00:30:45,Wow.
00:30:45,00:30:49,"So it's just a very long historical thing, but they've finally voted to do that."
00:30:49,00:30:50,You can get a map.
00:30:50,00:30:54,I wanted to get some of the Christmas of all the funny place names in the UK.
00:30:54,00:30:56,"I mean, there is just riddled with them."
00:30:56,00:30:57,It's really good.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"Yeah, I mean, there are so many."
00:30:58,00:30:59,What's the best?
00:30:59,00:31:00,I like Nether song.
00:31:00,00:31:02,I think that's my favourite name.
00:31:02,00:31:05,"I like Brown Willey, which is the highest points of visit Dorset or Della."
00:31:05,00:31:07,"Bowman Moore, the highest point of Bowman."
00:31:07,00:31:10,There is a meteorological effect called the Brown Willey effect.
00:31:10,00:31:15,"Yeah, which is where banks of cloud hit hill, go high."
00:31:15,00:31:19,"And then it leads to at least a rain, at least a thin drizzle all across Bodman Moore."
00:31:19,00:31:20,Brown Willey effect.
00:31:20,00:31:23,Someone getting undressed in the morning.
00:31:23,00:31:25,"Oh, God, it's going to rain today."
00:31:25,00:31:29,"That's the most disturbing lever apart, I've ever heard."
00:31:29,00:31:32,I'm now over to Jeff with the web.
00:31:32,00:31:33,"Oh, my God."
00:31:33,00:31:34,"I'm going to rain, guys."
00:31:34,00:31:35,It's going to rain.
00:31:39,00:31:41,"Okay, that's all of our facts for this week."

00:31:44,00:31:47,We will be back next week with more facts and a special guest.
00:31:47,00:31:50,A horrible history is resident historian Greg Jenner.
00:31:50,00:31:54,"If you do want to follow us on Twitter, you can do that, because that's a thing."
00:31:54,00:31:56,And it's available on...
