1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 It's still a little bit hard to walk, isn't it?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,000
 It's still a little bit hard to walk, isn't it?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a QI podcast coming to you from our offices here in Covern, Gardurn.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Dan Shriver is still a way that we are working on the pronunciation.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 My name is Andrew Murray and I'm here with three of the other QI elves.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 We are Ann Miller, James Harkin and Anna Tajinsky and we have gathered around the microphone to bring you our four favourite facts

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 from the last seven days and there are a lot of other facts we found out off the back of those.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So, let's get going. The first fact of today is Anna.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 My fact is that from the year 800 to the year 1349 the Colosseum was used as an apartment block.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Really?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Yeah, but yeah, we only discovered this a couple of years ago, a bunch of archaeology was done at the Colosseum and they excavated it and they discovered things like sewage pipes and that is evidence that it used to be a block of flats.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And we know it was owned, it was bought by monks and then they would rent it out to normal people who would take a flat there.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 That's good.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 That's what happened and the space where they all did all the fighting and the back in the ancient world was a communal living space where they'd have their market space

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 or where they'd graze their animals or where they'd just hang out.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Have a barbecue.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Have a barbie of a Sunday afternoon, yeah?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 It was used for a lot of things, wasn't it? It wasn't just an apartment block once it had fallen into disrepair.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I read that it was used for lots of trades like cobblers and blacksmiths and also glue makers and also a fortress for 12th century wallards called the Frangie Pernie.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Oh, man, thanks.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Yeah, that was their main weapon of choice.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I think the old place they just smothered people with delicious, delicious, comestibles.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I think it was used as a dumping ground so between when all the vicious sports were banned there in the 5th century and when it was bought up by these monks about 500 years later,

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 it was used as just a garbage dump where everyone dumped their old detritus.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I mean, I guess you've got a big story century, you might as well put stuff in it.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Yeah, it's weird there. They obviously didn't have much respect for this amazing edifice.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I think that happens in general around the world, doesn't it?

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Something will go slightly into disrepair and then people will just steal bits of it to build their own houses and whatever you use, what you can, don't you?

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Yeah, there is actually in the St Andrews.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 We have so quite a lot of St Andrews is places to visit and blew down because it's quite a windy place.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So the castle blew down.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 The castle blew down.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 The castle blew down.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 They shouldn't have made that a straw, shouldn't they?

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 It was on the coast.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 The cathedral blew down and they built it back at blew down again.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 But they've got this room bowl sort of bits they found around the town and there's one bit this statue that would be on top of a tomb

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 and they found that used to be made someone's windowsill on one of the town streets.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Oh really?

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 They found it like hang on, this belongs to the cathedral and then take it back.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So they didn't call the Colosseum the Colosseum, did they?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 No.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 That's a medieval name for it.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 They called it the Flavian amphitheater and also the name Colosseum comes from word for big.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 But it's not because that's big, it's because it's next to another statue which happened to be big.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Really?

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 What?

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 There was a huge statue of nearby and that was so big that the area became known as the big statue place.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 That's great.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 The Pantheon burnt down twice.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 So the Pantheon, the inscription on it reads, "Marcus the Gripper, son of Lucius, consul for the third time, built this."

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 When actually he died about a hundred years before it was built because he built the initial one but it just kept burning down.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 We shouldn't have made it out of sticks.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 People in building materials.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 He's talking as available for architectural consultancy to any little pigs listening.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So in the Colosseum itself when you were having games there, the person who organised and paid for the games was called the editor.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Which I did not know.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 That's rather nice.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So he was selecting who played or was he...?

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Well, I think he definitely got to choose who lived and who died.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 So obviously it didn't.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Oh, it's fake.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 If it's someone who decides who lives and who dies, that means it's kind of fixed a bit like WWF wrestling.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 To think people complained about that a lot and there was a genuine wrestling place around the corner.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 These guys are really injured.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Well Greco-Roman wrestling is not from Greece or Rome.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 It's from France.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Great.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 It's invented in France and they gave it the name because they thought it was probably similar to what they did in classical times.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 That's very fun.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 So when was it invented?

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 A couple of hundred years ago.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Oh, okay.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 It was based on, like, there's a French wrestling.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Oh gosh, I wish I could remember what it's called.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I think it's called "Savat" or something.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And what happens is you kind of crouch down like a crab and then you kick people like that.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And it was done on ships.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And because the ships rock all the time, you had to hold onto like a bar so you didn't fall over.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And so you do all your wrestling with your feet.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Now, this is all coming from memory.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 This is how you all be completely wrong.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It's like your shin kicking, isn't it?

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 But that was they were in barrels, they couldn't fall over.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I don't understand how big the barrel must be for you to get two of you in it kicking each other.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Well, if it's like ones they make whiskey in like 40 years, they're pretty big, aren't they?

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Yeah, I suppose so.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 But then also, there's no fun for any contestants unless you ever see through barrel.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It's like having a football match where you can only see the waist up of all the players.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Well, maybe you're looking down into it.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Well, Diogenes lived in a barrel.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So they must be quite big.

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 You can't have people round much.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 They're a barbecues.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Your plays are mine.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I think mine again, if that's okay.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Diogenes.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And this is another thing I learned about this week about the Greeks.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 The ancient Greeks used to paint obscene pictures on the inside of their drinking vessels,

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 of their wine glasses, and then they would reveal themselves to you as you drunk.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So there's pictures of a man, and then his willy is in the bottom of the glass.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And as you drink it, you can't see it.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Sorry, it's a picture of his willy.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Wow, that's amazing.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Yeah, it's not, yeah.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 I used to have a pen like that.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I remember they made those pens where you'd tell them upside down,

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 and a picture is either rude or normal depending on that.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I'm just imagining someone coming round going,

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 "I'm going to read your tea leaves."

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Oh my god!

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 That is rude.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And also they used to paint eyes on the bottom of the glass,

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 so that when you drank it looked like you were wearing a mask.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 See, they're making a combo.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I bought my brother party cups, so they got novelty noses.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So when you drink, he got like a beaker or a pig's lower.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Honestly, 2000 years too late.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 That's amazing from the Greeks.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I read a thing about the Colosseum as well,

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 which is that in the 1500s,

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 it was inspired by the previous people who lived in the Colosseum.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Pope Sixthus the Fifth wanted to turn it into a wool factory,

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 so the factory would be on the ground floor,

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 and then living quarters on the top.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 But he died and they ran out of money and didn't get made.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I like Sixthus the Fifth as well.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Was there a Sixthus the Sixth?

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I can't even say that.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 It's too much of a tongue twister, that's why.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 He was actually the Sixth, he just had to say it was the Fifth.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 No one could pronounce Sixthus the Sixth.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Sixthus the Fourth, Sixthus the Fifth, Sixthus the Seventh.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Roman Concrete is quite interesting,

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 the material that they made the Colosseum out of,

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 in that we don't know how it's lasted so long,

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 and we've sort of lost the exact formula for Roman Concrete

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 and how they made it.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 So the concrete that we use now is stronger

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 than what the Colosseum is made out of.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 But it wouldn't last nearly as long, it roads much faster.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And they think it's because it uses a lot of volcanic ash,

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 and that's much harder to erode.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And then they also used animal fat and milk and blood

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 to kind of adhere it together, didn't they?

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I guess the Colosseum had first supplies.

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Scuba nuts, builders and play.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 That's amazing.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Yeah, quite cool.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And all this is cool, in ancient China,

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 they used to use sticky rice as a building material

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 to stick stuff together in their concrete equivalent.

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Did it work? Yeah, worked really well.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 It's still standing. Still standing.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 If you think about it though,

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 if you have like a Chinese takeaway,

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 and then the day after it's on a plate,

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 and the rice is still on the plate,

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 it's pretty hard to get off its sticks a lot, yeah.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 On the Colosseum, just a couple of things I thought you might like.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 So two American tourists chipped off a bit of the Colosseum in Rome,

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 and they later returned it,

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 but they returned it 25 years later in 2009.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 They felt really bad about it, every time they look at it,

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 in their collection of things they've stolen from Lama.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Do you know that people often steal bits of Uluru,

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 which is Ezra.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Oh, yeah.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 But they almost always send it back,

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 and they get these very often,

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 they get these bits of Uluru sent through the post

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 to the National Park.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 And the reason is, because people steal it,

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 and then they have some bad luck,

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 and they always blame it on the fact that they stole this from

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 as rough as so they always send it back.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 You know there's gladiator guys who hang around outside it,

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 asking tourists if they want to have their photo taken.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Wolf and Shadow and...

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Yeah.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 So I love this story.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Italian police arrested 20 of them recently

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 in an undercover operation,

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 because they were intimidating all the rival gladiators

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 and being physically aggressive with them.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Yes, that's brilliant.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 How did they arrest them with like a net?

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 That's the thing.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Some police officers had to dress as gladiators

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 to get evidence of them being intimidating.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And then they took down the...

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I just think it's the funniest story.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 So an elaborate sting operation?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Arresting them for being aggressive

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 when they are dressed as gladiators.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Arresting them for fighting each other as well.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Yeah, yeah.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I think they get in trouble because they sort of say

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I'll post for a picture, then like demand 30 euros or something.

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And then the story is that some of the rogue ones

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 would like take your camera and then wouldn't give it back

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 until you paid them a certain amount of money.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Because they need to pay for their freedom.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Otherwise they'll be gladiators for life.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And that's no life.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 They used to die the sand in the coliseum red.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Didn't they to make it blend in with all the blood?

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 No.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Have they died?

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I'm not sure with blood.

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 The walls were made out of blood.

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 An animal that's on whatever.

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I think there's not enough blood in this area.

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Okay, so what about some unusual places to live?

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Yeah.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 There was a guy in Morocco called azayadine old barja

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 and he and his family listed city toilets as their official address.

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 So they were living in a toilet block.

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Fed up with his situation, he went to his local newspaper to tell his story

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 but then the local authorities read the article

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 and then blocked up the toilet's entrance with cement and concrete

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 so he couldn't live there anymore.

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Wow.

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Isn't that the saddest story you've ever heard?

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Was he going from stall to stall?

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Did he have a bedroom stall and a living room stall

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 and a library stall?

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 A library stall and a bathroom.

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Does anyone have anything else?

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Oh, I just had that one, just unusual housing.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 That's a story that did the rounds a while ago

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 about a woman who's found living in a man's cupboard in Japan.

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Then he only found out when food started vanishing from his fridge

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 and then he set up cameras and she moved in to his cupboard.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 What?

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Japanese times are quite small generally.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 You would notice.

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 It was a cubby hole in the cupboard area

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 and she said she'd been there for a year but only on and off.

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Oh my god.

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 So if you have a cupboard you don't go into, just check them every now and again.

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Which then cement her cupboard up.

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Maybe I could get back in.

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Okay guys, and let's move on to fact number two

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 which this week comes from James.

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that you can be find for swearing in Australia

247
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 and in the last financial year people in Australia's Northern Territory

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 paid $48,372 in fines.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Fuck off.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 That's unpredictable.

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Why are people being fined for swearing?

252
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Yeah, I mean it's actually been against law

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 in lots of different countries at different times.

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Yeah.

255
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 It's illegal in this country to use threatening, insulting or abusive behaviour

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 especially against police

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 but that's not necessarily swearing.

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 You could still swearing not be abusive.

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 But you're tone.

260
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 He said banana in a really menacing way, like in trouble.

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Tell some of the F-off quite friendlyly.

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 When Australia introduced this law there were lots of sweary protests

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 and one of them was called the fuck walk.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I found a quotation from it which was from a green MP

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 in the Victoria State Parliament called Colleen Hartland.

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 She said, is farty poo bum a swear word?

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Is windy bottom a swear word?

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Yeah, it's a very valid point

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 because you can just say very very mild things

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 but it's all about the intent as you say the banana.

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Where were we?

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I read this fact on a website called Nothing to Do With Our Broath.

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It's a blog of weird news from around the world.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 In the article that I read they had an interview with local man Jack Bullen

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 who said, I find those words slip into my vocabulary even when they shouldn't.

276
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I think the heat contributes to people being more aggressive

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 but swearing isn't really a sign of aggression.

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It's more of a communication tool.

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Mr. Bullen has lost his job at the primary school.

280
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And then the article goes on.

281
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Some residents said they had no idea letting loose a foul malty raid

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 could cost them a fine.

283
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Others just didn't give a shit.

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 It's been, it's gone back for centuries being fine for swearing.

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Oh yeah. Don't expect to the 18th century?

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 I think no centuries at all.

287
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 The purest of all.

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And this is quite interesting.

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 The finds that you got very, according to your social class

290
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 so the profane oaths act of 1745.

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 You got to find five shillings if you were a gentleman

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 or above two shillings if you were below that.

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And only one shilling if you were a day worker or a common soldier

294
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 or a tailor or something like that.

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So it was worse if you were well bred to be.

296
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Yeah, that was the idea.

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Or it could be just that you could afford more.

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Or so you'd like her and that more.

299
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Is it in Sweden where you're driving fine depends on how much you earn?

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Yeah.

301
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 So it means tested finding.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 In Sydney you can get the fine went up a couple of years ago

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 for swearing from $150 to $500.

304
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Oh wow.

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 But the worst thing is as soon as you get fine

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 and they tell you that you're the swearing out.

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Double fine.

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I was reading this brilliant book,

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 except from a book online about history of swearing

310
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 and said that so in the original OED, just 1888,

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 they just got bloody as like the worst, most terrible word.

312
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 But being Victoria they didn't list the affinities.

313
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Bloody was the worst word they could put in the OED.

314
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 So it's just that this is the worst of them.

315
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 The ones that were the ones that were list.

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 But then it's better.

317
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 So there's another book which is in 1785.

318
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 The classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 included the word "huffle",

320
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 which was too filthy for explanation.

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And in a later book there's another book

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 that wouldn't describe what bagpiping was.

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 What is bagpiping?

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I think they were both for Felatius.

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 The Victorians were not impressed.

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 But halfling and bagpiping, "huffle".

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 They were originally called House Felatio.

328
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Actually, Felatio does sound like a magic word.

329
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 That's what I'm talking about.

330
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 That's Felatio.

331
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 I don't know what would happen.

332
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I can't do it.

333
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 So the bloody was really bad, wasn't it?

334
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And when Pigmalion came out

335
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 and Elizadolittle said the word "bloody",

336
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 there was like a big scandal about it.

337
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 So Elizadolittle, in Pigmalion, said,

338
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 "Walk, not bloody likely in this podcast."

339
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And the quote is,

340
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 "The first night's audience greeted the word with a few seconds

341
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 of stunned, disbelieving silence

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 and then hysterical laughter for at least a minute and a quarter."

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 That's what I think is so nice.

344
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 These stories of when swear words weren't as bad.

345
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I think we've kind of missed out on words of really, really uncommon,

346
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 unless you're a soldier or a sailor or something.

347
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Maybe there are words, and we just don't know them.

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Huffling.

349
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 We don't know for a minute.

350
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 The army has new top secret swear words.

351
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 So yes, swearing was worse in medieval times, wasn't it?

352
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Because they were always blasphemous.

353
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 But in blasphemy was obviously a terrible thing.

354
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And you could, I think you could be killed for it.

355
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Yeah, probably.

356
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 But the user thing that swearing would physically hurt,

357
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 like blasphemy, would physically hurt Jesus Christ.

358
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 So the words that you could possibly say was Jesus Christ's nails.

359
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And that was absolutely horrific.

360
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And that's because he's up in heaven and you physically hurt him every time you say that.

361
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Or if you say, "By Christ's blood," then, you know, I don't know, he leads.

362
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I think that's where bloody comes from, isn't it, from the blood of Christ, probably.

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I think so. I'm not sure what sounds come from the phrase God's wounds.

365
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Sorry, sorry. What's this word, what's that you're telling us?

366
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 You must have heard it before.

367
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Yeah, we've heard it, but you say it as though it's a standard parlance.

368
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 So ever there's links. Yeah, it's like in a comic in Scooby-Doo.

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Yeah. Well, yeah, that's probably a palliative version of sounds.

370
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 So these are what's called minced oats.

371
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 So, all right, good ducks.

372
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Have you heard the word good ducks?

373
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 God's hooks, no.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Okay, it's another old school swear word.

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And it was, yeah, exactly by God's hooks.

376
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Yeah, that could be where zikes comes from, then. God's hooks.

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Yeah. Yeah, I think it might be.

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And so it's a minced, both of them, minced oats itself.

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Yeah. And there were things like slid, which was from the late 16th century,

380
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 which was by God's eyelid.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Really, it's foot by God's foot.

382
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 It's just taking all these body parts, right?

383
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 About 0.7% of the words we use are swear words.

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Which doesn't sound like very much, but, apparently, that's the same as pronums.

385
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So we swear on our fridge as much as we're saying, like,

386
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 your hour or hour sales a lot.

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 It is quite a lot, isn't it?

388
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I don't even know if they're including sounds.

389
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Time for fact number three, which is my one this week.

390
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And it is that when the first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858,

391
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 the reception on it was so bad that it took 17 hours to send the first message across.

392
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Wow. Yeah.

393
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Similar to our Wi-Fi in this episode.

394
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 It's a message from Queen Victoria to President Buchanan Urgent.

395
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Probably not.

396
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But depends. It was a 98 word to be fair.

397
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 So it was longer than your average text.

398
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Are there any swear words in that?

399
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 There's fervently reciprocal and pleasure.

400
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 But they're not. So wait a minute, wait a minute.

401
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 The Queen sent a message to the president about reciprocal pleasure.

402
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 It was the first sex. I think we believe.

403
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 The friendship is founded on their common interests and reciprocal as steam.

404
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 The Queen has much pleasure in thus directly communicating with a lot of internationalist flannel.

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 The first time they could communicate directly over 17 hours.

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Before that it would have taken something like 12 days to get a message across.

407
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 So it was an incredible achievement.

408
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 But the story of how they installed the first cable is just unbelievable.

409
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They had one across the English Channel.

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 That was the first one.

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And this was after decades of people just testing it out in ponds and things like that.

412
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 So the first apps were just people with their garden ponds.

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 They just put a load of cable in the ponds and see it saw if they could get a message from one end to the other.

414
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And they could.

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I know that there was a whale scare in that laying of the first one.

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 They wrote that they saw a whale swimming over the cable.

417
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And they thought, "Oh my god, it's going to ruin it."

418
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And then it brushed up against it and swam on its way.

419
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 But it was quite rubbish, wasn't it?

420
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 The reception wasn't good for the one you're talking about the first one.

421
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Because it just wasn't successful.

422
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 So it was broken within a month, I think,

423
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 by this guy called Wildman White House, who applied excessive voltage to it trying to get the signal better,

424
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I guess, and trying to make it take less than 17 hours.

425
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 His full name is amazing.

426
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 It was Edward Orange Wildman White House.

427
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And actually, the Victoria one wasn't the very first message.

428
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 The very first ever transatlantic message read,

429
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 "Laws, White House received five-minute signal.

430
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Coil signals, two-week delay.

431
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Try drive slow and regular.

432
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 I have put intermediate pulley.

433
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Reply by coils."

434
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 There's always, like, the first telegraph was supposedly what God hath wrought.

435
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And actually, it wasn't. It was telegraph test.

436
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Yeah, exactly.

437
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Yeah, and the first words on the moon were supposed to be one small step.

438
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But actually, it was contact light.

439
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Yeah.

440
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Oh, but you know the Alexander Graham Bell thing.

441
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Oh, yeah.

442
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So, 40 years after that first seminal phone call,

443
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 there was the first ever transcontinental phone call,

444
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 which went from Boston to San Francisco.

445
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And they tested it several months before,

446
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 so it wasn't the first actual contact.

447
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But they did a ceremony where Alexander Graham Bell and Watson

448
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 spoke by telephone to each other over the same connection.

449
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And they did a reprise of the original conversation.

450
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So, he said, "Mr. Watson, come here, I want you."

451
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And then Watson replied, "It would take me a week to get to you this time."

452
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 It's not cool.

453
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 "Mr. Watson, come here, I want you."

454
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I think that was the first sexting.

455
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 That was the first booty call.

456
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Yeah.

457
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 So, the first time they used cables in a telephone conversation

458
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 between the US and Britain was in 1927.

459
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And the Guardian has quite a funny description of it.

460
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 So, it relays the conversation.

461
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 We don't know who took part in this conversation.

462
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 But the Guardian says, "Conversation is quite unordered

463
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 by the marvel in which they were taking part,

464
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 fell back as we all do on the weather,

465
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 which was quite bad enough on either side to make a strong bond of sympathy.

466
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Indeed, a more pleasantly futile dialogue

467
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 could hardly have taken place over a suburban party wall

468
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 in dullich or Trolton come hardy."

469
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And that, which so astonishingly bridged the ocean.

470
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 This is quite interesting, though, actually.

471
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Only one unusual item of small talk broke its commonplace flow,

472
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 and we may take it that in trans-oceanic gossiping,

473
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 what's the time with you has come to stay as an addition of conversation.

474
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Suddenly, the idea of a time difference,

475
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 which had never been considered before, became a thing.

476
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 It would be like, "What is a different time of day?

477
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Hadn't crossed my mind, and people were apparently astonished by this."

478
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 It's still now if you ring people up in another country.

479
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 It's like, "What time is it there?"

480
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Exactly, so that was quite a good prediction, wasn't it?

481
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I've been up for eight.

482
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I still find it amazing that most of the internet

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 is going around the world in undersea cables.

484
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Yeah, it's odd.

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 It's really odd.

486
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 There are nearly 300 communications cables under the sea around the world.

487
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And there are these vast things,

488
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 and lots of them are not even on.

489
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 There are 20 which are not yet in use,

490
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 which are called dark cables.

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Eventually, they will be in use if our bandwidth increases,

492
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 and they cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 So the first message that was sent over the ARPANET,

494
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 which was like the pre-carser to the internet.

495
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It was where the internet started.

496
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It was in 1969. Do you know what the message was?

497
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 What time is it with you?

498
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It was not that.

499
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Was it Ed Bowles?

500
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Was it Logan?

501
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 It wasn't even, it wasn't Logan.

502
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It was supposed to be because that was the first command

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 they were giving, but the system broke down after two letters.

504
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So it was just low.

505
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 So how do you know he's going to say log in?

506
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 He might be trying to say low.

507
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Yeah.

508
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 First message.

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Well, I don't think he should have admitted that it was wrong,

510
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 because low could have just been low.

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You know, low.

512
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 You are familiar with like really old schoolers

513
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 that no one uses any more.

514
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Oh, God's looks I am.

515
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Dinks.

516
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 You say low all the time, right?

517
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Low, we're out of teeth.

518
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 That's a real slumber.

519
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 What I'm like around the author.

520
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 What he means is the level of teeth is low.

521
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 He means the level of teeth is low.

522
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Yeah.

523
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I know we need to get more supplies.

524
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 The guy who sent the first email doesn't remember

525
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 what it says.

526
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Oh no.

527
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I bet he does, but he's embarrassed.

528
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I think he wrote something embarrassing about a colleague

529
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 and accidentally sent it to the colleague.

530
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I don't want anybody to know.

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I think Dave is an arse.

532
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 But at that time, there will be two email addresses here today.

533
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Dave's like, come on.

534
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 The second email is dear Dave.

535
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I think there may have been a bit of a mistake.

536
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I was talking, of course, about Dave in accounts.

537
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Yeah.

538
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I just think people should plan this.

539
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I was thinking about this because we talk about the first text

540
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 of the phone calls and the cables.

541
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And you should plan.

542
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 If you're sending the first email, make sure it's something funny

543
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 or weird.

544
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Or that people are going to be writing down your books

545
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and repeating on podcasts.

546
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 My first purpose was it to equivalent if you meet someone

547
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 because they become your best friend or your other half.

548
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And you don't know.

549
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 So you don't take something profound.

550
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 You just say like five or more.

551
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 I say something profound to every single woman I meet.

552
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 You have to.

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Just in case they become.

554
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 That's the story for the wedding.

555
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 You're like, well, actually, we've had something lovely.

556
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 I am married.

557
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 So.

558
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Yeah.

559
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 It worked eventually.

560
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 OK.

561
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Time for fact number four, which comes from Anne.

562
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Yes.

563
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Last year, I just celebrated World Vegan Day.

564
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Peter, the animal charity, asked fry up in Yorkshire

565
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 to change its name to vegan fry up.

566
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And did they do that?

567
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 No.

568
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 It was a fair offer.

569
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Peter did say he only had to do it for one day.

570
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And if they did so, they provide the whole town village

571
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 with a free vegan breakfast, vegan sausages and vegan bacon.

572
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Try it pleasantly.

573
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 It's called faken.

574
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Town didn't go for the offer.

575
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 One of the councillors said, first of all,

576
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 there's not really anyone in charge of the town's name.

577
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 So it'd be quite hard to get everyone to agree.

578
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 And that they're not named after an actual fry up after the goddess figure,

579
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 who's Anglo-Saxon pig.

580
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Yeah.

581
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Yeah.

582
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 After whom fry day is named?

583
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Yes.

584
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Not the breakfast.

585
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 It really is an indictment of veganism, isn't it?

586
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 When an entire village says they're not willing to change their name

587
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 for one day to all get a free vegan fry up.

588
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 People do not want vegan fry up.

589
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 No matter how much bacon you put in them.

590
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Yeah.

591
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Great fry up.

592
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 It's not a very exciting place.

593
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I tried to find an exciting place.

594
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 I felt a little fry up nearby, isn't it?

595
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 There is.

596
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 That's even smaller and I think less exciting.

597
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 It has no shops, not even a pub, according to Wikipedia.

598
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 It has a telephone box, a post box, a village hall and an outdoor centre.

599
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And it also has a local cricket pitch and a quits pitch.

600
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And I think if you're having to claim a brag about your quits pitch.

601
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 But I like the idea of the being a great fry up and a little fry up.

602
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Yeah.

603
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Because it's like an option for breakfast, isn't it?

604
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Yeah.

605
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 But you want to get one sausage for this one.

606
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Yeah.

607
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 All the health con just people live in a little fry up.

608
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Yeah.

609
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Do you read about?

610
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Do you read this horrible thing as a caffeine?

611
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Gregorne sells the kids breakfast.

612
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 KID said.

613
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Not for kids.

614
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 It weighs the same as a child.

615
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Nine pounds of cut over.

616
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Basically, yeah.

617
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Six eggs, 12 bacon pieces, 12 sausages.

618
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 It weighs the same as a child.

619
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 But then the worst thing is that people who are to the quits breakfast might be kids if they don't realise that.

620
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Yeah.

621
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And so they get a breakfast which is the same size as that.

622
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 I can possibly beat that though for terrible food ideas.

623
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 So this is again, I'm very proud to say this is my hometown did this.

624
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Made the news last year.

625
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Because the local hospital is selling a fry up pie for £1.50.

626
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And the hospital can't see that.

627
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Wow.

628
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Sounds delicious.

629
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 That sounds great.

630
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Well, one of the bakery said, well, we're already making a full Scottish breakfast in a wrap.

631
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 So we thought.

632
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 I'm not trying to reply.

633
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 I've always thought when having a full Scottish breakfast, there's not enough carbohydrate.

634
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 So keep me going until 11th is.

635
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 In Bolton, we would have, like, pasty barms.

636
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 It's quite common or a pie bar.

637
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Oh yeah.

638
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 In Wig and they'd have that.

639
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 What's that?

640
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Is that something you rub on yourself?

641
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Pie bar.

642
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Soot your cracked lips.

643
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Yeah, a pastry into every orbit of your body.

644
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 No, a barms and a barm cake has in a bread roll or whatever you would call that.

645
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 So it's like a pie sandwich.

646
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 It's meat and potatoes.

647
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 So you've got carbs there with your potatoes inside pastry, which is more carbs inside a bread, which is more carb.

648
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 In the new Hampshire, you can buy a scratch card.

649
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Well, when you scratch it, it gives off the smell of bacon.

650
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 It's called the eye heart bacon scratch ticket.

651
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Well, that is a very imaginative name.

652
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 What do we call it, guys?

653
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 They should have called it pork scratchings.

654
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Oh no!

655
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Come on, people.

656
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 You're so right.

657
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 It's really good.

658
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 There's bacon perfume, isn't there?

659
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 As well.

660
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 You can get bacon tender perfume.

661
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Well, I think it's good.

662
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 They won't go well with my pie bar and then I will.

663
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Peter tried to change loads of different places names.

664
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Haven't they?

665
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 A few years ago, it might have been even this year, they tried to get Nottingham City Council to change the name to Not Eating Ham.

666
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Oh my goodness.

667
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 How does this ever work?

668
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Well, I think it does work.

669
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Yeah, it does work because it gets them in the newspapers.

670
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 The mayor of Fishkill was asked if it's near New York City if they change it to Fish Save.

671
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Did they contact the mayor of Dead Cow burger meat?

672
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 There's a place called Feather Bed Rocks, which is near Siem and they wanted to call it Synthetic Feather Bed Rocks.

673
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And also, the pet shop boys, they asked them to change their name to the rescue shelter boys.

674
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Oh yeah, because they hate pets, don't they?

675
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 They're against pets.

676
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Did they ask the super furry animals to change their name to the super synthetic furry animals?

677
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 They should have done something.

678
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Yeah.

679
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 The other thing they tried to change Peter was, I think we mentioned it on the TV show, which is they tried to change fish into sea kittens in the hope that people wouldn't eat them as much.

680
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Well, that's not an insane idea.

681
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 I mean, obviously, it's an insane idea.

682
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But the name does severely alter your perception of something, doesn't it?

683
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Yeah, so for instance, there are other fish.

684
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 There's a fish called a slime head.

685
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And if you eat that, actually, it's called an orange ruffy.

686
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 So if you eat orange ruffy, the original name of that fish was a slime head fish, but it changed it so that people would eat it.

687
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 So what would it take to agree to change your town's name?

688
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Would you go for it?

689
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 So there was the town of Clark, Texas, renamed itself Dish, after the Echo Star Communications Dish Network.

690
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And they all got free satellite dishes on their houses.

691
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Oh, that's good.

692
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 It's a shame that Clark isn't in Kent.

693
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 I'd be happy to have to change Hack Me into Sky Spots, if they gave me free Sky Spots.

694
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Yeah, I think I'd sell my town's name immediately for a bag of sweets.

695
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 There was a place in Texas which the mayor and the members of the Chamber of Commerce,

696
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 they wanted voters to approve the name change they had in mind.

697
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 This was in 2005.

698
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 The place is called White Settlement.

699
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 The measure was voted on and was defeated by 9-1.

700
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 As one resident said, why don't they go ahead and change the name of the White House to the West House?

701
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 It's all a bunch of poppycock.

702
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 The thing is, the White Settlement is named from the 1840s when a community of White Settlers occupied an area surrounded by several Native American villages.

703
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Right, so it's not an Inners index.

704
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Sorry, sorry.

705
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 It's not like being called Mr White.

706
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 There is a village in Spain called Castillo Matajudios, which translates as "Fort Kill the Jews".

707
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 They voted last year to change their name and it went through.

708
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 It takes about a year for the process to go through.

709
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 So by around June or July this year they should change their name.

710
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 You've got to be not interested.

711
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 I mean, I know it's offensive, but it is interesting.

712
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 It's really interesting.

713
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 You've got to wonder why I took them so long.

714
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Yeah, it dates back from the expulsion of the Jews in 1492 by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.

715
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Wow.

716
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 So it's just a very long historical thing, but they've finally voted to do that.

717
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 You can get a map.

718
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I wanted to get some of the Christmas of all the funny place names in the UK.

719
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 I mean, there is just riddled with them.

720
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 It's really good.

721
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Yeah, I mean, there are so many.

722
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 What's the best?

723
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 I like Nether song.

724
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 I think that's my favourite name.

725
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 I like Brown Willey, which is the highest points of visit Dorset or Della.

726
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Bowman Moore, the highest point of Bowman.

727
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 There is a meteorological effect called the Brown Willey effect.

728
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Yeah, which is where banks of cloud hit hill, go high.

729
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And then it leads to at least a rain, at least a thin drizzle all across Bodman Moore.

730
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Brown Willey effect.

731
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Someone getting undressed in the morning.

732
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Oh, God, it's going to rain today.

733
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 That's the most disturbing lever apart, I've ever heard.

734
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 I'm now over to Jeff with the web.

735
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Oh, my God.

736
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I'm going to rain, guys.

737
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 It's going to rain.

738
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
