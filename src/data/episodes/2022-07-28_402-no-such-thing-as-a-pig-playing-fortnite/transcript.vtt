00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.860
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.900
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.380
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.700
 from Barstapa.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.700
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.060
 (audience applauding)

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.540
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.860
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.380
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.760
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.900
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.160
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.260
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.660
 - Okay, my fact this week is that when the bird poo

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.300
 in pot industry first reached the UK,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.380
 the smell was so bad in Southampton

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.000
 that the entire urban population fled to the hills.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.340
 (snoring)

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.180
 - Was it in one go?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 You know when you watch movies like Deep Impact

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.700
 or Armageddon where you just see people

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.380
 flocking away from cities?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.200
 Was there a traffic?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.780
 - They just got one guy with a cold gun

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.060
 in the other direction, go what the fuck are they doing?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.580
 So this is, it's guano.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.540
 So it's in the olden days, you would get this bird poo

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.860
 and it would get brought into the country

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.860
 and they would use it as fertilizer.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 - And there is an English historian called Frederick Pike

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.380
 who wrote the modern history of Peru.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.540
 So he was writing about the Peruvian guano industry

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.420
 and he said that the stench was so miserable

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.740
 that the entire population of Southampton left the town.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.020
 It might be true, it might not be true.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.540
 This is what the historian says, so it's quite a good source.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.380
 - It certainly feels like

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.580
 it's an exaggeration though, doesn't it?

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.420
 - It does.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.660
 - I'd eat all of my clothes right now

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.700
 if every human in Southampton evacuated

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.420
 and went up a hill.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.940
 Well surely we'd know about that.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.420
 - It's true, but have you ever been to Southampton?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 - I have, but I didn't know what you were saying about it.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.260
 I'm gonna say I don't agree.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.660
 - No, I don't agree with myself.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.740
 - Can I just say I'd eat all of my clothes right now.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.900
 It's an incredible escalation of I'd eat my hat.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.700
 - What I did find was in Massachusetts,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.820
 there is a place called Woods Hole

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.740
 and there was a company called the Pacific Guano Company

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.180
 and I've seen some very good evidence

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.260
 that whenever the weather changed,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.220
 the wind changed in a certain direction,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.100
 the entire town would have to be evacuated from the smell.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.980
 So it was, it is very smelly bird poo

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.220
 when you have it on such big amounts.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.100
 - Yeah, and the reason it's so smelly

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.900
 is that it's not just any bird poo, isn't it?

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.980
 It's bird poo of specific birds

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.820
 that have been eating specific fish.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.460
 And the reason that Guano was this incredible

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.380
 wonder substance in the 19th century

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.100
 is that it has lots of, what is it?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.300
 Nitrogen and phosphate and potassium,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.300
 all of the chemicals that just act as rocket fuel for plants.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.980
 And so it suddenly acted as this incredible fertilizer.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.980
 But the reason it smells so bad

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.980
 is it's so full of this very, very oily fish.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.180
 - So what, so there's, yeah,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.380
 so there's the fish guano, which is very important,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.420
 but bat guano as well is very important.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.580
 But what are the bats eating?

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.860
 They're not eating fish, right?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.180
 - They're all eating sex bats.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.740
 - Okay, and it produces the same,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.860
 'cause those are the most important.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.940
 Sea birds and bats for guano.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.780
 - I didn't know bats was used as fertilizer.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.340
 - It can be, I think mostly it would be used,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.100
 they would use it as like to make gunpowder and stuff,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.340
 I think they used it, but like the fish one,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.140
 when they first found these islands off the coast of Peru,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.700
 which had all this tons and tons of bird shit on,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.340
 that kind of changed the world a little bit

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.300
 because it was the first mass produced fertilizer

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.260
 that wasn't coming, let's say, out of humans.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.660
 - Yeah, well they had islands just off Peru

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.340
 where the guano had built up for all those years,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.460
 that they were like 200 feet.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.940
 - Yeah, I've been there actually.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.900
 - Have you? - I've been to those guano islands, yeah.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.380
 I tricked my wife into going there, 'cause...

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.060
 There was an excursion to swim with sea lions,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.260
 and I noticed it was on the guano islands,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.580
 and I was like, oh, you've always wanted to swim with sea lions,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.660
 haven't you? And she hadn't.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.660
 - Have I? (laughing)

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.860
 - But we went down there, and I kept asking the guy

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.780
 who's in charge about the guano, I'm like,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.180
 oh, you know, is there still guards here and stuff like that?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.780
 And he didn't know anything about it.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.620
 - Really?

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.460
 - He only knew about sea lions.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.820
 I think you weren't cheated there, I think that's fair.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.580
 - I think one of the reasons as well that it was so useful,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.260
 and I think this might be why back guano

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.460
 was the other famous one, I suppose,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.540
 is that it's all together.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.860
 So the reason you can use back guano,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.420
 for let's say gunpowder, and this,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.660
 is that seabirds all flock to one spot,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.660
 and then they shit everywhere.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.420
 Bats are obviously all in one cave,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.260
 they shit everywhere.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.100
 If it was pigeon guano, that would be hell, right?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.860
 'Cause you'd have to crawl around the streets of London,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.980
 scraping up individual pigeon poo after pigeon poo.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.060
 You wouldn't get anywhere.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.100
 - Yeah, and also those islands, it hardly ever rains.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.540
 So it's always quite overcast,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.100
 but it doesn't really rain very often,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.940
 and so it never gets washed away,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.820
 it just kind of layers and layers and layers.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.660
 - It was, Matt.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.820
 So there was a newspaper advert I read from the 1840s,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.660
 and it just read, guano, guano, guano,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.660
 and then in caps lock, guano.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.620
 It was so impressive, and it was this kind of wonder substance.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.700
 So there was a story that the San Francisco Journal

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.460
 printed in 1857, and it was about a shipment of guano,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.380
 making its way across the Atlantic,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.020
 and the ship's hatches were left open by mistake,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.540
 and the guano got wet.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.300
 And the account is that the timbers of the ship

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.780
 started growing and sprouting in all directions.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.820
 The rudder of the ship grew into a huge, great oak.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.340
 They had to start pruning the ship every couple of days,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.940
 and apples were growing on the pump handle.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.700
 Worst of all, the ship's cockroaches,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.100
 all the cockroaches on board had got into the guano,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.020
 and they got so big and powerful

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.900
 that they were able to pull up the anchor of the ship.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.300
 - Whoa! - I mean, that's not true.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.100
 - Oh, I guess so. - It's such a...

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.220
 Well, it's printed in the San Francisco Journal.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.020
 - Why did they print it as a fable? - It was a humorous myth

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.780
 - related to how potent guano was. - A sailor's tale, yeah.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.620
 You know, guano is so strong, if you chug a cockroach out,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.420
 it grows to the size of a person,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.980
 and then you'll go away going,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.940
 "Wow, do you know what the sailor just told me?"

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.260
 - Yeah, I really would. - I mean, it is super impressive stuff,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.860
 isn't it, and people really valued it massively back in the day,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.820
 so in 1850, President Fillmore,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.820
 it was part of his union address

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.620
 that he was promising fairer prices for guano,

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.340
 and that was like a big deal.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.140
 We don't appreciate it now as much,

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.860
 because it's a bit harder to get it

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.460
 because all the islands where the seabirds were pooing on,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.780
 they've kind of been depleted.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.860
 And also, we don't need it.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.180
 That's the main reason, really, that it doesn't exist anymore,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.140
 is that we managed to invent fertilizer

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.740
 around about the turn of the century,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.900
 when we turn the 20th century,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.260
 and so suddenly it wasn't necessary anymore,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.700
 and so it was the 19th century when this massive rush happened, right?

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.180
 But that was when Britain and the new migrant Americans discovered it,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.420
 but it had been used for many centuries before that in South America,

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.300
 so in the 17th century, in fact, when Europeans first got to America,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.340
 they said that the Peruvians used it so much

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.700
 that it looked like they had loads of snow-capped mountains in the regions

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.340
 because they had just had huge mountains of guano that they had stocked up.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.860
 That's a very disappointing ski trip, isn't it?

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.580
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.620
 But, yeah, the Incas were very into it,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.180
 and the Incas had a cool communist kind of a system with guano,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.020
 where every town, every Inca town, was assigned its own guano island,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.220
 and then every household in the town was assigned its own, like, bit of guano,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.940
 or a bit of share of that island,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.780
 and that was how much you had, and it was according to how much you needed,

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.780
 and that meant no one could get a big monopoly,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.620
 no one could come in and raid it all, and it was all working very well.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.220
 - All right, Jeremy Corbyn has checked in to the podcast. - (LAUGHTER)

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.500
 But lots of Britain was built on guano, effectively, or built on the money from guano,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.020
 so there was a guano millionaire,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.380
 maybe the first guano millionaire called William Gibbs,

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.020
 and he was the subject of a musical song which ran,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.620
 "William Gibbs made his dibs, selling the turds of foreign birds."

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.220
 And there's a local link with him, which is that there's a church in Exeter

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:15.180
 called St Michael and All Angels Church, and that has this big memorial to William Gibbs,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.700
 because he was such a big noise and funded so many churches and chapels with the mining.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.940
 Kiebel College, Oxford, was, that their chapel was, you know, it's a huge thing,

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.700
 it was completely funded by bird poo, basically.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.420
 - Right. - Funny that more of them don't use this in their PR, hasn't it?

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.940
 - Built on bird ships. - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.740
 Well, the conditions in which it was mined were not great, either,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.900
 and there were lots of indentured labour where workers were shipped over from China,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.860
 and it's pretty horrible stuff to work among,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.060
 because if you don't have a really, really good mask,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.780
 you'll be inhaling kind of dust from it.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.180
 - Oh, they're covered with it, yeah. - They don't really bother with masks as well, do they?

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.380
 - No, they don't. - Yes, there were no masks.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.420
 Coolest thing that I think guano has given us

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.380
 is that there's an island called Nauru,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.660
 which made so much money from guano, from the selling of it and so on,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:10.020
 and they decided to invest a lot of that money in a musical called "Leonardo, a Portrait of Love",

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.420
 - the story of Leonardo da Vinci. - The Caprio, oh, sorry.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.300
 "Leonardo da Vinci" and Mona Lisa and how they had a relationship.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.020
 I mean, it was completely factually inaccurate, and it was pretty much a flop.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.020
 I think it had like one or two shows that went well in Oxford.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.340
 - I'd say bring it back. - Yeah, I'd love to see it.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.460
 - What the musical? - Yeah, not guano, I can live without guano.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.700
 What about the Guano Islands near Peru?

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.020
 In 1865, when it was the real height of it,

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.100
 Spain decided they would send a scientific mission to South America to kind of look at this.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.620
 It didn't belong to them, okay, but they just wanted to see what was going on.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.340
 So they sent a scientific mission of about a dozen warships.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.580
 [laughter]

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:59.340
 And basically then they forced a situation where some of their soldiers were attacked

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.020
 and there was a full all-out war for bird shit.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.580
 - Wow. - Basically, Chile got involved,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.420
 Bolivia got involved, the whole of South America against Spain.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.860
 They all blockaded the Spanish and eventually the Spanish disappeared

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.660
 with the tails between their legs.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.060
 But really, that was the start of quite a lot of battles over these bird shit islands.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.540
 - Wow. - What must the birds have thought?

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.060
 That's so weird.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.780
 One year to go back to this deserted island, you've always shat on to find warring nations.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.220
 You're desperately holding their hands up to your arseholes going, "Please!"

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.940
 - Oh my God, Adam! - "Just a morsel!"

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.220
 - Oh my God. - Wildering.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.100
 It was in the US Civil War as well.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.100
 Guano featured in the American Civil War.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.540
 It didn't change the outcome, but the Confederacy had been blockaded

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.020
 and so they had to mine bat guano to make their gunpowder.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.820
 - So they went to the Batcave in order to try and... - Oh, right.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.900
 - Yeah. - That's Robin's job, isn't it?

00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.020
 When he's... On the weekdays, he's just scraping Batman's poo off the walls.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.460
 Oh my God, that's how Bruce Wayne became a multimillionaire.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.020
 - We never really understand it. - That's it.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:10.180
 And Commissioner Gordon's going, "One more morsel, Batman!"

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.540
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.500
 My fact this week is that scientists have made a TV for fish,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.980
 but if humans want to watch it, they have to wear sunscreen.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.580
 - Bizarre. - Is that because it's placed on the beach?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.620
 Yeah, good point. Yeah, just hovering above the sea.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.980
 No, this is a scientist at the University of Queensland,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.460
 and they wanted to know about the visual capabilities of fish.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.380
 They started with clownfish, often very good for experimenting on,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.780
 and they were looking at what they can see in the UV spectrum.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.620
 So fish can see in the UV spectrum where we can't.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.540
 And so they developed a screen display

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.580
 that just includes the violet and the ultraviolet spectrum.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.980
 And they had the fish kind of peck at targets,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.020
 so they have targets in certain UV wavelengths on it,

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.980
 and they'd reward fish if they pecked at certain ones

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.380
 to see if they could see and distinguish

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.100
 between the different UV wavelengths.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.100
 And they could, but the thing is, of course,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.660
 is giving off lots of UV radiation.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.580
 And what do we know about that? It's bad for us.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.460
 So you've got to wear factor 50 and sunglasses.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.700
 And also I don't think it's very good programs.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.980
 No, if it's just like UV light and you just peck it on it all the time.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.020
 Yeah, yeah. But yeah, they can all see...

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.660
 In fact, loads of animals can see things that we can't.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.180
 I really like the idea that they're all seeing completely different stuff.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.340
 Like a rainbow. I never thought about it.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.340
 That's not just red to violet, right?

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.660
 That goes to infrared in one direction,

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.740
 so if you can see an infrared spectrum,

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.220
 then you'd be able to see all the colors that we can't.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.020
 And then the other side, like if you're a bird looking at a rainbow,

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.700
 so all birds can see UV,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.460
 you'll see loads more colors, I guess,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.340
 beyond violet.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.740
 Wow.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.540
 Do they see... Do we know if they see rainbows?

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:51.940
 As in...

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.300
 Yeah, they must do, right?

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.780
 But their eyes are on different sides of their head,

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.220
 often if they're prey animals.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.700
 If you're looking at a rainbow and you close one of your eyes,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.660
 does it disappear?

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.540
 I've never tried.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.220
 No, I'm not going to follow this line of inquiry any further.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:05.860
 You put me off it.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.700
 Fish aren't the only animals that TV is being created for.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.060
 There is... Well, there's Dog TV, which is a channel.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.540
 Okay.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.140
 Which is actually TV shows made for dogs.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.460
 And I spend a lot of time on their website today.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.220
 What do they watch?

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.380
 It's a range of shows to inform, educate and entertain.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.020
 It's very wreathy, actually.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.500
 Is it like...

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.460
 I imagine it would be like EastEnders, but all the characters are dogs.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.900
 Do they watch animal-based TV?

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.620
 Well, Great British Bake Off, but all the contestants are dogs.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.260
 Yeah.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.700
 No, I get where you're going with it, James.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.940
 Well, like, it could be like the football match,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.620
 but all the footballers are dogs.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.180
 I think it's not exactly that.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.820
 Or it could be Crofts, but all the contestants are humans.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.020
 It's... I think sometimes there's a squirrel on the screen,

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.380
 but that kind of thing.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.220
 But it's mostly to entertain your dog when you're not around.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.620
 But the FAQ section of the website is unbelievable,

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.140
 because it costs about the same as Netflix,

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.180
 but it's just for your dog.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.900
 So one of the questions the FAQs is...

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.940
 Is it called Petflex?

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.300
 Brilliant. It should be.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:12.420
 It's called Dog TV, I think probably due to a legal issue with Netflix.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.500
 But one of the FAQs is,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.540
 it seems like my dog is not watching this, and I've paid for it.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.460
 And the answer is, well, you have to understand,

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.620
 dogs don't watch TV the same way that humans do.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.460
 It won't happen.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.300
 Dogs, you know, some of them like the visuals,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.180
 some just lie there and feel calmed by the relaxing music.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.780
 Either of those methods is great.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.820
 And when you're there with the dog,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.340
 he will always be more interested in you than the TV screen.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.780
 So that's basically...

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.260
 Right.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.820
 You're never going to see your dog relax to this channel.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.900
 If you're in the room, it can only relax when you're away.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.980
 One really interesting thing about dogs with TV is that,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.620
 until probably, I'm going to say about 10 years ago,

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.980
 they would not have enjoyed watching normal TV, any kind of TV.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.620
 And that's because the number of frames per second,

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.940
 and the speed in which they see those frames,

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.020
 it would kind of look like a slideshow to them.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.540
 If you know what I mean?

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.780
 Well, I mean, we did a slideshow in our first half today,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.060
 and I think everyone enjoyed it.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.340
 So you don't necessarily not enjoy something because it's a slideshow.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.300
 Yep, fair enough.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.300
 But they wouldn't get all of the nuances

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.780
 that we would get from watching Breaking Bad, for instance.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.660
 Sure.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.940
 But they need about 70 images per second

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.220
 in order for it to look as if it's a continuous movement.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.860
 And these days, your TV does have that.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.060
 But until around 10, 20 years ago, it didn't look like that.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.660
 So recently, they've been looking at this box in the middle of the house

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.220
 that kind of just flashes these pictures,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.260
 and then suddenly, it was like a proper TV channel.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.100
 Wow, and you remember the day, don't you,

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.940
 where all dogs changed overnight?

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.180
 They all seemed so much happier.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.580
 But it also means that they wouldn't want to go to the cinema

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.140
 because all cinemas have still got the same old frame rate

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.180
 because people prefer it.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.860
 Oh, OK. That's interesting.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.900
 They do. I think they should make this dog TV for humans.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.420
 It shows dogs surfing.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.060
 It is, you're right.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.300
 It is pretty much all dogs because they've done experiments

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.900
 and it turns out all dogs want to watch,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.740
 self-involved as they are, is other dogs.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.900
 Sounds like Baywatch, but all the characters are dogs.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.700
 That's what it is.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.380
 I'd watch a show of dogs surfing for 10 minutes, I reckon.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.420
 Yeah.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.380
 I think that's a good point.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.220
 Oh, God, I read the craziest thing

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.620
 about the TV show Skippy today.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.340
 We're talking about animals on TV.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.100
 It's quite disgusting, so I'm very sorry

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.500
 if I'm going to ruin any Skippy lovers here.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.780
 But Skippy on screen always used to have the ability

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.380
 to open up doors and stuff like that.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.980
 So this is like a kangaroo, right?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.100
 Skippy the Bush Kangaroo.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.300
 Oh, my God, yeah. What am I doing?

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.220
 I'm talking about a show that hasn't been on TV for 50 years.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.420
 Let's move on to our next.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.260
 No, no, no, no. That was just for the young Skippy.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.100
 No, it's a good point. Skippy the Bush Kangaroo.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.220
 It's like glassy, but he's a kangaroo.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.020
 But he's a kangaroo.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.620
 Yeah. Yeah. And he was, what's that, Skippy?

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.260
 Yeah. Kind of thing.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.140
 And so Skippy would be on screen as the kangaroo,

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.980
 but he was a really grumpy kangaroo,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.740
 and he would never properly enjoy it.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.660
 And so when he had to do things like open the door,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.620
 he couldn't really do that.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.260
 So what they did was they had kangaroo hands

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.180
 that were from, I think, a dead kangaroo with sticks on them.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:58.660
 Oh, my God.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.980
 And so when you see Skippy opening doors,

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.740
 they would lean in with the stick

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.460
 and just have a kangaroo fucking horrible visit.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.740
 Oh, my God. That is...

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.180
 I don't know why I told you guys.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.060
 I sort of pulled this.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.140
 I thought you were going to say he opened it with his pouch

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:11.940
 or something cute.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.020
 Like, blue-tip birds, they get TV as well

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.620
 in one experiment that they did.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.540
 And they worked out that blue-tits make better dinner choices

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.420
 at a buffet after watching TV footage

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.060
 of other birds making bad decisions.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.260
 What are you talking about?

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.900
 Now, what is a bad dinner decision for a blue-tip?

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.020
 A bad dinner decision might be something that is dead,

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.260
 that has just a foul taste to it,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.940
 that you might not have eaten as a blue-tip.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.340
 But if presented to you in a package, you might go for it.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.180
 And so they would see these blue-tits eating this food

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.180
 and then going, "Oh, oh, oh," and spinning it out.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.820
 And then later, when they then presented them

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.060
 with that food and other options,

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.180
 in most cases, they would avoid the one that they saw on TV.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:54.180
 That's amazing.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.460
 They got the bad reaction.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.380
 Yeah. So TV can teach.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.340
 It's very Rethian.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.700
 Very clever.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.460
 And pigs can play video games.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.260
 Can they?

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.020
 Yeah, properly now.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.740
 They used to play them, but like with touchscreen.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.340
 Well, they used to play Pong,

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.460
 and now they're playing Fortnite,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.380
 is what you are implying.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.940
 Yeah.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.620
 Okay, I think it is actually still Pong.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.460
 But they're using a joystick.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.100
 This is leaps and bounds for Pig World.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.140
 This is this year.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.180
 Scientists have put pigs in front of a video game

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.060
 and they've given them a joystick to operate with their snout,

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.940
 which is harder than with a hand.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.260
 And they realize that they connect what they're doing

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.580
 on the joystick to what's happening on the screen,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.260
 and then they connect what's happening on the screen

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.700
 to rewards that they get.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.620
 And so, you know, they can chase the right thing

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.700
 and catch it knowing that they'll get a reward,

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.700
 just using this joystick thing.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.900
 That's clever.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.220
 That's very cool.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:43.860
 That's very cool.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.420
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.580
 I think the thing with pigs is like,

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.180
 they're quite intelligent

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.420
 and you need to give them stuff to play with, don't you?

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.380
 I think even by law,

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.820
 you need to give them stuff to play with.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:52.980
 Yeah.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.580
 So it doesn't have to be a PS5.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.620
 It can just be a ball.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:01.220
 But UV light, this fact is about these fish

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.180
 that can see UV light, there was a thing.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.300
 So there's a condition

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.620
 where some people can see ultraviolet light,

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.860
 which is very strange.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.940
 It's a condition called aphakia.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.060
 And it's where you don't have a lens in your eye.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.300
 So the lens has been removed for whatever reason that is.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:22.500
 And it means that you can sometimes see ultraviolet light.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.820
 But this actually, there's a rumour,

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.940
 and it's not completely confirmed

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.620
 that this was used in the Second World War,

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.380
 which is bizarre.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.740
 It's that military intelligence recruited people

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.180
 who had this condition, aphakia,

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.220
 to watch the coastline for German U-boats

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.020
 signalling to spies on the shore with UV lamps.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.780
 No, I don't think it's true.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.420
 But I love the idea of it, but I don't, yeah.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.300
 Here's a true thing.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.300
 You can buy ultraviolet trousers.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.140
 These are really cool.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:49.860
 I want to get these.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.460
 So ultraviolet will glow in a black light, right?

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.540
 So if you go to a club and you have a gin and tonic,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.060
 it'll glow slightly because it's under the UV light.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:19:59.700
 OK.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.180
 These trousers will look like normal trousers

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.380
 when you're walking down the street.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.660
 No one will notice.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.180
 And as soon as you walk into a club, party in your pants.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:08.900
 Wow.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.300
 They're glowing in all sorts of different colours.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:11.780
 Wow.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.660
 That's amazing.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.020
 I hope you don't say that sentence

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.220
 when you walk into a club.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.620
 Party in my pants, eh?

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.940
 We're going to have to move on, guys, to our next fact.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.420
 Oh.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.620
 Can I just one piece of technology created for animals

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.180
 that I liked is chickens.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.420
 We also like to look out for, well, some farmers

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.420
 like to look out for their chickens welfare.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.820
 And chickens apparently like physical contact

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.940
 with their farmers when they know them.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.340
 So they'll hold them and they'll stroke them.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.540
 When you've got lots, then you can't do that every single day.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.780
 And so they've developed a chicken jacket.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.780
 And chickens wear it and it allows humans to give

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.220
 the chicken a virtual hug, even though they're not present.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.980
 So a farmer will stroke a chicken model in a sitting room.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.820
 And then the chickens wearing the jacket

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.980
 will feel the farmer stroking him.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.220
 Can you do it for 1,000 chickens at the same time?

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:01.860
 I believe so.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.700
 So they're all wearing a jacket and they all go, ah.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.420
 I guess that would work, right?

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:06.980
 Yeah.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.180
 As we then they look at each other and they're like,

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.380
 "What, he's doing it to you as well?"

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.980
 That is incredible.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.380
 We do need to move on to our next fact.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.300
 It is time for fact number three.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.500
 And that is my fact.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.300
 My fact this week is just like how we have

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.060
 ice cream truck music in the UK.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.660
 In Taiwan, they have garbage truck music.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.500
 How cool is that?

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.740
 So this, I mean, this was a genius idea.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.460
 Are they different?

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.660
 They must be different tunes.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.780
 It's still green sleeves.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.740
 That's the amazing thing.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.700
 No, but it's Beethoven.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.420
 It's Phuellis, which I think is...

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.300
 Is that that one?

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.340
 Game of Thrones, isn't it?

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:44.660
 No.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.020
 Okay, after three.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.060
 One, two, three.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:54.980
 Thank you.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.340
 Yeah, so this was a genius concept from Taiwan.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.180
 Taiwan was an incredibly garbage-ridden place.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.940
 It was just steaming with it.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.700
 It was called Garbage Island.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.980
 Everyone knew it was that.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.420
 And they needed to do something.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.100
 And they worked out that in...

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.540
 And this was in 1997.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.020
 They started a thing called a Trash of the Ground Movement.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.820
 And basically, like an ice cream truck coming out

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.540
 and everyone running out to get an ice cream, kids running out,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.060
 in Taiwan, they abandoned the idea of you stocking up your garbage

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.460
 and then putting it out on one single day.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.020
 These trucks would go around four or five times a night

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.380
 and they would have their song playing

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.820
 and you would run outside

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.540
 and you would throw your garbage directly into the truck.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.620
 And it became a social event.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.380
 Most people who've reported about it said,

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.700
 "This is the time that I got to properly meet my neighbors

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.740
 as we were out there,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.980
 excitedly holding our trash can bags

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.340
 and chucking them in."

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.100
 And as a result, the pollution problem in Taiwan

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.020
 has gone extraordinarily down.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.220
 I mean, it's a model for how countries really should be operating

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.380
 for recycling and garbage waste.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.420
 Oh, I'd love to see them attempt that in Britain or America.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.380
 No one would do it.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.980
 They'd be right immediately.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.100
 There's no way I would do it.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.740
 Another bottle of wine, another bottle of wine, another bottle of wine.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.060
 You've got to adapt your laws to the people in your country.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.900
 It does seem to work extremely well there.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.980
 Yeah, you said it was 1980...

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.380
 -1997, roughly, yeah. -1997.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.300
 Before that, even in 1987,

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.940
 there was a group of ten Taiwanese women

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.460
 and they started something called the Homemakers United Foundation.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.740
 And they were kind of the first group of people

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.300
 who really wanted to make a difference in Taiwan

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.940
 and they were responsible for the yellow trash trucks,

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.820
 which kind of started going around Taiwan around that time.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.540
 Yeah.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.740
 And now, if you go to a tube station or something

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.220
 or a metro station in Taiwan,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.500
 you'll see these old ladies just kind of picking up trash and putting it in the bin.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.220
 It's really cool.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.940
 God, let's hope they never get ice cream trucks.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.940
 Otherwise, they'll realize what fun it's really like.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.900
 But they do crazy things as well.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.260
 Like, there's public shaming.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.620
 So if someone hasn't done it,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.220
 probably or tries to cheat the system,

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.380
 they film them, the CCTV footage,

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.300
 and that gets circulated in their area,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.140
 but they blur their faces because of...

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.180
 But everyone will know.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.500
 -Exactly. -I saw you in that shirt.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.300
 That stands shirt.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.180
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.180
 Well, because they have quite convoluted recycling policies, don't they?

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.780
 Which, again, they demand obedience.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.940
 So the recycling truck, I think,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.180
 follows basically behind the garbage truck.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.620
 And you're obviously incentivized,

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.740
 I think, like we often are here,

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.660
 to recycle rather than throw rubbish away.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.940
 So it costs less.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.020
 You know, it's free for the bin bags and stuff like that.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.780
 But there are 13 different types of recycling bin.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.700
 And you have to sort your recyclables

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.100
 into all those 13 different types.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.820
 And if you fail to sort them, you get fine $200.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.380
 I can only think of red wine, white wine and rosé.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.620
 You got champagne.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.420
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.860
 But they sing a different song.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.260
 They have a song called "Any Empty Wine Bottles for Sale"

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.700
 blasting out from them,

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.340
 which sounds fun and is an incredibly sad song.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.060
 From a film called "Puppa, Can You Hear Me Sing?"

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.020
 But I recommend looking it up. It's quite nice.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.700
 But Fur Release was apparently chosen

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.980
 because the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.180
 his daughter at the time, was playing constantly on her piano.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.380
 So he just picked it.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.100
 You'd think he would want to break from the song

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.020
 if his daughter was learning it on the piano.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.540
 Oh, maybe she was so bad.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.940
 It was like, this is what it's supposed to sound like.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.980
 Even the bin truck can play this better than you.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.700
 But you know, it happens so much, this music around town.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.780
 And it actually pisses off a lot of people as well.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.100
 Because there's now an app that you can get

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.340
 where you can see where the trucks are going to be.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.900
 And so some people try to work out where they can move,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.780
 where it happens less.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.300
 Because between 6 and 8 p.m., sometimes four or five times,

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.780
 you've got Beethoven just playing in the streets.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.620
 And you're like, oh, my God, it's just so annoying.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.540
 And there was this one guy who wrote a blog

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.220
 who said he was out in the countryside

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.860
 and suddenly he's hearing the song play.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.260
 And he's like, oh, my God, I can't get away from this song.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.100
 And then he realized there were no trucks there.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.860
 And he thought, what is going on?

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.980
 And he investigated it.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.820
 And it turned out that the local birds started mimicking.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.020
 No. Yeah.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.260
 And so people started throwing garbage at them.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.660
 So he went out to investigate.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.860
 And he's got this whole blog where

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.420
 he's trying to prove that there's a species of bird out there

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.140
 that is currently mimicking.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.020
 That's amazing.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.220
 Yeah, Beethoven.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.140
 Imagine when Beethoven wrote that song.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.460
 Could he ever have thought that it would translate

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.900
 then into a garbage truck song

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.620
 that then got picked up by a species of bird

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.300
 that would just fly around singing itself?

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.220
 I think you'd have to explain a lot of concepts to them.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:31.060
 Just on bins, the dumpster was invented by a man called

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:31.620
 Dempster.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.140
 And he named it after himself.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.180
 But he got it wrong?

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.500
 No, he just named it slightly differently.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.100
 But he was an incredible guy.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.300
 He was called George Dempster.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.940
 He was the mayor of a place in the USA called Knoxville.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.060
 And he was an interesting man.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.540
 He used to work on the Panama Canal when he was a young man.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.100
 And later in life, he created the Dempster dumpster.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.020
 And it was the first ever waste container

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.300
 that could be emptied onto a truck.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.820
 So this was a huge leap forward in taking rubbish away.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.100
 Yeah?

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.220
 And dump obviously meant still to dump something,

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:03.620
 didn't it?

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.620
 So that it was a fun pun for him.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.820
 He didn't change it for no reason.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.780
 He didn't invent the word dump.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.180
 No, no, no.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.340
 But he did create the dumpster.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.180
 I read about this guy, Dempster.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.380
 And he was the mayor of Knoxville.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.620
 And he got into a feud with the editor of the Knoxville Journal.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.260
 The editor of the Journal criticized him.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.220
 And then Dempster decided that he would get the town police

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.740
 to follow the editor around towing his car at every opportunity.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.660
 And then in retaliation, the guy from the newspaper

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.220
 cropped him out of every single newspaper picture.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.020
 That's absolutely amazing.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.660
 And then Dempster organized a police raid

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.180
 that caught the journalist with a large supply of illegal whiskey.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.020
 Isn't that amazing?

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.980
 This feels like abuse of power in a lot of ways.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:49.700
 By both of them.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:57.140
 But then the Knoxville News last year claimed 2020 as its own for Knoxville.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.220
 They said that 2020 was a complete dumpster fire.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.260
 So since we invented the dumpster, we know on this year.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.380
 That's very funny.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.900
 You can have it, guys.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.740
 Do you guys know what the French for bin is?

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.380
 French for bin.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.060
 Is it Poobel or something?

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:11.460
 Poobel.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.980
 Do you know why it's called Poobel?

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.260
 Because it's got poo in it?

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.220
 No, it can't be.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:15.700
 No, not that.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.860
 It's named after someone called Mr. Poobel.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.340
 No.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.860
 So many bins are just named after people who invented the bins.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.340
 Yeah.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.020
 It's weird, so many people want to put their name to it.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.660
 You just thought of all the things you want your name stamped on.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.380
 I actually don't know if it was him who did the dubbing on this occasion

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.300
 because he was the police chief of Paris.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.780
 Eugène, René, Poobel.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.500
 And he ordered that everyone had to have a rubbish receptacle

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.340
 outside their doors in the 1880s.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.620
 And they got called Poobels.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.780
 And that's where the French for bin comes from.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.980
 Wow, that's so cool.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:49.300
 Yeah, just on words then, Susie Dent wrote this amazing book

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:54.260
 where she showed the slang language that exists within every different culture.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.060
 So butchers will have slang terms that they use

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:57.940
 that they'll understand.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.100
 Police officers and garbage bin workers also have that same thing.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.620
 They have words that they know.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:08.580
 So I was reading about in America, Coney Island Whitefish in New York.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.020
 What would that be, do you think?

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.460
 Coney Island Whitefish.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.820
 OK, so Coney Island, there was a big sort of fun fair there.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.260
 So lots of--

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.100
 You won't get it from that, really.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.460
 It's used condoms.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.820
 This is what they would call the Coney Island Whitefish.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.180
 Disco rice.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.180
 OK, so disco's a fun place as well.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.700
 People wear really cool trousers.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.340
 With those parties in your pants.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.100
 Disco rice.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:32.580
 Maggots.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.980
 Oh, that's fantastic.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.500
 What a great hit, Dancing Rice.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll buy that.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.100
 If you got air mail, if you were--

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.940
 I mean, this one's quite literal.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.300
 Someone throws rubbish at your head.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.780
 From New York, they would throw it from the windows

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.580
 into the garbage truck in the open tops and so on.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.460
 That's cool.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.580
 Yeah, great.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.580
 I love those kind of slang cultures.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.340
 Do you know, we have a rubbish bin called Dame Foodie Dench.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.540
 A food bin in this country in Bracknell Forest Council.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.260
 Called it?

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.860
 It's like officially called it.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.780
 Yeah, a rubbish truck, sorry, I should say.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:10.180
 So, and, but not only this, this is in Berkshire

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.140
 and there are a bunch of trucks, the fleet of trucks they have,

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.540
 they're called Truck Norris, Binderella.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.340
 And then for some reason, just Hank Marvin.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.100
 So I spent a long time looking at him thinking,

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.620
 am I missing something?

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.420
 What is that then?

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.500
 'Cause like that's slang for being starving.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.700
 So maybe 'cause it eats the garbage.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.980
 Oh, that's good.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.980
 That's a good, that's a very compelling theory.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.500
 All right, I'll accept that.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.700
 But Dame Foodie Dench received a video message

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.900
 from Dame Judy Dench, slanking it for the honor.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.540
 She said, she'd never been called Foodie Dench before,

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.380
 but it's sort of like you're not being called Foodie Dench now.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.180
 You've missed the point.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.980
 But she'd never been called Foodie Dench before

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.540
 and she was very proud of the accolade.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.620
 I've got some from Thurwick Council.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.180
 They got their school children to name their lorries.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.580
 One of them's named after a cult movie

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.380
 from the 80s, I think, 70s or 80s.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.180
 Okay.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.300
 Give us a bit more clue.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.740
 With Brian Blessed in it.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.100
 Oh, Trash Gordon.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:02.820
 Trash Gordon.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.420
 Very good, very good.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.020
 One of them's named after a footballer

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.300
 who became a movie star.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.140
 Eric...

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.740
 Kurt, Kurt, Kurt, Kurt.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.700
 Shunt.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.580
 Eric Trashner.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.300
 No, no, no.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.300
 What about the guy who was in like Lockstock?

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.900
 Oh, Vinnie, Vinnie, um...

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.620
 Vinnie Jones.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.500
 Vinnie Jones.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.860
 Vinnie Jones.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.820
 And one of them is named after a male pop star,

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.140
 probably the biggest pop star of the last 10 years.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.060
 Dustin Bieber.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:27.700
 Correct!

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.500
 Really?

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.820
 Oh, that's amazing.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.540
 Oh, that's good.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.500
 Probably on House of Gangs.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.140
 Very good.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.300
 It is time for our final fact, and that is Andy.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.140
 My fact is that in 1956,

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.820
 the BBC broadcast a magic show

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.140
 which involved a woman being sawn in half.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.900
 Unfortunately, the show ran out of time

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.060
 and it ended before she was put back together.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.460
 And the BBC was then inundated with complaints

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.380
 from people who thought they had just witnessed a murder.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.140
 What a way to commit a murder.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.340
 It was a... Exactly.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.780
 On prime time television.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.300
 It was... This was so weird.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.260
 It was on panorama,

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.860
 which feels like it must have been a very different show

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.500
 back in the day.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.860
 This was a magician called P.C. Sorsa,

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.380
 who was an Indian magician.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.980
 He was born in Bengal.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.140
 And he was over.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.460
 It was one of his first big international gigs.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.540
 He saw his assistant in half.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.980
 She was called Dipty Day.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.020
 And then...

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.180
 But the show was running really short of time.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.940
 And it was all live,

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.180
 so they just ran out of time.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.180
 And he was sort of standing over her, saying,

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.780
 "Oh, dear, what's going on here?"

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.740
 And then the show was just completely out of time.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.380
 So Richard Dimbleby, who was hosting,

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.500
 stepped forward and said,

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.780
 "Well, that's all we've got time for,

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.060
 "so now it's time for the news."

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.220
 The phone lines went crazy at the BBC.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.300
 The BBC had set up a special phone operator

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.500
 to divert calls to with just this poor operator,

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.100
 having to say, "No, she is fine.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.340
 "No, she is fine."

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.900
 But, of course, the theory is that

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.820
 a PC source I knew exactly what he was doing,

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.860
 and he would never have mistimed his trick so badly.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.300
 And it was a publicity thing for him.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.420
 But what's amazing is...

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.420
 So, 1956, right?

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.860
 So all the newspapers the next day

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.620
 were, you know, girl cut in half, shock.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.460
 It was all... It was all properly...

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.860
 You know, it was a confusion whether or not this happened.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.900
 He was doing a run at the Duke of York Theatre.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.260
 And as a result of this stunt, he sold it out completely.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.580
 As if people just needed the answer.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.700
 Like, was she gonna be there or...?

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.460
 It was definitely a publicity stunt.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.540
 Like you say, the newspapers...

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.300
 If you look at the British newspaper archives,

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.700
 you can see always, like, woman cut in half and whatever.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.860
 But if you go to the stage newspaper,

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.020
 which was the newspaper for magicians,

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.380
 their headline was, "Sorsa is publicity magician."

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.380
 And it was all about how he was a publicist

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.140
 and how he'd done this before.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.580
 He was great at that, wasn't he?

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.100
 Self-promotion.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.940
 Even from the start of his career,

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.940
 where he started out in Bengal,

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.340
 he called himself the world's greatest magician immediately,

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.260
 before even really starting his career,

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.940
 and shortened it, bizarrely, to TW's GM,

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.060
 the world's greatest magician,

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.260
 which feels like really complicated, weird, non-acronym.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.460
 Well, it's weird to do an acronym

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.500
 where there had to be an apostrophe "S" in it, like that.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.620
 And he did call himself that.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.420
 He was, "I'm TW's GM."

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.660
 Of course, he then came over to Europe and everyone's like,

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.980
 "Well, you're not the greatest magician."

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.980
 But his idea was, "Well, India is the home of magic,

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.980
 "and I'm the best magician in India,

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.140
 "so therefore it's fine that I call myself

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.300
 "the world's greatest magician."

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.060
 But basically, all the other magicians

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.820
 really didn't like him very much,

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.460
 and they started writing pieces and newspapers

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.500
 about how bad he was.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.260
 And there was one where they called him

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.260
 a Pakistani illusionist.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.940
 This was a time when India and Pakistan

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.580
 had been at quite a lot of war in the previous few years,

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.060
 and he felt like everyone was against him.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.820
 Someone who didn't like him was Shriver, Helmut Shriver.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.220
 - Helmut Shriver. - Don't know if he's a relation, but...

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.220
 - Uncle Helmut. - Uncle Helmut.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.020
 He was Hitler's favourite magician, wasn't he?

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.980
 He certainly was.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.580
 He was the one who, I think,

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:57.380
 turned people onto this magician, a PC sorcerer,

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.900
 because people didn't like him,

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.020
 but then Hitler's favourite magician came along in 1955.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.180
 It feels a bit late to be training

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.740
 on the Hitler's favourite magician label there at that point.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.500
 I think maybe he was trying to abandon the label

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.460
 at that point, but at least things stick, don't they?

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.940
 So, yeah, people knew he was Hitler's favourite magician.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.460
 Most are mostly taught in Argentina,

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.900
 didn't he, at that stage, yeah?

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.700
 It was very successful.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.420
 It was very good at making former senior Nazis disappear.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.180
 (LAUGHTER)

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.740
 He performed in front of Hitler.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.860
 He once conjured 150 Reichs marks into Hitler's jacket.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.620
 He made Eva Braun's diamonds studded platinum watch disappear

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.820
 and then come back.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.780
 But he was, after the war, he was a first German entertainer

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.460
 to get permission to perform abroad.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.660
 (GASPS)

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.300
 And they said, "Well, you were part of the Nazi party, weren't you?"

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.500
 And he was like, "No, I don't know what you're talking about."

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.820
 And some people said he was the Houdini

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.140
 of coming to terms with the past.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.500
 Yeah, right.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.340
 And there were rumours that he'd taken

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.300
 a lot of the kind of Nazi gold,

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.820
 and so when he died, his widow kind of went back,

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.700
 sort of desperately trying to find where all the money was,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.460
 and all she found was seven keys to seven different safes.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.940
 But didn't find the safes.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.540
 Oh, right. Oh, she found the keys?

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.300
 Yeah, she found them all. How did she know they were safes?

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.380
 So they have little labels on them saying "safe number one."

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.340
 Yeah. But to be fair, I'd have just bought seven keys

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.260
 for a laugh and labelled them "massive safe full of gold number one."

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.220
 (LAUGHTER)

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.220
 I thought, "I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that."

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.620
 What is the Houdini of coming to terms with the past?

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.820
 I'm sorry, I'm really struggling with this.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.620
 Is it someone who manages to escape from the past?

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.860
 Exactly. So he kind of, he was part of the Nazi regime,

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.100
 but he managed to convince people that he wasn't,

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.260
 so he escaped from his dark past.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.940
 Go on in. Look at this CV of mine.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.540
 I'm going to make it completely disappear.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.300
 Okay. Like that.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.580
 It sort of works, quite a lot.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.620
 Do you know that Jonathan Creek was based on a real person?

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.140
 Really? Was it Alan Davis?

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.740
 No. Sorry. No.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.460
 No, Jonathan Creek was played by a real person.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.660
 Alan Davis, you're absolutely right.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.780
 Oh, that's how TV works, yeah.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.740
 I'm afraid so.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.420
 You should get on this TV for dogs thing.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:00.900
 You love it.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.340
 No, he was a magician called Ali Bongo.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.100
 And that was who?

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.460
 Yeah, he's famous.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.340
 He is famous, yeah.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.620
 David Renick, the writer of Jonathan Creek,

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.780
 said he was based on Ali Bongo.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.620
 This guy, PC, what was he called?

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.100
 Sausage.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.740
 Sausage.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:21.700
 One thing about him is that he had a rival called Gojia Pasha,

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.540
 who was another Indian magician.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.900
 They were real proper rivals,

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.100
 and there was a lot of argument

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.980
 that maybe Sausage had stolen some of his tricks.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.260
 And there was another magician called K Lal,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.820
 and he told an author, Lee Seigel,

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.500
 when he was writing about magicians,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.620
 that Sausage, once bribed a member of his crew,

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:44.420
 10,000 rupees to sabotage a sawing in lady-in-the-half magic trick.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.340
 That's a risky one to sabotage, isn't it?

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.260
 I would just sabotage the rabbit in the hat.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.660
 And yeah, basically what he did is he bribed this guy

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.620
 a load of money to make this trick fail.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.060
 And at the last minute,

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.540
 this guy, Pasha, realized what had happened.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.100
 And so he ran over and he put his finger

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.100
 in a little hole in the trick

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.540
 and managed to stop the blade from sort of going towards her.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.980
 Wait, did he lose the finger?

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.220
 He didn't, but he was badly wounded.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.100
 He was like...

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:12.900
 What a hero.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.580
 "Cut to the bone," they said.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:14.900
 Yeah.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.780
 Oh, my word.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.420
 So that's one of the reasons why people didn't like him so much.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.940
 Yeah, I mean, that's quite a good reason, isn't it?

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.740
 Fair enough.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.540
 Wow.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.380
 David Copperfield sawed himself in half once.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.940
 Yeah, I think that was really impressive, yeah.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.300
 Did he put himself back together?

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.740
 Yeah.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.300
 Wow.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.100
 Eventually, yeah.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.460
 How did he do that, though?

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.780
 He was, I think it's quite a famous one.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.900
 He's tied to a table, isn't he?

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.060
 And it's just like Goldfinger, where there's something, you know.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:37.620
 It's amazing.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.140
 There's a saw coming down towards him

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.900
 and he doesn't get away in time.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.540
 And that's the...

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.660
 You think you're watching a trick

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.580
 where he's going to show you and escape,

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.260
 but you don't and he gets sawed in half.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:46.820
 And I think the blade...

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.340
 Is it very bloody?

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.300
 No, it's not at all.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.180
 And I think the blade...

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.620
 But it's a version of the sawing someone in half trick

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.100
 where it's meant to look like it's a mistake.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.220
 So, David Copperfield, as it's happening,

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.100
 the box is up and this huge, as Andy says,

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.060
 this incredible drill,

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.820
 which I believe was owned by Orson Wells,

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.340
 who was trying to get into magic.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.580
 So, he bought Orson Wells's...

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:08.980
 What?

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.740
 Yeah, Citizen Kane's Orson Wells.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.220
 He bought this big thing off the estate

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.820
 or maybe even personally from him.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.980
 So, it comes down and as it's coming down,

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.380
 the box that he's in flips open.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.780
 So, you can see him laying there and it goes through him.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.460
 And that's meant to be the big...

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.540
 It's meant to be the sawing trick that goes wrong.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.900
 I've just remembered, actually, on QI in series H,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.300
 we chopped Daniel Radcliffe's head off, do you remember?

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:31.860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.460
 And I had to do that in the rehearsal,

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.900
 had to pretend to be Daniel Radcliffe

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.180
 having his head chopped off.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.940
 And there was a massive argument afterwards

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.140
 about whether we would show afterwards that he was fine

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.660
 or whether we would just say,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.580
 "Oh, sorry, guys, we're going to have to stop the trick."

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.980
 We should have said, "Oh, we've run out of time on the show."

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.100
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.940
 That would have got the publicity in, yeah.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.860
 David Copperfield, there's a story I read about him,

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.700
 which was he was walking after a show

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.940
 with a couple of his assistants from the show

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.420
 and they all got mugged in the street.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.500
 And the mugger went, "Give me all the stuff that you have.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.700
 "Give me your wallet, give me your..."

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.860
 And so the two assistants took out their wallets

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.820
 and their airplane tickets and their passports and gave it.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.220
 David Copperfield, who also had his phone,

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.020
 his wallet and his airplane tickets on him,

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.780
 went into his pockets and then did a trick

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.300
 where it looked like he had nothing.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.860
 So he was like, "Oh, I don't have anything on me."

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.100
 And the guy was like, "Okay, that's fine."

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:24.820
 And went away.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.820
 This guy's worth over $800 million.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.340
 It would be worse if he pulled out a load of flags

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.900
 and then all of the pocket sheets and stuff.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.860
 Maybe a few dubs.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.980
 That would have been so good.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.620
 It might be.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.580
 You've got to use it.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.500
 I'm sorry, if you've been training to do...

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.900
 You've been training for that moment your whole life.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.420
 If you don't, then whip out the tricks then.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.540
 When are you going to do it?

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.260
 Oh, like carry a sore on you and chop the guy's head.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.460
 Like do something.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.900
 That's actually going to save your life.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.620
 What happened to me in Nuremberg that time when we were on tour.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.580
 I don't know if I've said it.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:59.780
 So we were on tour and I was dressed in like a yellow and black suit

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.100
 and Andy said that I looked like a magician,

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.180
 which in fairness I did look a bit like a magician.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.180
 So we decided to put some magic tricks on

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.300
 and I had this kind of cane that's just appeared from nowhere

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.460
 and I had like the handkerchiefs that would come out.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.700
 Anyway, we finished the last tour of the gig

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.820
 and then I had to go to Nuremberg to see my in-laws the next day

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.980
 and I couldn't put stuff in the hold so it was all hand luggage.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.340
 And so I had all of my tricks with me in my bag

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.420
 and this like cane that appeared from nowhere

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.420
 just looked like a bomb basically.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.180
 And so we went through the airport and they were like,

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.660
 "What's this? What's this? These German guys?"

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.380
 And I'm like, "Oh, oh, it's magic. It's magic. It's magic."

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.340
 And they went, "What?"

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.020
 I said, "It's magic. It's magic."

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.460
 I said, "Let me show you. Let me show you."

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.980
 And so then I did a load of magic tricks in front of them, insecurity.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.460
 And they were like, "Oh, okay, okay."

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.940
 And I was just about to go and they went, "No, no, stop, stop, stop."

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.620
 I'm like, "Oh, shit. What? What? What?"

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.900
 They said, "Do it again."

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.460
 And they got all of the other security guys in the whole of Nuremberg

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.420
 at a part and they made me do a magic trick in front of them all.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.780
 That's really funny.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.420
 It's a frightening place to be questioned, Nuremberg, isn't it?

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:09.140
 Just while we're on tour stories, on our previous tour,

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.860
 we had a guy who was our road manager called Daniel

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.580
 and he lives in Wales and just on mugging,

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.500
 he was walking home one night in Wales

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.500
 and he was going under a bridge at a guy walked up behind him

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.700
 and tried to mug him.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.580
 So he went, "Oi!"

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:26.820
 And Daniel turned around and Daniel's a really big guy

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:30.740
 and he's from America and he's quite an intimidating character

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.500
 if you didn't see the front of him.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.100
 So he turns around and this guy's holding a knife at him

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.140
 but he looks at Daniel and sees the size of him and the look of him

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.700
 and goes, "Wanna buy a knife?"

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.940
 And Daniel went, "Yeah, it looks good."

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:51.380
 And he bought it off him for 20 quid.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.860
 And he has that knife.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.380
 He brought it on all of our tours.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.580
 It's what he uses to cut things to put things like this up.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.300
 Really funny.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.620
 That is it.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.740
 That is all of our facts.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.180
