00:00:02,00:00:17,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:17,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:23,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:00:23,00:00:24,from Barstapa.
00:00:24,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:31,(audience applauding)
00:00:31,00:00:32,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:32,00:00:34,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:37,00:00:39,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:39,00:00:42,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:42,00:00:46,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:46,00:00:49,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:49,00:00:53,"- Okay, my fact this week is that when the bird poo"
00:00:53,00:00:57,"in pot industry first reached the UK,"
00:00:57,00:01:00,the smell was so bad in Southampton
00:01:00,00:01:04,that the entire urban population fled to the hills.
00:01:04,00:01:05,(snoring)
00:01:05,00:01:06,- Was it in one go?
00:01:06,00:01:08,You know when you watch movies like Deep Impact
00:01:08,00:01:09,or Armageddon where you just see people
00:01:09,00:01:11,flocking away from cities?
00:01:11,00:01:12,Was there a traffic?
00:01:12,00:01:13,- They just got one guy with a cold gun
00:01:13,00:01:17,"in the other direction, go what the fuck are they doing?"
00:01:17,00:01:19,"So this is, it's guano."
00:01:19,00:01:23,"So it's in the olden days, you would get this bird poo"
00:01:23,00:01:24,and it would get brought into the country
00:01:24,00:01:26,and they would use it as fertilizer.
00:01:26,00:01:30,- And there is an English historian called Frederick Pike
00:01:30,00:01:32,who wrote the modern history of Peru.
00:01:32,00:01:35,So he was writing about the Peruvian guano industry
00:01:35,00:01:37,and he said that the stench was so miserable
00:01:37,00:01:40,that the entire population of Southampton left the town.
00:01:40,00:01:42,"It might be true, it might not be true."
00:01:42,00:01:44,"This is what the historian says, so it's quite a good source."
00:01:44,00:01:45,- It certainly feels like
00:01:45,00:01:46,"it's an exaggeration though, doesn't it?"
00:01:46,00:01:47,- It does.
00:01:47,00:01:49,- I'd eat all of my clothes right now
00:01:49,00:01:52,if every human in Southampton evacuated
00:01:52,00:01:54,and went up a hill.
00:01:54,00:01:55,Well surely we'd know about that.
00:01:55,00:01:58,"- It's true, but have you ever been to Southampton?"
00:01:58,00:02:01,"- I have, but I didn't know what you were saying about it."
00:02:01,00:02:02,I'm gonna say I don't agree.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"- No, I don't agree with myself."
00:02:04,00:02:06,- Can I just say I'd eat all of my clothes right now.
00:02:06,00:02:08,It's an incredible escalation of I'd eat my hat.
00:02:08,00:02:14,"- What I did find was in Massachusetts,"
00:02:14,00:02:16,there is a place called Woods Hole
00:02:16,00:02:20,and there was a company called the Pacific Guano Company
00:02:20,00:02:23,and I've seen some very good evidence
00:02:23,00:02:25,"that whenever the weather changed,"
00:02:25,00:02:27,"the wind changed in a certain direction,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,the entire town would have to be evacuated from the smell.
00:02:30,00:02:32,"So it was, it is very smelly bird poo"
00:02:32,00:02:35,when you have it on such big amounts.
00:02:35,00:02:37,"- Yeah, and the reason it's so smelly"
00:02:37,00:02:39,"is that it's not just any bird poo, isn't it?"
00:02:39,00:02:42,It's bird poo of specific birds
00:02:42,00:02:44,that have been eating specific fish.
00:02:44,00:02:47,And the reason that Guano was this incredible
00:02:47,00:02:49,wonder substance in the 19th century
00:02:49,00:02:51,"is that it has lots of, what is it?"
00:02:51,00:02:53,"Nitrogen and phosphate and potassium,"
00:02:53,00:02:56,all of the chemicals that just act as rocket fuel for plants.
00:02:56,00:02:58,And so it suddenly acted as this incredible fertilizer.
00:02:58,00:02:59,But the reason it smells so bad
00:02:59,00:03:01,"is it's so full of this very, very oily fish."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"- So what, so there's, yeah,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,"so there's the fish guano, which is very important,"
00:03:05,00:03:08,but bat guano as well is very important.
00:03:08,00:03:09,But what are the bats eating?
00:03:09,00:03:10,"They're not eating fish, right?"
00:03:10,00:03:12,- They're all eating sex bats.
00:03:12,00:03:13,"- Okay, and it produces the same,"
00:03:13,00:03:14,'cause those are the most important.
00:03:14,00:03:16,Sea birds and bats for guano.
00:03:16,00:03:18,- I didn't know bats was used as fertilizer.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"- It can be, I think mostly it would be used,"
00:03:21,00:03:25,"they would use it as like to make gunpowder and stuff,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,"I think they used it, but like the fish one,"
00:03:27,00:03:30,"when they first found these islands off the coast of Peru,"
00:03:30,00:03:32,"which had all this tons and tons of bird shit on,"
00:03:32,00:03:34,that kind of changed the world a little bit
00:03:34,00:03:38,because it was the first mass produced fertilizer
00:03:38,00:03:41,"that wasn't coming, let's say, out of humans."
00:03:41,00:03:43,"- Yeah, well they had islands just off Peru"
00:03:43,00:03:47,"where the guano had built up for all those years,"
00:03:47,00:03:49,that they were like 200 feet.
00:03:49,00:03:50,"- Yeah, I've been there actually."
00:03:50,00:03:53,"- Have you? - I've been to those guano islands, yeah."
00:03:53,00:03:56,"I tricked my wife into going there, 'cause..."
00:03:56,00:04:02,"There was an excursion to swim with sea lions,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"and I noticed it was on the guano islands,"
00:04:04,00:04:06,"and I was like, oh, you've always wanted to swim with sea lions,"
00:04:06,00:04:07,haven't you? And she hadn't.
00:04:07,00:04:09,- Have I? (laughing)
00:04:09,00:04:11,"- But we went down there, and I kept asking the guy"
00:04:11,00:04:13,"who's in charge about the guano, I'm like,"
00:04:13,00:04:16,"oh, you know, is there still guards here and stuff like that?"
00:04:16,00:04:17,And he didn't know anything about it.
00:04:17,00:04:18,- Really?
00:04:18,00:04:20,- He only knew about sea lions.
00:04:20,00:04:24,"I think you weren't cheated there, I think that's fair."
00:04:24,00:04:27,"- I think one of the reasons as well that it was so useful,"
00:04:27,00:04:29,and I think this might be why back guano
00:04:29,00:04:31,"was the other famous one, I suppose,"
00:04:31,00:04:33,is that it's all together.
00:04:33,00:04:35,"So the reason you can use back guano,"
00:04:35,00:04:37,"for let's say gunpowder, and this,"
00:04:37,00:04:39,"is that seabirds all flock to one spot,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,and then they shit everywhere.
00:04:40,00:04:42,"Bats are obviously all in one cave,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,they shit everywhere.
00:04:43,00:04:45,"If it was pigeon guano, that would be hell, right?"
00:04:45,00:04:46,"'Cause you'd have to crawl around the streets of London,"
00:04:46,00:04:49,scraping up individual pigeon poo after pigeon poo.
00:04:49,00:04:51,You wouldn't get anywhere.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"- Yeah, and also those islands, it hardly ever rains."
00:04:54,00:04:55,"So it's always quite overcast,"
00:04:55,00:04:57,"but it doesn't really rain very often,"
00:04:57,00:04:58,"and so it never gets washed away,"
00:04:58,00:05:00,it just kind of layers and layers and layers.
00:05:00,00:05:01,"- It was, Matt."
00:05:01,00:05:04,"So there was a newspaper advert I read from the 1840s,"
00:05:04,00:05:07,"and it just read, guano, guano, guano,"
00:05:07,00:05:09,"and then in caps lock, guano."
00:05:09,00:05:13,"It was so impressive, and it was this kind of wonder substance."
00:05:13,00:05:15,So there was a story that the San Francisco Journal
00:05:15,00:05:19,"printed in 1857, and it was about a shipment of guano,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,"making its way across the Atlantic,"
00:05:21,00:05:24,"and the ship's hatches were left open by mistake,"
00:05:24,00:05:25,and the guano got wet.
00:05:25,00:05:28,And the account is that the timbers of the ship
00:05:28,00:05:31,started growing and sprouting in all directions.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"The rudder of the ship grew into a huge, great oak."
00:05:34,00:05:38,"They had to start pruning the ship every couple of days,"
00:05:38,00:05:39,and apples were growing on the pump handle.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"Worst of all, the ship's cockroaches,"
00:05:41,00:05:44,"all the cockroaches on board had got into the guano,"
00:05:44,00:05:46,and they got so big and powerful
00:05:46,00:05:48,that they were able to pull up the anchor of the ship.
00:05:48,00:05:51,"- Whoa! - I mean, that's not true."
00:05:51,00:05:53,"- Oh, I guess so. - It's such a..."
00:05:53,00:05:55,"Well, it's printed in the San Francisco Journal."
00:05:55,00:05:59,- Why did they print it as a fable? - It was a humorous myth
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- related to how potent guano was. - A sailor's tale, yeah."
00:06:01,00:06:04,"You know, guano is so strong, if you chug a cockroach out,"
00:06:04,00:06:06,"it grows to the size of a person,"
00:06:06,00:06:07,"and then you'll go away going,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,"""Wow, do you know what the sailor just told me?"""
00:06:09,00:06:14,"- Yeah, I really would. - I mean, it is super impressive stuff,"
00:06:14,00:06:18,"isn't it, and people really valued it massively back in the day,"
00:06:18,00:06:21,"so in 1850, President Fillmore,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,it was part of his union address
00:06:23,00:06:26,"that he was promising fairer prices for guano,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,and that was like a big deal.
00:06:28,00:06:30,"We don't appreciate it now as much,"
00:06:30,00:06:31,because it's a bit harder to get it
00:06:31,00:06:35,"because all the islands where the seabirds were pooing on,"
00:06:35,00:06:36,they've kind of been depleted.
00:06:36,00:06:37,"And also, we don't need it."
00:06:37,00:06:40,"That's the main reason, really, that it doesn't exist anymore,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,is that we managed to invent fertilizer
00:06:42,00:06:43,"around about the turn of the century,"
00:06:43,00:06:44,"when we turn the 20th century,"
00:06:44,00:06:47,"and so suddenly it wasn't necessary anymore,"
00:06:47,00:06:50,"and so it was the 19th century when this massive rush happened, right?"
00:06:50,00:06:55,"But that was when Britain and the new migrant Americans discovered it,"
00:06:55,00:06:58,"but it had been used for many centuries before that in South America,"
00:06:58,00:07:02,"so in the 17th century, in fact, when Europeans first got to America,"
00:07:02,00:07:05,they said that the Peruvians used it so much
00:07:05,00:07:09,that it looked like they had loads of snow-capped mountains in the regions
00:07:09,00:07:13,because they had just had huge mountains of guano that they had stocked up.
00:07:13,00:07:15,"That's a very disappointing ski trip, isn't it?"
00:07:15,00:07:18,(LAUGHTER)
00:07:18,00:07:20,"But, yeah, the Incas were very into it,"
00:07:20,00:07:24,"and the Incas had a cool communist kind of a system with guano,"
00:07:24,00:07:29,"where every town, every Inca town, was assigned its own guano island,"
00:07:29,00:07:33,"and then every household in the town was assigned its own, like, bit of guano,"
00:07:33,00:07:34,"or a bit of share of that island,"
00:07:34,00:07:37,"and that was how much you had, and it was according to how much you needed,"
00:07:37,00:07:39,"and that meant no one could get a big monopoly,"
00:07:39,00:07:42,"no one could come in and raid it all, and it was all working very well."
00:07:42,00:07:47,"- All right, Jeremy Corbyn has checked in to the podcast. - (LAUGHTER)"
00:07:47,00:07:51,"But lots of Britain was built on guano, effectively, or built on the money from guano,"
00:07:51,00:07:54,"so there was a guano millionaire,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,"maybe the first guano millionaire called William Gibbs,"
00:07:56,00:08:00,"and he was the subject of a musical song which ran,"
00:08:00,00:08:03,"""William Gibbs made his dibs, selling the turds of foreign birds."""
00:08:03,00:08:05,(LAUGHTER)
00:08:05,00:08:09,"And there's a local link with him, which is that there's a church in Exeter"
00:08:09,00:08:15,"called St Michael and All Angels Church, and that has this big memorial to William Gibbs,"
00:08:15,00:08:20,because he was such a big noise and funded so many churches and chapels with the mining.
00:08:20,00:08:24,"Kiebel College, Oxford, was, that their chapel was, you know, it's a huge thing,"
00:08:24,00:08:27,"it was completely funded by bird poo, basically."
00:08:27,00:08:30,"- Right. - Funny that more of them don't use this in their PR, hasn't it?"
00:08:30,00:08:32,"- Built on bird ships. - Yeah, yeah."
00:08:32,00:08:35,"Well, the conditions in which it was mined were not great, either,"
00:08:35,00:08:39,"and there were lots of indentured labour where workers were shipped over from China,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"and it's pretty horrible stuff to work among,"
00:08:41,00:08:46,"because if you don't have a really, really good mask,"
00:08:46,00:08:47,you'll be inhaling kind of dust from it.
00:08:47,00:08:51,"- Oh, they're covered with it, yeah. - They don't really bother with masks as well, do they?"
00:08:51,00:08:53,"- No, they don't. - Yes, there were no masks."
00:08:53,00:08:56,Coolest thing that I think guano has given us
00:08:56,00:08:58,"is that there's an island called Nauru,"
00:08:58,00:09:02,"which made so much money from guano, from the selling of it and so on,"
00:09:02,00:09:10,"and they decided to invest a lot of that money in a musical called ""Leonardo, a Portrait of Love"","
00:09:10,00:09:13,"- the story of Leonardo da Vinci. - The Caprio, oh, sorry."
00:09:13,00:09:18,"""Leonardo da Vinci"" and Mona Lisa and how they had a relationship."
00:09:18,00:09:23,"I mean, it was completely factually inaccurate, and it was pretty much a flop."
00:09:23,00:09:26,I think it had like one or two shows that went well in Oxford.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"- I'd say bring it back. - Yeah, I'd love to see it."
00:09:28,00:09:32,"- What the musical? - Yeah, not guano, I can live without guano."
00:09:32,00:09:35,What about the Guano Islands near Peru?
00:09:35,00:09:39,"In 1865, when it was the real height of it,"
00:09:39,00:09:44,Spain decided they would send a scientific mission to South America to kind of look at this.
00:09:44,00:09:47,"It didn't belong to them, okay, but they just wanted to see what was going on."
00:09:47,00:09:51,So they sent a scientific mission of about a dozen warships.
00:09:51,00:09:53,[laughter]
00:09:53,00:09:59,And basically then they forced a situation where some of their soldiers were attacked
00:09:59,00:10:03,and there was a full all-out war for bird shit.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"- Wow. - Basically, Chile got involved,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"Bolivia got involved, the whole of South America against Spain."
00:10:08,00:10:11,They all blockaded the Spanish and eventually the Spanish disappeared
00:10:11,00:10:13,with the tails between their legs.
00:10:13,00:10:18,"But really, that was the start of quite a lot of battles over these bird shit islands."
00:10:18,00:10:20,- Wow. - What must the birds have thought?
00:10:20,00:10:22,That's so weird.
00:10:22,00:10:27,"One year to go back to this deserted island, you've always shat on to find warring nations."
00:10:27,00:10:31,"You're desperately holding their hands up to your arseholes going, ""Please!"""
00:10:31,00:10:33,"- Oh my God, Adam! - ""Just a morsel!"""
00:10:33,00:10:37,- Oh my God. - Wildering.
00:10:37,00:10:39,It was in the US Civil War as well.
00:10:39,00:10:41,Guano featured in the American Civil War.
00:10:41,00:10:44,"It didn't change the outcome, but the Confederacy had been blockaded"
00:10:44,00:10:48,and so they had to mine bat guano to make their gunpowder.
00:10:48,00:10:52,"- So they went to the Batcave in order to try and... - Oh, right."
00:10:52,00:10:54,"- Yeah. - That's Robin's job, isn't it?"
00:10:54,00:11:00,"When he's... On the weekdays, he's just scraping Batman's poo off the walls."
00:11:00,00:11:02,"Oh my God, that's how Bruce Wayne became a multimillionaire."
00:11:02,00:11:05,- We never really understand it. - That's it.
00:11:05,00:11:10,"And Commissioner Gordon's going, ""One more morsel, Batman!"""
00:11:10,00:11:14,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:11:14,00:11:18,"My fact this week is that scientists have made a TV for fish,"
00:11:18,00:11:21,"but if humans want to watch it, they have to wear sunscreen."
00:11:21,00:11:25,- Bizarre. - Is that because it's placed on the beach?
00:11:25,00:11:28,"Yeah, good point. Yeah, just hovering above the sea."
00:11:28,00:11:31,"No, this is a scientist at the University of Queensland,"
00:11:31,00:11:36,and they wanted to know about the visual capabilities of fish.
00:11:36,00:11:40,"They started with clownfish, often very good for experimenting on,"
00:11:40,00:11:43,and they were looking at what they can see in the UV spectrum.
00:11:43,00:11:46,So fish can see in the UV spectrum where we can't.
00:11:46,00:11:48,And so they developed a screen display
00:11:48,00:11:52,that just includes the violet and the ultraviolet spectrum.
00:11:52,00:11:55,"And they had the fish kind of peck at targets,"
00:11:55,00:11:59,"so they have targets in certain UV wavelengths on it,"
00:11:59,00:12:01,and they'd reward fish if they pecked at certain ones
00:12:01,00:12:03,to see if they could see and distinguish
00:12:03,00:12:05,between the different UV wavelengths.
00:12:05,00:12:07,"And they could, but the thing is, of course,"
00:12:07,00:12:09,is giving off lots of UV radiation.
00:12:09,00:12:11,And what do we know about that? It's bad for us.
00:12:11,00:12:14,So you've got to wear factor 50 and sunglasses.
00:12:14,00:12:17,And also I don't think it's very good programs.
00:12:17,00:12:20,"No, if it's just like UV light and you just peck it on it all the time."
00:12:20,00:12:24,"Yeah, yeah. But yeah, they can all see..."
00:12:24,00:12:26,"In fact, loads of animals can see things that we can't."
00:12:26,00:12:30,I really like the idea that they're all seeing completely different stuff.
00:12:30,00:12:32,Like a rainbow. I never thought about it.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"That's not just red to violet, right?"
00:12:34,00:12:36,"That goes to infrared in one direction,"
00:12:36,00:12:38,"so if you can see an infrared spectrum,"
00:12:38,00:12:41,then you'd be able to see all the colors that we can't.
00:12:41,00:12:44,"And then the other side, like if you're a bird looking at a rainbow,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,"so all birds can see UV,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"you'll see loads more colors, I guess,"
00:12:47,00:12:48,beyond violet.
00:12:48,00:12:48,Wow.
00:12:48,00:12:51,Do they see... Do we know if they see rainbows?
00:12:51,00:12:51,As in...
00:12:51,00:12:53,"Yeah, they must do, right?"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"But their eyes are on different sides of their head,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,often if they're prey animals.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"If you're looking at a rainbow and you close one of your eyes,"
00:12:59,00:13:00,does it disappear?
00:13:00,00:13:01,I've never tried.
00:13:01,00:13:05,"No, I'm not going to follow this line of inquiry any further."
00:13:05,00:13:05,You put me off it.
00:13:05,00:13:09,Fish aren't the only animals that TV is being created for.
00:13:09,00:13:13,"There is... Well, there's Dog TV, which is a channel."
00:13:13,00:13:13,Okay.
00:13:13,00:13:17,Which is actually TV shows made for dogs.
00:13:17,00:13:19,And I spend a lot of time on their website today.
00:13:19,00:13:21,What do they watch?
00:13:21,00:13:25,"It's a range of shows to inform, educate and entertain."
00:13:25,00:13:26,"It's very wreathy, actually."
00:13:26,00:13:26,Is it like...
00:13:26,00:13:29,"I imagine it would be like EastEnders, but all the characters are dogs."
00:13:29,00:13:32,Do they watch animal-based TV?
00:13:32,00:13:35,"Well, Great British Bake Off, but all the contestants are dogs."
00:13:35,00:13:36,Yeah.
00:13:36,00:13:37,"No, I get where you're going with it, James."
00:13:37,00:13:39,"Well, like, it could be like the football match,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,but all the footballers are dogs.
00:13:41,00:13:44,I think it's not exactly that.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"Or it could be Crofts, but all the contestants are humans."
00:13:46,00:13:52,"It's... I think sometimes there's a squirrel on the screen,"
00:13:52,00:13:53,but that kind of thing.
00:13:53,00:13:57,But it's mostly to entertain your dog when you're not around.
00:13:57,00:13:59,"But the FAQ section of the website is unbelievable,"
00:13:59,00:14:01,"because it costs about the same as Netflix,"
00:14:01,00:14:02,but it's just for your dog.
00:14:02,00:14:04,So one of the questions the FAQs is...
00:14:04,00:14:05,Is it called Petflex?
00:14:05,00:14:07,Brilliant. It should be.
00:14:07,00:14:12,"It's called Dog TV, I think probably due to a legal issue with Netflix."
00:14:13,00:14:14,"But one of the FAQs is,"
00:14:14,00:14:17,"it seems like my dog is not watching this, and I've paid for it."
00:14:17,00:14:19,"And the answer is, well, you have to understand,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,dogs don't watch TV the same way that humans do.
00:14:21,00:14:23,It won't happen.
00:14:23,00:14:25,"Dogs, you know, some of them like the visuals,"
00:14:25,00:14:28,some just lie there and feel calmed by the relaxing music.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Either of those methods is great.
00:14:29,00:14:30,"And when you're there with the dog,"
00:14:30,00:14:34,he will always be more interested in you than the TV screen.
00:14:34,00:14:35,So that's basically...
00:14:35,00:14:36,Right.
00:14:36,00:14:38,You're never going to see your dog relax to this channel.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"If you're in the room, it can only relax when you're away."
00:14:41,00:14:44,"One really interesting thing about dogs with TV is that,"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"until probably, I'm going to say about 10 years ago,"
00:14:47,00:14:50,"they would not have enjoyed watching normal TV, any kind of TV."
00:14:50,00:14:53,"And that's because the number of frames per second,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"and the speed in which they see those frames,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,it would kind of look like a slideshow to them.
00:14:58,00:14:59,If you know what I mean?
00:14:59,00:15:01,"Well, I mean, we did a slideshow in our first half today,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,and I think everyone enjoyed it.
00:15:03,00:15:06,So you don't necessarily not enjoy something because it's a slideshow.
00:15:06,00:15:07,"Yep, fair enough."
00:15:07,00:15:09,But they wouldn't get all of the nuances
00:15:09,00:15:11,"that we would get from watching Breaking Bad, for instance."
00:15:11,00:15:12,Sure.
00:15:12,00:15:15,But they need about 70 images per second
00:15:15,00:15:19,in order for it to look as if it's a continuous movement.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"And these days, your TV does have that."
00:15:21,00:15:25,"But until around 10, 20 years ago, it didn't look like that."
00:15:25,00:15:28,"So recently, they've been looking at this box in the middle of the house"
00:15:28,00:15:31,"that kind of just flashes these pictures,"
00:15:31,00:15:34,"and then suddenly, it was like a proper TV channel."
00:15:34,00:15:36,"Wow, and you remember the day, don't you,"
00:15:36,00:15:37,where all dogs changed overnight?
00:15:37,00:15:40,They all seemed so much happier.
00:15:40,00:15:42,But it also means that they wouldn't want to go to the cinema
00:15:42,00:15:45,because all cinemas have still got the same old frame rate
00:15:45,00:15:46,because people prefer it.
00:15:46,00:15:47,"Oh, OK. That's interesting."
00:15:47,00:15:50,They do. I think they should make this dog TV for humans.
00:15:50,00:15:52,It shows dogs surfing.
00:15:52,00:15:53,"It is, you're right."
00:15:53,00:15:55,It is pretty much all dogs because they've done experiments
00:15:55,00:15:56,"and it turns out all dogs want to watch,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,"self-involved as they are, is other dogs."
00:15:58,00:16:00,"Sounds like Baywatch, but all the characters are dogs."
00:16:00,00:16:03,That's what it is.
00:16:03,00:16:07,"I'd watch a show of dogs surfing for 10 minutes, I reckon."
00:16:07,00:16:08,Yeah.
00:16:08,00:16:09,I think that's a good point.
00:16:09,00:16:11,"Oh, God, I read the craziest thing"
00:16:11,00:16:13,about the TV show Skippy today.
00:16:13,00:16:16,We're talking about animals on TV.
00:16:16,00:16:18,"It's quite disgusting, so I'm very sorry"
00:16:18,00:16:20,if I'm going to ruin any Skippy lovers here.
00:16:20,00:16:23,But Skippy on screen always used to have the ability
00:16:23,00:16:25,to open up doors and stuff like that.
00:16:25,00:16:26,"So this is like a kangaroo, right?"
00:16:26,00:16:28,Skippy the Bush Kangaroo.
00:16:28,00:16:29,"Oh, my God, yeah. What am I doing?"
00:16:29,00:16:31,I'm talking about a show that hasn't been on TV for 50 years.
00:16:31,00:16:32,Let's move on to our next.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"No, no, no, no. That was just for the young Skippy."
00:16:34,00:16:38,"No, it's a good point. Skippy the Bush Kangaroo."
00:16:38,00:16:39,"It's like glassy, but he's a kangaroo."
00:16:39,00:16:40,But he's a kangaroo.
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Yeah. Yeah. And he was, what's that, Skippy?"
00:16:41,00:16:42,Yeah. Kind of thing.
00:16:42,00:16:45,"And so Skippy would be on screen as the kangaroo,"
00:16:45,00:16:46,"but he was a really grumpy kangaroo,"
00:16:46,00:16:48,and he would never properly enjoy it.
00:16:48,00:16:50,"And so when he had to do things like open the door,"
00:16:50,00:16:51,he couldn't really do that.
00:16:51,00:16:54,So what they did was they had kangaroo hands
00:16:54,00:16:58,"that were from, I think, a dead kangaroo with sticks on them."
00:16:58,00:16:58,"Oh, my God."
00:16:58,00:17:00,"And so when you see Skippy opening doors,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,they would lean in with the stick
00:17:02,00:17:05,and just have a kangaroo fucking horrible visit.
00:17:05,00:17:06,"Oh, my God. That is..."
00:17:06,00:17:08,I don't know why I told you guys.
00:17:08,00:17:09,I sort of pulled this.
00:17:09,00:17:11,I thought you were going to say he opened it with his pouch
00:17:11,00:17:11,or something cute.
00:17:11,00:17:16,"Like, blue-tip birds, they get TV as well"
00:17:16,00:17:17,in one experiment that they did.
00:17:17,00:17:21,And they worked out that blue-tits make better dinner choices
00:17:21,00:17:24,at a buffet after watching TV footage
00:17:24,00:17:27,of other birds making bad decisions.
00:17:27,00:17:28,What are you talking about?
00:17:28,00:17:30,"Now, what is a bad dinner decision for a blue-tip?"
00:17:30,00:17:34,"A bad dinner decision might be something that is dead,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,"that has just a foul taste to it,"
00:17:36,00:17:37,that you might not have eaten as a blue-tip.
00:17:37,00:17:40,"But if presented to you in a package, you might go for it."
00:17:40,00:17:44,And so they would see these blue-tits eating this food
00:17:44,00:17:46,"and then going, ""Oh, oh, oh,"" and spinning it out."
00:17:46,00:17:48,"And then later, when they then presented them"
00:17:48,00:17:51,"with that food and other options,"
00:17:51,00:17:54,"in most cases, they would avoid the one that they saw on TV."
00:17:54,00:17:54,That's amazing.
00:17:54,00:17:55,They got the bad reaction.
00:17:55,00:17:57,Yeah. So TV can teach.
00:17:57,00:17:58,It's very Rethian.
00:17:58,00:17:59,Very clever.
00:17:59,00:18:01,And pigs can play video games.
00:18:01,00:18:02,Can they?
00:18:02,00:18:04,"Yeah, properly now."
00:18:04,00:18:06,"They used to play them, but like with touchscreen."
00:18:06,00:18:08,"Well, they used to play Pong,"
00:18:08,00:18:09,"and now they're playing Fortnite,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,is what you are implying.
00:18:11,00:18:11,Yeah.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"Okay, I think it is actually still Pong."
00:18:13,00:18:15,But they're using a joystick.
00:18:15,00:18:18,This is leaps and bounds for Pig World.
00:18:18,00:18:19,This is this year.
00:18:19,00:18:22,Scientists have put pigs in front of a video game
00:18:22,00:18:25,"and they've given them a joystick to operate with their snout,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,which is harder than with a hand.
00:18:27,00:18:30,And they realize that they connect what they're doing
00:18:30,00:18:32,"on the joystick to what's happening on the screen,"
00:18:32,00:18:34,and then they connect what's happening on the screen
00:18:34,00:18:35,to rewards that they get.
00:18:35,00:18:37,"And so, you know, they can chase the right thing"
00:18:37,00:18:39,"and catch it knowing that they'll get a reward,"
00:18:39,00:18:41,just using this joystick thing.
00:18:41,00:18:42,That's clever.
00:18:42,00:18:43,That's very cool.
00:18:43,00:18:43,That's very cool.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:18:44,00:18:46,"I think the thing with pigs is like,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,they're quite intelligent
00:18:48,00:18:50,"and you need to give them stuff to play with, don't you?"
00:18:50,00:18:51,"I think even by law,"
00:18:51,00:18:52,you need to give them stuff to play with.
00:18:52,00:18:52,Yeah.
00:18:52,00:18:54,So it doesn't have to be a PS5.
00:18:54,00:18:55,It can just be a ball.
00:18:55,00:19:01,"But UV light, this fact is about these fish"
00:19:01,00:19:04,"that can see UV light, there was a thing."
00:19:04,00:19:05,So there's a condition
00:19:05,00:19:07,"where some people can see ultraviolet light,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,which is very strange.
00:19:09,00:19:11,It's a condition called aphakia.
00:19:11,00:19:15,And it's where you don't have a lens in your eye.
00:19:15,00:19:17,So the lens has been removed for whatever reason that is.
00:19:17,00:19:22,And it means that you can sometimes see ultraviolet light.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"But this actually, there's a rumour,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,and it's not completely confirmed
00:19:25,00:19:27,"that this was used in the Second World War,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,which is bizarre.
00:19:29,00:19:32,It's that military intelligence recruited people
00:19:32,00:19:34,"who had this condition, aphakia,"
00:19:34,00:19:37,to watch the coastline for German U-boats
00:19:37,00:19:40,signalling to spies on the shore with UV lamps.
00:19:40,00:19:41,"No, I don't think it's true."
00:19:41,00:19:44,"But I love the idea of it, but I don't, yeah."
00:19:44,00:19:45,Here's a true thing.
00:19:45,00:19:47,You can buy ultraviolet trousers.
00:19:47,00:19:49,These are really cool.
00:19:49,00:19:49,I want to get these.
00:19:49,00:19:53,"So ultraviolet will glow in a black light, right?"
00:19:53,00:19:55,"So if you go to a club and you have a gin and tonic,"
00:19:55,00:19:59,it'll glow slightly because it's under the UV light.
00:19:59,00:19:59,OK.
00:19:59,00:20:02,These trousers will look like normal trousers
00:20:02,00:20:03,when you're walking down the street.
00:20:03,00:20:04,No one will notice.
00:20:04,00:20:08,"And as soon as you walk into a club, party in your pants."
00:20:08,00:20:08,Wow.
00:20:08,00:20:11,They're glowing in all sorts of different colours.
00:20:11,00:20:11,Wow.
00:20:11,00:20:12,That's amazing.
00:20:12,00:20:14,I hope you don't say that sentence
00:20:14,00:20:15,when you walk into a club.
00:20:15,00:20:17,"Party in my pants, eh?"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"We're going to have to move on, guys, to our next fact."
00:20:21,00:20:22,Oh.
00:20:22,00:20:25,Can I just one piece of technology created for animals
00:20:25,00:20:28,that I liked is chickens.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"We also like to look out for, well, some farmers"
00:20:30,00:20:32,like to look out for their chickens welfare.
00:20:32,00:20:34,And chickens apparently like physical contact
00:20:34,00:20:35,with their farmers when they know them.
00:20:35,00:20:38,So they'll hold them and they'll stroke them.
00:20:38,00:20:41,"When you've got lots, then you can't do that every single day."
00:20:41,00:20:43,And so they've developed a chicken jacket.
00:20:43,00:20:47,And chickens wear it and it allows humans to give
00:20:47,00:20:51,"the chicken a virtual hug, even though they're not present."
00:20:51,00:20:54,So a farmer will stroke a chicken model in a sitting room.
00:20:54,00:20:56,And then the chickens wearing the jacket
00:20:56,00:20:58,will feel the farmer stroking him.
00:20:58,00:21:01,"Can you do it for 1,000 chickens at the same time?"
00:21:01,00:21:01,I believe so.
00:21:01,00:21:03,"So they're all wearing a jacket and they all go, ah."
00:21:03,00:21:06,"I guess that would work, right?"
00:21:06,00:21:06,Yeah.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"As we then they look at each other and they're like,"
00:21:08,00:21:09,"""What, he's doing it to you as well?"""
00:21:09,00:21:12,That is incredible.
00:21:12,00:21:15,We do need to move on to our next fact.
00:21:15,00:21:17,It is time for fact number three.
00:21:17,00:21:18,And that is my fact.
00:21:18,00:21:21,My fact this week is just like how we have
00:21:21,00:21:23,ice cream truck music in the UK.
00:21:23,00:21:26,"In Taiwan, they have garbage truck music."
00:21:26,00:21:28,How cool is that?
00:21:28,00:21:30,"So this, I mean, this was a genius idea."
00:21:30,00:21:31,Are they different?
00:21:31,00:21:32,They must be different tunes.
00:21:32,00:21:33,It's still green sleeves.
00:21:33,00:21:34,That's the amazing thing.
00:21:34,00:21:37,"No, but it's Beethoven."
00:21:37,00:21:40,"It's Phuellis, which I think is..."
00:21:40,00:21:43,Is that that one?
00:21:43,00:21:44,"Game of Thrones, isn't it?"
00:21:44,00:21:44,No.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"Okay, after three."
00:21:48,00:21:49,"One, two, three."
00:21:49,00:21:54,Thank you.
00:21:54,00:21:58,"Yeah, so this was a genius concept from Taiwan."
00:21:58,00:22:02,Taiwan was an incredibly garbage-ridden place.
00:22:02,00:22:03,It was just steaming with it.
00:22:03,00:22:05,It was called Garbage Island.
00:22:05,00:22:06,Everyone knew it was that.
00:22:06,00:22:08,And they needed to do something.
00:22:08,00:22:10,And they worked out that in...
00:22:10,00:22:11,And this was in 1997.
00:22:11,00:22:14,They started a thing called a Trash of the Ground Movement.
00:22:14,00:22:16,"And basically, like an ice cream truck coming out"
00:22:16,00:22:19,"and everyone running out to get an ice cream, kids running out,"
00:22:19,00:22:23,"in Taiwan, they abandoned the idea of you stocking up your garbage"
00:22:23,00:22:25,and then putting it out on one single day.
00:22:25,00:22:28,These trucks would go around four or five times a night
00:22:28,00:22:29,and they would have their song playing
00:22:29,00:22:30,and you would run outside
00:22:30,00:22:33,and you would throw your garbage directly into the truck.
00:22:33,00:22:35,And it became a social event.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"Most people who've reported about it said,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,"""This is the time that I got to properly meet my neighbors"
00:22:39,00:22:40,"as we were out there,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,excitedly holding our trash can bags
00:22:42,00:22:44,"and chucking them in."""
00:22:44,00:22:48,"And as a result, the pollution problem in Taiwan"
00:22:48,00:22:50,has gone extraordinarily down.
00:22:50,00:22:53,"I mean, it's a model for how countries really should be operating"
00:22:53,00:22:55,for recycling and garbage waste.
00:22:55,00:22:58,"Oh, I'd love to see them attempt that in Britain or America."
00:22:58,00:22:59,No one would do it.
00:22:59,00:23:00,They'd be right immediately.
00:23:00,00:23:02,There's no way I would do it.
00:23:02,00:23:04,"Another bottle of wine, another bottle of wine, another bottle of wine."
00:23:04,00:23:09,You've got to adapt your laws to the people in your country.
00:23:09,00:23:10,It does seem to work extremely well there.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Yeah, you said it was 1980..."
00:23:12,00:23:15,"-1997, roughly, yeah. -1997."
00:23:15,00:23:17,"Before that, even in 1987,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,there was a group of ten Taiwanese women
00:23:19,00:23:23,and they started something called the Homemakers United Foundation.
00:23:23,00:23:26,And they were kind of the first group of people
00:23:26,00:23:29,who really wanted to make a difference in Taiwan
00:23:29,00:23:31,"and they were responsible for the yellow trash trucks,"
00:23:31,00:23:34,which kind of started going around Taiwan around that time.
00:23:34,00:23:35,Yeah.
00:23:35,00:23:38,"And now, if you go to a tube station or something"
00:23:38,00:23:41,"or a metro station in Taiwan,"
00:23:41,00:23:44,you'll see these old ladies just kind of picking up trash and putting it in the bin.
00:23:44,00:23:45,It's really cool.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"God, let's hope they never get ice cream trucks."
00:23:47,00:23:49,"Otherwise, they'll realize what fun it's really like."
00:23:49,00:23:52,But they do crazy things as well.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"Like, there's public shaming."
00:23:54,00:23:55,"So if someone hasn't done it,"
00:23:55,00:23:57,"probably or tries to cheat the system,"
00:23:57,00:24:01,"they film them, the CCTV footage,"
00:24:01,00:24:03,"and that gets circulated in their area,"
00:24:03,00:24:05,but they blur their faces because of...
00:24:05,00:24:06,But everyone will know.
00:24:06,00:24:08,-Exactly. -I saw you in that shirt.
00:24:08,00:24:09,That stands shirt.
00:24:09,00:24:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:24:10,00:24:14,"Well, because they have quite convoluted recycling policies, don't they?"
00:24:14,00:24:15,"Which, again, they demand obedience."
00:24:15,00:24:17,"So the recycling truck, I think,"
00:24:17,00:24:20,follows basically behind the garbage truck.
00:24:20,00:24:21,"And you're obviously incentivized,"
00:24:21,00:24:22,"I think, like we often are here,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,to recycle rather than throw rubbish away.
00:24:24,00:24:25,So it costs less.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"You know, it's free for the bin bags and stuff like that."
00:24:28,00:24:31,But there are 13 different types of recycling bin.
00:24:31,00:24:33,And you have to sort your recyclables
00:24:33,00:24:36,into all those 13 different types.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"And if you fail to sort them, you get fine $200."
00:24:38,00:24:41,"I can only think of red wine, white wine and rosé."
00:24:41,00:24:43,You got champagne.
00:24:43,00:24:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:44,00:24:45,But they sing a different song.
00:24:45,00:24:50,"They have a song called ""Any Empty Wine Bottles for Sale"""
00:24:50,00:24:51,"blasting out from them,"
00:24:51,00:24:54,which sounds fun and is an incredibly sad song.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"From a film called ""Puppa, Can You Hear Me Sing?"""
00:24:57,00:25:00,But I recommend looking it up. It's quite nice.
00:25:00,00:25:01,But Fur Release was apparently chosen
00:25:01,00:25:04,"because the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,"
00:25:04,00:25:08,"his daughter at the time, was playing constantly on her piano."
00:25:08,00:25:09,So he just picked it.
00:25:09,00:25:12,You'd think he would want to break from the song
00:25:12,00:25:14,if his daughter was learning it on the piano.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"Oh, maybe she was so bad."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"It was like, this is what it's supposed to sound like."
00:25:17,00:25:20,Even the bin truck can play this better than you.
00:25:20,00:25:23,"But you know, it happens so much, this music around town."
00:25:23,00:25:25,And it actually pisses off a lot of people as well.
00:25:25,00:25:28,Because there's now an app that you can get
00:25:28,00:25:30,where you can see where the trucks are going to be.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"And so some people try to work out where they can move,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,where it happens less.
00:25:33,00:25:37,"Because between 6 and 8 p.m., sometimes four or five times,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,you've got Beethoven just playing in the streets.
00:25:39,00:25:41,"And you're like, oh, my God, it's just so annoying."
00:25:41,00:25:43,And there was this one guy who wrote a blog
00:25:43,00:25:45,who said he was out in the countryside
00:25:45,00:25:47,and suddenly he's hearing the song play.
00:25:47,00:25:50,"And he's like, oh, my God, I can't get away from this song."
00:25:50,00:25:52,And then he realized there were no trucks there.
00:25:52,00:25:53,"And he thought, what is going on?"
00:25:53,00:25:54,And he investigated it.
00:25:54,00:25:58,And it turned out that the local birds started mimicking.
00:25:58,00:26:00,No. Yeah.
00:26:00,00:26:02,And so people started throwing garbage at them.
00:26:03,00:26:04,So he went out to investigate.
00:26:04,00:26:05,And he's got this whole blog where
00:26:05,00:26:08,he's trying to prove that there's a species of bird out there
00:26:08,00:26:09,that is currently mimicking.
00:26:09,00:26:10,That's amazing.
00:26:10,00:26:11,"Yeah, Beethoven."
00:26:11,00:26:13,Imagine when Beethoven wrote that song.
00:26:13,00:26:15,Could he ever have thought that it would translate
00:26:15,00:26:16,then into a garbage truck song
00:26:16,00:26:19,that then got picked up by a species of bird
00:26:19,00:26:21,that would just fly around singing itself?
00:26:21,00:26:23,I think you'd have to explain a lot of concepts to them.
00:26:23,00:26:31,"Just on bins, the dumpster was invented by a man called"
00:26:31,00:26:31,Dempster.
00:26:31,00:26:35,And he named it after himself.
00:26:35,00:26:36,But he got it wrong?
00:26:36,00:26:38,"No, he just named it slightly differently."
00:26:38,00:26:40,But he was an incredible guy.
00:26:40,00:26:41,He was called George Dempster.
00:26:41,00:26:43,He was the mayor of a place in the USA called Knoxville.
00:26:43,00:26:47,And he was an interesting man.
00:26:47,00:26:49,He used to work on the Panama Canal when he was a young man.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"And later in life, he created the Dempster dumpster."
00:26:52,00:26:54,And it was the first ever waste container
00:26:54,00:26:55,that could be emptied onto a truck.
00:26:55,00:26:58,So this was a huge leap forward in taking rubbish away.
00:26:58,00:27:00,Yeah?
00:27:00,00:27:03,"And dump obviously meant still to dump something,"
00:27:03,00:27:03,didn't it?
00:27:03,00:27:05,So that it was a fun pun for him.
00:27:05,00:27:06,He didn't change it for no reason.
00:27:06,00:27:07,He didn't invent the word dump.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"No, no, no."
00:27:08,00:27:10,But he did create the dumpster.
00:27:10,00:27:12,"I read about this guy, Dempster."
00:27:12,00:27:15,And he was the mayor of Knoxville.
00:27:15,00:27:19,And he got into a feud with the editor of the Knoxville Journal.
00:27:19,00:27:22,The editor of the Journal criticized him.
00:27:22,00:27:25,And then Dempster decided that he would get the town police
00:27:25,00:27:28,to follow the editor around towing his car at every opportunity.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"And then in retaliation, the guy from the newspaper"
00:27:32,00:27:35,cropped him out of every single newspaper picture.
00:27:35,00:27:38,That's absolutely amazing.
00:27:38,00:27:40,And then Dempster organized a police raid
00:27:40,00:27:44,that caught the journalist with a large supply of illegal whiskey.
00:27:44,00:27:46,Isn't that amazing?
00:27:46,00:27:48,This feels like abuse of power in a lot of ways.
00:27:48,00:27:49,By both of them.
00:27:49,00:27:57,But then the Knoxville News last year claimed 2020 as its own for Knoxville.
00:27:57,00:28:01,They said that 2020 was a complete dumpster fire.
00:28:01,00:28:04,"So since we invented the dumpster, we know on this year."
00:28:04,00:28:05,That's very funny.
00:28:05,00:28:06,"You can have it, guys."
00:28:06,00:28:08,Do you guys know what the French for bin is?
00:28:08,00:28:09,French for bin.
00:28:09,00:28:11,Is it Poobel or something?
00:28:11,00:28:11,Poobel.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Do you know why it's called Poobel?
00:28:12,00:28:14,Because it's got poo in it?
00:28:14,00:28:15,"No, it can't be."
00:28:15,00:28:15,"No, not that."
00:28:15,00:28:17,It's named after someone called Mr. Poobel.
00:28:17,00:28:18,No.
00:28:18,00:28:21,So many bins are just named after people who invented the bins.
00:28:21,00:28:22,Yeah.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"It's weird, so many people want to put their name to it."
00:28:24,00:28:26,You just thought of all the things you want your name stamped on.
00:28:26,00:28:29,I actually don't know if it was him who did the dubbing on this occasion
00:28:29,00:28:31,because he was the police chief of Paris.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"Eugène, René, Poobel."
00:28:33,00:28:36,And he ordered that everyone had to have a rubbish receptacle
00:28:36,00:28:38,outside their doors in the 1880s.
00:28:38,00:28:39,And they got called Poobels.
00:28:39,00:28:41,And that's where the French for bin comes from.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Wow, that's so cool."
00:28:42,00:28:49,"Yeah, just on words then, Susie Dent wrote this amazing book"
00:28:49,00:28:54,where she showed the slang language that exists within every different culture.
00:28:54,00:28:57,So butchers will have slang terms that they use
00:28:57,00:28:57,that they'll understand.
00:28:57,00:29:02,Police officers and garbage bin workers also have that same thing.
00:29:02,00:29:03,They have words that they know.
00:29:03,00:29:08,"So I was reading about in America, Coney Island Whitefish in New York."
00:29:08,00:29:10,"What would that be, do you think?"
00:29:10,00:29:11,Coney Island Whitefish.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"OK, so Coney Island, there was a big sort of fun fair there."
00:29:14,00:29:16,So lots of--
00:29:16,00:29:18,"You won't get it from that, really."
00:29:18,00:29:19,It's used condoms.
00:29:19,00:29:22,This is what they would call the Coney Island Whitefish.
00:29:22,00:29:24,Disco rice.
00:29:24,00:29:26,"OK, so disco's a fun place as well."
00:29:26,00:29:27,People wear really cool trousers.
00:29:27,00:29:30,With those parties in your pants.
00:29:30,00:29:32,Disco rice.
00:29:32,00:29:32,Maggots.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"Oh, that's fantastic."
00:29:34,00:29:36,"What a great hit, Dancing Rice."
00:29:36,00:29:38,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll buy that."
00:29:38,00:29:40,"If you got air mail, if you were--"
00:29:40,00:29:41,"I mean, this one's quite literal."
00:29:41,00:29:43,Someone throws rubbish at your head.
00:29:43,00:29:45,"From New York, they would throw it from the windows"
00:29:45,00:29:48,into the garbage truck in the open tops and so on.
00:29:48,00:29:49,That's cool.
00:29:49,00:29:50,"Yeah, great."
00:29:50,00:29:52,I love those kind of slang cultures.
00:29:52,00:29:56,"Do you know, we have a rubbish bin called Dame Foodie Dench."
00:29:56,00:30:01,A food bin in this country in Bracknell Forest Council.
00:30:01,00:30:02,Called it?
00:30:02,00:30:03,It's like officially called it.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"Yeah, a rubbish truck, sorry, I should say."
00:30:05,00:30:10,"So, and, but not only this, this is in Berkshire"
00:30:10,00:30:13,"and there are a bunch of trucks, the fleet of trucks they have,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,"they're called Truck Norris, Binderella."
00:30:15,00:30:18,"And then for some reason, just Hank Marvin."
00:30:18,00:30:20,"So I spent a long time looking at him thinking,"
00:30:20,00:30:21,am I missing something?
00:30:21,00:30:22,What is that then?
00:30:22,00:30:24,'Cause like that's slang for being starving.
00:30:24,00:30:25,So maybe 'cause it eats the garbage.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Oh, that's good."
00:30:26,00:30:28,"That's a good, that's a very compelling theory."
00:30:28,00:30:30,"All right, I'll accept that."
00:30:30,00:30:33,But Dame Foodie Dench received a video message
00:30:33,00:30:36,"from Dame Judy Dench, slanking it for the honor."
00:30:36,00:30:39,"She said, she'd never been called Foodie Dench before,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,but it's sort of like you're not being called Foodie Dench now.
00:30:41,00:30:42,You've missed the point.
00:30:42,00:30:44,But she'd never been called Foodie Dench before
00:30:44,00:30:47,and she was very proud of the accolade.
00:30:47,00:30:49,I've got some from Thurwick Council.
00:30:49,00:30:52,They got their school children to name their lorries.
00:30:52,00:30:54,One of them's named after a cult movie
00:30:54,00:30:57,"from the 80s, I think, 70s or 80s."
00:30:57,00:30:58,Okay.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Give us a bit more clue.
00:30:59,00:31:00,With Brian Blessed in it.
00:31:00,00:31:02,"Oh, Trash Gordon."
00:31:02,00:31:02,Trash Gordon.
00:31:02,00:31:04,"Very good, very good."
00:31:04,00:31:06,One of them's named after a footballer
00:31:06,00:31:07,who became a movie star.
00:31:07,00:31:09,Eric...
00:31:09,00:31:10,"Kurt, Kurt, Kurt, Kurt."
00:31:10,00:31:11,Shunt.
00:31:11,00:31:12,Eric Trashner.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"No, no, no."
00:31:13,00:31:15,What about the guy who was in like Lockstock?
00:31:15,00:31:16,"Oh, Vinnie, Vinnie, um..."
00:31:16,00:31:17,Vinnie Jones.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Vinnie Jones.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Vinnie Jones.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"And one of them is named after a male pop star,"
00:31:22,00:31:25,probably the biggest pop star of the last 10 years.
00:31:25,00:31:27,Dustin Bieber.
00:31:27,00:31:27,Correct!
00:31:27,00:31:28,Really?
00:31:28,00:31:30,"Oh, that's amazing."
00:31:30,00:31:31,"Oh, that's good."
00:31:31,00:31:32,Probably on House of Gangs.
00:31:32,00:31:33,Very good.
00:31:33,00:31:37,"It is time for our final fact, and that is Andy."
00:31:37,00:31:39,"My fact is that in 1956,"
00:31:39,00:31:40,the BBC broadcast a magic show
00:31:40,00:31:43,which involved a woman being sawn in half.
00:31:43,00:31:44,"Unfortunately, the show ran out of time"
00:31:44,00:31:47,and it ended before she was put back together.
00:31:47,00:31:49,And the BBC was then inundated with complaints
00:31:49,00:31:51,from people who thought they had just witnessed a murder.
00:31:51,00:31:55,What a way to commit a murder.
00:31:55,00:31:56,It was a... Exactly.
00:31:56,00:31:57,On prime time television.
00:31:57,00:31:59,It was... This was so weird.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"It was on panorama,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,which feels like it must have been a very different show
00:32:01,00:32:02,back in the day.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"This was a magician called P.C. Sorsa,"
00:32:05,00:32:07,who was an Indian magician.
00:32:07,00:32:08,He was born in Bengal.
00:32:08,00:32:11,And he was over.
00:32:11,00:32:13,It was one of his first big international gigs.
00:32:13,00:32:15,He saw his assistant in half.
00:32:15,00:32:16,She was called Dipty Day.
00:32:16,00:32:18,And then...
00:32:18,00:32:20,But the show was running really short of time.
00:32:20,00:32:21,"And it was all live,"
00:32:21,00:32:24,so they just ran out of time.
00:32:24,00:32:26,"And he was sort of standing over her, saying,"
00:32:26,00:32:27,"""Oh, dear, what's going on here?"""
00:32:27,00:32:30,And then the show was just completely out of time.
00:32:30,00:32:33,"So Richard Dimbleby, who was hosting,"
00:32:33,00:32:34,"stepped forward and said,"
00:32:34,00:32:35,"""Well, that's all we've got time for,"
00:32:35,00:32:37,"""so now it's time for the news."""
00:32:37,00:32:39,The phone lines went crazy at the BBC.
00:32:39,00:32:41,The BBC had set up a special phone operator
00:32:41,00:32:44,"to divert calls to with just this poor operator,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,"having to say, ""No, she is fine."
00:32:46,00:32:48,"""No, she is fine."""
00:32:48,00:32:50,"But, of course, the theory is that"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"a PC source I knew exactly what he was doing,"
00:32:52,00:32:55,and he would never have mistimed his trick so badly.
00:32:55,00:32:57,And it was a publicity thing for him.
00:32:57,00:32:58,But what's amazing is...
00:32:58,00:33:00,"So, 1956, right?"
00:33:00,00:33:01,So all the newspapers the next day
00:33:01,00:33:03,"were, you know, girl cut in half, shock."
00:33:03,00:33:05,It was all... It was all properly...
00:33:05,00:33:07,"You know, it was a confusion whether or not this happened."
00:33:07,00:33:10,He was doing a run at the Duke of York Theatre.
00:33:10,00:33:14,"And as a result of this stunt, he sold it out completely."
00:33:14,00:33:16,As if people just needed the answer.
00:33:16,00:33:17,"Like, was she gonna be there or...?"
00:33:17,00:33:19,It was definitely a publicity stunt.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"Like you say, the newspapers..."
00:33:21,00:33:23,"If you look at the British newspaper archives,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,"you can see always, like, woman cut in half and whatever."
00:33:25,00:33:27,"But if you go to the stage newspaper,"
00:33:27,00:33:30,"which was the newspaper for magicians,"
00:33:30,00:33:33,"their headline was, ""Sorsa is publicity magician."""
00:33:33,00:33:35,And it was all about how he was a publicist
00:33:35,00:33:37,and how he'd done this before.
00:33:37,00:33:38,"He was great at that, wasn't he?"
00:33:38,00:33:40,Self-promotion.
00:33:40,00:33:41,"Even from the start of his career,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,"where he started out in Bengal,"
00:33:43,00:33:48,"he called himself the world's greatest magician immediately,"
00:33:48,00:33:50,"before even really starting his career,"
00:33:50,00:33:53,"and shortened it, bizarrely, to TW's GM,"
00:33:53,00:33:55,"the world's greatest magician,"
00:33:55,00:33:58,"which feels like really complicated, weird, non-acronym."
00:33:58,00:33:59,"Well, it's weird to do an acronym"
00:33:59,00:34:02,"where there had to be an apostrophe ""S"" in it, like that."
00:34:02,00:34:03,And he did call himself that.
00:34:03,00:34:06,"He was, ""I'm TW's GM."""
00:34:06,00:34:08,"Of course, he then came over to Europe and everyone's like,"
00:34:08,00:34:10,"""Well, you're not the greatest magician."""
00:34:10,00:34:14,"But his idea was, ""Well, India is the home of magic,"
00:34:14,00:34:16,"""and I'm the best magician in India,"
00:34:16,00:34:19,"""so therefore it's fine that I call myself"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"""the world's greatest magician."""
00:34:21,00:34:23,"But basically, all the other magicians"
00:34:23,00:34:24,"really didn't like him very much,"
00:34:24,00:34:27,and they started writing pieces and newspapers
00:34:27,00:34:28,about how bad he was.
00:34:28,00:34:30,And there was one where they called him
00:34:30,00:34:32,a Pakistani illusionist.
00:34:32,00:34:33,This was a time when India and Pakistan
00:34:33,00:34:36,"had been at quite a lot of war in the previous few years,"
00:34:36,00:34:39,and he felt like everyone was against him.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"Someone who didn't like him was Shriver, Helmut Shriver."
00:34:42,00:34:45,"- Helmut Shriver. - Don't know if he's a relation, but..."
00:34:45,00:34:47,- Uncle Helmut. - Uncle Helmut.
00:34:47,00:34:50,"He was Hitler's favourite magician, wasn't he?"
00:34:50,00:34:50,He certainly was.
00:34:50,00:34:52,"He was the one who, I think,"
00:34:52,00:34:57,"turned people onto this magician, a PC sorcerer,"
00:34:57,00:34:58,"because people didn't like him,"
00:34:58,00:35:02,but then Hitler's favourite magician came along in 1955.
00:35:02,00:35:04,It feels a bit late to be training
00:35:04,00:35:06,on the Hitler's favourite magician label there at that point.
00:35:06,00:35:08,I think maybe he was trying to abandon the label
00:35:08,00:35:11,"at that point, but at least things stick, don't they?"
00:35:11,00:35:13,"So, yeah, people knew he was Hitler's favourite magician."
00:35:13,00:35:15,"Most are mostly taught in Argentina,"
00:35:15,00:35:16,"didn't he, at that stage, yeah?"
00:35:16,00:35:17,It was very successful.
00:35:17,00:35:20,It was very good at making former senior Nazis disappear.
00:35:20,00:35:22,(LAUGHTER)
00:35:22,00:35:24,He performed in front of Hitler.
00:35:24,00:35:29,He once conjured 150 Reichs marks into Hitler's jacket.
00:35:29,00:35:33,He made Eva Braun's diamonds studded platinum watch disappear
00:35:33,00:35:34,and then come back.
00:35:34,00:35:37,"But he was, after the war, he was a first German entertainer"
00:35:37,00:35:39,to get permission to perform abroad.
00:35:39,00:35:40,(GASPS)
00:35:40,00:35:43,"And they said, ""Well, you were part of the Nazi party, weren't you?"""
00:35:43,00:35:46,"And he was like, ""No, I don't know what you're talking about."""
00:35:46,00:35:48,And some people said he was the Houdini
00:35:48,00:35:51,of coming to terms with the past.
00:35:51,00:35:52,"Yeah, right."
00:35:52,00:35:54,And there were rumours that he'd taken
00:35:54,00:35:57,"a lot of the kind of Nazi gold,"
00:35:57,00:36:00,"and so when he died, his widow kind of went back,"
00:36:00,00:36:03,"sort of desperately trying to find where all the money was,"
00:36:03,00:36:07,and all she found was seven keys to seven different safes.
00:36:07,00:36:09,But didn't find the safes.
00:36:09,00:36:11,"Oh, right. Oh, she found the keys?"
00:36:11,00:36:13,"Yeah, she found them all. How did she know they were safes?"
00:36:13,00:36:15,"So they have little labels on them saying ""safe number one."""
00:36:15,00:36:18,"Yeah. But to be fair, I'd have just bought seven keys"
00:36:18,00:36:22,"for a laugh and labelled them ""massive safe full of gold number one."""
00:36:22,00:36:23,(LAUGHTER)
00:36:23,00:36:25,"I thought, ""I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that."""
00:36:25,00:36:27,What is the Houdini of coming to terms with the past?
00:36:27,00:36:28,"I'm sorry, I'm really struggling with this."
00:36:28,00:36:31,Is it someone who manages to escape from the past?
00:36:31,00:36:35,"Exactly. So he kind of, he was part of the Nazi regime,"
00:36:35,00:36:38,"but he managed to convince people that he wasn't,"
00:36:38,00:36:40,so he escaped from his dark past.
00:36:40,00:36:41,Go on in. Look at this CV of mine.
00:36:41,00:36:43,I'm going to make it completely disappear.
00:36:43,00:36:45,Okay. Like that.
00:36:45,00:36:46,"It sort of works, quite a lot."
00:36:46,00:36:49,Do you know that Jonathan Creek was based on a real person?
00:36:49,00:36:51,Really? Was it Alan Davis?
00:36:51,00:36:52,No. Sorry. No.
00:36:52,00:36:55,"No, Jonathan Creek was played by a real person."
00:36:55,00:36:56,"Alan Davis, you're absolutely right."
00:36:56,00:36:57,"Oh, that's how TV works, yeah."
00:36:57,00:36:58,I'm afraid so.
00:36:58,00:37:00,You should get on this TV for dogs thing.
00:37:00,00:37:00,You love it.
00:37:00,00:37:04,"No, he was a magician called Ali Bongo."
00:37:04,00:37:06,And that was who?
00:37:06,00:37:07,"Yeah, he's famous."
00:37:07,00:37:08,"He is famous, yeah."
00:37:08,00:37:11,"David Renick, the writer of Jonathan Creek,"
00:37:11,00:37:13,said he was based on Ali Bongo.
00:37:13,00:37:15,"This guy, PC, what was he called?"
00:37:15,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:16,Sausage.
00:37:16,00:37:21,"One thing about him is that he had a rival called Gojia Pasha,"
00:37:21,00:37:23,who was another Indian magician.
00:37:23,00:37:24,"They were real proper rivals,"
00:37:24,00:37:26,and there was a lot of argument
00:37:26,00:37:28,that maybe Sausage had stolen some of his tricks.
00:37:28,00:37:32,"And there was another magician called K Lal,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,"and he told an author, Lee Seigel,"
00:37:34,00:37:36,"when he was writing about magicians,"
00:37:36,00:37:39,"that Sausage, once bribed a member of his crew,"
00:37:39,00:37:44,"10,000 rupees to sabotage a sawing in lady-in-the-half magic trick."
00:37:44,00:37:46,"That's a risky one to sabotage, isn't it?"
00:37:46,00:37:48,I would just sabotage the rabbit in the hat.
00:37:48,00:37:52,"And yeah, basically what he did is he bribed this guy"
00:37:52,00:37:55,a load of money to make this trick fail.
00:37:55,00:37:57,"And at the last minute,"
00:37:57,00:37:59,"this guy, Pasha, realized what had happened."
00:37:59,00:38:02,And so he ran over and he put his finger
00:38:02,00:38:04,in a little hole in the trick
00:38:04,00:38:07,and managed to stop the blade from sort of going towards her.
00:38:07,00:38:08,"Wait, did he lose the finger?"
00:38:08,00:38:11,"He didn't, but he was badly wounded."
00:38:11,00:38:12,He was like...
00:38:12,00:38:12,What a hero.
00:38:12,00:38:14,"""Cut to the bone,"" they said."
00:38:14,00:38:14,Yeah.
00:38:14,00:38:15,"Oh, my word."
00:38:15,00:38:18,So that's one of the reasons why people didn't like him so much.
00:38:18,00:38:19,"Yeah, I mean, that's quite a good reason, isn't it?"
00:38:19,00:38:20,Fair enough.
00:38:20,00:38:21,Wow.
00:38:21,00:38:23,David Copperfield sawed himself in half once.
00:38:23,00:38:25,"Yeah, I think that was really impressive, yeah."
00:38:25,00:38:27,Did he put himself back together?
00:38:27,00:38:28,Yeah.
00:38:28,00:38:29,Wow.
00:38:29,00:38:30,"Eventually, yeah."
00:38:30,00:38:31,"How did he do that, though?"
00:38:31,00:38:33,"He was, I think it's quite a famous one."
00:38:33,00:38:34,"He's tied to a table, isn't he?"
00:38:34,00:38:37,"And it's just like Goldfinger, where there's something, you know."
00:38:37,00:38:37,It's amazing.
00:38:37,00:38:39,There's a saw coming down towards him
00:38:39,00:38:40,and he doesn't get away in time.
00:38:40,00:38:41,And that's the...
00:38:41,00:38:42,You think you're watching a trick
00:38:42,00:38:44,"where he's going to show you and escape,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,but you don't and he gets sawed in half.
00:38:46,00:38:46,And I think the blade...
00:38:46,00:38:48,Is it very bloody?
00:38:48,00:38:49,"No, it's not at all."
00:38:49,00:38:50,And I think the blade...
00:38:50,00:38:53,But it's a version of the sawing someone in half trick
00:38:53,00:38:56,where it's meant to look like it's a mistake.
00:38:56,00:38:59,"So, David Copperfield, as it's happening,"
00:38:59,00:39:02,"the box is up and this huge, as Andy says,"
00:39:02,00:39:03,"this incredible drill,"
00:39:03,00:39:04,"which I believe was owned by Orson Wells,"
00:39:04,00:39:06,who was trying to get into magic.
00:39:06,00:39:08,"So, he bought Orson Wells's..."
00:39:08,00:39:08,What?
00:39:08,00:39:10,"Yeah, Citizen Kane's Orson Wells."
00:39:10,00:39:13,He bought this big thing off the estate
00:39:13,00:39:14,or maybe even personally from him.
00:39:14,00:39:16,"So, it comes down and as it's coming down,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,the box that he's in flips open.
00:39:19,00:39:21,"So, you can see him laying there and it goes through him."
00:39:21,00:39:23,And that's meant to be the big...
00:39:23,00:39:25,It's meant to be the sawing trick that goes wrong.
00:39:25,00:39:28,"I've just remembered, actually, on QI in series H,"
00:39:28,00:39:31,"we chopped Daniel Radcliffe's head off, do you remember?"
00:39:31,00:39:31,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:31,00:39:33,"And I had to do that in the rehearsal,"
00:39:33,00:39:34,had to pretend to be Daniel Radcliffe
00:39:34,00:39:36,having his head chopped off.
00:39:36,00:39:37,And there was a massive argument afterwards
00:39:37,00:39:41,about whether we would show afterwards that he was fine
00:39:41,00:39:42,"or whether we would just say,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"""Oh, sorry, guys, we're going to have to stop the trick."""
00:39:44,00:39:46,"We should have said, ""Oh, we've run out of time on the show."""
00:39:46,00:39:48,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:48,00:39:49,"That would have got the publicity in, yeah."
00:39:49,00:39:51,"David Copperfield, there's a story I read about him,"
00:39:51,00:39:53,which was he was walking after a show
00:39:53,00:39:55,with a couple of his assistants from the show
00:39:55,00:39:58,and they all got mugged in the street.
00:39:58,00:40:00,"And the mugger went, ""Give me all the stuff that you have."
00:40:00,00:40:01,"""Give me your wallet, give me your..."""
00:40:01,00:40:05,And so the two assistants took out their wallets
00:40:05,00:40:08,and their airplane tickets and their passports and gave it.
00:40:08,00:40:11,"David Copperfield, who also had his phone,"
00:40:11,00:40:14,"his wallet and his airplane tickets on him,"
00:40:14,00:40:17,went into his pockets and then did a trick
00:40:17,00:40:19,where it looked like he had nothing.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"So he was like, ""Oh, I don't have anything on me."""
00:40:21,00:40:24,"And the guy was like, ""Okay, that's fine."""
00:40:24,00:40:24,And went away.
00:40:26,00:40:28,This guy's worth over $800 million.
00:40:28,00:40:32,It would be worse if he pulled out a load of flags
00:40:32,00:40:34,and then all of the pocket sheets and stuff.
00:40:34,00:40:35,Maybe a few dubs.
00:40:35,00:40:36,That would have been so good.
00:40:36,00:40:37,It might be.
00:40:37,00:40:38,You've got to use it.
00:40:38,00:40:40,"I'm sorry, if you've been training to do..."
00:40:40,00:40:42,You've been training for that moment your whole life.
00:40:42,00:40:44,"If you don't, then whip out the tricks then."
00:40:44,00:40:45,When are you going to do it?
00:40:45,00:40:48,"Oh, like carry a sore on you and chop the guy's head."
00:40:48,00:40:49,Like do something.
00:40:49,00:40:50,That's actually going to save your life.
00:40:50,00:40:53,What happened to me in Nuremberg that time when we were on tour.
00:40:53,00:40:54,I don't know if I've said it.
00:40:54,00:40:59,So we were on tour and I was dressed in like a yellow and black suit
00:40:59,00:41:02,"and Andy said that I looked like a magician,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,which in fairness I did look a bit like a magician.
00:41:04,00:41:06,So we decided to put some magic tricks on
00:41:06,00:41:09,and I had this kind of cane that's just appeared from nowhere
00:41:09,00:41:13,and I had like the handkerchiefs that would come out.
00:41:13,00:41:15,"Anyway, we finished the last tour of the gig"
00:41:15,00:41:18,and then I had to go to Nuremberg to see my in-laws the next day
00:41:18,00:41:22,and I couldn't put stuff in the hold so it was all hand luggage.
00:41:22,00:41:26,And so I had all of my tricks with me in my bag
00:41:26,00:41:28,and this like cane that appeared from nowhere
00:41:28,00:41:30,just looked like a bomb basically.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"And so we went through the airport and they were like,"
00:41:32,00:41:34,"""What's this? What's this? These German guys?"""
00:41:34,00:41:37,"And I'm like, ""Oh, oh, it's magic. It's magic. It's magic."""
00:41:37,00:41:38,"And they went, ""What?"""
00:41:38,00:41:40,"I said, ""It's magic. It's magic."""
00:41:40,00:41:41,"I said, ""Let me show you. Let me show you."""
00:41:41,00:41:44,"And so then I did a load of magic tricks in front of them, insecurity."
00:41:44,00:41:47,"And they were like, ""Oh, okay, okay."""
00:41:47,00:41:49,"And I was just about to go and they went, ""No, no, stop, stop, stop."""
00:41:49,00:41:51,"I'm like, ""Oh, shit. What? What? What?"""
00:41:51,00:41:52,"They said, ""Do it again."""
00:41:52,00:41:57,And they got all of the other security guys in the whole of Nuremberg
00:41:57,00:42:00,at a part and they made me do a magic trick in front of them all.
00:42:00,00:42:01,That's really funny.
00:42:01,00:42:04,"It's a frightening place to be questioned, Nuremberg, isn't it?"
00:42:04,00:42:09,"Just while we're on tour stories, on our previous tour,"
00:42:09,00:42:11,we had a guy who was our road manager called Daniel
00:42:11,00:42:14,"and he lives in Wales and just on mugging,"
00:42:14,00:42:16,he was walking home one night in Wales
00:42:16,00:42:20,and he was going under a bridge at a guy walked up behind him
00:42:20,00:42:21,and tried to mug him.
00:42:21,00:42:22,"So he went, ""Oi!"""
00:42:22,00:42:26,And Daniel turned around and Daniel's a really big guy
00:42:26,00:42:30,and he's from America and he's quite an intimidating character
00:42:30,00:42:32,if you didn't see the front of him.
00:42:32,00:42:36,So he turns around and this guy's holding a knife at him
00:42:36,00:42:39,but he looks at Daniel and sees the size of him and the look of him
00:42:39,00:42:41,"and goes, ""Wanna buy a knife?"""
00:42:45,00:42:47,"And Daniel went, ""Yeah, it looks good."""
00:42:47,00:42:51,And he bought it off him for 20 quid.
00:42:51,00:42:53,And he has that knife.
00:42:53,00:42:55,He brought it on all of our tours.
00:42:55,00:42:58,It's what he uses to cut things to put things like this up.
00:42:58,00:42:59,Really funny.
00:42:59,00:43:01,That is it.
00:43:01,00:43:02,That is all of our facts.
