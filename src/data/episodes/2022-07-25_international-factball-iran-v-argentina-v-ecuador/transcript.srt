00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
 Hello and welcome to no such thing as a fish presents international Factball.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:13,100
 This is the only podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of football despite being a football podcast brought to you by the QILs in

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:20,780
 Association with VisitingLin.com. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Freddie Soms, James Harkin and Anarcha Zinski.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,700
 And we're about to play the penultimate match in our competition and it is a triple header.

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:38,620
 A rare football occurrence that doesn't happen too often but is happening right now in which Iran, Argentina and Ecuador are about to battle off in a three-half match.

6
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,580
 So let's begin the first whistles about to go. Match is about to start and it's Iran.

7
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,820
 What's quite interesting about Iran?

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,900
 Okay, what do you think was the most popular TV show in Iran in 2002?

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,420
 Ooh, um, Crystal Maze.

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,960
 Yeah, the answer was Baywatch.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,900
 Really?

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,360
 No wonder David Hasselhoff is so big around the world.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,840
 They're only just hearing about him in certain places.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,480
 Well, this was 2002, so that's what I was going to say.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,940
 Satellite TV first came to Iran and Baywatch was all the rage.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,040
 Wow, is it, is that not quite surprising that it's allowed?

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,660
 I'm not sure how allowed it was actually but yeah, people watched it nonetheless.

18
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,460
 Okay.

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,320
 You know, apparently satellite TV is now banned in Iran.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,840
 Oh, is it?

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,580
 Yeah, because of Baywatch, they took one look at David Hasselhoff and thought this guy is not for us.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,740
 Get the sound of here, yeah.

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,420
 I read that in Iran, the thumbs up, don't do it.

24
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,920
 Really?

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,240
 Doesn't mean what you want it to mean.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,080
 What does it mean?

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,240
 It roughly means, but I like that someone's written this sentence as the rough meaning.

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,320
 Sit on my fallous asshole.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
 That's what someone's put down as the rough meaning of a thumbs up.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,440
 It's the same. It goes for Afghanistan, Nigeria, parts of Italy, and Greece as well, a thumbs up.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,480
 Doesn't mean what we think it means.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,980
 So speaking of the phallic thumb, it has that cemetery, doesn't it?

33
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,920
 On the border of Turkmenistan, it's got the phallic cemetery, which is a big tourist attraction

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
 in Iran now.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,780
 No one knows why it's there, but there are hundreds of gravestones and they're all in the

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,620
 shape of either penises or like breasts or genitals of some sort.

37
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,620
 Oh, I thought you knew me.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,620
 No, it's why.

39
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,560
 It's a cemetery for penises, separated from the bodies.

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,600
 Is it like an ancient cemetery or...?

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,800
 They do know very little research than done, and it was only documented first in the 70s,

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,120
 but I think people look quite nervous about research into it because Iran is a conservative

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,400
 country in a lot of ways and they have this whole massive cemetery of penises hanging out

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
 on its borders.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
 That's amazing.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,320
 Well, the idea of burying a penis that's just out of pride just having a gigantic casket.

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
 A morselium.

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,400
 Yeah, it's a tiny little shrivel thing.

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
 Yeah, exactly.

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,880
 A tiny, tiny little casket.

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,940
 He died on a cold day, what can we say?

52
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,380
 Speaking of body parts, Iran is the only country in the world to have like a regulated

53
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,000
 legal organ trade, and you're allowed to sell your own kidneys.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,880
 It's only for Iranians, though, so you can't go there and buy a kidney, but there's quite

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,120
 a big thing about it because there's a lot of graffiti around the hospitals now and you'll

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,600
 get people advertising their blood type and like a phone number, so you can call them up

57
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,920
 and buy a kidney if you feel like it.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
 Oh, wow.

59
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
 Okay.

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
 There's sort of like an eBay for kidneys.

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,440
 Can we sell our kidneys to Iranians or is it like foreigners bandled together because

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,200
 I actually am not being paid enough by QI, I need something to.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,360
 Unfortunately, it's not for Iranians, no.

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,280
 The LUT desert I like, it's an area of Iran, it's so extreme, the temperatures are so high

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840
 that if you put milk in the middle of the desert there, it won't turn sour because the bacteria

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
 can't live, and so it stays sterile.

67
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
 Wow.

68
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
 That sounds quite useful.

69
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
 That's why I should keep my milk.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,320
 Yeah, your complex would be quite warm.

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,440
 Yeah, and it's a long commute for a cup of tea, but even so.

72
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,040
 Yeah, it's got the highest ever recorded temperature, I think, hasn't it?

73
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
 That's right.

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,960
 159 Fahrenheit or 71 Celsius for the modern among you.

75
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
 Things that are invented in Iran?

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
 Yes.

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 Okay.

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 Windmills?

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
 What?

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
 Really?

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
 Windmills?

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
 Yeah, apparently.

83
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,720
 The oldest known windmills we have are from Iran.

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,240
 Human rights, they are invented by Cyrus the Great, around 500 BC, and what's now known as

85
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
 Iran.

86
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,560
 Sorry, what does that mean?

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
 He drew up the first kind of human rights document.

88
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
 Yeah, code of human rights.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Wow.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
 And also April Fool's Day.

91
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
 Really?

92
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
 Yeah.

93
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,060
 You have the world's oldest wine from, it's actually from 5,000 BC, they've found six, two

94
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,060
 and a half gallon jars.

95
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,920
 It's in a neolithic village in Iran's northern Zagros mountains, but yeah, old is why it's

96
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
 7,000 year old wine.

97
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
 And apparently, it's still quite delicious.

98
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
 Really?

99
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
 Yeah.

100
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
 I think it would be quite vinegary.

101
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
 I might have gone a bit.

102
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
 Yeah.

103
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,760
 Depends, if they kept in the same circumstances as milk, they kept it in the lot, doesn't it?

104
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
 Is it?

105
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
 Yeah.

106
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
 You're right.

107
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
 What's weird is this?

108
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
 Main wine producing region is the Shiraz region, and they produce Shiraz wine, which

109
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,440
 is a white wine totally unconnected to Shiraz wine that we know today, the red wine from the

110
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
 Rowan region.

111
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
 It's not the same grape.

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
 Nope.

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
 Unconnected.

114
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,600
 There are theories about how maybe Shiraz came over from Iran, but it seems like that's

115
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 a myth.

116
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
 Okay.

117
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
 We are vastly approaching half time.

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,960
 So if you have any Iranian facts that haven't been said.

119
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
 Yes.

120
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
 I have a good one.

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
 Go for it.

122
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,920
 They try to make the world's largest ostrich sandwich.

123
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
 Ostrich sandwich?

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
 Yep.

125
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,720
 It was going for a world record for the Guinness Book of Records, largest ostrich sandwich.

126
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,480
 It took two days to prepare the sandwich, a huge measuring tape ran across the length of

127
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,560
 the table, but before they could measure it, people rushed forward to eat it.

128
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
 You're kidding.

129
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,200
 So literally like Guinness is arriving ready to like take this down as a world record.

130
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,360
 They have it on video, but they didn't do the official measure because people let it

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
 before they could do that.

132
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,080
 I've got one last thing that's pretty good.

133
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,360
 It's actually illegal to wear a tie in Iran, because it's, you know, a symbol of American

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,640
 kind of encroachment on the nation.

135
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,240
 You remember Ahmadinejad was very famous for his 3-B suit, and he wore an open neck shirt

136
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
 at all times.

137
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,880
 Got a bit of the North career about it, doesn't it?

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
 Yeah.

139
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
 Yeah.

140
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,080
 Less, less eyebrow than ties.

141
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,200
 Their most commonly sold detergent is called bath detergent.

142
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
 Bath, B-A-R-F.

143
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
 B-A-R-F, yeah.

144
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
 Vomit detergent.

145
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 Yeah.

146
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
 That's very good.

147
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 Okay.

148
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
 There we go.

149
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
 There's the half-time whistle.

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,400
 And now it's time for our half-time show, which comes in the form of a QI quiz brought

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
 to you by visitingland.com.

152
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,520
 And we have two questions for you in this half, and they are starting with you, Freddie.

153
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,600
 My question is, what does Mr. Chicken have in common with David Cameron?

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
 Mr. Chicken.

155
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
 Oh.

156
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
 Okay.

157
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
 And second question, Anna.

158
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,360
 My question is, so Barry is a 4-foot-long.

159
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,960
 He lives in New Key, and he has had a poem written about him by a rabbi.

160
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 What is he?

161
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,480
 Okay, so if you want to find out the answers to his quiz questions, you're going to have to

162
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,760
 stay tuned for the end of the match, where we'll be revealing them there.

163
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,040
 But in the meantime, let's head back to the field for the second half of our match, and

164
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
 it is Argentina.

165
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
 Argentina.

166
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
 Okay.

167
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
 Let's go.

168
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,440
 I'll go in fact.

169
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
 And it's to do with football.

170
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
 No.

171
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,680
 I know I'm very sorry about this, but it's very quick.

172
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,760
 It's that the very first rulebook on football published in Argentina said that a player who'd

173
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,360
 been fouled could choose to accept an apology from the Fowler instead of involving the referee

174
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,160
 in the situation, which I would make all modern football so much more interesting to watch

175
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,120
 a negotiation process going on, an apology, a shaking of hand, and then by the time the

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,680
 referee arrives, they can ask who will make this sort of thing.

177
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
 Yeah.

178
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
 That's my football fact.

179
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
 No more football.

180
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
 Sorry.

181
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,120
 So Argentina since 1944 has had an average rate of inflation of 205%.

182
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,040
 And since 1969, it's dropped off about 13 zeros from its currency, which means the Argentinian

183
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,080
 peso is worth about one ten trillionth of what it was worth back then.

184
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
 Yeah.

185
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
 Really plummeted to the last century.

186
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 That's really plummet.

187
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
 It is.

188
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,840
 It's gone downhill fairly fast.

189
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
 Trillion.

190
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,880
 I've never heard anyone say a trillionth about anything.

191
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,680
 Except in a ridiculous exaggeration context of their five-year-old, used to be the eighth

192
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,640
 wealthiest country in the world, about 1900.

193
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
 Argentina was.

194
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
 Argentina was, yes.

195
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,360
 There's a practice that's arisen in Argentina lately of selling ferrets on steroids and

196
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,000
 disguising them as expensive little dogs.

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,600
 People have been paying quite a lot of money for what they think are toy poodles in Chihuahua

198
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,040
 and they don't have to be ferrets and they're given steroids when they're born to make

199
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
 them bigger.

200
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
 And then they get really fluffed up.

201
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,280
 And if you see pictures of them, they kind of look like a Chihuahua, but they mainly

202
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,680
 look like a really fluffy big ferret.

203
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,760
 And they've been complaints about that.

204
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,520
 I'm not surprised there's been complaints.

205
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,200
 Ferrets are brutally aggressive as well.

206
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,920
 You expect this cute little sweet Chihuahua and then suddenly it attacks your small child.

207
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
 I don't know.

208
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,040
 John Mitchinson, who was on one of these earlier podcasts, he used to have pet ferrets and

209
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,880
 he said they were the best pets you can have.

210
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
 Really?

211
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,000
 Yeah, he said they were very loving.

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,920
 Apparently, when happy ferrets may perform a routine known as the Weasel Ward dance, which

213
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,120
 is characterized by a series of hops and frenzy attempts to bump into things, which is

214
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,000
 the stone hole you want from your new to our very similar to John Mitchinson.

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,520
 I didn't know that Shagua Verre was Argentinian, but did you guys know that he was, he used to

216
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,760
 be a journalist for a rugby magazine.

217
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
 That's cool.

218
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,520
 Yeah, he was a massive rugby union fan and he was a player as well in Bonniserys, played

219
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,680
 for three clubs and he founded a magazine for rugby called Tackle and it ran for three

220
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,360
 months between May and July, 1951.

221
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,600
 He was the sole contributor to the magazine as well as the editor and was accused by the

222
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 police of spreading communist propaganda in some of the articles when he commented on the

223
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,880
 class system in different Argentinian rugby teams.

224
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,080
 Okay, so we're, yeah guys, we're running out of time here.

225
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
 The Weasel's about to go.

226
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,360
 We're heading towards our second half time of the match, there's rare moments.

227
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,880
 Does anyone want to throw anything in before we go to it?

228
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,800
 Argentina has the largest Welsh settlement outside of Wales.

229
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,360
 It's the Chewbut region, it was settled by the Wales in the late 19th century and 10% of

230
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,040
 its population have Patagonian Welsh as a first language and I think about a third of its

231
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,800
 population speak Patagonian Welsh as a first or second language, yeah.

232
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
 And it's got six newspapers and I think two of them are in Welsh.

233
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,040
 It's not weird, middle of Argentina, bunch of people speaking Welsh.

234
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 That's wonderful.

235
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,480
 Alright, here's another fact.

236
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,080
 The male Argentinian lake duck has a 42 inch penis.

237
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
 That is impressive.

238
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,120
 That is getting an impressive gravestone if it's in Iran.

239
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,560
 Okay, so there's the Weasel, that's the end of that half of the three halfed match.

240
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,080
 And now it's time for our second half time show, which once again is brought to us by visiting

241
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,440
 Lin.com and it comes in the form of another question and that's from you James.

242
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,920
 Okay, just one question for this second half.

243
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,560
 The world's first dog show took place in 1859 in Newcastle.

244
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,920
 What was controversial about the winners?

245
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,240
 It was a thorough undroids.

246
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,320
 Okay, well, if you want to find out the answer to that question and the two previous questions

247
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,440
 from the first half half time, then stay tuned to the end of the match where we will be revealing

248
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
 all of the answers.

249
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,640
 Okay, so now it's time to head to the third half of our match.

250
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,480
 Yes, screw you, Matt.

251
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,280
 Yeah, and here it is, Ecuador.

252
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,000
 Ecuadorians prior to 2004 were renowned for being late.

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,400
 According to their own country, their country was like, guys, everyone's way too late.

254
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,800
 And the lateness supposedly cost Ecuador 2.5 billion a year.

255
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:32,160
 So what they did was in October of 2004, everyone synchronized their watches at noon.

256
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
 Wow.

257
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,880
 And this was the mark of the beginning of a national crusade against lateness.

258
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,120
 But you know the crazy thing about Ecuador is nature has its own constitutional rights in

259
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
 Ecuador.

260
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
 Really?

261
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
 Yeah.

262
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,680
 It says that nature has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles,

263
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,600
 structures, functions and processes in evolution.

264
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,760
 Does nature have, like, seats in parliament?

265
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,520
 No, well, this is the thing it has rights, but no responsibilities.

266
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
 It's not good.

267
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,640
 But in return, nature, no tornadoes, no earthquakes.

268
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
 Wow.

269
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
 Wow.

270
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
 That's great.

271
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,920
 Scientists in Ecuador in 2010 looking for new species and they found a gecko so small

272
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,360
 it can perch on top of a pencil and a new species of snail sucking snake.

273
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,680
 Apparently they said that when they went there, you could, if you go to any one spot in Ecuador,

274
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,480
 you can find 20 or 30 species of frog.

275
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,880
 And if you go to the next site over, you'll find a whole bunch of different ones.

276
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,040
 Just loads and loads of frogs in Ecuador.

277
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
 Wow.

278
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,360
 They've also got the world's smallest orchid, which is extraordinary.

279
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,320
 The person who spotted it because the world's smallest orchid is just 2.1 millimeters wide.

280
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
 Wow.

281
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
 Oh my god.

282
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,400
 And petals of one cell thick.

283
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
 That's so small.

284
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,280
 Yeah, but it'd be great, be great excuse for Valentine's Day, wouldn't it?

285
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
 Well.

286
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,840
 When you can say to your girlfriend or boyfriend when they said, "Yeah, I'm going

287
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
 to be on me."

288
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
 And he said, "What are you talking about?

289
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
 But you are forest."

290
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
 Ecuadorian orchids.

291
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:07,520
 Is there a tiny, tiny gecko balanced on top of the tiny orchid, do you think?

292
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:14,160
 Abdullah Bicaram, Ecuadorian president, he released a CD called "A Crazy Man Who Loves."

293
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,960
 It was an actual album.

294
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,720
 After winning his presidency, he once invited Lorena Bobbitt to the Ecuadorian...

295
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,920
 That's a woman who cut off her husband's penis.

296
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
 She was an Ecuadorian woman.

297
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,760
 And John Wayne Bobbitt's wife was Ecuador and she was the one who very angrily lobbed off

298
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,600
 the penis of John.

299
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,040
 Can that also be found in the Iranian graveyard?

300
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
 Well, you would hope so.

301
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
 That would be the star of the future, wouldn't it?

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,160
 The thing about Abdullah Bicaram, who's quite good, is he caused a national scandal by serenading

303
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,160
 the winner of the international Miss Banana contest.

304
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
 Yeah.

305
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 Okay.

306
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,680
 Now, I read that and I can't for the life of me work out why I didn't look into

307
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,280
 what the hell the Miss Banana contest is.

308
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 What is it?

309
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,800
 It's just a beauty contest, like it's just to celebrate bananas and to promote them.

310
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,400
 Miss Banana contest, I definitely want to take it to the next Miss Banana contest.

311
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,720
 So, to be clear, is the winner of the Miss Banana contest a banana or a woman?

312
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
 A woman.

313
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
 It's a woman.

314
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
 It's not another.

315
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
 I know.

316
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
 That would be leading.

317
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
 It would be an even bigger scandal if the president was serenading a banana.

318
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
 Yeah.

319
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,920
 On Ecuadorian politicians and politics in 1967, in the town of Picoazza, in Ecuador, the

320
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,560
 people of Picoazza elected a brown-of-foot powder as mayor.

321
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,280
 It won the mayoral election.

322
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,360
 It was a footballer called Pulvapies and it was meant to be a tongue-in-cheek, PR campaign.

323
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,600
 It was like elect for Pulvapies to get rid of your rancid foot odor and it won the election.

324
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 I don't know how many people know this.

325
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,840
 It may be kind of a boring fact, but you know, in all the Andean countries, it's really

326
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,880
 popular to chew coca leaf, right?

327
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
 It's kind of a stimulant.

328
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,680
 I mean, obviously, it's what you use to make a cane, but it's a big problem because, you

329
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,280
 know, the war on drugs, they want to burn all the coca plantations, but it's also a massive

330
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,720
 part of Andean culture, so they're all still just chewing coca leaf to kind of keep themselves

331
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,360
 awake at night and do whatever.

332
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 Yeah.

333
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,640
 The other Andean delicacy I suppose is guinea pig.

334
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,920
 You can have it in a couple of different ways, but I've had it on a stick.

335
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
 Oh, really?

336
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
 It's nice.

337
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
 It tastes nice.

338
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,000
 I mean, it's like a guinea pig lullipop.

339
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Exactly.

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 The cheeks are the best bit.

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Are they?

342
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Yeah.

343
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,760
 Did I remember reading that there's a painting somewhere of the last supper where they're

344
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
 eating guinea pig?

345
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
 It's awesome.

346
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
 Yeah.

347
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
 I love it when there's the cultural artistic clashes.

348
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,680
 There's an Ecuadorian poet called Jose Joaquín Del Olmeido, and there's a statue of him

349
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,240
 in Ecuador, but it's not actually him.

350
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,480
 They couldn't afford to make a new statue, and so they got a second-hand one depicting Lord

351
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,480
 Byron.

352
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
 Apparently.

353
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,200
 Did he look like Lord Byron?

354
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,520
 It was just another poet.

355
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,800
 No, it didn't look like him.

356
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
 Classic.

357
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,040
 Classic Ecuadorian hero, Lord Byron.

358
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,160
 A couple of years ago, a bunch of young Ecuadorians attempted to enter Senor Buro into

359
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,800
 the election, and Senor Buro was Mr. Donkey.

360
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,280
 He was a donkey.

361
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,160
 Sadly, he was not allowed to enter, but there was a big movement to get him voted in.

362
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.

363
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,600
 The donkey wasn't allowed to enter, but the foot powder was.

364
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
 I guess times have changed.

365
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 They learned from their mistakes.

366
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,760
 Yeah, that was a tough ten-year, you know.

367
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,480
 It wasn't the same election.

368
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
 No, all right.

369
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,080
 That was a missed opportunity, yeah.

370
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,480
 Donkey versus foot powder.

371
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,960
 OK, that's the end of the third half of our match, but before we find out who is come

372
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,960
 out on top as the winner, let's get the answers to our visitingland.com quiz, and we started

373
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,880
 with a question from you, Freddie.

374
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,080
 So the question was, what does Mr. Chicken have in common with David Cameron?

375
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,200
 And the answer is that they've both lived in number ten.

376
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:53,000
 Ah, because, OK, so England, like Mr. Donkey, had a chicken, right for politics, successfully

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,600
 win and presuming?

378
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,400
 No, actually, it was a Mr. Chicken, a guy who lived in Downing Street in the early 18th

379
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,960
 century, and Warpole managed to convince him to move out, so he could take over.

380
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,800
 That was a real political coup.

381
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 Yeah.

382
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,600
 OK, question number two, that was your asanna?

383
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,920
 Yes, so I told you that Barry is four-foot long.

384
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,920
 He lives in New Key, and he's had a poem written about him by a rabbi.

385
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:21,280
 Barry is a four-foot long reef worm, and he was found in New Key Aquarium, who wasn't supposed

386
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
 to be there.

387
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,360
 They saw him poking out, and they eventually had to dig up all the rocks in New Key Aquarium

388
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,120
 and found this hideous reef worm.

389
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,600
 OK, and finally, James, your question.

390
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,760
 Yes, my question was about the world's first dog show in Newcastle in 1859.

391
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,840
 My question was, what was controversial about the winners?

392
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,800
 The winners were judged by Mr. Jobbling and Mr. Brailsford, and were dogs belonging to

393
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,800
 Mr. Brailsford and Mr. Jobbling.

394
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,320
 Ah, very controversial.

395
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,800
 They just knew a lot about dogs.

396
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,360
 That's why they're judging this show.

397
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,960
 Obviously, you know a lot about dogs.

398
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
 That's true.

399
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
 You raise a prize-winning dog.

400
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
 Yeah.

401
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,920
 OK, so that's the end of our quiz.

402
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
 There are no prizes for that.

403
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,960
 However, if you do want a prize, if you want to win a QI book or a T-shirt or hat, head

404
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,560
 over to visit England.com where you can enter a competition to do so.

405
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,800
 And now it's time to find out who has won the penultimate match of our international

406
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 fact-ball.

407
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 Was it Iran?

408
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,960
 Was it Argentina?

409
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,880
 Or was it Ecuador?

410
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 And I am going to go to James.

411
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,160
 OK, I think of those three, I'm going to go for Ecuador.

412
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
 How come?

413
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,320
 Just like the idea of everyone setting their watches at the same time.

414
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,720
 Oh, yeah, to solve lateness.

415
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
 Yeah.

416
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
 Yeah, yeah.

417
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
 OK, well, there we go.

418
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,040
 Ecuador has come out on top.

419
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,840
 And if you heard this podcast and you thought, hang on a second, it should have been Iran

420
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,800
 or it should have been Argentina or hang on who the hell does a three-half match to begin

421
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 with.

422
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,040
 You can get in contact with us to ask any of those questions on our Twitter handles.

423
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,600
 Mine is @Sriberland, Freddie, @FSomes, James, @EggShaped, and Anna.

424
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,080
 You can get me on @Quickipedia or email podcast@QI.com.

425
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,720
 Has to get Anna on Twitter.

426
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,360
 OK, that's it for today's match.

427
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,600
 We're going to be back again tomorrow with our final match of the international fact-ball

428
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
 competition.

429
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,760
 And James, that's going to be the final two countries South Korea versus Ghana.

430
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,720
 OK, so that's going to be a good one.

431
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
 All right.

432
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
 Catch you guys tomorrow.
