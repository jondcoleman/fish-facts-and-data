00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 Hello and welcome to no such thing as a fish presents international Factball.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:13.100
 This is the only podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of football despite being a football podcast brought to you by the QILs in

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.780
 Association with VisitingLin.com. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Freddie Soms, James Harkin and Anarcha Zinski.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.700
 And we're about to play the penultimate match in our competition and it is a triple header.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:38.620
 A rare football occurrence that doesn't happen too often but is happening right now in which Iran, Argentina and Ecuador are about to battle off in a three-half match.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.580
 So let's begin the first whistles about to go. Match is about to start and it's Iran.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.820
 What's quite interesting about Iran?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.900
 Okay, what do you think was the most popular TV show in Iran in 2002?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.420
 Ooh, um, Crystal Maze.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.960
 Yeah, the answer was Baywatch.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.900
 Really?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.360
 No wonder David Hasselhoff is so big around the world.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.840
 They're only just hearing about him in certain places.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.480
 Well, this was 2002, so that's what I was going to say.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.940
 Satellite TV first came to Iran and Baywatch was all the rage.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.040
 Wow, is it, is that not quite surprising that it's allowed?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.660
 I'm not sure how allowed it was actually but yeah, people watched it nonetheless.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.460
 Okay.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.320
 You know, apparently satellite TV is now banned in Iran.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.840
 Oh, is it?

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.580
 Yeah, because of Baywatch, they took one look at David Hasselhoff and thought this guy is not for us.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.740
 Get the sound of here, yeah.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.420
 I read that in Iran, the thumbs up, don't do it.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.920
 Really?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.240
 Doesn't mean what you want it to mean.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.080
 What does it mean?

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.240
 It roughly means, but I like that someone's written this sentence as the rough meaning.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.320
 Sit on my fallous asshole.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.880
 That's what someone's put down as the rough meaning of a thumbs up.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.440
 It's the same. It goes for Afghanistan, Nigeria, parts of Italy, and Greece as well, a thumbs up.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.480
 Doesn't mean what we think it means.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.980
 So speaking of the phallic thumb, it has that cemetery, doesn't it?

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.920
 On the border of Turkmenistan, it's got the phallic cemetery, which is a big tourist attraction

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 in Iran now.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.780
 No one knows why it's there, but there are hundreds of gravestones and they're all in the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.620
 shape of either penises or like breasts or genitals of some sort.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.620
 Oh, I thought you knew me.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.620
 No, it's why.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.560
 It's a cemetery for penises, separated from the bodies.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.600
 Is it like an ancient cemetery or...?

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.800
 They do know very little research than done, and it was only documented first in the 70s,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.120
 but I think people look quite nervous about research into it because Iran is a conservative

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.400
 country in a lot of ways and they have this whole massive cemetery of penises hanging out

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 on its borders.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400
 That's amazing.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.320
 Well, the idea of burying a penis that's just out of pride just having a gigantic casket.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320
 A morselium.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.400
 Yeah, it's a tiny little shrivel thing.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.880
 A tiny, tiny little casket.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.940
 He died on a cold day, what can we say?

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.380
 Speaking of body parts, Iran is the only country in the world to have like a regulated

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.000
 legal organ trade, and you're allowed to sell your own kidneys.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.880
 It's only for Iranians, though, so you can't go there and buy a kidney, but there's quite

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.120
 a big thing about it because there's a lot of graffiti around the hospitals now and you'll

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.600
 get people advertising their blood type and like a phone number, so you can call them up

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.920
 and buy a kidney if you feel like it.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
 Oh, wow.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920
 Okay.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920
 There's sort of like an eBay for kidneys.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.440
 Can we sell our kidneys to Iranians or is it like foreigners bandled together because

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.200
 I actually am not being paid enough by QI, I need something to.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.360
 Unfortunately, it's not for Iranians, no.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.280
 The LUT desert I like, it's an area of Iran, it's so extreme, the temperatures are so high

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.840
 that if you put milk in the middle of the desert there, it won't turn sour because the bacteria

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.640
 can't live, and so it stays sterile.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640
 Wow.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.640
 That sounds quite useful.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.000
 That's why I should keep my milk.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.320
 Yeah, your complex would be quite warm.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.440
 Yeah, and it's a long commute for a cup of tea, but even so.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.040
 Yeah, it's got the highest ever recorded temperature, I think, hasn't it?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040
 That's right.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.960
 159 Fahrenheit or 71 Celsius for the modern among you.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.400
 Things that are invented in Iran?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 Yes.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 Okay.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400
 Windmills?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 What?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400
 Really?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 Windmills?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400
 Yeah, apparently.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.720
 The oldest known windmills we have are from Iran.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.240
 Human rights, they are invented by Cyrus the Great, around 500 BC, and what's now known as

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240
 Iran.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.560
 Sorry, what does that mean?

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.560
 He drew up the first kind of human rights document.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.000
 Yeah, code of human rights.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Wow.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.520
 And also April Fool's Day.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.520
 Really?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520
 Yeah.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.060
 You have the world's oldest wine from, it's actually from 5,000 BC, they've found six, two

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.060
 and a half gallon jars.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.920
 It's in a neolithic village in Iran's northern Zagros mountains, but yeah, old is why it's

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.920
 7,000 year old wine.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.920
 And apparently, it's still quite delicious.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920
 Really?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920
 Yeah.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.920
 I think it would be quite vinegary.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920
 I might have gone a bit.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.920
 Yeah.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.760
 Depends, if they kept in the same circumstances as milk, they kept it in the lot, doesn't it?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760
 Is it?

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760
 Yeah.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760
 You're right.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760
 What's weird is this?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.760
 Main wine producing region is the Shiraz region, and they produce Shiraz wine, which

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.440
 is a white wine totally unconnected to Shiraz wine that we know today, the red wine from the

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.440
 Rowan region.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.440
 It's not the same grape.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440
 Nope.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.440
 Unconnected.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.600
 There are theories about how maybe Shiraz came over from Iran, but it seems like that's

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600
 a myth.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 Okay.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.560
 We are vastly approaching half time.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.960
 So if you have any Iranian facts that haven't been said.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960
 Yes.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960
 I have a good one.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960
 Go for it.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.920
 They try to make the world's largest ostrich sandwich.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920
 Ostrich sandwich?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.920
 Yep.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.720
 It was going for a world record for the Guinness Book of Records, largest ostrich sandwich.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.480
 It took two days to prepare the sandwich, a huge measuring tape ran across the length of

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.560
 the table, but before they could measure it, people rushed forward to eat it.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560
 You're kidding.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.200
 So literally like Guinness is arriving ready to like take this down as a world record.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.360
 They have it on video, but they didn't do the official measure because people let it

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.680
 before they could do that.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.080
 I've got one last thing that's pretty good.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.360
 It's actually illegal to wear a tie in Iran, because it's, you know, a symbol of American

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.640
 kind of encroachment on the nation.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.240
 You remember Ahmadinejad was very famous for his 3-B suit, and he wore an open neck shirt

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240
 at all times.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.880
 Got a bit of the North career about it, doesn't it?

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880
 Yeah.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.880
 Yeah.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.080
 Less, less eyebrow than ties.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.200
 Their most commonly sold detergent is called bath detergent.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200
 Bath, B-A-R-F.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
 B-A-R-F, yeah.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200
 Vomit detergent.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200
 Yeah.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200
 That's very good.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200
 Okay.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200
 There we go.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.600
 There's the half-time whistle.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.400
 And now it's time for our half-time show, which comes in the form of a QI quiz brought

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.400
 to you by visitingland.com.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.520
 And we have two questions for you in this half, and they are starting with you, Freddie.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.600
 My question is, what does Mr. Chicken have in common with David Cameron?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600
 Mr. Chicken.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 Oh.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600
 Okay.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600
 And second question, Anna.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.360
 My question is, so Barry is a 4-foot-long.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.960
 He lives in New Key, and he has had a poem written about him by a rabbi.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960
 What is he?

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.480
 Okay, so if you want to find out the answers to his quiz questions, you're going to have to

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.760
 stay tuned for the end of the match, where we'll be revealing them there.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.040
 But in the meantime, let's head back to the field for the second half of our match, and

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.360
 it is Argentina.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.360
 Argentina.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 Okay.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360
 Let's go.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.440
 I'll go in fact.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.440
 And it's to do with football.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.440
 No.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.680
 I know I'm very sorry about this, but it's very quick.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.760
 It's that the very first rulebook on football published in Argentina said that a player who'd

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:06.360
 been fouled could choose to accept an apology from the Fowler instead of involving the referee

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.160
 in the situation, which I would make all modern football so much more interesting to watch

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.120
 a negotiation process going on, an apology, a shaking of hand, and then by the time the

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.680
 referee arrives, they can ask who will make this sort of thing.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680
 Yeah.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680
 That's my football fact.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.680
 No more football.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.680
 Sorry.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.120
 So Argentina since 1944 has had an average rate of inflation of 205%.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.040
 And since 1969, it's dropped off about 13 zeros from its currency, which means the Argentinian

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.080
 peso is worth about one ten trillionth of what it was worth back then.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080
 Yeah.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.080
 Really plummeted to the last century.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080
 That's really plummet.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080
 It is.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.840
 It's gone downhill fairly fast.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840
 Trillion.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.880
 I've never heard anyone say a trillionth about anything.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.680
 Except in a ridiculous exaggeration context of their five-year-old, used to be the eighth

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.640
 wealthiest country in the world, about 1900.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640
 Argentina was.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.640
 Argentina was, yes.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.360
 There's a practice that's arisen in Argentina lately of selling ferrets on steroids and

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.000
 disguising them as expensive little dogs.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.600
 People have been paying quite a lot of money for what they think are toy poodles in Chihuahua

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.040
 and they don't have to be ferrets and they're given steroids when they're born to make

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.040
 them bigger.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040
 And then they get really fluffed up.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.280
 And if you see pictures of them, they kind of look like a Chihuahua, but they mainly

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.680
 look like a really fluffy big ferret.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.760
 And they've been complaints about that.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.520
 I'm not surprised there's been complaints.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.200
 Ferrets are brutally aggressive as well.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.920
 You expect this cute little sweet Chihuahua and then suddenly it attacks your small child.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.920
 I don't know.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.040
 John Mitchinson, who was on one of these earlier podcasts, he used to have pet ferrets and

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.880
 he said they were the best pets you can have.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.880
 Really?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.000
 Yeah, he said they were very loving.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.920
 Apparently, when happy ferrets may perform a routine known as the Weasel Ward dance, which

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.120
 is characterized by a series of hops and frenzy attempts to bump into things, which is

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.000
 the stone hole you want from your new to our very similar to John Mitchinson.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.520
 I didn't know that Shagua Verre was Argentinian, but did you guys know that he was, he used to

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.760
 be a journalist for a rugby magazine.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760
 That's cool.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.520
 Yeah, he was a massive rugby union fan and he was a player as well in Bonniserys, played

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.680
 for three clubs and he founded a magazine for rugby called Tackle and it ran for three

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.360
 months between May and July, 1951.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.600
 He was the sole contributor to the magazine as well as the editor and was accused by the

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 police of spreading communist propaganda in some of the articles when he commented on the

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.880
 class system in different Argentinian rugby teams.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.080
 Okay, so we're, yeah guys, we're running out of time here.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080
 The Weasel's about to go.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.360
 We're heading towards our second half time of the match, there's rare moments.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.880
 Does anyone want to throw anything in before we go to it?

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.800
 Argentina has the largest Welsh settlement outside of Wales.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.360
 It's the Chewbut region, it was settled by the Wales in the late 19th century and 10% of

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.040
 its population have Patagonian Welsh as a first language and I think about a third of its

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.800
 population speak Patagonian Welsh as a first or second language, yeah.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.120
 And it's got six newspapers and I think two of them are in Welsh.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.040
 It's not weird, middle of Argentina, bunch of people speaking Welsh.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
 That's wonderful.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.480
 Alright, here's another fact.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:18.080
 The male Argentinian lake duck has a 42 inch penis.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.080
 That is impressive.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.120
 That is getting an impressive gravestone if it's in Iran.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:28.560
 Okay, so there's the Weasel, that's the end of that half of the three halfed match.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.080
 And now it's time for our second half time show, which once again is brought to us by visiting

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.440
 Lin.com and it comes in the form of another question and that's from you James.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.920
 Okay, just one question for this second half.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.560
 The world's first dog show took place in 1859 in Newcastle.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.920
 What was controversial about the winners?

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.240
 It was a thorough undroids.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.320
 Okay, well, if you want to find out the answer to that question and the two previous questions

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.440
 from the first half half time, then stay tuned to the end of the match where we will be revealing

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.440
 all of the answers.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.640
 Okay, so now it's time to head to the third half of our match.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.480
 Yes, screw you, Matt.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.280
 Yeah, and here it is, Ecuador.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.000
 Ecuadorians prior to 2004 were renowned for being late.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.400
 According to their own country, their country was like, guys, everyone's way too late.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.800
 And the lateness supposedly cost Ecuador 2.5 billion a year.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:32.160
 So what they did was in October of 2004, everyone synchronized their watches at noon.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160
 Wow.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.880
 And this was the mark of the beginning of a national crusade against lateness.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.120
 But you know the crazy thing about Ecuador is nature has its own constitutional rights in

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.120
 Ecuador.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120
 Really?

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.120
 Yeah.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.680
 It says that nature has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.600
 structures, functions and processes in evolution.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.760
 Does nature have, like, seats in parliament?

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.520
 No, well, this is the thing it has rights, but no responsibilities.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.520
 It's not good.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.640
 But in return, nature, no tornadoes, no earthquakes.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640
 Wow.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640
 Wow.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.640
 That's great.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.920
 Scientists in Ecuador in 2010 looking for new species and they found a gecko so small

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.360
 it can perch on top of a pencil and a new species of snail sucking snake.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.680
 Apparently they said that when they went there, you could, if you go to any one spot in Ecuador,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.480
 you can find 20 or 30 species of frog.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.880
 And if you go to the next site over, you'll find a whole bunch of different ones.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.040
 Just loads and loads of frogs in Ecuador.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.040
 Wow.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.360
 They've also got the world's smallest orchid, which is extraordinary.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.320
 The person who spotted it because the world's smallest orchid is just 2.1 millimeters wide.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.320
 Wow.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.320
 Oh my god.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.400
 And petals of one cell thick.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.400
 That's so small.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.280
 Yeah, but it'd be great, be great excuse for Valentine's Day, wouldn't it?

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280
 Well.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.840
 When you can say to your girlfriend or boyfriend when they said, "Yeah, I'm going

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840
 to be on me."

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.840
 And he said, "What are you talking about?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.840
 But you are forest."

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840
 Ecuadorian orchids.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:07.520
 Is there a tiny, tiny gecko balanced on top of the tiny orchid, do you think?

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:14.160
 Abdullah Bicaram, Ecuadorian president, he released a CD called "A Crazy Man Who Loves."

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.960
 It was an actual album.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.720
 After winning his presidency, he once invited Lorena Bobbitt to the Ecuadorian...

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.920
 That's a woman who cut off her husband's penis.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920
 She was an Ecuadorian woman.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.760
 And John Wayne Bobbitt's wife was Ecuador and she was the one who very angrily lobbed off

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.600
 the penis of John.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.040
 Can that also be found in the Iranian graveyard?

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.040
 Well, you would hope so.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.120
 That would be the star of the future, wouldn't it?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.160
 The thing about Abdullah Bicaram, who's quite good, is he caused a national scandal by serenading

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
 the winner of the international Miss Banana contest.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160
 Yeah.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160
 Okay.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.680
 Now, I read that and I can't for the life of me work out why I didn't look into

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.280
 what the hell the Miss Banana contest is.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.280
 What is it?

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.800
 It's just a beauty contest, like it's just to celebrate bananas and to promote them.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.400
 Miss Banana contest, I definitely want to take it to the next Miss Banana contest.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.720
 So, to be clear, is the winner of the Miss Banana contest a banana or a woman?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720
 A woman.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.720
 It's a woman.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.720
 It's not another.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720
 I know.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720
 That would be leading.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.120
 It would be an even bigger scandal if the president was serenading a banana.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120
 Yeah.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.920
 On Ecuadorian politicians and politics in 1967, in the town of Picoazza, in Ecuador, the

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.560
 people of Picoazza elected a brown-of-foot powder as mayor.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.280
 It won the mayoral election.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.360
 It was a footballer called Pulvapies and it was meant to be a tongue-in-cheek, PR campaign.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.600
 It was like elect for Pulvapies to get rid of your rancid foot odor and it won the election.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.600
 I don't know how many people know this.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.840
 It may be kind of a boring fact, but you know, in all the Andean countries, it's really

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.880
 popular to chew coca leaf, right?

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.880
 It's kind of a stimulant.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.680
 I mean, obviously, it's what you use to make a cane, but it's a big problem because, you

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.280
 know, the war on drugs, they want to burn all the coca plantations, but it's also a massive

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.720
 part of Andean culture, so they're all still just chewing coca leaf to kind of keep themselves

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.360
 awake at night and do whatever.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360
 Yeah.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.640
 The other Andean delicacy I suppose is guinea pig.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.920
 You can have it in a couple of different ways, but I've had it on a stick.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920
 Oh, really?

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920
 It's nice.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920
 It tastes nice.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.000
 I mean, it's like a guinea pig lullipop.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 Exactly.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 The cheeks are the best bit.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Are they?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Yeah.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.760
 Did I remember reading that there's a painting somewhere of the last supper where they're

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760
 eating guinea pig?

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760
 It's awesome.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.760
 Yeah.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.760
 I love it when there's the cultural artistic clashes.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.680
 There's an Ecuadorian poet called Jose Joaquín Del Olmeido, and there's a statue of him

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.240
 in Ecuador, but it's not actually him.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.480
 They couldn't afford to make a new statue, and so they got a second-hand one depicting Lord

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.480
 Byron.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.480
 Apparently.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.200
 Did he look like Lord Byron?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.520
 It was just another poet.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.800
 No, it didn't look like him.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800
 Classic.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.040
 Classic Ecuadorian hero, Lord Byron.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.160
 A couple of years ago, a bunch of young Ecuadorians attempted to enter Senor Buro into

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.800
 the election, and Senor Buro was Mr. Donkey.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.280
 He was a donkey.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.160
 Sadly, he was not allowed to enter, but there was a big movement to get him voted in.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.600
 The donkey wasn't allowed to enter, but the foot powder was.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.600
 I guess times have changed.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.600
 They learned from their mistakes.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.760
 Yeah, that was a tough ten-year, you know.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.480
 It wasn't the same election.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480
 No, all right.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.080
 That was a missed opportunity, yeah.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.480
 Donkey versus foot powder.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.960
 OK, that's the end of the third half of our match, but before we find out who is come

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.960
 out on top as the winner, let's get the answers to our visitingland.com quiz, and we started

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.880
 with a question from you, Freddie.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.080
 So the question was, what does Mr. Chicken have in common with David Cameron?

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.200
 And the answer is that they've both lived in number ten.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:53.000
 Ah, because, OK, so England, like Mr. Donkey, had a chicken, right for politics, successfully

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.600
 win and presuming?

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.400
 No, actually, it was a Mr. Chicken, a guy who lived in Downing Street in the early 18th

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.960
 century, and Warpole managed to convince him to move out, so he could take over.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.800
 That was a real political coup.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800
 Yeah.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.600
 OK, question number two, that was your asanna?

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.920
 Yes, so I told you that Barry is four-foot long.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.920
 He lives in New Key, and he's had a poem written about him by a rabbi.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:21.280
 Barry is a four-foot long reef worm, and he was found in New Key Aquarium, who wasn't supposed

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.280
 to be there.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.360
 They saw him poking out, and they eventually had to dig up all the rocks in New Key Aquarium

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.120
 and found this hideous reef worm.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.600
 OK, and finally, James, your question.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.760
 Yes, my question was about the world's first dog show in Newcastle in 1859.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.840
 My question was, what was controversial about the winners?

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.800
 The winners were judged by Mr. Jobbling and Mr. Brailsford, and were dogs belonging to

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.800
 Mr. Brailsford and Mr. Jobbling.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.320
 Ah, very controversial.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.800
 They just knew a lot about dogs.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.360
 That's why they're judging this show.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.960
 Obviously, you know a lot about dogs.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960
 That's true.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960
 You raise a prize-winning dog.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960
 Yeah.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.920
 OK, so that's the end of our quiz.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.200
 There are no prizes for that.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.960
 However, if you do want a prize, if you want to win a QI book or a T-shirt or hat, head

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.560
 over to visit England.com where you can enter a competition to do so.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.800
 And now it's time to find out who has won the penultimate match of our international

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800
 fact-ball.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.800
 Was it Iran?

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.960
 Was it Argentina?

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.880
 Or was it Ecuador?

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.880
 And I am going to go to James.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.160
 OK, I think of those three, I'm going to go for Ecuador.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.160
 How come?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.320
 Just like the idea of everyone setting their watches at the same time.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.720
 Oh, yeah, to solve lateness.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.720
 Yeah.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720
 OK, well, there we go.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.040
 Ecuador has come out on top.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.840
 And if you heard this podcast and you thought, hang on a second, it should have been Iran

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.800
 or it should have been Argentina or hang on who the hell does a three-half match to begin

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800
 with.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.040
 You can get in contact with us to ask any of those questions on our Twitter handles.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.600
 Mine is @Sriberland, Freddie, @FSomes, James, @EggShaped, and Anna.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.080
 You can get me on @Quickipedia or email podcast@QI.com.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.720
 Has to get Anna on Twitter.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.360
 OK, that's it for today's match.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.600
 We're going to be back again tomorrow with our final match of the international fact-ball

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.600
 competition.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.760
 And James, that's going to be the final two countries South Korea versus Ghana.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.720
 OK, so that's going to be a good one.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.720
 All right.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720
 Catch you guys tomorrow.
