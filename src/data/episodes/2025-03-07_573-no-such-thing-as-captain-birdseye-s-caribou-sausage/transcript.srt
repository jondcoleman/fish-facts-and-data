 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,200
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,520
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,000
 Anna Tyshinsky, and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,160
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,240
 Starting with fact number one and that is Andy.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,680
 My fact is, after the first bridge from Europe to Asia was built, it took 33 years to build

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,400
 the second and 2,453 years to build the third.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,080
 Let's set the scene.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
 Okay.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
 Istanbul.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 Yeah.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
 Yeah.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,360
 Famously, a city between two continents.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
 Europe and Asia.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
 Those are the two.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 Amazing.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
 And it is amazing.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
 It is amazing.

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
 It's a city in two continents.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,560
 It's the only one in the world, I think, right?

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
 Yes.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 Is it?

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,440
 There's like a bit of trivia that says that.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,040
 That's what the Istanbul tourists would want you to believe.

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
 Yeah.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,640
 So that's why I've really got all of the Istanbul sites.

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
 Yeah.

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,920
 And in between is a body of water, the Bosphorus Strait, which links, what is it, the Black

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
 Sea and the...

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,800
 You've got the Sea of Marmara in the middle of Turkey and the Black Sea above it and the

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
 GNC.

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,040
 And then eventually the Med.

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
 Eventually the Med.

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,680
 Eventually the Atlantic, you know?

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,240
 And then eventually the Pacific, if you want to go all the way around.

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
 Yeah.

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
 That's Istanbul.

40
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:43,760
 And the Bosphorus Strait, across it, supposedly says Herodotus, was first crossed in 513 B.C.

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,560
 Because Darius, who we talked about a while ago on this podcast...

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
 Darius the Great.

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
 Yeah, we did.

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
 Darius the Great.

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
 He was apparently pursuing the Scythians.

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
 And it was all a bit...

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
 Yeah.

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,400
 Anyway, the bridge that was built then was a pontoon bridge.

49
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
 Yeah.

50
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,760
 And you had a load of boats together and you'd walk across the top of the boats.

51
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
 And you say load of boats.

52
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
 It's a load of load of boats.

53
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
 Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,960
 Like that's a thousand boats or something attached, because that's a very big distance

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
 to cover.

56
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
 Yeah, it is.

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
 Seven hunj.

58
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
 Seven hunj.

59
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
 We want to be specific.

60
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 Seven hunj.

61
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
 Which Herodotus probably wasn't...

62
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
 What?

63
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
 Seven hunj?

64
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
 700.

65
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
 Is that not a standard abbreviation?

66
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
 700.

67
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
 Oh, my God.

68
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
 Get with it, kids.

69
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
 Yeah.

70
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
 And then the second one was built 33 years later.

71
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
 They presumably thought, "Oh, this is a really good idea."

72
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,200
 And that was slightly lower.

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
 That was the Hellespont, apparently, which is just...

74
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
 Oh, that's the Dardanelles.

75
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,280
 So that's a different part of Istanbul, right?

76
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
 It is indeed.

77
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
 Yeah.

78
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,800
 It's just southwest of the Bosphorus.

79
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,520
 And then 1973 AD was when the first permanent bridge was built across the Bosphorus.

80
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
 Yeah.

81
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
 And what did they do in the meantime?

82
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
 Boats.

83
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
 Yeah.

84
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
 Lots of boats.

85
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,320
 Can I ask, jumping back to the first bridge, they're all boats tied together.

86
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,040
 How long did that last until someone needed their boat back?

87
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,880
 It's a temporary thing.

88
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
 Yeah.

89
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
 It's a temporary thing.

90
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
 I think it's to make an individual journey.

91
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
 Yeah.

92
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
 When you've got an army, you want to get from one to the other.

93
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
 Right.

94
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
 It had one mission, basically.

95
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
 Exactly.

96
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
 Yeah.

97
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
 And you might just rip it up after that because you don't want the enemy to follow you.

98
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
 Yeah.

99
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,440
 But then 1973, Turkey got its first cross Istanbul bridge, and it made a massive difference.

100
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
 Nice bridge.

101
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
 Have you been across it?

102
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
 Yeah.

103
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
 Very cool.

104
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
 Did you go on foot?

105
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
 No.

106
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
 In a taxi.

107
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,880
 You're only allowed one day a year on foot.

108
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
 Oh, is it?

109
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
 Really?

110
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
 It's the marathon.

111
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
 It's when they have their annual marathon.

112
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
 Oh.

113
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
 You're allowed to run from Europe to Asia, which is very cool.

114
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
 That is cool.

115
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
 Yeah.

116
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
 It's awesome.

117
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
 Do you guys know what "bosphorus" means?

118
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
 No.

119
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
 "Bos" means like cow.

120
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
 Mm-hmm.

121
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,880
 It's actually almost forgettable, sort of.

122
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
 Oh, okay.

123
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,880
 So like phosphorus was something...

124
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
 Oh, yeah.

125
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
 It's like lightbringer.

126
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
 So is it cowbringer?

127
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
 Okay.

128
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
 No, it's not.

129
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,760
 It's similar to origin to porous, a channel, or a ford, a cow ford, or in fact, an oxford.

130
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
 It's Oxford.

131
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
 Whoa.

132
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
 Bosphorus is Oxford.

133
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
 Really?

134
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
 Yeah.

135
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,360
 A ford is a very, very, very small river that you could just walk across.

136
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
 Yes.

137
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,040
 And having been across this part of Istanbul, there's no way that has ever been a ford.

138
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
 It was a ford.

139
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,880
 It was a ford in the myth, which caused this, because it was a myth of a woman called Io,

140
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,160
 who was transformed into a bull, and then she walked across the bosphorus.

141
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
 She forded it.

142
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
 Very cool.

143
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,480
 Because, you know, in myth, shit like that can happen.

144
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,680
 Just cow, because otherwise we'll get letters.

145
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
 Cow, sorry.

146
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
 Cow.

147
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 Yeah.

148
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
 Yes.

149
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
 She wasn't turned into a bull.

150
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,400
 Well, one cool thing about the bosphorus is that the water flows in both directions.

151
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,880
 So on the top of the water, it flows in one way.

152
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,680
 And then if you go really low down, it flows the other way.

153
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,520
 And so that means that if you're someone on a boat, you can just float on top and you'll

154
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,480
 nicely float across in the direction of the water.

155
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
 Yeah.

156
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,160
 But if you want to go in the other direction, what you have to do is you get a big rock,

157
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,760
 drop it down really, really deep, and then the current underneath the water will drag

158
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,280
 your rock in the other direction, and that'll drag your boat in that direction.

159
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,160
 Wait, that's not on way anyone traveled that.

160
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,720
 That sounds exactly plausible to me.

161
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
 Is that work?

162
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
 It genuinely works.

163
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
 I mean, wouldn't work with a cruise ship.

164
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
 Oh, as good as that.

165
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
 What size is this?

166
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
 And if you're a fisherman.

167
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 Yeah, okay.

168
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
 Is it done?

169
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
 Well, in history, it has been done.

170
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
 That's amazing.

171
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,240
 These days, I don't think you get those kind of boats around there.

172
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
 But that's very cool.

173
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,400
 But it is an actual river, isn't it?

174
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,440
 And it was the world's first ever discovered underground, underwater, sorry, river.

175
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
 And it's so cool.

176
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,200
 And underneath, it's to do with the salinity going from a salty bit to a less salty bit

177
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,960
 of water, the river underneath the sea.

178
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,880
 The river's got like banks and meanders and all the features that you have in a normal

179
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
 river.

180
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
 A lot of boat lakes.

181
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
 A lot of boats.

182
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
 A lot of boats.

183
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
 A lot of boats.

184
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
 A lot of boats.

185
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
 Yeah, yeah, a lot of banana boats.

186
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,520
 And the shopping trolleys at the surface are nice.

187
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,360
 So the bridges is one way to get across now, but they also have now the underground rail.

188
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,040
 And that started being built in 2004.

189
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,920
 They wanted to build it quite quickly, because one bridge, having that one bridge, was just

190
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,240
 crazy amount of traffic.

191
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,600
 The problem was, is they tried to pick a spot that just wouldn't have any archaeology around

192
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
 it.

193
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 It's hard in Turkey, isn't it?

194
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
 So hard.

195
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 The center of the ancient world.

196
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,960
 Particularly when you've had like, you know, bridges that were made of boats, you know,

197
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,040
 thousands of them, 700, sorry, Anna.

198
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,400
 And so that's exactly what happened.

199
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,440
 They started going down and they started finding all of these shipwrecks that had been buried

200
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,560
 into the ground and they had to pause.

201
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,360
 And so between 2005 and 2013, they were just digging up something like 36 ships that they

202
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
 found.

203
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,520
 They found all this pottery.

204
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,320
 And so after they found everything, they thought it was all done.

205
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,640
 They then said, okay, we just want one more quick look, just one little tiny look.

206
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,720
 And then discovered a 6000 BC, unknown Neolithic dwelling that they had no idea existed with

207
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
 everything down there.

208
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
 And then it just took even more time.

209
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,560
 But I feel a bit conflicted about that.

210
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,600
 I just think we don't owe the past this much.

211
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,720
 I'm sorry to irritate all archaeologists listening.

212
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,000
 We wouldn't know about these things if it wasn't for the fact some brilliant person

213
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 had the idea of building an underground railway, which is much cooler than an old boat.

214
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I'm sorry.

215
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Do you know whose side you're on here?

216
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,160
 And I think this is going to make you happy because I know you're a big fan is Odeon felt

217
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
 exactly the same as you.

218
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,480
 And he said there's a bunch of rubbish pots and pans.

219
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,520
 And the more important thing is infrastructure.

220
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,640
 And I know you guys see I-to-I a lot.

221
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,560
 So I think of myself as the strongman of this podcast.

222
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,680
 And threw himself a pissed off birthday party in the unopened tunnel underneath saying this

223
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
 has to be open.

224
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
 This is enough.

225
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
 This is too much.

226
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,080
 And it eventually was on the date that he suggested.

227
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,840
 A lot of traffic goes through those straights.

228
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,760
 The bus for a straight to the Dardanelles, doesn't it?

229
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:37,440
 I think it's, is it 4 percent of the world's oil goes through there and there's a rule that

230
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,120
 says that everyone has to pay, but it's a very small amount.

231
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,640
 They did some sort of deal 50 years ago and said that one of those there's a toll bridge

232
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,000
 in me where you pay to pay to pay to go across it.

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Like that.

234
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Yeah.

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,880
 It's just one old boy who's collecting to pay.

236
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
 Sorry, Emma.

237
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
 What's entry?

238
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
 Are you living in?

239
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
 What?

240
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
 They exist.

241
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
 They exist in Lancashire.

242
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
 Fair bit.

243
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
 I'm sorry.

244
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,240
 Do you have to pay to pay every time you play five P the one in is to P and that the property

245
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,760
 makes quite a lot of money out of it in a year.

246
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
 It's enough to sustain the property.

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Wow.

248
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,520
 Do you have a role of two P's in your car?

249
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,520
 I actually think if you don't have the two P's they now let you go anyway, but you really

250
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
 should.

251
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
 It's round upon not to.

252
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
 What are they going to do?

253
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,960
 If you're sitting there blocking the two P toll, yeah, eventually it'll cost them more

254
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,200
 not to let you through.

255
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
 You won't be popular.

256
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
 Wow.

257
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 Yeah.

258
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,560
 I have been to one where it's 20 P. Actually, they hiked it to 15.

259
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
 I was really annoyed.

260
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
 Is that what you're about to say, James?

261
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
 They hiked it.

262
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
 No, I'm not.

263
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,000
 But this is what about turn of what is this ridiculous thing you're talking about Anna to.

264
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Yeah.

265
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I'm very familiar with those.

266
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,040
 I'm sorry for comic conceit I wanted to, you know, tease Anna, I wanted to have my cake

267
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
 and eat it.

268
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,160
 But anyway, so Turkey are now building a canal or they want to build a big old canal that

269
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,960
 goes right the way through Turkey so that you can either go on this route that goes

270
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,160
 through the Dardanelles and through the Bosphorus and pay your two P or you can pay more and

271
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,280
 go through the canal, but you know, you get through quicker and you don't have to queue

272
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
 up.

273
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
 It's an amazing idea.

274
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
 It's like double Bosphorus.

275
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,640
 It's like imagine if you had a road where you had to pay two P to go across it, or then

276
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,680
 you had the M6 toll road that went the other way and you can't choose which way to go.

277
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,200
 I think the first person who suggested that canal was Suleyman the Magnificent in the

278
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 1500s.

279
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,520
 And it's been suggested by almost every Turkish leader, Ottoman leader since then.

280
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,320
 But yeah, the ones caught on.

281
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
 Just a quick thing on the Ottoman Empire.

282
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,160
 I don't think we've said before much about the Ottomans.

283
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,620
 So if you became Sultan, the traditional thing to do was immediately off all your brothers

284
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,200
 plus any uncles, cousins, like anyone would just murdered immediately.

285
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,840
 Anyone who could possibly take over from you apart from your son.

286
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
 Exactly.

287
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 But you've got 19 sons.

288
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,120
 And when your son becomes Sultan, he'll kill the other 18.

289
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,360
 And also your main son is cool, but all the other sons are like put in cages.

290
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,600
 They're all put in cages.

291
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
 I thought it was cages.

292
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,980
 Basically, it's a suite of rooms, but they're called the cages.

293
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,960
 And then they change their policy in about 1600 and they said, right, we can't keep on

294
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
 murdering everyone.

295
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,120
 So we'll just keep everyone in the cages.

296
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,040
 And you would be kept there with some, apparently some concubines, but concubines who won't

297
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,400
 have any children so that, you know, you don't present a threat because you're not producing

298
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
 more heirs.

299
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 How do you make sure?

300
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,280
 So it's all sort of post-menopausal concubines?

301
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,600
 I believe, I think that's the drill, yeah, yeah.

302
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
 And you only allowed a few very specific hobbies.

303
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
 Apparently mainly macrame.

304
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
 Making knots.

305
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,420
 It's basically elaborate knot, knot work.

306
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,700
 And then you can tie yourself a rope ladder in it.

307
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
 It's terrible.

308
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,860
 Like they went, another one's escaped Sultan, but by a rope bridge, yeah, rope bridge.

309
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,200
 That's why the multiple attempts at bridges across the Bosphorus are all rope based, none

310
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
 of them survived.

311
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,020
 But every so often the Sultan would die and they'd have to get someone out of the cages.

312
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,340
 And basically you'd have this blithering idiot who only knew how to do macrame and

313
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,400
 not experienced in ruling the largest empire on the planet.

314
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
 So weird.

315
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 Did that happen?

316
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,040
 Did you have the cage ruler?

317
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 Yeah.

318
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
 Wow.

319
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,280
 So imagine you're in the 17th century, you're visiting the Sultan, you're like a big wig

320
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,200
 but from another part of Turkey or the Ottoman Empire.

321
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,960
 You turn up at the Topkapi Palace in the middle of Istanbul, that's where he lives and he

322
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,760
 gives you some sorbet.

323
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
 Okay.

324
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,340
 Normally you get some nice white sorbet, but this time it's red.

325
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,460
 It's strawberry flavour.

326
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
 What does that mean?

327
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
 I'm about to be executed.

328
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
 I'm afraid so.

329
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,460
 No.

330
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
 Yeah, yeah.

331
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,460
 That's what would happen.

332
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
 That's how you find out?

333
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,460
 You see your sorbet?

334
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,180
 I just need to say, I need to say it was sherbet, not sorbet.

335
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,180
 Sherbet.

336
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
 Oh.

337
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,180
 Which is a similar design.

338
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
 Just as nice.

339
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,180
 Yeah.

340
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,180
 But I misread it on my file.

341
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,760
 And yeah, so you would give this sherbet, normally it'd be white with your little lolly

342
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,860
 that you would dip in it and lick it, but now it was the red flavour.

343
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,560
 And so you're going to get executed, right?

344
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
 Yeah.

345
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,280
 But there was a loophole.

346
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:02,160
 You could escape execution if you could outrun the executioner in a 300-yard foot race.

347
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
 Wow.

348
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
 Okay.

349
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,520
 So the executioner who's also a gardener, by the way.

350
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
 Yeah.

351
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
 Oh, so he might be a bit limber.

352
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
 He is going to be limber.

353
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
 Yeah.

354
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
 He's going to be strong.

355
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
 Yeah.

356
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
 He's going to work outside a lot.

357
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
 So how do you do it?

358
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
 Well, you just have to race him.

359
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
 Oh, I thought that was a question.

360
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
 If you beat him, you're fine.

361
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,480
 And if you don't beat him, you're executed and your body's held into the sea.

362
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,580
 See, I was thinking, pretend to eat the sherbet, keep it in your hand as you run, drop it down

363
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,780
 as a trap, let him slip, easy peasy.

364
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,780
 No.

365
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,780
 He's a gardener, damn.

366
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,260
 What you want to do is you want to leave an unusual flower in his path.

367
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,980
 So he can't help but stop and take a cutting for later.

368
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
 Yes.

369
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,620
 No, what you want to do is you want to take him on a path where you come to a 2P toll and

370
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,960
 you go through, but he, having left his change, back at the castle.

371
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 Do you get to eat the sherbet beforehand, just in case you don't live to be able to

372
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
 eat it afterwards?

373
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
 I think you do, yeah.

374
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
 Oh, that's nice.

375
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
 It's a sort of last meal, isn't it?

376
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,040
 It's going to put you off a little bit, though, because you know it's your last meal.

377
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,400
 I don't think you're going to enjoy that sherbet quite as much.

378
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,480
 Are there stats on how many people won or lost against the gardener?

379
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,520
 If there are, they didn't come up in the course of my research.

380
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
 Yeah, right.

381
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
 Fair enough.

382
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
 This was 17th century, did you say?

383
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
 That's correct.

384
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,100
 I was trying to look into anything else that has survived Istanbul from the 17th century

385
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,300
 onwards that we still have today, and I found, if you look at a drum kit on most of the biggest

386
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,300
 bands out there in the world, you'll see on the symbols, a lot of them will say Zildjian.

387
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,620
 There's like four major symbol brands out there, right?

388
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:31,660
 This one was created in 1623 by Evadas Zildjian, and it was a family that were trying to bring

389
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,460
 metals together to create gold, but instead created these amazing symbols and they would

390
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,480
 make little symbols that go on each finger, so you could make it, so as to create noise

391
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
 and war and so on.

392
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,440
 That's not going to be a big noise, the fingers imagine, 10,000 Ottomans.

393
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,840
 So this became a product that they started making, and it slowly over the years morphed

394
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,880
 into becoming symbols that were being used by drummers, and then when the Beatles appeared

395
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,000
 on the Ed Sullivan show, which was seen, probably the most viewed show, I think, at

396
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,880
 its time, Zildjian was on there, and every drummer started taking it up.

397
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
 Really?

398
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,060
 Yeah, it's become the biggest brand.

399
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,180
 This is a Turkish Ottoman family in the 1600s.

400
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
 Yeah, exactly.

401
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
 Yeah, in the 1600s.

402
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
 That's fantastic.

403
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,420
 So that survived into pop, you'll see it at the Grammys, you'll see it everywhere in

404
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
 modern day.

405
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,540
 I just like it when Dan starts a fact, watching the excitement on your face and in your voice

406
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,220
 as you get closer and closer to the Beatles climax.

407
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:32,380
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is My Fact.

408
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,080
 My fact this week is that because he talks so fast, when Martin Scorsese spoke at an

409
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,600
 international film festival, they had to provide an additional translator to first translate

410
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,280
 his fast words into slower words.

411
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,320
 They're still the same words.

412
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
 They're same words.

413
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 You wouldn't know.

414
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
 They sound completely different.

415
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,640
 Does this mean that the event went on way after Scorsese finished talking?

416
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,520
 Because what matters to the audience is hearing the words from the second interpreter, right?

417
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,620
 So you've got Scorsese, who's going to be translated into, let's say it's French, right?

418
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,420
 The French translator is listening to Scorsese going, "I have no idea what you're saying

419
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,740
 because you're so speedy."

420
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,020
 So they brought another English speaker in to listen to Scorsese speak really fast

421
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,180
 and then go, "So what he's saying is in English..."

422
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,020
 Yeah, so that will take twice as long, won't it?

423
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
 Oh yeah, absolutely.

424
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,020
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

425
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
 You could trim it down a bit along the way.

426
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
 You could.

427
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,180
 Unfortunately, Scorsese and his films are known for being break and slice and brief.

428
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,980
 So I'm sure his speech is the same.

429
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,640
 Yeah, this is a very little known nugget that I got from Michael Palin's Diaries.

430
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,000
 So I'm reading his second volume of Diaries, Halfway to Hollywood.

431
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,080
 This happened on the 24th of September, 1980.

432
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,720
 He was out to dinner in Los Angeles with Scorsese and he told them this over a dinner party.

433
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,920
 So I haven't seen that referenced anywhere else, but I had since asked a bunch of filmmakers

434
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,640
 and watched a few interviews and yeah, he's powerhouse when he's speaking.

435
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,640
 It's funny because I wouldn't imagine it because of all his films, they have these

436
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,700
 languorous long pauses and people who speak very slowly before murdering people.

437
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,260
 It's weird to think of him as just like a chipmunk.

438
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,900
 I've never heard him speak, I don't think.

439
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
 No, I mean either.

440
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,700
 He's slower these days, I would say, but he's 80.

441
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,980
 But you've seen him speak, I suppose, James, through cinema.

442
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
 Oh.

443
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,740
 You've heard what he wants to say.

444
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,920
 Yeah, I suppose I have for four hours at a time.

445
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,420
 I thought I'd never seen one of his films.

446
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,080
 I had to look through the whole, I thought I'd managed it because it doesn't, it's not

447
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,320
 my kind of thing, you know, like gangsters and mafia stuff, I don't know what I think.

448
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,480
 No big worms.

449
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,880
 No big worms.

450
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,440
 It turns out I've seen two of his films.

451
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,840
 You cannot get away from Scorsese.

452
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
 I've seen Cape Fear.

453
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
 Oh yeah.

454
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,080
 That's a bit of a stinker and Shutter Island, which is amazing.

455
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
 Yes, love Shutter Island.

456
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 Oh, what a film.

457
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
 So good.

458
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
 I'm interested.

459
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
 Cape Fear isn't a stinker, is it?

460
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
 It's a classic.

461
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 It's a classic, yeah.

462
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
 A bit silly, isn't it?

463
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
 I guess so.

464
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
 Yeah.

465
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
 A lot of our own opinions.

466
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
 Yeah, exactly.

467
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
 Sorry.

468
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,980
 It's not like a classic, grassy kind of movie.

469
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
 No, sorry.

470
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,020
 What I mean is it's a highly garlanded, commercially successful and critically acclaimed stinker

471
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,860
 in my eyes.

472
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,020
 Yeah, but amazing filmmaker.

473
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,900
 So the movies, if you don't know, Taxi Driver, he made, he made, what else did he make?

474
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,020
 Mean Streets, The Goodfellas, The King of New York, yeah.

475
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
 The Irishman, I watched.

476
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
 The Irishman in Recent Times.

477
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,020
 Yeah.

478
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,020
 Raging Bull.

479
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,020
 Raging Bull of Wall Street.

480
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
 Oh yeah.

481
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
 That's a big one.

482
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,020
 Yeah.

483
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,860
 Raging Bull does seem to have saved his life.

484
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,800
 Well, he was a huge, co-caddox, what's it mean, the '70s, and-

485
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,840
 So why he was speaking so fast?

486
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,040
 I think it will have contributed.

487
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
 Yes.

488
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,560
 He had something to do with it, actually, yeah.

489
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,320
 And he just made a film, which actually was a bit of a flop with what's she called Dorothy

490
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,720
 from The Wizard of Oz's Daughter.

491
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 Liza Minnelli.

492
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
 Thank you.

493
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,800
 He nearly died.

494
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,320
 He ended up in hospital and he was really bleeding internally everywhere.

495
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,080
 They thought he was going to brain hemorrhage.

496
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,080
 He said, "I was bleeding internally everywhere and I didn't know it.

497
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,160
 My eyes were bleeding.

498
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,560
 My hands, everything.

499
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,460
 My mouth, my nose, coughing up blood."

500
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,260
 Anyway, he sort of was surviving, but he was very depressed.

501
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,420
 And he didn't really want to make Raging Bull, I don't think, but Robert De Niro, who'd

502
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,780
 made a few films with him, was really keen on it.

503
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,940
 And De Niro rocked up beside his hospital bed with a script for Raging Bull that I think

504
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,180
 had been sort of rewritten, re-drafted and said, "Look, you've got to do this, mate.

505
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,180
 What are you going to do?

506
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,780
 Are you going to sit here and die or are you going to do Raging Bull?"

507
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,540
 And he did it and it's one of the best films I've ever made.

508
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,500
 Another thing he made was a film called New York, New York.

509
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 Yes.

510
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,240
 It's the one we're talking about with Liza Manelli in it, maybe.

511
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
 I think it was, yes.

512
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
 Yeah.

513
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,840
 And so she sang the song theme from New York, New York, which is the one that everyone knows.

514
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
 New York, New York.

515
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
 No.

516
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
 New York, New York.

517
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
 I want to be a part of it.

518
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 Oh, that one.

519
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
 Yeah, yeah.

520
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,340
 There are two songs called New York, New York.

521
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
 What's yours?

522
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,840
 That one's from an old sort of Bing Crosby film, isn't it?

523
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
 New York, New York.

524
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
 It's a hell of a town.

525
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
 Yeah, that one.

526
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
 Something's up.

527
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
 Yeah.

528
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
 Exactly.

529
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
 But no, not that one.

530
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
 So I was teasing.

531
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
 You were.

532
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
 It was real.

533
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 This is my 2P Tolbridge moment.

534
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
 You all right?

535
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
 I feel like a fool.

536
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
 Thank you.

537
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
 Have your money back.

538
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,740
 Well, so the interesting thing about that is that film came out in 1977 and Liza Manelli

539
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,220
 sang the theme from New York, New York and then later in 1980, Frank Sinatra sang New

540
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,740
 York, New York, which everyone thinks like associates Frank Sinatra with New York, New

541
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,740
 York.

542
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,840
 He never sang until 1980 because it wasn't written until 1977.

543
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
 That's insane.

544
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
 I don't know.

545
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
 He was still singing in 1980.

546
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
 I know.

547
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,340
 So all of those times when he's in the rap park and, you know, doing, being absolutely

548
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,720
 mega famous, he never sang New York, New York because it hadn't been written yet.

549
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
 How interesting.

550
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
 Isn't that interesting?

551
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
 That's really odd.

552
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
 Yeah.

553
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,000
 I feel like I've got a false memory of being alive in the 50s and the 60s and hearing him

554
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 sing it.

555
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Exactly.

556
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,400
 I think that like a lot of people who are older would know that, but for me it was really

557
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
 incongruous.

558
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,400
 Yeah, incongruous.

559
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
 He loved his cocaine.

560
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,800
 Massive in Coke in the Coke world.

561
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 Well, he did it a lot, right?

562
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
 Yeah.

563
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,080
 I mean, he did it to the point that there was a film festival he went to in Cannes in '78.

564
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,520
 He was unable to score a Coke there.

565
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,420
 So he dispatched a private jet to go on a Coke run to pick it up for him and bring it

566
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,420
 back.

567
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
 So it was a massive thing.

568
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,640
 And also he made a movie called The Last Waltz.

569
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,320
 So he's quite an amazing director.

570
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,700
 He doesn't just do films.

571
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,560
 He does documentaries and quite seminal documentaries as well.

572
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,000
 And so he's done a Beatles documentary.

573
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Oh my gosh.

574
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 There we go.

575
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Wow.

576
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And let's move on.

577
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,140
 Now we've loved that foil for this fact.

578
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
 Let's plow on.

579
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
 Shall we?

580
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:32,520
 But there was one which was called The Last Waltz and one of the musicians, Neil Young,

581
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,000
 had a bit of coke under his nose and this made it to the film.

582
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,540
 And so they were sitting in the editing room going, "What do we do about this?"

583
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,500
 And he had VFX literally invent a whole new method that's still used in film today.

584
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,780
 They called it the traveling bogey where they were able to knock out the coke from his nose

585
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,260
 by having a thing follow and track the coke all along in the shot.

586
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,100
 So when you see it, the coke's not in the shot, but it was in the print.

587
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,820
 And cinema was advanced as a result of it.

588
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,700
 That's basically a Snapchat filter, isn't it, really?

589
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
 Yeah.

590
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
 Where they find one bit.

591
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,420
 All this is your nose or your ears or your eyes and they can scan and put, make you look

592
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,920
 like a potato or whatever.

593
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
 Yeah.

594
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
 That's a really good call.

595
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
 They should have done that.

596
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
 Just put a potato over his head.

597
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 I think it was Neil Young.

598
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
 Yeah, Neil Young.

599
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,760
 None of this stuff, I have to say, is in the IMDb on Martin Scorsese, which reads...

600
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,200
 Let me just read you a couple of things from it, right?

601
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
 Okay.

602
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,320
 Because I think Scorsese might have written this.

603
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,340
 Despite being known for directing extremely dark and often very violent movies, he is

604
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,200
 known in real life to be a very friendly, polite and mild man person who gets along very

605
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,140
 well with his cast and crew.

606
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,940
 Because so many of his actors win or are nominated for awards, actors are dying to work with

607
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
 him.

608
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,820
 Scorsese rarely uses our rated language in real life.

609
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,940
 I mean, it's just pure hagiography.

610
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
 Yeah.

611
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,860
 There's a film he made recently called The Irishman.

612
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,860
 Yep.

613
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,860
 Which I missed.

614
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,780
 I watched it on the flight to Lanzarote and it was almost the exact length of the flight.

615
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,780
 Nice.

616
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,580
 It's about four hours.

617
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
 It seems long.

618
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,940
 I mean, it is long, clearly.

619
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,120
 But one thing they did there, because James, am I right in thinking people age a bit?

620
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,040
 Oh, I don't fucking remember it.

621
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,240
 It was just four hours of tedious gangster stuff.

622
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
 Well, okay.

623
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
 Basically, people get older and then younger.

624
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,360
 It's the same characters and you're going back in life and then forward in life and

625
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
 then back together.

626
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 That does happen, yeah.

627
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 You know, they're 30 and then they're 80 and blah, blah, blah.

628
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,040
 Anyway, they had to have a posture coach telling people, "No, stop it.

629
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,200
 You're getting up from the chair like an 80-year-old.

630
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
 You're 30 in this scene."

631
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
 Oh.

632
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,520
 Just saying, "No, look, for this scene, you are a healthy fit young man, so can you jump

633
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
 out of it?"

634
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
 So confused.

635
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
 That's very funny.

636
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 That's weird.

637
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
 Another one he did was Hugo.

638
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
 Oh, yeah.

639
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
 Probably my favorite Scorsese film.

640
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
 Embarrassingly.

641
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 The Victor Hugo biopic.

642
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
 No, no.

643
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,340
 It's like a family film about the early days of cinema and stuff.

644
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,340
 Lumiere.

645
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,340
 Is that what it's called?

646
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,340
 Lumiere Brothers.

647
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,340
 Yeah.

648
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,340
 It's a gorgeous film.

649
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,340
 It's a really good film.

650
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,380
 And it was in 3D.

651
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,300
 It was one of the early 3D films.

652
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,320
 And one interesting thing about it is there was a guy called Bruce Bridgeman.

653
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
 Okay.

654
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,960
 He was a neuroscientist, but he had this weird thing where he couldn't perceive depth.

655
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,640
 So whenever he went to, like, let's say he went to a big church in Europe and he wanted

656
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,160
 to admire it, he couldn't really tell what was here and what was there.

657
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,640
 It was all flat to him.

658
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,840
 So he used to walk up and down the church so that the things closer to him would move

659
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
 quicker than things further away from him.

660
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,380
 You know, like when you're on a train and like anything that's really close to the train

661
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,380
 flies past and then the mountains in the background go really slowly.

662
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,060
 He would use that parallax effect to understand depth.

663
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,500
 Anyway, he went to watch Hugo and he put on these 3D glasses and suddenly he could see

664
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,140
 the 3D and when he left the movie, he could see 3D.

665
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,740
 It had fixed his problem.

666
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,300
 Isn't that amazing?

667
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
 That's incredible.

668
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
 That is good.

669
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
 Yeah.

670
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
 So he didn't have to keep the glasses on.

671
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
 No.

672
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
 It just fixes.

673
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,640
 No, it just fixed his 3D and kind of triggered something in his brain that said, "Oh, this

674
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
 is how it works."

675
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
 How weird.

676
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
 Was that in the IMDB?

677
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
 No.

678
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,740
 What is going on?

679
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,800
 Just on interpreters, as this fact was about, it does sound insanely stressful.

680
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,380
 They do have, at the European Parliament, they have to switch every half an hour because

681
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,780
 otherwise they just can't, they get very, very stressed and they can't have mistakes

682
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
 as well, right?

683
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,780
 Exactly.

684
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,060
 They can't have a booth with one other interpreter.

685
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:26,020
 So you seamlessly switch over every half an hour and if you're not on shift, you should

686
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,220
 not eat an apple.

687
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,580
 You can eat a banana.

688
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
 Why?

689
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,580
 Because it's too noisy.

690
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,020
 It will distract your fellow interpreter who's trying desperately to listen to, "Okay,

691
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,020
 James is doing some Foley now and the audience is just listening to this disgusting sound."

692
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
 Wow.

693
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
 That's cruel.

694
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,700
 And if James, you'd had a nana there, it would have been fine.

695
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
 I've actually been eating a banana this whole time.

696
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
 Exactly.

697
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
 Exactly.

698
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,740
 The gestures Dan's been doing have been actually more distracting.

699
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,780
 No, but half an hour, half an hour is about apparently the safe limit.

700
00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:00,660
 And in 2009, Colonel Gaddafi spoke at the UN and his interpreter allegedly collapsed

701
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,420
 after 75 minutes of mental stuff from Gaddafi.

702
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,740
 He just, the interpreter's brain just went into spasm and he had to be helped away.

703
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,380
 He cried out or something like, "I can't do this anymore."

704
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
 Yeah.

705
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,940
 I think that is a problem, isn't it?

706
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,220
 So some interpreters talk about this with translating Donald Trump, which is you have

707
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,140
 certain phrases that he uses that just kind of doesn't make sense.

708
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,840
 But in English, we all kind of let it slip.

709
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,340
 But as a translator, you've got to do it.

710
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,740
 Yeah, you don't translate the words, do you?

711
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,860
 Translate the meaning of the words.

712
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,820
 I think they just suffer from what he actually means is the issue.

713
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
 Yeah.

714
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,220
 What is he actually trying to say there?

715
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,580
 The sentence lasts 20 minutes and it just goes, "Yeah, yeah."

716
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,500
 And I think I can see how it's a pressurizing thing.

717
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,580
 Like a different kind of interpretation is to do sign language, right?

718
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,780
 And we have seen meltdowns publicly where they are often accused of not knowing sign

719
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
 language.

720
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
 I wonder if that's the case.

721
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,700
 So do you remember there was the Obama speech after Mandela had died and the guy just clearly

722
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
 didn't know.

723
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,820
 He still maintains that he does know it, but he was hallucinating.

724
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,300
 And in America, Hurricane Irma, there was a moment where on TV, they were saying, "You've

725
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
 got to be safe.

726
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,620
 There's flood zones you've got to get to, you've got to consider saying in shelters."

727
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,140
 And the guy who apparently knew sign language was just making words like, "Bear monster

728
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,620
 and pizza."

729
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,820
 And he says, "Well, my brother's deaf and I do know sign language, but I just, it was

730
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
 too much."

731
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,180
 I think this is the stress of it.

732
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,020
 My cousin is actually a professional translator, a Russian translator and he was saying the

733
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,700
 stress of it like, "You're fluent, you've been fluent for years and then suddenly you'll

734
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
 have a blank."

735
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,020
 He said he was translating Russian and at one point someone was talking about baking

736
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,540
 and said the word kek.

737
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,900
 And he knew that's a loan word from British, so that's fine.

738
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,060
 So kek means cake in Russian, that's what the loan word they were using.

739
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,740
 He was like, "I know it's a loan word from British.

740
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
 What do I say with kek?

741
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
 I can't get your keks on.

742
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,980
 There's trousers and there's translated cake as trousers and you panic in the moment."

743
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,500
 One thing interpreters all do apparently is they interrupt people.

744
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 Okay.

745
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
 They're nearest to the noise.

746
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,020
 I shouldn't have mentioned this fact.

747
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,020
 I knew.

748
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,420
 I knew it would be you, James.

749
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,140
 If listen, you'd notice I haven't spoken for a while.

750
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,380
 It's because I've literally been eating the apple the whole time.

751
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,900
 Unfortunately, swallowed it just in time to interrupt Andy.

752
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
 Go back to it.

753
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,860
 No, basically the whole thing of being an interpreter is you learn what people around

754
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,060
 you are going to say and you slightly are anticipating the end of a sentence.

755
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,540
 So when they clock off after a long day of interpreting, they go home and their partner

756
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,000
 says to them, "I'm making," and they say, "Chicken nuggets.

757
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I know.

758
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I know."

759
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,700
 And their spouses and children are furious with them all the time because they just will

760
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,740
 not let them finish the sentence.

761
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,580
 Certainly relatedly, I saw a head of an interpreting service who hires people out for like UN and

762
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,420
 stuff, talking about how you do it.

763
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,100
 And he was saying in his video, "You have to be really careful about what distance you

764
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,420
 keep from the person who you're interpreting."

765
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,180
 At first, I thought, "Sure, you just keep the distance where you can hear them."

766
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
 Right.

767
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,860
 But he meant in terms of the time you leave between when they speak and when you start

768
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
 interpreting.

769
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,700
 So, you can't get too close to them as in if Andy starts speaking and I'm interpreting

770
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
 him.

771
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,420
 If I literally interpret after every single word he says, "I'll mess up the grammar.

772
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,060
 I won't be able to predict the end of the sentence.

773
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
 I won't get the syntax."

774
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,780
 Yeah, because Andy might be starting a sentence and then go on one of his whimsical endings

775
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,780
 of a sentence.

776
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
 Exactly.

777
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,780
 You don't have to do that shit.

778
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,420
 Whereas if you're converting Dan, you just mentioned the Beatles, and you trust that

779
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,460
 train will come in.

780
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:32,340
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

781
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,420
 My fact this week is that Indigenous Arctic peoples were absolutely banned from eating

782
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,300
 the surf and turf.

783
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,500
 Now, we said before we went on air, before the mics came on, that neither one's going

784
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,260
 to know what surf and turf is.

785
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:53,560
 Yes, I thought this was a universally accepted cuisine, but Dan, maybe because of his unique

786
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,060
 upbringing and others don't.

787
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,060
 So, surf and turf is basically where you get dumped like a massive lobster next to a massive

788
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,780
 steak or meat and fish.

789
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
 Land and sea.

790
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
 Land and sea.

791
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,100
 I was wondering, can it be like oysters and ham?

792
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,300
 Is that technically surf and turf?

793
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,700
 Where I come from, it's usually scampy and very, very cheap steak.

794
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,740
 Oh, okay, okay.

795
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,180
 Fish fingers in a Scotch egg would technically count as surf and turf, right?

796
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
 Oh, yeah.

797
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
 Yeah, there you go.

798
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,180
 So, there are lots of things that count.

799
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,140
 You can all think of meat from land and meat from the sea and do it yourself at home.

800
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
 Yes.

801
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,140
 Oh, it's a venomless fun.

802
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,140
 God, it's a fun game.

803
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,140
 I don't know.

804
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,140
 I don't know.

805
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
 I think that's debatable.

806
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,340
 Anyway, I don't know if this is still true.

807
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:43,020
 Obviously, there are a lot of Inuits left across Alaska and Canada, Greenland, and the

808
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:48,420
 Yupik people and the Elute people all from that kind of region of the world, all used

809
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:53,940
 to do it, but they've obviously integrated more into the outside world in the last hundred

810
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
 years.

811
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
 So, I don't know if they still do.

812
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,980
 But anyway, it was the idea that land and sea absolutely could not be mixed, mostly because

813
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,820
 you'd really upset the mistress of the sea.

814
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
 And they went to such lengths.

815
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,980
 So, essentially, the only foods they had, 90% of the time, were seal and caribou and

816
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
 fish.

817
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
 And fish.

818
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
 And fish, yes.

819
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,300
 And they could never be eaten together.

820
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,180
 They could never be cooked or stored together.

821
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,420
 In the dark months of the year, so like half of the year, they'd go and live out on the

822
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,420
 sea ice.

823
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:29,060
 And because they're on sea there, the women who did all the sewing were absolutely forbidden

824
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,700
 from sewing clothes because they're made of caribou skins.

825
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,500
 So they'd have to do all their sewing in summer because you can't take the caribou skins

826
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,740
 out onto the sea because that's mixing land and sea.

827
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
 Was that surf and turf?

828
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
 Yeah.

829
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
 Surf and turf.

830
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
 You're allowed to wear the caribou skins.

831
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
 Weirdly, you're allowed to wear.

832
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,220
 Yeah, you don't have to go naked out to the sea.

833
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,740
 You're allowed to wear them weirdly, but just not make them.

834
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,020
 This taboo was so strict.

835
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,180
 So there was one as the thread thing, and you had to process all your caribou in the autumn

836
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,380
 before you then started hunting seal.

837
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,380
 But there was another taboo.

838
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:02,580
 So fish that were caught in rivers and lakes, so trout and salmon, must not be cooked over

839
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,180
 a driftwood fire because driftwood comes from the sea.

840
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
 Oh, wow.

841
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,660
 So that is a land sea taboo where it's kind of fish from the land, if you like, and wood

842
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,660
 from the sea.

843
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,780
 What if you caught your fish in some brackish water?

844
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,060
 I think it's a strong line.

845
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,060
 Is it a freshwater fish?

846
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,700
 Well, a salmon would go in between, wouldn't it?

847
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
 Yeah.

848
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,980
 But as soon as they'd entered, it was like even if the salmon were just 20 yards upstream

849
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,900
 having come from the sea, it's like, no, the sea's out now.

850
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,140
 They're now river fish, it's bizarre.

851
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,220
 It wasn't easy, was it, living the life of an arctic person a hundred years ago.

852
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,100
 You wouldn't have thought you'd be introduced, imagine you were practically starving to death

853
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,220
 and all you've got is a bit of driftwood to catch your caribou on.

854
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,220
 Oh, fuck.

855
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,420
 I guess we're going to die.

856
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
 So interesting.

857
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,380
 Is it one of those things where there's a great reason behind it?

858
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,860
 And actually the religious thing or the mistress of the sea thing is just a justification.

859
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,860
 I don't know.

860
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,980
 You know, like there's a thing where people who don't eat pig products, perhaps, is because

861
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,820
 if you didn't cook them properly, you'd get terrible parasites and stuff.

862
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
 Right.

863
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,620
 And the meat spoils faster in the middle to the sun, so that's why there's a pork taboo,

864
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
 that kind of thing.

865
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,620
 I don't know.

866
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,820
 Could have been like if you take the caribou meat out to sea and like spoil by the time

867
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,740
 you're out at sea or something, but it's lost in the midst of time and now it's all about

868
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,500
 pissing off the sea goddess.

869
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,840
 I was reading a bit about their diets and the stuff they ate and this is about the turn

870
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,020
 of the 20th century, quite a few explorers, memoirs who went and lived with Inuits for

871
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,660
 long periods of time and one guy who was living with the copper Inuits who were off the island

872
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:35,820
 off the north of Canada, said that the only non-meat he ever saw them eat is the half-digested

873
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,900
 moss from the first stomach of a caribou or a reindeer.

874
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
 Oh, Sandy.

875
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,900
 Sounds good to me.

876
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
 Yeah, you would have loved it.

877
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
 I think that's unnecessarily picky by that.

878
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:49,540
 Yeah, it's a thing called rock tripe is what they eat, which is this, it's kind of, I think

879
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,560
 it's more like in the moss, Andy, just to say, but it would grow on the rocks and then

880
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,560
 you would scrape it off and you would eat it, but you had to soak it for long periods

881
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,680
 and change the water a lot because if you didn't, it would basically give you the constant

882
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
 shits.

883
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
 Oh, no.

884
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
 So you had to.

885
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
 Yeah.

886
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,880
 So has it been, if it's in an animal stomach, has it kind of been pre-soaked?

887
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
 That would do it.

888
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
 That would help it, I guess.

889
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,120
 Maybe a ferments a little bit in there.

890
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,560
 Yeah, maybe that's why they did it.

891
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,240
 It's like having your oats pre-milked.

892
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
 Yeah.

893
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,420
 So it came in like, I'm sort of imagining like a meat loaf because often it would be in the

894
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,380
 caribou's stomach and they'd take the stomach out wholesale and it would freeze obviously

895
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,860
 because it's freezing and then you just hack off bits.

896
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,540
 So what you get is a nice mixture of, you know, like if you have a sort of sausage meat

897
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,820
 loaf with like herbs through it, it's like you get a mixture of caribou's stomach and

898
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,820
 moss.

899
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,820
 Yeah, lovely.

900
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,820
 You're frozen.

901
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,820
 Yeah.

902
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
 Very nice.

903
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,540
 Another explorary type who witnessed the way that they ate their food and then transposed

904
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
 it.

905
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,540
 It was Captain Bird's Eye.

906
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,400
 I had no idea about this.

907
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
 What was this?

908
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:55,300
 Captain Bird's Eye basically was out in Labrador for quite a while and he noticed all the

909
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:01,000
 indigenous Inuit freezing their food and then being able to heat it later and it tastes

910
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,560
 really good.

911
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,720
 Frozen food was happening already around the world, but the thawing process was really

912
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
 bad.

913
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,400
 If you unfroze your food, it suddenly lost its taste.

914
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,760
 It was really oddly and the texture of it and so on.

915
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,660
 And he applied the method that he saw the Inuit do to his frozen food company and that's

916
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,140
 what sparked frozen food as a massive industry.

917
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:25,080
 And of course, Bird's Eye today never sell sausages because it's so tough.

918
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,320
 Land, surf and turf.

919
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
 Yeah.

920
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:33,580
 The early caribou intestine and moss was not popular with kids at tea time.

921
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,140
 Oh, you battered that.

922
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,340
 Anyone's eating it.

923
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
 Yeah.

924
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,580
 He noticed that when they've caught some fish and froze it in the middle of winter, it tastes

925
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,880
 way better than when they caught it in like the spring and froze it because it was so

926
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,980
 much quicker that the freezing process happened that it just made things taste better and

927
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,280
 then that made him, you know, do his own version.

928
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,500
 So basically his trick is free stuff really quickly.

929
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
 Free stuff really good.

930
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
 Flash freezing.

931
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
 Yeah.

932
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
 Kind of like flash frying.

933
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
 But the opposite.

934
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
 Wise words.

935
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
 Yeah, wise.

936
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 Humpty mind.

937
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,800
 Another taboo.

938
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,580
 Even if you're allowed to make reindeer based clothing, right?

939
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,300
 In some groups of people, you would match your clothes to the sex of the caribou that

940
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
 the skin came from.

941
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,300
 Cool.

942
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,900
 So men, human men would wear male caribou based skin clothing.

943
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
 Oh, okay.

944
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,700
 Do you think you'd be able to tell the difference?

945
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,380
 I think if I was an Inuit, I would.

946
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
 Yeah, you probably could.

947
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,820
 Yeah, because apparently the skin is a bit tougher and therefore supposedly better for

948
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
 hunting in.

949
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,700
 And the women would use the thinner skin from the female caribou for their own clothes.

950
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
 Really?

951
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
 Because presumably they're, you know, doing the macrame or whatever.

952
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,500
 Again, if you've only got the male caribou and you're freezing to death.

953
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
 I know.

954
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,300
 How rigidly did they adhere to these rules?

955
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,300
 I don't know.

956
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,300
 I don't know.

957
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,540
 One thing is, Franklin, you know, Franklin went on an excision of the North and he got

958
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,580
 trapped and they had no food and stuff.

959
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,780
 He had some Inuit people with him there and he said that when they got really desperate,

960
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,140
 they would eat their clothes.

961
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
 Oh, okay.

962
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,140
 That's not.

963
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,140
 So that's quite useful.

964
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,140
 Yeah.

965
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,140
 And sleds, right?

966
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,140
 As well?

967
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:06,420
 Yeah, sleds were sort of very frozen, they weren't frozen fish.

968
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,420
 I think I remember they weren't frozen fish.

969
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,420
 Some of them.

970
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,420
 Wow.

971
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,940
 Really, really frozen, consistently frozen fish.

972
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,820
 And some of the Alu people, speaking of edible clothes, they had gut parkas.

973
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,180
 So any large sea mammal, their guts are very good for making a weatherproof, waterproof,

974
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,820
 windproof parka out of.

975
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,740
 And some Alu people made robes from sea otter intestine.

976
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,740
 Wow.

977
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,740
 You know that?

978
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,340
 Did your parents ever say to you if you did something bad, they say, I'll have your guts

979
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,340
 for garters.

980
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

981
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
 They were probably alliotes.

982
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,420
 That's where it comes from.

983
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,540
 Because they really sort of had like three ingredients, they used all of it.

984
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:51,460
 So they ate caribou poo, a real delicacy was caribou head and fermented contents of caribou

985
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,740
 stomach and lots of caribou droppings made into a soup.

986
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:59,820
 Could we eat it with our, it was on a plate right now, would I get sick if I ate it?

987
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,820
 You might not be used to it.

988
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
 I might well do.

989
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,820
 It's poo, like we're talking poo.

990
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,260
 I think you'd struggle to keep it down in the first instance.

991
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
 Yeah.

992
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
 Okay.

993
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
 But it's not poo because it's a herbivore poo.

994
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,980
 It's quite different to us eating our own poo, which is really, really bad for you.

995
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,180
 It's like eating a cow pat.

996
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
 Yeah.

997
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,740
 I don't think we're recommending eating any poo.

998
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,740
 Sorry, Emma.

999
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,740
 It's a good job.

1000
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,340
 Captain Birdseye saw the fish freezing thing, not the poo eating thing.

1001
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,140
 Caribou head poo soon, that has not taken off.

1002
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,740
 How different would the world be right now?

1003
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:35,300
 Waitrose freezer section would be an exciting place.

1004
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,900
 There are damn things about whether Inuit people were especially adapted and were, because

1005
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,300
 they're, you know, this stuff about the Mediterranean diet, you know, lots of vegetables, lots of

1006
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,580
 olive oil and so on.

1007
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,780
 People wondered for a long time why Inuit people were able to live on a diet that's basically

1008
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,980
 just fat and protein.

1009
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
 Yeah.

1010
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
 There's no carbohydrate.

1011
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
 Where's the vitamins coming from?

1012
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
 Where's the vitamins?

1013
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
 It's confusing.

1014
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,700
 Almost no vegetation, apart from a little bit in summer.

1015
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,780
 And they do have a few genetic adaptations, it's believed now, which make it easier for

1016
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,660
 them to eat a lot more fat than everyone else and survive.

1017
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,820
 They have slightly bigger livers because they need to make more glucose from protein.

1018
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,460
 They whee a lot more to get rid of all the extra urea that they're taking in in their

1019
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
 diet.

1020
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,460
 Oh, so annoying to be weeing so much when you're in such a cold place.

1021
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,460
 I know.

1022
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,460
 I know.

1023
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,460
 It's bad.

1024
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,460
 Yeah.

1025
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
 They must have a system where you don't need to take things out.

1026
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,820
 There's an otter-gut-tuned system that's...

1027
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,940
 You've got to be like astronauts at that point, right?

1028
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940
 Yeah.

1029
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
 There are lots of...

1030
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,220
 They were genuinely less healthy in other ways, as in, you know, they had lots of hardening

1031
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,860
 of the arteries dating back hundreds of years, just like this, urating mostly fat and protein.

1032
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
 Yeah.

1033
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
 Makes sense.

1034
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,620
 Sometimes they just find a tiny bird, an arctic bird, and they swallow it whole.

1035
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,580
 Skin it and swallow it whole, which I'm impressed you can swallow a bird whole.

1036
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
 This is just what the...

1037
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,580
 Helping is a bird?

1038
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
 Wait a minute.

1039
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,860
 Was there a spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside them?

1040
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,860
 Yeah.

1041
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,300
 Eventually they swallow the whole reindeer.

1042
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,460
 Kiviak is one thing that they do.

1043
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:12,100
 So they get a seal skin, and they fill it with loads of tiny little orcs, little birds.

1044
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
 A-U-K.

1045
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
 Yeah.

1046
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
 Not A-W-K.

1047
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,100
 Orcs.

1048
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,500
 It's a bit orcs.

1049
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,940
 So you have about 300 little orc birds, and you put them in a seal skin, and then you bury

1050
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,580
 it under some rocks and ferment it, and then eventually you eat it.

1051
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,520
 So you have to use orcs.

1052
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,820
 In 2013, there was a load of people from the town of Sierra Palak, and they made Kiviak

1053
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,540
 out of ideducks.

1054
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,700
 And ideducks don't ferment as well as orcs, and a few people died because they need to

1055
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,100
 ferment in the proper way that makes them edible.

1056
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,100
 Silly billies.

1057
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,780
 That's why there are these taboos, is because it's actually really sound food guidance that

1058
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,620
 people have learned through trial and error for centuries.

1059
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,620
 Yeah.

1060
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,260
 I mean, that would make sense for there to be a taboo against eating ideducks fermented

1061
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
 inside a seal.

1062
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,260
 Yeah.

1063
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,260
 Yeah.

1064
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,780
 Do you know what the Scandinavian Sammy use reindeer spleen for?

1065
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,940
 That is like a question for the news quiz.

1066
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:15,620
 So this week, one of the Sammy people of the Arctic been doing with reindeer spleen.

1067
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,620
 Santa sacks?

1068
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,100
 Oh, very nice.

1069
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,180
 It is Dewey, but it's for a particular group of people in your civilization tweets.

1070
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
 Well, babies.

1071
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
 Got any one?

1072
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
 Oh, nice.

1073
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,180
 So they're easy to suck on.

1074
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,980
 They're slightly a sort of training food.

1075
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,980
 Okay.

1076
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,980
 Spleen.

1077
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,980
 That makes sense because a lot of the food that people were eating was just solid frozen.

1078
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,860
 Even though you were saying they sometimes thawed it, very often they just didn't have

1079
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,100
 the equipment to make a fire, big enough to thaw it.

1080
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,500
 So and it's so hard for a newborn baby to chow down on a massive frozen chunk of raw

1081
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
 meat.

1082
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
 So frozen jerky.

1083
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,540
 Not the reason why very little baby food is frozen jerky.

1084
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,540
 Yeah.

1085
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
 Yeah.

1086
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,020
 But yeah, reindeer spleen is apparently good for your tot.

1087
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,020
 Well, there you go.

1088
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:01,260
 And if you run out of those little Ella pouches, that's something to consider.

1089
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:09,620
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

1090
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,620
 Okay.

1091
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,960
 My fact this week is that men can have three penises without knowing it.

1092
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,220
 So I checked.

1093
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
 And yeah.

1094
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
 Surprise.

1095
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
 Yeah.

1096
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220
 Surprise.

1097
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,540
 And then they have the normal four, the normal five.

1098
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,540
 Yeah.

1099
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,700
 This is very interesting, isn't it?

1100
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,940
 Because they're not obvious.

1101
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,580
 No, they're not.

1102
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,380
 They're hidden inside your body.

1103
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,900
 This was a thing called trifalia.

1104
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,040
 And it was only seen in a human for the first time in 2020 in a newborn baby.

1105
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,960
 But then in 2024, I think, or 2023, there was a recent study from the University of Birmingham

1106
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,780
 Medical School where they dissected a 78-year-old man who donated his body to science and found

1107
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,900
 that he had an extra two penises hidden up there.

1108
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,900
 Yeah.

1109
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
 It's hidden inside.

1110
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,900
 And they were inside his scrotum.

1111
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,900
 Yeah.

1112
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
 So they were small.

1113
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
 They were really, really small.

1114
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,820
 Well, let's not judge, honey.

1115
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,820
 Okay.

1116
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,820
 Yeah.

1117
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,820
 They were really small.

1118
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:15,540
 And they kind of, they attached to his normal penis, like the urethra kind of went through.

1119
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,080
 They said that there was no dead end.

1120
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:24,000
 So if you imagine, like, if the urine had not had a real, just a straight place to go,

1121
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,840
 then he might have got a lot of urine infections and stuff like that.

1122
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,040
 But actually, it seemed like mostly everything was kind of fine there.

1123
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,360
 He might have experienced some pain during sex if he got some internal erections and

1124
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
 wondering what that was.

1125
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
 That's ironic, isn't it?

1126
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
 Yeah.

1127
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,840
 Well, your free penises might make sex less pleasant.

1128
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
 That's, you know.

1129
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
 That is ironic.

1130
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
 You think it would have the opposite effect.

1131
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
 Yeah.

1132
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,140
 Seven thousand spoons when all you need is a knife, isn't it?

1133
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,140
 Right.

1134
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,140
 Free penises when all you need is a good chag.

1135
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,140
 Okay.

1136
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,580
 They were called two small, super-numerary penises stacked in a sagittal orientation

1137
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,340
 posterior inferiorly to the primary penis.

1138
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,340
 Lovely stuff.

1139
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,340
 Right.

1140
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,340
 Sexy.

1141
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,340
 Yeah.

1142
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
 And one was more of a main one, wasn't it?

1143
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
 Yeah.

1144
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
 He had one.

1145
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
 He had one main penis.

1146
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
 Oh, sorry.

1147
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
 Sorry.

1148
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,340
 He had the main main one.

1149
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,340
 The big guy.

1150
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
 And then he had two.

1151
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
 The big guy.

1152
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
 The big guy.

1153
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,840
 The sweet old guy.

1154
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,840
 The good enough guy.

1155
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,840
 I didn't actually really know the layout, the structure of the penis very well until

1156
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
 this.

1157
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,720
 So you've got these two bodies of tissue, one on top and one underneath.

1158
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,160
 The corpus cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum, the urethra runs through the middle.

1159
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,840
 And so in his mini penises, he had those spongy bits as well.

1160
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,800
 And in the secondary penis, the second main one, the stand-in, the urethra actually did

1161
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,480
 still run through the middle of that.

1162
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,480
 Yeah.

1163
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,660
 And then the second main one, the urethra didn't even bother, just skipped it out.

1164
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,180
 But it was so small that it didn't really matter.

1165
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,180
 Yeah.

1166
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,860
 But the corpus cavernosa is the bit that fills up with the blood.

1167
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,420
 That's the, I think we might have mentioned it before.

1168
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,820
 That's the bit that fills the blood, which allows you to have an erection.

1169
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,820
 Yeah.

1170
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,820
 Yeah.

1171
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,820
 Let's look at this guy.

1172
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,820
 This is quite recent news.

1173
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,820
 Oh, yeah.

1174
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,820
 He's lived a long life, 78 years.

1175
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,340
 He's probably had chats with his family as he's going, "What do you think I'll be remembered

1176
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,340
 for?

1177
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,340
 What do you think they'll talk about me?"

1178
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,740
 He's got one of his kids sat there and his two tiny kids sat next to him.

1179
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:15,800
 I just think what a great tragedy he never knew.

1180
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
 Yeah.

1181
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
 I know.

1182
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
 Yeah.

1183
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
 Exactly, right?

1184
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
 So sad.

1185
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
 You'd want to know.

1186
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
 Yeah.

1187
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
 I mean, who knows what everyone listening to this podcast will have?

1188
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,880
 People might have extra fingers or extra, also you can get extra nipples, can't you?

1189
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,760
 But really subtle ones that you can barely tell that they're there.

1190
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
 Yeah.

1191
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,760
 Yeah.

1192
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,760
 So, you know, there's all sorts you can have.

1193
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
 Well, these things are quite rare.

1194
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,720
 And I was thinking about it would be good if we were more likely to have some of these

1195
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
 interesting extra body parts.

1196
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,720
 Yeah.

1197
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
 So, I was looking at the more likely ones.

1198
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,020
 And, you know, the 20% of people, maybe up to 30%, estimates vary, have an extra spleen.

1199
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,140
 Oh, that would be useful when we're feeding our kids.

1200
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,140
 Yeah.

1201
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,140
 Is that right?

1202
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,140
 Yeah.

1203
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,620
 The splinunculi, an extra spleen.

1204
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,620
 Yeah.

1205
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,620
 And it's a little accessory spleen.

1206
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:01,020
 They tend to be very small and quite near your main spleen.

1207
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,020
 And yeah.

1208
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,020
 I think we don't really know why.

1209
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,420
 I think they think it's often you'll get a little injured or bumped when you're younger

1210
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,860
 and it'll split off from the main spleen.

1211
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,560
 So, this isn't done in the womb, it's not the fetus that causes it.

1212
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
 I don't think so.

1213
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
 No, it's not.

1214
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,240
 So, there was a guy who was playing Ultimate Frisbee one day.

1215
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,240
 He was slightly injured.

1216
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,240
 He rupted his spleen.

1217
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,240
 So, not good.

1218
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,880
 And the doctors who operated on him later said, "By the way, you know about all your other

1219
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880
 spleens?"

1220
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,880
 And he didn't.

1221
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,440
 And so, the spleen, it sort of filters out damaged red blood cells and it's very, very

1222
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440
 useful.

1223
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,440
 Although, it's not crucial.

1224
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,680
 A lot of people have a spleen off and it's fine.

1225
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,680
 Yes.

1226
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,680
 That's true.

1227
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,440
 But it has a role in the immune system and things like that.

1228
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,240
 And it's, as you say, it's not essential.

1229
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,820
 But if it's hurt, bits of it splinter off through the body and it depends where they

1230
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,820
 land.

1231
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,540
 So, if they land somewhere with a good blood supply, they will grow into another micro

1232
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,540
 spleen.

1233
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,420
 And sometimes, if you're having your spleen out, the doctors will just chop it up and

1234
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,500
 hope a new one grows somewhere in you, like chopping up a worm, basically.

1235
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,220
 Oh, does that actually, I thought they didn't know if that worked yet.

1236
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,220
 I said they hope.

1237
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,220
 I didn't say they guarantee it.

1238
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,220
 They hope.

1239
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:05,180
 Because something else that I also read weirdly, conversely, is if you're having a splinectomy,

1240
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,920
 which is like if you've got blood disorder or something, you have to have your spleen

1241
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
 out.

1242
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,620
 The doctors have to know if you've got an extra spleen, because if your main spleen's

1243
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,400
 malfunctioning, your tiny extra one will also be malfunctioning somewhere.

1244
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,000
 So you have the main one out, but, you know, the malfunction will stay.

1245
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,080
 So you've got to search the whole, but you've got to open up someone's entire body and search.

1246
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,080
 Yeah.

1247
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,560
 There's another thing which is called the LRP5 gene, which when it has a mutation,

1248
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,920
 bones have a higher density about them.

1249
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,880
 So they've noticed that there are people who just can't break their bones.

1250
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,380
 Obviously if you really, really went for it, ultimately it could break, but in a situation

1251
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,380
 where most people would break their bones, they would just not have a crack.

1252
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,580
 And it seems to happen a lot in America, in Connecticut, who people have been identified.

1253
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,700
 So something's going on.

1254
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,900
 The mutation is passing through genetically.

1255
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,700
 But one of the symptoms where you could know that you have this is difficulty staying afloat

1256
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,700
 while swimming.

1257
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,700
 Anna.

1258
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,700
 Anna.

1259
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
 Dun, dun, dun.

1260
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,380
 The only person we know to sink in the Dead Sea.

1261
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,380
 Oh my God.

1262
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,960
 And my mum was so weirdly close to that guy from Connecticut, who used to visit all the

1263
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,720
 time when I was a kid.

1264
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,720
 That's amazing.

1265
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,280
 Have you ever broken a bone?

1266
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,280
 No.

1267
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,560
 Oh no, I've broken loads of bones.

1268
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,760
 Only small ones though.

1269
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,760
 Like wrist bones and my jaw.

1270
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,760
 I think it would count.

1271
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,760
 It still can't damage.

1272
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,760
 Good job.

1273
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,760
 Only the minor ones.

1274
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,600
 You were with me when I broke my jaw in fact, weren't you?

1275
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
 Yes.

1276
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,600
 I don't get any more facts wrong on QI.

1277
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
 Wow.

1278
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:36,060
 It's a top shipping run, guys.

1279
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,420
 There was an interesting thing in 2020, which is the first medical case I think of someone

1280
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:45,020
 who was shot in the chest but survived because his heart was on the opposite side of his

1281
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,260
 body to most people.

1282
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,260
 Brilliant.

1283
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,260
 Cool.

1284
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,620
 It actually happened.

1285
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:54,740
 So this is a thing called cytosine versus where all of your organs are on the wrong side.

1286
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:59,940
 There's about one in 6,000 to 12,000 people have it, but most people would never know

1287
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,360
 they had it.

1288
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:07,120
 But what's kind of interesting is Dr. No had it in the novel, in the James Bond novel.

1289
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,520
 And he was shot in the wrong side of his body just like this guy in the medical literature

1290
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,760
 a few years ago.

1291
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,640
 He survived and he got a God complex because he thought this makes me special and that's

1292
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,120
 why he became such a bad guy.

1293
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,120
 Oh, sorry.

1294
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,120
 Dr. No did.

1295
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
 Not the other guy.

1296
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,320
 Did Dr. No think his heart was in the right place then?

1297
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,320
 No.

1298
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
 And that's where the saying comes from.

1299
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,780
 No, he knew that, like the doctors told him and he was like, that makes me special.

1300
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,100
 So I should take off the world.

1301
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,140
 That has been used in a few plot points.

1302
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,260
 I remember my dad and I watching a movie and him explaining to me because a lady shoots

1303
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,140
 a man in the chest and leads him to die, but she shot him.

1304
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,140
 She knows.

1305
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,140
 And it's love.

1306
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,740
 Your heart is quite near the middle, isn't it?

1307
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,740
 Yeah.

1308
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,780
 It's nearer the middle than we all think, which is just out of the left nipple.

1309
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,780
 Yeah.

1310
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,780
 It's got to be a very good shot, hasn't it?

1311
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,100
 And you're still going to scrape probably a bit of it.

1312
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,620
 Because what does it really affect?

1313
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,420
 The Cetus inversus thing where you're the other way around because your lungs are unaffected.

1314
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,420
 Yeah.

1315
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,420
 Oh, liver.

1316
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,540
 Because you've only got one liver, one spleen, gallbladder.

1317
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:11,440
 Also your spleen, as we've heard, could be literally anywhere, but your liver is a big

1318
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
 one, I think.

1319
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,440
 Yes.

1320
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,440
 Yeah.

1321
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,440
 Because that's massive, isn't it?

1322
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
 Yeah.

1323
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,180
 I mean, you probably will die if you've been shot in the chest anyway, right?

1324
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,180
 We should say.

1325
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,180
 Again.

1326
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,180
 Don't hope.

1327
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,240
 Don't eat poo and don't get shot in the chest on the wrong side if you're going to take

1328
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,120
 any message from this podcast.

1329
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,920
 All these things about unusual body parts that we're talking about.

1330
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,180
 I think it might interest a guy called Etienne de Beaumont, who was someone living in Paris

1331
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,700
 in the early 20th century.

1332
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,380
 He was a big old posh-o, and he liked to do lots of parties and stuff.

1333
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,380
 He was a friend of Coco Chanel, and one of his parties in 1919, the theme of it was that

1334
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:53,420
 every guest had to arrive with the most interesting body parts exposed.

1335
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,420
 Cool.

1336
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,760
 Whatever you think your most interesting body part is, if it's your head, lucky you.

1337
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,260
 If it's your spleen, tough.

1338
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,260
 Very tough.

1339
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,920
 What would you go for, Andy?

1340
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,920
 Sorry to put you on the spot.

1341
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,920
 No, it's fine.

1342
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,920
 Well, that weird growth down there is...

1343
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
 I would go with that one.

1344
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
 That'll be it.

1345
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,920
 That'll be it.

1346
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,920
 I've got a wood-shaped finger.

1347
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,200
 The finger which got shut in the door when I was tiny, and it's permanently disfigured

1348
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,200
 as a result.

1349
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,200
 Oh, wow.

1350
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,200
 Yeah.

1351
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
 Do you think that would break the ice at this party?

1352
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,700
 I think I'm not getting invited to this party.

1353
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,600
 If I filled in the form and put that on my RFP, this is the guy I'm going to come with

1354
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,600
 exposed.

1355
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,600
 I think it's going to be a dull night for a little bit.

1356
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,200
 That's weird because I was going to pick my finger as well, because I've got a little

1357
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,040
 freckle on it, which makes it...

1358
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,240
 I can make my finger look like an elephant.

1359
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,600
 I've got a trunk and an ear.

1360
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,280
 I think we'd be put on the same table.

1361
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,280
 I don't think...

1362
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,780
 I think you'll be put on the table with other people who could do elephant impressions.

1363
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,360
 Oh, no.

1364
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,360
 Do we know what...

1365
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,960
 If anyone beat Dan and Andy's suggestions for this party...

1366
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
 No, I don't have...

1367
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,380
 I really tried to find out, and really every source just tells you that this existed.

1368
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,580
 I got it from a biography of Coco Chanel, initially.

1369
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:01,400
 Because you're either going for, "Oh, my genitals are the most interesting part.

1370
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
 Here they are."

1371
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
 Or, "What is it?

1372
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,400
 What can you expose?"

1373
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,400
 Your knee, ankle, elbow.

1374
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,400
 It's joints and genitals.

1375
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,400
 It's going to be this party.

1376
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,400
 Genitals.

1377
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,120
 You don't want interesting genitals, do you?

1378
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,260
 I think you want standard genitals.

1379
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,200
 But they might be the most interesting thing about you.

1380
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,200
 Okay.

1381
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,200
 Yeah.

1382
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
 If you have three.

1383
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,200
 Yeah.

1384
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
 Oh, God.

1385
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,280
 If you had three.

1386
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,080
 On things you don't know are inside your body.

1387
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,080
 Yeah.

1388
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,080
 I mean, this is silly.

1389
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,240
 I was just reading a doctor talking on Reddit about experiences of patients with weird stuff

1390
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,960
 inside the body and saying, "A young man came in complaining of a headache."

1391
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,120
 And sorry, this was someone who worked in radiology and said, "They wanted to find out

1392
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,120
 the cause of the headache."

1393
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,360
 And so I said, "We asked for a history, anything that could be relevant to this headache."

1394
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,160
 The man said, "Nothing to report.

1395
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,320
 We scan his head, CT shows a bullet rattling loose between his nasal cavity and his brain."

1396
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,480
 So I asked the guy, "Have you ever been shot in the face?"

1397
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,200
 And he said, "Oh, yeah, I guess I forgot to mention that."

1398
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,480
 You've got to run back through your full history sometimes.

1399
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,480
 Yeah.

1400
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,480
 That's amazing.

1401
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,200
 I read something about a guy in 1911 called Alexander Grail who fought two duels near

1402
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,200
 New Orleans.

1403
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,480
 And the first one, someone sort of stabbed him with a sword and it went right through

1404
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,000
 his lungs.

1405
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,640
 And then he went to hospital, managed to come out, but he was really sick.

1406
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,600
 He walked, they said in the newspapers, he was bowed like an octogenarian.

1407
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,720
 He had a bit of surgery, but the doctors are like, "Ah, this is not going to work, mate.

1408
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,000
 You've got a huge abscess there.

1409
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,760
 You're going to die."

1410
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,000
 And he thought, "Well, I'm going to die now, so I might as well do more duels.

1411
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,400
 I might as well say fuck you to the people who upset me in the past."

1412
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:43,240
 So he got into another duel and the person shot him in the exact place where the sword

1413
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,640
 had gone in and it drained the abscess and he got cured.

1414
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,640
 Yes.

1415
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,640
 Oh, God.

1416
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,640
 I think you'd say that.

1417
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,640
 Wow.

1418
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,520
 That is where we get the comic bonk on the head twice, restores your memory.

1419
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
 Yeah.

1420
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,520
 The 3D glasses.

1421
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
 3D version.

1422
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,520
 Wow.

1423
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,480
 And sorry, is this one of the things we are recommending?

1424
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
 Yes, absolutely.

1425
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,480
 OK.

1426
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,040
 If you've been in a duel and got an abscess on your lungs, get in another duel immediately.

1427
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:14,440
 OK, that's it.

1428
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,440
 That is all of our facts.

1429
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,840
