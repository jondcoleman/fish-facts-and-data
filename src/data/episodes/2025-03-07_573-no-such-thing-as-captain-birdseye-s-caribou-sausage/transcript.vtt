 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.200
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.520
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.000
 Anna Tyshinsky, and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.160
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.240
 Starting with fact number one and that is Andy.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.680
 My fact is, after the first bridge from Europe to Asia was built, it took 33 years to build

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.400
 the second and 2,453 years to build the third.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.080
 Let's set the scene.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.080
 Okay.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 Istanbul.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 Yeah.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.080
 Yeah.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.360
 Famously, a city between two continents.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 Europe and Asia.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.360
 Those are the two.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 Amazing.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.360
 And it is amazing.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 It is amazing.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 It's a city in two continents.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.560
 It's the only one in the world, I think, right?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.560
 Yes.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.560
 Is it?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.440
 There's like a bit of trivia that says that.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.040
 That's what the Istanbul tourists would want you to believe.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 Yeah.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.640
 So that's why I've really got all of the Istanbul sites.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 Yeah.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.920
 And in between is a body of water, the Bosphorus Strait, which links, what is it, the Black

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 Sea and the...

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.800
 You've got the Sea of Marmara in the middle of Turkey and the Black Sea above it and the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 GNC.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.040
 And then eventually the Med.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 Eventually the Med.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.680
 Eventually the Atlantic, you know?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.240
 And then eventually the Pacific, if you want to go all the way around.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 Yeah.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 That's Istanbul.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.760
 And the Bosphorus Strait, across it, supposedly says Herodotus, was first crossed in 513 B.C.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.560
 Because Darius, who we talked about a while ago on this podcast...

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 Darius the Great.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 Yeah, we did.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 Darius the Great.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 He was apparently pursuing the Scythians.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 And it was all a bit...

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.560
 Yeah.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.400
 Anyway, the bridge that was built then was a pontoon bridge.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 Yeah.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.760
 And you had a load of boats together and you'd walk across the top of the boats.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 And you say load of boats.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.760
 It's a load of load of boats.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.960
 Like that's a thousand boats or something attached, because that's a very big distance

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 to cover.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 Yeah, it is.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960
 Seven hunj.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 Seven hunj.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960
 We want to be specific.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 Seven hunj.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.960
 Which Herodotus probably wasn't...

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960
 What?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960
 Seven hunj?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.960
 700.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.960
 Is that not a standard abbreviation?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960
 700.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.960
 Oh, my God.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 Get with it, kids.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960
 Yeah.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960
 And then the second one was built 33 years later.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.960
 They presumably thought, "Oh, this is a really good idea."

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.200
 And that was slightly lower.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.400
 That was the Hellespont, apparently, which is just...

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 Oh, that's the Dardanelles.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.280
 So that's a different part of Istanbul, right?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
 It is indeed.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 Yeah.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.800
 It's just southwest of the Bosphorus.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.520
 And then 1973 AD was when the first permanent bridge was built across the Bosphorus.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.520
 Yeah.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520
 And what did they do in the meantime?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520
 Boats.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 Yeah.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520
 Lots of boats.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.320
 Can I ask, jumping back to the first bridge, they're all boats tied together.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.040
 How long did that last until someone needed their boat back?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.880
 It's a temporary thing.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880
 Yeah.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880
 It's a temporary thing.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880
 I think it's to make an individual journey.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.880
 Yeah.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.880
 When you've got an army, you want to get from one to the other.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.880
 Right.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 It had one mission, basically.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880
 Exactly.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.880
 Yeah.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.880
 And you might just rip it up after that because you don't want the enemy to follow you.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.880
 Yeah.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.440
 But then 1973, Turkey got its first cross Istanbul bridge, and it made a massive difference.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440
 Nice bridge.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440
 Have you been across it?

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.440
 Yeah.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440
 Very cool.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440
 Did you go on foot?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440
 No.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 In a taxi.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.880
 You're only allowed one day a year on foot.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.880
 Oh, is it?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880
 Really?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880
 It's the marathon.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.880
 It's when they have their annual marathon.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880
 Oh.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.880
 You're allowed to run from Europe to Asia, which is very cool.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880
 That is cool.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.880
 Yeah.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880
 It's awesome.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880
 Do you guys know what "bosphorus" means?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880
 No.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880
 "Bos" means like cow.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.880
 Mm-hmm.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.880
 It's actually almost forgettable, sort of.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.880
 Oh, okay.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.880
 So like phosphorus was something...

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880
 It's like lightbringer.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880
 So is it cowbringer?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.880
 Okay.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.880
 No, it's not.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.760
 It's similar to origin to porous, a channel, or a ford, a cow ford, or in fact, an oxford.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760
 It's Oxford.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760
 Whoa.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760
 Bosphorus is Oxford.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760
 Really?

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.760
 Yeah.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.360
 A ford is a very, very, very small river that you could just walk across.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.360
 Yes.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.040
 And having been across this part of Istanbul, there's no way that has ever been a ford.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040
 It was a ford.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.880
 It was a ford in the myth, which caused this, because it was a myth of a woman called Io,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.160
 who was transformed into a bull, and then she walked across the bosphorus.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160
 She forded it.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160
 Very cool.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.480
 Because, you know, in myth, shit like that can happen.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.680
 Just cow, because otherwise we'll get letters.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680
 Cow, sorry.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680
 Cow.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 Yeah.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680
 Yes.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680
 She wasn't turned into a bull.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.400
 Well, one cool thing about the bosphorus is that the water flows in both directions.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.880
 So on the top of the water, it flows in one way.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.680
 And then if you go really low down, it flows the other way.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.520
 And so that means that if you're someone on a boat, you can just float on top and you'll

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.480
 nicely float across in the direction of the water.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.480
 Yeah.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.160
 But if you want to go in the other direction, what you have to do is you get a big rock,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.760
 drop it down really, really deep, and then the current underneath the water will drag

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.280
 your rock in the other direction, and that'll drag your boat in that direction.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.160
 Wait, that's not on way anyone traveled that.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.720
 That sounds exactly plausible to me.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.720
 Is that work?

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.720
 It genuinely works.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720
 I mean, wouldn't work with a cruise ship.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.720
 Oh, as good as that.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.720
 What size is this?

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.720
 And if you're a fisherman.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.720
 Yeah, okay.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.720
 Is it done?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.720
 Well, in history, it has been done.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.720
 That's amazing.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.240
 These days, I don't think you get those kind of boats around there.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.240
 But that's very cool.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.400
 But it is an actual river, isn't it?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.440
 And it was the world's first ever discovered underground, underwater, sorry, river.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440
 And it's so cool.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.200
 And underneath, it's to do with the salinity going from a salty bit to a less salty bit

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.960
 of water, the river underneath the sea.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.880
 The river's got like banks and meanders and all the features that you have in a normal

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.880
 river.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.880
 A lot of boat lakes.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.880
 A lot of boats.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880
 A lot of boats.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.880
 A lot of boats.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.880
 A lot of boats.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.880
 Yeah, yeah, a lot of banana boats.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.520
 And the shopping trolleys at the surface are nice.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.360
 So the bridges is one way to get across now, but they also have now the underground rail.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.040
 And that started being built in 2004.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.920
 They wanted to build it quite quickly, because one bridge, having that one bridge, was just

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.240
 crazy amount of traffic.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.600
 The problem was, is they tried to pick a spot that just wouldn't have any archaeology around

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600
 it.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600
 It's hard in Turkey, isn't it?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600
 So hard.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600
 The center of the ancient world.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.960
 Particularly when you've had like, you know, bridges that were made of boats, you know,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.040
 thousands of them, 700, sorry, Anna.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.400
 And so that's exactly what happened.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.440
 They started going down and they started finding all of these shipwrecks that had been buried

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.560
 into the ground and they had to pause.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.360
 And so between 2005 and 2013, they were just digging up something like 36 ships that they

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360
 found.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.520
 They found all this pottery.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.320
 And so after they found everything, they thought it was all done.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.640
 They then said, okay, we just want one more quick look, just one little tiny look.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.720
 And then discovered a 6000 BC, unknown Neolithic dwelling that they had no idea existed with

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720
 everything down there.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.120
 And then it just took even more time.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.560
 But I feel a bit conflicted about that.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.600
 I just think we don't owe the past this much.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.720
 I'm sorry to irritate all archaeologists listening.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.000
 We wouldn't know about these things if it wasn't for the fact some brilliant person

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 had the idea of building an underground railway, which is much cooler than an old boat.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 I'm sorry.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Do you know whose side you're on here?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.160
 And I think this is going to make you happy because I know you're a big fan is Odeon felt

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.160
 exactly the same as you.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.480
 And he said there's a bunch of rubbish pots and pans.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.520
 And the more important thing is infrastructure.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.640
 And I know you guys see I-to-I a lot.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.560
 So I think of myself as the strongman of this podcast.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.680
 And threw himself a pissed off birthday party in the unopened tunnel underneath saying this

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.680
 has to be open.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.680
 This is enough.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680
 This is too much.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.080
 And it eventually was on the date that he suggested.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.840
 A lot of traffic goes through those straights.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.760
 The bus for a straight to the Dardanelles, doesn't it?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:37.440
 I think it's, is it 4 percent of the world's oil goes through there and there's a rule that

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.120
 says that everyone has to pay, but it's a very small amount.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.640
 They did some sort of deal 50 years ago and said that one of those there's a toll bridge

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.000
 in me where you pay to pay to pay to go across it.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Like that.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Yeah.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.880
 It's just one old boy who's collecting to pay.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880
 Sorry, Emma.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.880
 What's entry?

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.880
 Are you living in?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880
 What?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880
 They exist.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880
 They exist in Lancashire.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.880
 Fair bit.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.880
 I'm sorry.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.240
 Do you have to pay to pay every time you play five P the one in is to P and that the property

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.760
 makes quite a lot of money out of it in a year.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.000
 It's enough to sustain the property.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Wow.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.520
 Do you have a role of two P's in your car?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.520
 I actually think if you don't have the two P's they now let you go anyway, but you really

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.520
 should.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.520
 It's round upon not to.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.520
 What are they going to do?

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.960
 If you're sitting there blocking the two P toll, yeah, eventually it'll cost them more

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.200
 not to let you through.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200
 You won't be popular.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200
 Wow.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200
 Yeah.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.560
 I have been to one where it's 20 P. Actually, they hiked it to 15.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560
 I was really annoyed.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560
 Is that what you're about to say, James?

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560
 They hiked it.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560
 No, I'm not.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.000
 But this is what about turn of what is this ridiculous thing you're talking about Anna to.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Yeah.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 I'm very familiar with those.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.040
 I'm sorry for comic conceit I wanted to, you know, tease Anna, I wanted to have my cake

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040
 and eat it.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.160
 But anyway, so Turkey are now building a canal or they want to build a big old canal that

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.960
 goes right the way through Turkey so that you can either go on this route that goes

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.160
 through the Dardanelles and through the Bosphorus and pay your two P or you can pay more and

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.280
 go through the canal, but you know, you get through quicker and you don't have to queue

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.280
 up.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280
 It's an amazing idea.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.280
 It's like double Bosphorus.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.640
 It's like imagine if you had a road where you had to pay two P to go across it, or then

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.680
 you had the M6 toll road that went the other way and you can't choose which way to go.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.200
 I think the first person who suggested that canal was Suleyman the Magnificent in the

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200
 1500s.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.520
 And it's been suggested by almost every Turkish leader, Ottoman leader since then.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.320
 But yeah, the ones caught on.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.520
 Just a quick thing on the Ottoman Empire.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.160
 I don't think we've said before much about the Ottomans.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.620
 So if you became Sultan, the traditional thing to do was immediately off all your brothers

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.200
 plus any uncles, cousins, like anyone would just murdered immediately.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.840
 Anyone who could possibly take over from you apart from your son.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840
 Exactly.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840
 But you've got 19 sons.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.120
 And when your son becomes Sultan, he'll kill the other 18.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.360
 And also your main son is cool, but all the other sons are like put in cages.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.600
 They're all put in cages.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600
 I thought it was cages.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.980
 Basically, it's a suite of rooms, but they're called the cages.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.960
 And then they change their policy in about 1600 and they said, right, we can't keep on

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960
 murdering everyone.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.120
 So we'll just keep everyone in the cages.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.040
 And you would be kept there with some, apparently some concubines, but concubines who won't

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.400
 have any children so that, you know, you don't present a threat because you're not producing

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400
 more heirs.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400
 How do you make sure?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.280
 So it's all sort of post-menopausal concubines?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.600
 I believe, I think that's the drill, yeah, yeah.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.920
 And you only allowed a few very specific hobbies.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920
 Apparently mainly macrame.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.920
 Making knots.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.420
 It's basically elaborate knot, knot work.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.700
 And then you can tie yourself a rope ladder in it.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.700
 It's terrible.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.860
 Like they went, another one's escaped Sultan, but by a rope bridge, yeah, rope bridge.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:44.200
 That's why the multiple attempts at bridges across the Bosphorus are all rope based, none

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.200
 of them survived.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.020
 But every so often the Sultan would die and they'd have to get someone out of the cages.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.340
 And basically you'd have this blithering idiot who only knew how to do macrame and

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.400
 not experienced in ruling the largest empire on the planet.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400
 So weird.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400
 Did that happen?

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.040
 Did you have the cage ruler?

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.040
 Yeah.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040
 Wow.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.280
 So imagine you're in the 17th century, you're visiting the Sultan, you're like a big wig

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.200
 but from another part of Turkey or the Ottoman Empire.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.960
 You turn up at the Topkapi Palace in the middle of Istanbul, that's where he lives and he

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.760
 gives you some sorbet.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.760
 Okay.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.340
 Normally you get some nice white sorbet, but this time it's red.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.460
 It's strawberry flavour.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.460
 What does that mean?

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.460
 I'm about to be executed.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.460
 I'm afraid so.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.460
 No.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.460
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.460
 That's what would happen.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.460
 That's how you find out?

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.460
 You see your sorbet?

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.180
 I just need to say, I need to say it was sherbet, not sorbet.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.180
 Sherbet.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.180
 Oh.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.180
 Which is a similar design.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.180
 Just as nice.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.180
 Yeah.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.180
 But I misread it on my file.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.760
 And yeah, so you would give this sherbet, normally it'd be white with your little lolly

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.860
 that you would dip in it and lick it, but now it was the red flavour.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.560
 And so you're going to get executed, right?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.560
 Yeah.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.280
 But there was a loophole.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:02.160
 You could escape execution if you could outrun the executioner in a 300-yard foot race.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.160
 Wow.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160
 Okay.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.520
 So the executioner who's also a gardener, by the way.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.520
 Yeah.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.520
 Oh, so he might be a bit limber.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.520
 He is going to be limber.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.520
 Yeah.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.520
 He's going to be strong.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.520
 Yeah.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.520
 He's going to work outside a lot.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.520
 So how do you do it?

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.520
 Well, you just have to race him.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.520
 Oh, I thought that was a question.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.520
 If you beat him, you're fine.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.480
 And if you don't beat him, you're executed and your body's held into the sea.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.580
 See, I was thinking, pretend to eat the sherbet, keep it in your hand as you run, drop it down

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.780
 as a trap, let him slip, easy peasy.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.780
 No.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.780
 He's a gardener, damn.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.260
 What you want to do is you want to leave an unusual flower in his path.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.980
 So he can't help but stop and take a cutting for later.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.980
 Yes.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.620
 No, what you want to do is you want to take him on a path where you come to a 2P toll and

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.960
 you go through, but he, having left his change, back at the castle.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.960
 Do you get to eat the sherbet beforehand, just in case you don't live to be able to

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960
 eat it afterwards?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.960
 I think you do, yeah.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.960
 Oh, that's nice.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.960
 It's a sort of last meal, isn't it?

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.040
 It's going to put you off a little bit, though, because you know it's your last meal.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.400
 I don't think you're going to enjoy that sherbet quite as much.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.480
 Are there stats on how many people won or lost against the gardener?

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.520
 If there are, they didn't come up in the course of my research.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520
 Yeah, right.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.520
 Fair enough.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520
 This was 17th century, did you say?

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.520
 That's correct.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.100
 I was trying to look into anything else that has survived Istanbul from the 17th century

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.300
 onwards that we still have today, and I found, if you look at a drum kit on most of the biggest

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.300
 bands out there in the world, you'll see on the symbols, a lot of them will say Zildjian.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.620
 There's like four major symbol brands out there, right?

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:31.660
 This one was created in 1623 by Evadas Zildjian, and it was a family that were trying to bring

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.460
 metals together to create gold, but instead created these amazing symbols and they would

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.480
 make little symbols that go on each finger, so you could make it, so as to create noise

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.480
 and war and so on.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.440
 That's not going to be a big noise, the fingers imagine, 10,000 Ottomans.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.840
 So this became a product that they started making, and it slowly over the years morphed

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.880
 into becoming symbols that were being used by drummers, and then when the Beatles appeared

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.000
 on the Ed Sullivan show, which was seen, probably the most viewed show, I think, at

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.880
 its time, Zildjian was on there, and every drummer started taking it up.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880
 Really?

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.060
 Yeah, it's become the biggest brand.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.180
 This is a Turkish Ottoman family in the 1600s.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.180
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.180
 Yeah, in the 1600s.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.180
 That's fantastic.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.420
 So that survived into pop, you'll see it at the Grammys, you'll see it everywhere in

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.420
 modern day.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.540
 I just like it when Dan starts a fact, watching the excitement on your face and in your voice

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:25.220
 as you get closer and closer to the Beatles climax.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:32.380
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is My Fact.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:37.080
 My fact this week is that because he talks so fast, when Martin Scorsese spoke at an

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.600
 international film festival, they had to provide an additional translator to first translate

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.280
 his fast words into slower words.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.320
 They're still the same words.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.320
 They're same words.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.320
 You wouldn't know.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.320
 They sound completely different.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.640
 Does this mean that the event went on way after Scorsese finished talking?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.520
 Because what matters to the audience is hearing the words from the second interpreter, right?

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.620
 So you've got Scorsese, who's going to be translated into, let's say it's French, right?

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.420
 The French translator is listening to Scorsese going, "I have no idea what you're saying

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.740
 because you're so speedy."

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.020
 So they brought another English speaker in to listen to Scorsese speak really fast

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.180
 and then go, "So what he's saying is in English..."

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.020
 Yeah, so that will take twice as long, won't it?

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.020
 Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.020
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.020
 You could trim it down a bit along the way.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.020
 You could.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.180
 Unfortunately, Scorsese and his films are known for being break and slice and brief.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.980
 So I'm sure his speech is the same.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.640
 Yeah, this is a very little known nugget that I got from Michael Palin's Diaries.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.000
 So I'm reading his second volume of Diaries, Halfway to Hollywood.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.080
 This happened on the 24th of September, 1980.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.720
 He was out to dinner in Los Angeles with Scorsese and he told them this over a dinner party.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.920
 So I haven't seen that referenced anywhere else, but I had since asked a bunch of filmmakers

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.640
 and watched a few interviews and yeah, he's powerhouse when he's speaking.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.640
 It's funny because I wouldn't imagine it because of all his films, they have these

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.700
 languorous long pauses and people who speak very slowly before murdering people.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.260
 It's weird to think of him as just like a chipmunk.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.900
 I've never heard him speak, I don't think.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.900
 No, I mean either.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.700
 He's slower these days, I would say, but he's 80.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.980
 But you've seen him speak, I suppose, James, through cinema.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.980
 Oh.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.740
 You've heard what he wants to say.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.920
 Yeah, I suppose I have for four hours at a time.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.420
 I thought I'd never seen one of his films.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.080
 I had to look through the whole, I thought I'd managed it because it doesn't, it's not

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.320
 my kind of thing, you know, like gangsters and mafia stuff, I don't know what I think.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.480
 No big worms.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.880
 No big worms.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.440
 It turns out I've seen two of his films.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.840
 You cannot get away from Scorsese.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.840
 I've seen Cape Fear.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840
 Oh yeah.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.080
 That's a bit of a stinker and Shutter Island, which is amazing.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.080
 Yes, love Shutter Island.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080
 Oh, what a film.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080
 So good.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080
 I'm interested.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.080
 Cape Fear isn't a stinker, is it?

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.080
 It's a classic.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.080
 It's a classic, yeah.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080
 A bit silly, isn't it?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.080
 I guess so.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.080
 Yeah.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080
 A lot of our own opinions.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.080
 Sorry.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.980
 It's not like a classic, grassy kind of movie.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:54.980
 No, sorry.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.020
 What I mean is it's a highly garlanded, commercially successful and critically acclaimed stinker

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.860
 in my eyes.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.020
 Yeah, but amazing filmmaker.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.900
 So the movies, if you don't know, Taxi Driver, he made, he made, what else did he make?

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.020
 Mean Streets, The Goodfellas, The King of New York, yeah.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.020
 The Irishman, I watched.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.020
 The Irishman in Recent Times.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.020
 Yeah.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.020
 Raging Bull.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.020
 Raging Bull of Wall Street.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.020
 Oh yeah.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.020
 That's a big one.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.020
 Yeah.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.860
 Raging Bull does seem to have saved his life.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.800
 Well, he was a huge, co-caddox, what's it mean, the '70s, and-

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.840
 So why he was speaking so fast?

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.040
 I think it will have contributed.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040
 Yes.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.560
 He had something to do with it, actually, yeah.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.320
 And he just made a film, which actually was a bit of a flop with what's she called Dorothy

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.720
 from The Wizard of Oz's Daughter.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.720
 Liza Minnelli.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.720
 Thank you.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.800
 He nearly died.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.320
 He ended up in hospital and he was really bleeding internally everywhere.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.080
 They thought he was going to brain hemorrhage.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.080
 He said, "I was bleeding internally everywhere and I didn't know it.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.160
 My eyes were bleeding.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.560
 My hands, everything.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.460
 My mouth, my nose, coughing up blood."

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.260
 Anyway, he sort of was surviving, but he was very depressed.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.420
 And he didn't really want to make Raging Bull, I don't think, but Robert De Niro, who'd

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.780
 made a few films with him, was really keen on it.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.940
 And De Niro rocked up beside his hospital bed with a script for Raging Bull that I think

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.180
 had been sort of rewritten, re-drafted and said, "Look, you've got to do this, mate.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.180
 What are you going to do?

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.780
 Are you going to sit here and die or are you going to do Raging Bull?"

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.540
 And he did it and it's one of the best films I've ever made.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.500
 Another thing he made was a film called New York, New York.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.500
 Yes.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.240
 It's the one we're talking about with Liza Manelli in it, maybe.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.240
 I think it was, yes.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.240
 Yeah.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:31.840
 And so she sang the song theme from New York, New York, which is the one that everyone knows.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840
 New York, New York.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.840
 No.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840
 New York, New York.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840
 I want to be a part of it.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840
 Oh, that one.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.340
 There are two songs called New York, New York.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.340
 What's yours?

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.840
 That one's from an old sort of Bing Crosby film, isn't it?

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840
 New York, New York.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.840
 It's a hell of a town.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.840
 Yeah, that one.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.840
 Something's up.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840
 Yeah.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.840
 Exactly.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840
 But no, not that one.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840
 So I was teasing.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840
 You were.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.840
 It was real.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840
 This is my 2P Tolbridge moment.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840
 You all right?

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840
 I feel like a fool.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840
 Thank you.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840
 Have your money back.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.740
 Well, so the interesting thing about that is that film came out in 1977 and Liza Manelli

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:11.220
 sang the theme from New York, New York and then later in 1980, Frank Sinatra sang New

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.740
 York, New York, which everyone thinks like associates Frank Sinatra with New York, New

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.740
 York.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.840
 He never sang until 1980 because it wasn't written until 1977.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.840
 That's insane.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840
 I don't know.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.840
 He was still singing in 1980.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.840
 I know.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.340
 So all of those times when he's in the rap park and, you know, doing, being absolutely

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.720
 mega famous, he never sang New York, New York because it hadn't been written yet.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720
 How interesting.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720
 Isn't that interesting?

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720
 That's really odd.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720
 Yeah.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.000
 I feel like I've got a false memory of being alive in the 50s and the 60s and hearing him

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 sing it.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Exactly.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.400
 I think that like a lot of people who are older would know that, but for me it was really

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400
 incongruous.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.400
 Yeah, incongruous.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.400
 He loved his cocaine.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.800
 Massive in Coke in the Coke world.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800
 Well, he did it a lot, right?

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.800
 Yeah.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.080
 I mean, he did it to the point that there was a film festival he went to in Cannes in '78.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.520
 He was unable to score a Coke there.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.420
 So he dispatched a private jet to go on a Coke run to pick it up for him and bring it

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.420
 back.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.420
 So it was a massive thing.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.640
 And also he made a movie called The Last Waltz.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.320
 So he's quite an amazing director.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.700
 He doesn't just do films.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.560
 He does documentaries and quite seminal documentaries as well.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.000
 And so he's done a Beatles documentary.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Oh my gosh.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 There we go.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Wow.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 And let's move on.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.140
 Now we've loved that foil for this fact.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.140
 Let's plow on.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.140
 Shall we?

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:32.520
 But there was one which was called The Last Waltz and one of the musicians, Neil Young,

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.000
 had a bit of coke under his nose and this made it to the film.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.540
 And so they were sitting in the editing room going, "What do we do about this?"

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.500
 And he had VFX literally invent a whole new method that's still used in film today.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.780
 They called it the traveling bogey where they were able to knock out the coke from his nose

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.260
 by having a thing follow and track the coke all along in the shot.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.100
 So when you see it, the coke's not in the shot, but it was in the print.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.820
 And cinema was advanced as a result of it.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.700
 That's basically a Snapchat filter, isn't it, really?

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.700
 Yeah.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.700
 Where they find one bit.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.420
 All this is your nose or your ears or your eyes and they can scan and put, make you look

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.920
 like a potato or whatever.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.920
 Yeah.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.920
 That's a really good call.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.920
 They should have done that.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920
 Just put a potato over his head.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920
 I think it was Neil Young.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.920
 Yeah, Neil Young.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.760
 None of this stuff, I have to say, is in the IMDb on Martin Scorsese, which reads...

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.200
 Let me just read you a couple of things from it, right?

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.200
 Okay.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.320
 Because I think Scorsese might have written this.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.340
 Despite being known for directing extremely dark and often very violent movies, he is

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.200
 known in real life to be a very friendly, polite and mild man person who gets along very

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.140
 well with his cast and crew.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.940
 Because so many of his actors win or are nominated for awards, actors are dying to work with

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.940
 him.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.820
 Scorsese rarely uses our rated language in real life.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.940
 I mean, it's just pure hagiography.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.940
 Yeah.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.860
 There's a film he made recently called The Irishman.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.860
 Yep.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.860
 Which I missed.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.780
 I watched it on the flight to Lanzarote and it was almost the exact length of the flight.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.780
 Nice.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.580
 It's about four hours.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.580
 It seems long.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.940
 I mean, it is long, clearly.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.120
 But one thing they did there, because James, am I right in thinking people age a bit?

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.040
 Oh, I don't fucking remember it.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.240
 It was just four hours of tedious gangster stuff.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.240
 Well, okay.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.840
 Basically, people get older and then younger.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.360
 It's the same characters and you're going back in life and then forward in life and

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360
 then back together.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360
 That does happen, yeah.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360
 You know, they're 30 and then they're 80 and blah, blah, blah.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.040
 Anyway, they had to have a posture coach telling people, "No, stop it.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.200
 You're getting up from the chair like an 80-year-old.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.200
 You're 30 in this scene."

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.200
 Oh.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.520
 Just saying, "No, look, for this scene, you are a healthy fit young man, so can you jump

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.520
 out of it?"

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.520
 So confused.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.520
 That's very funny.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.520
 That's weird.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520
 Another one he did was Hugo.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.520
 Probably my favorite Scorsese film.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.520
 Embarrassingly.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.520
 The Victor Hugo biopic.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.520
 No, no.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.340
 It's like a family film about the early days of cinema and stuff.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.340
 Lumiere.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.340
 Is that what it's called?

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.340
 Lumiere Brothers.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.340
 Yeah.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.340
 It's a gorgeous film.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.340
 It's a really good film.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.380
 And it was in 3D.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.300
 It was one of the early 3D films.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.320
 And one interesting thing about it is there was a guy called Bruce Bridgeman.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320
 Okay.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.960
 He was a neuroscientist, but he had this weird thing where he couldn't perceive depth.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.640
 So whenever he went to, like, let's say he went to a big church in Europe and he wanted

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.160
 to admire it, he couldn't really tell what was here and what was there.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.640
 It was all flat to him.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.840
 So he used to walk up and down the church so that the things closer to him would move

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.840
 quicker than things further away from him.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.380
 You know, like when you're on a train and like anything that's really close to the train

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.380
 flies past and then the mountains in the background go really slowly.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.060
 He would use that parallax effect to understand depth.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.500
 Anyway, he went to watch Hugo and he put on these 3D glasses and suddenly he could see

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.140
 the 3D and when he left the movie, he could see 3D.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.740
 It had fixed his problem.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.300
 Isn't that amazing?

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.300
 That's incredible.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.300
 That is good.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.300
 Yeah.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.300
 So he didn't have to keep the glasses on.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.300
 No.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.300
 It just fixes.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.640
 No, it just fixed his 3D and kind of triggered something in his brain that said, "Oh, this

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.640
 is how it works."

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640
 How weird.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.640
 Was that in the IMDB?

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640
 No.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.740
 What is going on?

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:10.800
 Just on interpreters, as this fact was about, it does sound insanely stressful.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.380
 They do have, at the European Parliament, they have to switch every half an hour because

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.780
 otherwise they just can't, they get very, very stressed and they can't have mistakes

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.780
 as well, right?

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.780
 Exactly.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.060
 They can't have a booth with one other interpreter.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:26.020
 So you seamlessly switch over every half an hour and if you're not on shift, you should

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.220
 not eat an apple.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.580
 You can eat a banana.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.580
 Why?

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.580
 Because it's too noisy.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.020
 It will distract your fellow interpreter who's trying desperately to listen to, "Okay,

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.020
 James is doing some Foley now and the audience is just listening to this disgusting sound."

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.020
 Wow.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.020
 That's cruel.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.700
 And if James, you'd had a nana there, it would have been fine.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.700
 I've actually been eating a banana this whole time.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.700
 Exactly.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.700
 Exactly.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.740
 The gestures Dan's been doing have been actually more distracting.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.780
 No, but half an hour, half an hour is about apparently the safe limit.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:25:00.660
 And in 2009, Colonel Gaddafi spoke at the UN and his interpreter allegedly collapsed

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.420
 after 75 minutes of mental stuff from Gaddafi.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.740
 He just, the interpreter's brain just went into spasm and he had to be helped away.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.380
 He cried out or something like, "I can't do this anymore."

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.380
 Yeah.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.940
 I think that is a problem, isn't it?

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.220
 So some interpreters talk about this with translating Donald Trump, which is you have

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.140
 certain phrases that he uses that just kind of doesn't make sense.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.840
 But in English, we all kind of let it slip.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.340
 But as a translator, you've got to do it.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.740
 Yeah, you don't translate the words, do you?

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.860
 Translate the meaning of the words.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.820
 I think they just suffer from what he actually means is the issue.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.820
 Yeah.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.220
 What is he actually trying to say there?

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.580
 The sentence lasts 20 minutes and it just goes, "Yeah, yeah."

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.500
 And I think I can see how it's a pressurizing thing.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.580
 Like a different kind of interpretation is to do sign language, right?

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.780
 And we have seen meltdowns publicly where they are often accused of not knowing sign

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.780
 language.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.780
 I wonder if that's the case.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.700
 So do you remember there was the Obama speech after Mandela had died and the guy just clearly

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.700
 didn't know.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.820
 He still maintains that he does know it, but he was hallucinating.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:02.300
 And in America, Hurricane Irma, there was a moment where on TV, they were saying, "You've

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.300
 got to be safe.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.620
 There's flood zones you've got to get to, you've got to consider saying in shelters."

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:11.140
 And the guy who apparently knew sign language was just making words like, "Bear monster

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.620
 and pizza."

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.820
 And he says, "Well, my brother's deaf and I do know sign language, but I just, it was

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.820
 too much."

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.180
 I think this is the stress of it.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.020
 My cousin is actually a professional translator, a Russian translator and he was saying the

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.700
 stress of it like, "You're fluent, you've been fluent for years and then suddenly you'll

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.700
 have a blank."

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.020
 He said he was translating Russian and at one point someone was talking about baking

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.540
 and said the word kek.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.900
 And he knew that's a loan word from British, so that's fine.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:41.060
 So kek means cake in Russian, that's what the loan word they were using.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.740
 He was like, "I know it's a loan word from British.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.740
 What do I say with kek?

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.740
 I can't get your keks on.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:49.980
 There's trousers and there's translated cake as trousers and you panic in the moment."

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.500
 One thing interpreters all do apparently is they interrupt people.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.500
 Okay.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.500
 They're nearest to the noise.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.020
 I shouldn't have mentioned this fact.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.020
 I knew.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.420
 I knew it would be you, James.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.140
 If listen, you'd notice I haven't spoken for a while.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.380
 It's because I've literally been eating the apple the whole time.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.900
 Unfortunately, swallowed it just in time to interrupt Andy.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.900
 Go back to it.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.860
 No, basically the whole thing of being an interpreter is you learn what people around

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.060
 you are going to say and you slightly are anticipating the end of a sentence.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.540
 So when they clock off after a long day of interpreting, they go home and their partner

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.000
 says to them, "I'm making," and they say, "Chicken nuggets.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 I know.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 I know."

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.700
 And their spouses and children are furious with them all the time because they just will

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.740
 not let them finish the sentence.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.580
 Certainly relatedly, I saw a head of an interpreting service who hires people out for like UN and

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.420
 stuff, talking about how you do it.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.100
 And he was saying in his video, "You have to be really careful about what distance you

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.420
 keep from the person who you're interpreting."

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.180
 At first, I thought, "Sure, you just keep the distance where you can hear them."

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.180
 Right.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.860
 But he meant in terms of the time you leave between when they speak and when you start

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.860
 interpreting.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.700
 So, you can't get too close to them as in if Andy starts speaking and I'm interpreting

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.700
 him.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.420
 If I literally interpret after every single word he says, "I'll mess up the grammar.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.060
 I won't be able to predict the end of the sentence.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.060
 I won't get the syntax."

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.780
 Yeah, because Andy might be starting a sentence and then go on one of his whimsical endings

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.780
 of a sentence.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.780
 Exactly.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.780
 You don't have to do that shit.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.420
 Whereas if you're converting Dan, you just mentioned the Beatles, and you trust that

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.460
 train will come in.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:32.340
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:37.420
 My fact this week is that Indigenous Arctic peoples were absolutely banned from eating

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.300
 the surf and turf.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:45.500
 Now, we said before we went on air, before the mics came on, that neither one's going

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.260
 to know what surf and turf is.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:53.560
 Yes, I thought this was a universally accepted cuisine, but Dan, maybe because of his unique

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.060
 upbringing and others don't.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:59.060
 So, surf and turf is basically where you get dumped like a massive lobster next to a massive

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.780
 steak or meat and fish.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.780
 Land and sea.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.780
 Land and sea.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.100
 I was wondering, can it be like oysters and ham?

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.300
 Is that technically surf and turf?

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.700
 Where I come from, it's usually scampy and very, very cheap steak.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.740
 Oh, okay, okay.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.180
 Fish fingers in a Scotch egg would technically count as surf and turf, right?

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.180
 Yeah, there you go.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.180
 So, there are lots of things that count.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:28.140
 You can all think of meat from land and meat from the sea and do it yourself at home.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.140
 Yes.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.140
 Oh, it's a venomless fun.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.140
 God, it's a fun game.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.140
 I don't know.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.140
 I don't know.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.140
 I think that's debatable.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.340
 Anyway, I don't know if this is still true.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:43.020
 Obviously, there are a lot of Inuits left across Alaska and Canada, Greenland, and the

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:48.420
 Yupik people and the Elute people all from that kind of region of the world, all used

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.940
 to do it, but they've obviously integrated more into the outside world in the last hundred

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:54.940
 years.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940
 So, I don't know if they still do.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.980
 But anyway, it was the idea that land and sea absolutely could not be mixed, mostly because

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.820
 you'd really upset the mistress of the sea.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.820
 And they went to such lengths.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:10.980
 So, essentially, the only foods they had, 90% of the time, were seal and caribou and

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.980
 fish.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.980
 And fish.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.980
 And fish, yes.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.300
 And they could never be eaten together.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.180
 They could never be cooked or stored together.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.420
 In the dark months of the year, so like half of the year, they'd go and live out on the

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.420
 sea ice.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:29.060
 And because they're on sea there, the women who did all the sewing were absolutely forbidden

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.700
 from sewing clothes because they're made of caribou skins.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.500
 So they'd have to do all their sewing in summer because you can't take the caribou skins

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.740
 out onto the sea because that's mixing land and sea.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.740
 Was that surf and turf?

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.740
 Yeah.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.740
 Surf and turf.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.740
 You're allowed to wear the caribou skins.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.740
 Weirdly, you're allowed to wear.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.220
 Yeah, you don't have to go naked out to the sea.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.740
 You're allowed to wear them weirdly, but just not make them.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.020
 This taboo was so strict.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.180
 So there was one as the thread thing, and you had to process all your caribou in the autumn

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.380
 before you then started hunting seal.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.380
 But there was another taboo.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:02.580
 So fish that were caught in rivers and lakes, so trout and salmon, must not be cooked over

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.180
 a driftwood fire because driftwood comes from the sea.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.180
 Oh, wow.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:12.660
 So that is a land sea taboo where it's kind of fish from the land, if you like, and wood

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.660
 from the sea.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.780
 What if you caught your fish in some brackish water?

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.060
 I think it's a strong line.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.060
 Is it a freshwater fish?

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.700
 Well, a salmon would go in between, wouldn't it?

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.700
 Yeah.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.980
 But as soon as they'd entered, it was like even if the salmon were just 20 yards upstream

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.900
 having come from the sea, it's like, no, the sea's out now.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.140
 They're now river fish, it's bizarre.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:36.220
 It wasn't easy, was it, living the life of an arctic person a hundred years ago.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.100
 You wouldn't have thought you'd be introduced, imagine you were practically starving to death

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.220
 and all you've got is a bit of driftwood to catch your caribou on.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.220
 Oh, fuck.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.420
 I guess we're going to die.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.420
 So interesting.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.380
 Is it one of those things where there's a great reason behind it?

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.860
 And actually the religious thing or the mistress of the sea thing is just a justification.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.860
 I don't know.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:58.980
 You know, like there's a thing where people who don't eat pig products, perhaps, is because

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.820
 if you didn't cook them properly, you'd get terrible parasites and stuff.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.820
 Right.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.620
 And the meat spoils faster in the middle to the sun, so that's why there's a pork taboo,

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.620
 that kind of thing.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.620
 I don't know.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.820
 Could have been like if you take the caribou meat out to sea and like spoil by the time

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.740
 you're out at sea or something, but it's lost in the midst of time and now it's all about

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.500
 pissing off the sea goddess.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.840
 I was reading a bit about their diets and the stuff they ate and this is about the turn

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.020
 of the 20th century, quite a few explorers, memoirs who went and lived with Inuits for

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:29.660
 long periods of time and one guy who was living with the copper Inuits who were off the island

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:35.820
 off the north of Canada, said that the only non-meat he ever saw them eat is the half-digested

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.900
 moss from the first stomach of a caribou or a reindeer.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.900
 Oh, Sandy.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.900
 Sounds good to me.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.900
 Yeah, you would have loved it.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.900
 I think that's unnecessarily picky by that.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:49.540
 Yeah, it's a thing called rock tripe is what they eat, which is this, it's kind of, I think

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.560
 it's more like in the moss, Andy, just to say, but it would grow on the rocks and then

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:59.560
 you would scrape it off and you would eat it, but you had to soak it for long periods

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.680
 and change the water a lot because if you didn't, it would basically give you the constant

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.680
 shits.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680
 Oh, no.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.680
 So you had to.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.680
 Yeah.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.880
 So has it been, if it's in an animal stomach, has it kind of been pre-soaked?

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.880
 That would do it.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.880
 That would help it, I guess.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.120
 Maybe a ferments a little bit in there.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.560
 Yeah, maybe that's why they did it.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.240
 It's like having your oats pre-milked.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240
 Yeah.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.420
 So it came in like, I'm sort of imagining like a meat loaf because often it would be in the

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.380
 caribou's stomach and they'd take the stomach out wholesale and it would freeze obviously

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.860
 because it's freezing and then you just hack off bits.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.540
 So what you get is a nice mixture of, you know, like if you have a sort of sausage meat

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.820
 loaf with like herbs through it, it's like you get a mixture of caribou's stomach and

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.820
 moss.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.820
 Yeah, lovely.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.820
 You're frozen.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.820
 Yeah.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.820
 Very nice.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.540
 Another explorary type who witnessed the way that they ate their food and then transposed

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.540
 it.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.540
 It was Captain Bird's Eye.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.400
 I had no idea about this.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.400
 What was this?

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:55.300
 Captain Bird's Eye basically was out in Labrador for quite a while and he noticed all the

00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:01.000
 indigenous Inuit freezing their food and then being able to heat it later and it tastes

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.560
 really good.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.720
 Frozen food was happening already around the world, but the thawing process was really

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.720
 bad.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.400
 If you unfroze your food, it suddenly lost its taste.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.760
 It was really oddly and the texture of it and so on.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.660
 And he applied the method that he saw the Inuit do to his frozen food company and that's

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.140
 what sparked frozen food as a massive industry.

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:25.080
 And of course, Bird's Eye today never sell sausages because it's so tough.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.320
 Land, surf and turf.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.320
 Yeah.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:33.580
 The early caribou intestine and moss was not popular with kids at tea time.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.140
 Oh, you battered that.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.340
 Anyone's eating it.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.340
 Yeah.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.580
 He noticed that when they've caught some fish and froze it in the middle of winter, it tastes

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.880
 way better than when they caught it in like the spring and froze it because it was so

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.980
 much quicker that the freezing process happened that it just made things taste better and

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.280
 then that made him, you know, do his own version.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.500
 So basically his trick is free stuff really quickly.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.500
 Free stuff really good.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.500
 Flash freezing.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.500
 Yeah.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.500
 Kind of like flash frying.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500
 But the opposite.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.500
 Wise words.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.500
 Yeah, wise.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.500
 Humpty mind.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.800
 Another taboo.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.580
 Even if you're allowed to make reindeer based clothing, right?

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:14.300
 In some groups of people, you would match your clothes to the sex of the caribou that

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.300
 the skin came from.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.300
 Cool.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.900
 So men, human men would wear male caribou based skin clothing.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.900
 Oh, okay.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.700
 Do you think you'd be able to tell the difference?

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.380
 I think if I was an Inuit, I would.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.380
 Yeah, you probably could.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.820
 Yeah, because apparently the skin is a bit tougher and therefore supposedly better for

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.820
 hunting in.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.700
 And the women would use the thinner skin from the female caribou for their own clothes.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.700
 Really?

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.700
 Because presumably they're, you know, doing the macrame or whatever.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.500
 Again, if you've only got the male caribou and you're freezing to death.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.500
 I know.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.300
 How rigidly did they adhere to these rules?

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.300
 I don't know.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.300
 I don't know.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.540
 One thing is, Franklin, you know, Franklin went on an excision of the North and he got

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.580
 trapped and they had no food and stuff.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.780
 He had some Inuit people with him there and he said that when they got really desperate,

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.140
 they would eat their clothes.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.140
 Oh, okay.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.140
 That's not.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.140
 So that's quite useful.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.140
 Yeah.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.140
 And sleds, right?

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.140
 As well?

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.420
 Yeah, sleds were sort of very frozen, they weren't frozen fish.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.420
 I think I remember they weren't frozen fish.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.420
 Some of them.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.420
 Wow.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.940
 Really, really frozen, consistently frozen fish.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:18.820
 And some of the Alu people, speaking of edible clothes, they had gut parkas.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:24.180
 So any large sea mammal, their guts are very good for making a weatherproof, waterproof,

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.820
 windproof parka out of.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.740
 And some Alu people made robes from sea otter intestine.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.740
 Wow.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.740
 You know that?

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.340
 Did your parents ever say to you if you did something bad, they say, I'll have your guts

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.340
 for garters.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.340
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.340
 They were probably alliotes.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.420
 That's where it comes from.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.540
 Because they really sort of had like three ingredients, they used all of it.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:51.460
 So they ate caribou poo, a real delicacy was caribou head and fermented contents of caribou

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.740
 stomach and lots of caribou droppings made into a soup.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:59.820
 Could we eat it with our, it was on a plate right now, would I get sick if I ate it?

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.820
 You might not be used to it.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:01.820
 I might well do.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.820
 It's poo, like we're talking poo.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.260
 I think you'd struggle to keep it down in the first instance.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.260
 Yeah.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.260
 Okay.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.260
 But it's not poo because it's a herbivore poo.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.980
 It's quite different to us eating our own poo, which is really, really bad for you.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.180
 It's like eating a cow pat.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.180
 Yeah.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.740
 I don't think we're recommending eating any poo.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.740
 Sorry, Emma.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.740
 It's a good job.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:22.340
 Captain Birdseye saw the fish freezing thing, not the poo eating thing.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:27.140
 Caribou head poo soon, that has not taken off.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.740
 How different would the world be right now?

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:35.300
 Waitrose freezer section would be an exciting place.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.900
 There are damn things about whether Inuit people were especially adapted and were, because

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.300
 they're, you know, this stuff about the Mediterranean diet, you know, lots of vegetables, lots of

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.580
 olive oil and so on.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.780
 People wondered for a long time why Inuit people were able to live on a diet that's basically

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.980
 just fat and protein.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.980
 Yeah.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.980
 There's no carbohydrate.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.980
 Where's the vitamins coming from?

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.980
 Where's the vitamins?

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.980
 It's confusing.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.700
 Almost no vegetation, apart from a little bit in summer.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.780
 And they do have a few genetic adaptations, it's believed now, which make it easier for

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.660
 them to eat a lot more fat than everyone else and survive.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:12.820
 They have slightly bigger livers because they need to make more glucose from protein.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.460
 They whee a lot more to get rid of all the extra urea that they're taking in in their

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.460
 diet.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.460
 Oh, so annoying to be weeing so much when you're in such a cold place.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.460
 I know.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.460
 I know.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.460
 It's bad.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.460
 Yeah.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.460
 They must have a system where you don't need to take things out.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.820
 There's an otter-gut-tuned system that's...

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.940
 You've got to be like astronauts at that point, right?

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.940
 Yeah.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.940
 There are lots of...

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:38.220
 They were genuinely less healthy in other ways, as in, you know, they had lots of hardening

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:42.860
 of the arteries dating back hundreds of years, just like this, urating mostly fat and protein.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.860
 Yeah.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.860
 Makes sense.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.620
 Sometimes they just find a tiny bird, an arctic bird, and they swallow it whole.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.580
 Skin it and swallow it whole, which I'm impressed you can swallow a bird whole.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.580
 This is just what the...

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.580
 Helping is a bird?

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.580
 Wait a minute.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.860
 Was there a spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside them?

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.860
 Yeah.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.300
 Eventually they swallow the whole reindeer.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.460
 Kiviak is one thing that they do.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:12.100
 So they get a seal skin, and they fill it with loads of tiny little orcs, little birds.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.100
 A-U-K.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.100
 Yeah.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.100
 Not A-W-K.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.100
 Orcs.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.500
 It's a bit orcs.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:23.940
 So you have about 300 little orc birds, and you put them in a seal skin, and then you bury

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.580
 it under some rocks and ferment it, and then eventually you eat it.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.520
 So you have to use orcs.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:34.820
 In 2013, there was a load of people from the town of Sierra Palak, and they made Kiviak

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.540
 out of ideducks.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.700
 And ideducks don't ferment as well as orcs, and a few people died because they need to

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:45.100
 ferment in the proper way that makes them edible.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.100
 Silly billies.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.780
 That's why there are these taboos, is because it's actually really sound food guidance that

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.620
 people have learned through trial and error for centuries.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.620
 Yeah.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.260
 I mean, that would make sense for there to be a taboo against eating ideducks fermented

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.260
 inside a seal.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.260
 Yeah.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.260
 Yeah.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.780
 Do you know what the Scandinavian Sammy use reindeer spleen for?

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:08.940
 That is like a question for the news quiz.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:15.620
 So this week, one of the Sammy people of the Arctic been doing with reindeer spleen.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620
 Santa sacks?

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.100
 Oh, very nice.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:23.180
 It is Dewey, but it's for a particular group of people in your civilization tweets.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.180
 Well, babies.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.180
 Got any one?

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.180
 Oh, nice.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.180
 So they're easy to suck on.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.980
 They're slightly a sort of training food.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.980
 Okay.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:30.980
 Spleen.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.980
 That makes sense because a lot of the food that people were eating was just solid frozen.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.860
 Even though you were saying they sometimes thawed it, very often they just didn't have

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.100
 the equipment to make a fire, big enough to thaw it.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.500
 So and it's so hard for a newborn baby to chow down on a massive frozen chunk of raw

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.500
 meat.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.500
 So frozen jerky.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.540
 Not the reason why very little baby food is frozen jerky.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.540
 Yeah.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.540
 Yeah.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.020
 But yeah, reindeer spleen is apparently good for your tot.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.020
 Well, there you go.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:41:01.260
 And if you run out of those little Ella pouches, that's something to consider.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:09.620
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.620
 Okay.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.960
 My fact this week is that men can have three penises without knowing it.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.220
 So I checked.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.220
 And yeah.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.220
 Surprise.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.220
 Yeah.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.220
 Surprise.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.540
 And then they have the normal four, the normal five.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.540
 Yeah.

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.700
 This is very interesting, isn't it?

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.940
 Because they're not obvious.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.580
 No, they're not.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.380
 They're hidden inside your body.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.900
 This was a thing called trifalia.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:42.040
 And it was only seen in a human for the first time in 2020 in a newborn baby.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:47.960
 But then in 2024, I think, or 2023, there was a recent study from the University of Birmingham

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:54.780
 Medical School where they dissected a 78-year-old man who donated his body to science and found

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.900
 that he had an extra two penises hidden up there.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.900
 Yeah.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:41:59.900
 It's hidden inside.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.900
 And they were inside his scrotum.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.900
 Yeah.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.900
 So they were small.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.900
 They were really, really small.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.820
 Well, let's not judge, honey.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.820
 Okay.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.820
 Yeah.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.820
 They were really small.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:15.540
 And they kind of, they attached to his normal penis, like the urethra kind of went through.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.080
 They said that there was no dead end.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:24.000
 So if you imagine, like, if the urine had not had a real, just a straight place to go,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.840
 then he might have got a lot of urine infections and stuff like that.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.040
 But actually, it seemed like mostly everything was kind of fine there.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:35.360
 He might have experienced some pain during sex if he got some internal erections and

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.360
 wondering what that was.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.360
 That's ironic, isn't it?

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.360
 Yeah.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.840
 Well, your free penises might make sex less pleasant.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.840
 That's, you know.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.840
 That is ironic.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.840
 You think it would have the opposite effect.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.840
 Yeah.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.140
 Seven thousand spoons when all you need is a knife, isn't it?

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.140
 Right.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.140
 Free penises when all you need is a good chag.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.140
 Okay.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:55.580
 They were called two small, super-numerary penises stacked in a sagittal orientation

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.340
 posterior inferiorly to the primary penis.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.340
 Lovely stuff.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:00.340
 Right.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.340
 Sexy.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.340
 Yeah.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.340
 And one was more of a main one, wasn't it?

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.340
 Yeah.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.340
 He had one.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:06.340
 He had one main penis.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.340
 Oh, sorry.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.340
 Sorry.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.340
 He had the main main one.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.340
 The big guy.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.340
 And then he had two.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.340
 The big guy.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.340
 The big guy.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.840
 The sweet old guy.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.840
 The good enough guy.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.840
 I didn't actually really know the layout, the structure of the penis very well until

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.840
 this.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.720
 So you've got these two bodies of tissue, one on top and one underneath.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.160
 The corpus cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum, the urethra runs through the middle.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.840
 And so in his mini penises, he had those spongy bits as well.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:39.800
 And in the secondary penis, the second main one, the stand-in, the urethra actually did

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.480
 still run through the middle of that.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.480
 Yeah.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.660
 And then the second main one, the urethra didn't even bother, just skipped it out.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.180
 But it was so small that it didn't really matter.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.180
 Yeah.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.860
 But the corpus cavernosa is the bit that fills up with the blood.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.420
 That's the, I think we might have mentioned it before.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.820
 That's the bit that fills the blood, which allows you to have an erection.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:55.820
 Yeah.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.820
 Yeah.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:57.820
 Let's look at this guy.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.820
 This is quite recent news.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.820
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.820
 He's lived a long life, 78 years.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.340
 He's probably had chats with his family as he's going, "What do you think I'll be remembered

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.340
 for?

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.340
 What do you think they'll talk about me?"

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.740
 He's got one of his kids sat there and his two tiny kids sat next to him.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:15.800
 I just think what a great tragedy he never knew.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.800
 Yeah.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.800
 I know.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.800
 Yeah.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.800
 Exactly, right?

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.800
 So sad.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.800
 You'd want to know.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.800
 Yeah.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.800
 I mean, who knows what everyone listening to this podcast will have?

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.880
 People might have extra fingers or extra, also you can get extra nipples, can't you?

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.760
 But really subtle ones that you can barely tell that they're there.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760
 Yeah.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760
 Yeah.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760
 So, you know, there's all sorts you can have.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.760
 Well, these things are quite rare.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.720
 And I was thinking about it would be good if we were more likely to have some of these

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720
 interesting extra body parts.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.720
 Yeah.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.720
 So, I was looking at the more likely ones.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:47.020
 And, you know, the 20% of people, maybe up to 30%, estimates vary, have an extra spleen.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.140
 Oh, that would be useful when we're feeding our kids.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.140
 Yeah.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.140
 Is that right?

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.140
 Yeah.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.620
 The splinunculi, an extra spleen.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.620
 Yeah.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.620
 And it's a little accessory spleen.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.020
 They tend to be very small and quite near your main spleen.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.020
 And yeah.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.020
 I think we don't really know why.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.420
 I think they think it's often you'll get a little injured or bumped when you're younger

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.860
 and it'll split off from the main spleen.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:11.560
 So, this isn't done in the womb, it's not the fetus that causes it.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560
 I don't think so.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.560
 No, it's not.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.240
 So, there was a guy who was playing Ultimate Frisbee one day.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.240
 He was slightly injured.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.240
 He rupted his spleen.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.240
 So, not good.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.880
 And the doctors who operated on him later said, "By the way, you know about all your other

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.880
 spleens?"

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:23.880
 And he didn't.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.440
 And so, the spleen, it sort of filters out damaged red blood cells and it's very, very

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.440
 useful.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.440
 Although, it's not crucial.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.680
 A lot of people have a spleen off and it's fine.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.680
 Yes.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.680
 That's true.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.440
 But it has a role in the immune system and things like that.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.240
 And it's, as you say, it's not essential.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.820
 But if it's hurt, bits of it splinter off through the body and it depends where they

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.820
 land.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.540
 So, if they land somewhere with a good blood supply, they will grow into another micro

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.540
 spleen.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.420
 And sometimes, if you're having your spleen out, the doctors will just chop it up and

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.500
 hope a new one grows somewhere in you, like chopping up a worm, basically.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.220
 Oh, does that actually, I thought they didn't know if that worked yet.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.220
 I said they hope.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.220
 I didn't say they guarantee it.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.220
 They hope.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:05.180
 Because something else that I also read weirdly, conversely, is if you're having a splinectomy,

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.920
 which is like if you've got blood disorder or something, you have to have your spleen

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.920
 out.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.620
 The doctors have to know if you've got an extra spleen, because if your main spleen's

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:16.400
 malfunctioning, your tiny extra one will also be malfunctioning somewhere.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.000
 So you have the main one out, but, you know, the malfunction will stay.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.080
 So you've got to search the whole, but you've got to open up someone's entire body and search.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.080
 Yeah.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.560
 There's another thing which is called the LRP5 gene, which when it has a mutation,

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.920
 bones have a higher density about them.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.880
 So they've noticed that there are people who just can't break their bones.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.380
 Obviously if you really, really went for it, ultimately it could break, but in a situation

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.380
 where most people would break their bones, they would just not have a crack.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:47.580
 And it seems to happen a lot in America, in Connecticut, who people have been identified.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.700
 So something's going on.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.900
 The mutation is passing through genetically.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:55.700
 But one of the symptoms where you could know that you have this is difficulty staying afloat

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.700
 while swimming.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.700
 Anna.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.700
 Anna.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700
 Dun, dun, dun.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.380
 The only person we know to sink in the Dead Sea.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.380
 Oh my God.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:07.960
 And my mum was so weirdly close to that guy from Connecticut, who used to visit all the

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.720
 time when I was a kid.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720
 That's amazing.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.280
 Have you ever broken a bone?

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.280
 No.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.560
 Oh no, I've broken loads of bones.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.760
 Only small ones though.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.760
 Like wrist bones and my jaw.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.760
 I think it would count.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760
 It still can't damage.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760
 Good job.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760
 Only the minor ones.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.600
 You were with me when I broke my jaw in fact, weren't you?

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.600
 Yes.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.600
 I don't get any more facts wrong on QI.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.600
 Wow.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:36.060
 It's a top shipping run, guys.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.420
 There was an interesting thing in 2020, which is the first medical case I think of someone

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.020
 who was shot in the chest but survived because his heart was on the opposite side of his

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.260
 body to most people.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.260
 Brilliant.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.260
 Cool.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.620
 It actually happened.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:54.740
 So this is a thing called cytosine versus where all of your organs are on the wrong side.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:59.940
 There's about one in 6,000 to 12,000 people have it, but most people would never know

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.360
 they had it.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:07.120
 But what's kind of interesting is Dr. No had it in the novel, in the James Bond novel.

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.520
 And he was shot in the wrong side of his body just like this guy in the medical literature

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.760
 a few years ago.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.640
 He survived and he got a God complex because he thought this makes me special and that's

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.120
 why he became such a bad guy.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.120
 Oh, sorry.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.120
 Dr. No did.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.120
 Not the other guy.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:25.320
 Did Dr. No think his heart was in the right place then?

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.320
 No.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.320
 And that's where the saying comes from.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.780
 No, he knew that, like the doctors told him and he was like, that makes me special.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.100
 So I should take off the world.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.140
 That has been used in a few plot points.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:42.260
 I remember my dad and I watching a movie and him explaining to me because a lady shoots

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.140
 a man in the chest and leads him to die, but she shot him.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.140
 She knows.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:47.140
 And it's love.

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.740
 Your heart is quite near the middle, isn't it?

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:49.740
 Yeah.

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.780
 It's nearer the middle than we all think, which is just out of the left nipple.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:52.780
 Yeah.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.780
 It's got to be a very good shot, hasn't it?

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.100
 And you're still going to scrape probably a bit of it.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.620
 Because what does it really affect?

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:01.420
 The Cetus inversus thing where you're the other way around because your lungs are unaffected.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:02.420
 Yeah.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:03.420
 Oh, liver.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.540
 Because you've only got one liver, one spleen, gallbladder.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:11.440
 Also your spleen, as we've heard, could be literally anywhere, but your liver is a big

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.440
 one, I think.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.440
 Yes.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.440
 Yeah.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440
 Because that's massive, isn't it?

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.440
 Yeah.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.180
 I mean, you probably will die if you've been shot in the chest anyway, right?

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.180
 We should say.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.180
 Again.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.180
 Don't hope.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.240
 Don't eat poo and don't get shot in the chest on the wrong side if you're going to take

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.120
 any message from this podcast.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.920
 All these things about unusual body parts that we're talking about.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:37.180
 I think it might interest a guy called Etienne de Beaumont, who was someone living in Paris

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.700
 in the early 20th century.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.380
 He was a big old posh-o, and he liked to do lots of parties and stuff.

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:48.380
 He was a friend of Coco Chanel, and one of his parties in 1919, the theme of it was that

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.420
 every guest had to arrive with the most interesting body parts exposed.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.420
 Cool.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.760
 Whatever you think your most interesting body part is, if it's your head, lucky you.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.260
 If it's your spleen, tough.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.260
 Very tough.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.920
 What would you go for, Andy?

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:05.920
 Sorry to put you on the spot.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.920
 No, it's fine.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.920
 Well, that weird growth down there is...

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:09.920
 I would go with that one.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.920
 That'll be it.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.920
 That'll be it.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.920
 I've got a wood-shaped finger.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:16.200
 The finger which got shut in the door when I was tiny, and it's permanently disfigured

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200
 as a result.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200
 Oh, wow.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.200
 Yeah.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200
 Do you think that would break the ice at this party?

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.700
 I think I'm not getting invited to this party.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.600
 If I filled in the form and put that on my RFP, this is the guy I'm going to come with

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.600
 exposed.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.600
 I think it's going to be a dull night for a little bit.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.200
 That's weird because I was going to pick my finger as well, because I've got a little

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.040
 freckle on it, which makes it...

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.240
 I can make my finger look like an elephant.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.600
 I've got a trunk and an ear.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.280
 I think we'd be put on the same table.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.280
 I don't think...

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.780
 I think you'll be put on the table with other people who could do elephant impressions.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.360
 Oh, no.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.360
 Do we know what...

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.960
 If anyone beat Dan and Andy's suggestions for this party...

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.960
 No, I don't have...

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.380
 I really tried to find out, and really every source just tells you that this existed.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.580
 I got it from a biography of Coco Chanel, initially.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.400
 Because you're either going for, "Oh, my genitals are the most interesting part.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.400
 Here they are."

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.400
 Or, "What is it?

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400
 What can you expose?"

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.400
 Your knee, ankle, elbow.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.400
 It's joints and genitals.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400
 It's going to be this party.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.400
 Genitals.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.120
 You don't want interesting genitals, do you?

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.260
 I think you want standard genitals.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.200
 But they might be the most interesting thing about you.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.200
 Okay.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.200
 Yeah.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.200
 If you have three.

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.200
 Yeah.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.200
 Oh, God.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.280
 If you had three.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.080
 On things you don't know are inside your body.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.080
 Yeah.

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.080
 I mean, this is silly.

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.240
 I was just reading a doctor talking on Reddit about experiences of patients with weird stuff

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.960
 inside the body and saying, "A young man came in complaining of a headache."

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.120
 And sorry, this was someone who worked in radiology and said, "They wanted to find out

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.120
 the cause of the headache."

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:44.360
 And so I said, "We asked for a history, anything that could be relevant to this headache."

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.160
 The man said, "Nothing to report.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.320
 We scan his head, CT shows a bullet rattling loose between his nasal cavity and his brain."

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.480
 So I asked the guy, "Have you ever been shot in the face?"

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:58.200
 And he said, "Oh, yeah, I guess I forgot to mention that."

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.480
 You've got to run back through your full history sometimes.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.480
 Yeah.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.480
 That's amazing.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:08.200
 I read something about a guy in 1911 called Alexander Grail who fought two duels near

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.200
 New Orleans.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:14.480
 And the first one, someone sort of stabbed him with a sword and it went right through

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.000
 his lungs.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.640
 And then he went to hospital, managed to come out, but he was really sick.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.600
 He walked, they said in the newspapers, he was bowed like an octogenarian.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.720
 He had a bit of surgery, but the doctors are like, "Ah, this is not going to work, mate.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.000
 You've got a huge abscess there.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.760
 You're going to die."

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.000
 And he thought, "Well, I'm going to die now, so I might as well do more duels.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.400
 I might as well say fuck you to the people who upset me in the past."

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:43.240
 So he got into another duel and the person shot him in the exact place where the sword

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.640
 had gone in and it drained the abscess and he got cured.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.640
 Yes.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.640
 Oh, God.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.640
 I think you'd say that.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.640
 Wow.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.520
 That is where we get the comic bonk on the head twice, restores your memory.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.520
 Yeah.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.520
 The 3D glasses.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:57.520
 3D version.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.520
 Wow.

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.480
 And sorry, is this one of the things we are recommending?

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.480
 Yes, absolutely.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.480
 OK.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.040
 If you've been in a duel and got an abscess on your lungs, get in another duel immediately.

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:14.440
 OK, that's it.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.440
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.840

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.040
