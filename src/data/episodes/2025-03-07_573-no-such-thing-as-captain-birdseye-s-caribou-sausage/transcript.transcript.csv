00:00:11,00:00:17,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:17,00:00:20,to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:00:24,00:00:29,"Anna Tyshinsky, and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:29,00:00:34,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:34,00:00:37,Starting with fact number one and that is Andy.
00:00:37,00:00:42,"My fact is, after the first bridge from Europe to Asia was built, it took 33 years to build"
00:00:42,00:00:47,"the second and 2,453 years to build the third."
00:00:47,00:00:49,Let's set the scene.
00:00:49,00:00:50,Okay.
00:00:50,00:00:51,Istanbul.
00:00:51,00:00:52,Yeah.
00:00:52,00:00:53,Yeah.
00:00:53,00:00:54,"Famously, a city between two continents."
00:00:54,00:00:55,Europe and Asia.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Those are the two.
00:00:56,00:00:57,Amazing.
00:00:57,00:00:58,And it is amazing.
00:00:58,00:00:59,It is amazing.
00:00:59,00:01:00,It's a city in two continents.
00:01:00,00:01:02,"It's the only one in the world, I think, right?"
00:01:02,00:01:03,Yes.
00:01:03,00:01:04,Is it?
00:01:04,00:01:06,There's like a bit of trivia that says that.
00:01:06,00:01:09,That's what the Istanbul tourists would want you to believe.
00:01:09,00:01:10,Yeah.
00:01:10,00:01:12,So that's why I've really got all of the Istanbul sites.
00:01:12,00:01:13,Yeah.
00:01:13,00:01:18,"And in between is a body of water, the Bosphorus Strait, which links, what is it, the Black"
00:01:18,00:01:19,Sea and the...
00:01:19,00:01:24,You've got the Sea of Marmara in the middle of Turkey and the Black Sea above it and the
00:01:24,00:01:25,GNC.
00:01:25,00:01:27,And then eventually the Med.
00:01:27,00:01:28,Eventually the Med.
00:01:28,00:01:30,"Eventually the Atlantic, you know?"
00:01:30,00:01:33,"And then eventually the Pacific, if you want to go all the way around."
00:01:33,00:01:34,Yeah.
00:01:34,00:01:35,That's Istanbul.
00:01:35,00:01:43,"And the Bosphorus Strait, across it, supposedly says Herodotus, was first crossed in 513 B.C."
00:01:43,00:01:46,"Because Darius, who we talked about a while ago on this podcast..."
00:01:46,00:01:47,Darius the Great.
00:01:47,00:01:48,"Yeah, we did."
00:01:48,00:01:49,Darius the Great.
00:01:49,00:01:50,He was apparently pursuing the Scythians.
00:01:50,00:01:51,And it was all a bit...
00:01:51,00:01:52,Yeah.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"Anyway, the bridge that was built then was a pontoon bridge."
00:01:54,00:01:55,Yeah.
00:01:55,00:01:58,And you had a load of boats together and you'd walk across the top of the boats.
00:01:58,00:01:59,And you say load of boats.
00:01:59,00:02:00,It's a load of load of boats.
00:02:00,00:02:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:01,00:02:04,"Like that's a thousand boats or something attached, because that's a very big distance"
00:02:04,00:02:05,to cover.
00:02:05,00:02:06,"Yeah, it is."
00:02:06,00:02:07,Seven hunj.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Seven hunj.
00:02:08,00:02:09,We want to be specific.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Seven hunj.
00:02:10,00:02:11,Which Herodotus probably wasn't...
00:02:11,00:02:12,What?
00:02:12,00:02:13,Seven hunj?
00:02:13,00:02:14,700.
00:02:14,00:02:15,Is that not a standard abbreviation?
00:02:15,00:02:16,700.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"Oh, my God."
00:02:17,00:02:18,"Get with it, kids."
00:02:18,00:02:19,Yeah.
00:02:19,00:02:20,And then the second one was built 33 years later.
00:02:20,00:02:21,"They presumably thought, ""Oh, this is a really good idea."""
00:02:21,00:02:23,And that was slightly lower.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"That was the Hellespont, apparently, which is just..."
00:02:25,00:02:26,"Oh, that's the Dardanelles."
00:02:26,00:02:28,"So that's a different part of Istanbul, right?"
00:02:28,00:02:29,It is indeed.
00:02:29,00:02:30,Yeah.
00:02:30,00:02:31,It's just southwest of the Bosphorus.
00:02:31,00:02:36,And then 1973 AD was when the first permanent bridge was built across the Bosphorus.
00:02:36,00:02:37,Yeah.
00:02:37,00:02:38,And what did they do in the meantime?
00:02:38,00:02:39,Boats.
00:02:39,00:02:40,Yeah.
00:02:40,00:02:41,Lots of boats.
00:02:41,00:02:44,"Can I ask, jumping back to the first bridge, they're all boats tied together."
00:02:44,00:02:47,How long did that last until someone needed their boat back?
00:02:47,00:02:48,It's a temporary thing.
00:02:48,00:02:49,Yeah.
00:02:49,00:02:50,It's a temporary thing.
00:02:50,00:02:51,I think it's to make an individual journey.
00:02:51,00:02:52,Yeah.
00:02:52,00:02:53,"When you've got an army, you want to get from one to the other."
00:02:53,00:02:54,Right.
00:02:54,00:02:55,"It had one mission, basically."
00:02:55,00:02:56,Exactly.
00:02:56,00:02:57,Yeah.
00:02:57,00:02:59,And you might just rip it up after that because you don't want the enemy to follow you.
00:02:59,00:03:00,Yeah.
00:03:00,00:03:06,"But then 1973, Turkey got its first cross Istanbul bridge, and it made a massive difference."
00:03:06,00:03:07,Nice bridge.
00:03:07,00:03:08,Have you been across it?
00:03:08,00:03:09,Yeah.
00:03:09,00:03:10,Very cool.
00:03:10,00:03:11,Did you go on foot?
00:03:11,00:03:12,No.
00:03:12,00:03:13,In a taxi.
00:03:13,00:03:14,You're only allowed one day a year on foot.
00:03:14,00:03:15,"Oh, is it?"
00:03:15,00:03:16,Really?
00:03:16,00:03:17,It's the marathon.
00:03:17,00:03:18,It's when they have their annual marathon.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Oh.
00:03:19,00:03:20,"You're allowed to run from Europe to Asia, which is very cool."
00:03:20,00:03:21,That is cool.
00:03:21,00:03:22,Yeah.
00:03:22,00:03:23,It's awesome.
00:03:23,00:03:24,"Do you guys know what ""bosphorus"" means?"
00:03:24,00:03:25,No.
00:03:25,00:03:26,"""Bos"" means like cow."
00:03:26,00:03:27,Mm-hmm.
00:03:27,00:03:30,"It's actually almost forgettable, sort of."
00:03:30,00:03:31,"Oh, okay."
00:03:31,00:03:33,So like phosphorus was something...
00:03:33,00:03:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:34,00:03:35,It's like lightbringer.
00:03:35,00:03:36,So is it cowbringer?
00:03:36,00:03:37,Okay.
00:03:37,00:03:38,"No, it's not."
00:03:38,00:03:45,"It's similar to origin to porous, a channel, or a ford, a cow ford, or in fact, an oxford."
00:03:45,00:03:46,It's Oxford.
00:03:46,00:03:47,Whoa.
00:03:47,00:03:48,Bosphorus is Oxford.
00:03:48,00:03:49,Really?
00:03:49,00:03:50,Yeah.
00:03:50,00:03:54,"A ford is a very, very, very small river that you could just walk across."
00:03:54,00:03:55,Yes.
00:03:55,00:04:00,"And having been across this part of Istanbul, there's no way that has ever been a ford."
00:04:00,00:04:01,It was a ford.
00:04:01,00:04:06,"It was a ford in the myth, which caused this, because it was a myth of a woman called Io,"
00:04:06,00:04:10,"who was transformed into a bull, and then she walked across the bosphorus."
00:04:10,00:04:11,She forded it.
00:04:11,00:04:12,Very cool.
00:04:12,00:04:13,"Because, you know, in myth, shit like that can happen."
00:04:13,00:04:15,"Just cow, because otherwise we'll get letters."
00:04:15,00:04:16,"Cow, sorry."
00:04:16,00:04:17,Cow.
00:04:17,00:04:18,Yeah.
00:04:18,00:04:19,Yes.
00:04:19,00:04:20,She wasn't turned into a bull.
00:04:20,00:04:26,"Well, one cool thing about the bosphorus is that the water flows in both directions."
00:04:26,00:04:29,"So on the top of the water, it flows in one way."
00:04:29,00:04:32,"And then if you go really low down, it flows the other way."
00:04:32,00:04:37,"And so that means that if you're someone on a boat, you can just float on top and you'll"
00:04:37,00:04:40,nicely float across in the direction of the water.
00:04:40,00:04:41,Yeah.
00:04:41,00:04:45,"But if you want to go in the other direction, what you have to do is you get a big rock,"
00:04:45,00:04:49,"drop it down really, really deep, and then the current underneath the water will drag"
00:04:49,00:04:53,"your rock in the other direction, and that'll drag your boat in that direction."
00:04:53,00:04:55,"Wait, that's not on way anyone traveled that."
00:04:55,00:04:56,That sounds exactly plausible to me.
00:04:56,00:04:57,Is that work?
00:04:57,00:04:58,It genuinely works.
00:04:58,00:04:59,"I mean, wouldn't work with a cruise ship."
00:04:59,00:05:00,"Oh, as good as that."
00:05:00,00:05:01,What size is this?
00:05:01,00:05:02,And if you're a fisherman.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"Yeah, okay."
00:05:03,00:05:04,Is it done?
00:05:04,00:05:05,"Well, in history, it has been done."
00:05:05,00:05:06,That's amazing.
00:05:06,00:05:08,"These days, I don't think you get those kind of boats around there."
00:05:08,00:05:09,But that's very cool.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"But it is an actual river, isn't it?"
00:05:11,00:05:16,"And it was the world's first ever discovered underground, underwater, sorry, river."
00:05:16,00:05:17,And it's so cool.
00:05:17,00:05:21,"And underneath, it's to do with the salinity going from a salty bit to a less salty bit"
00:05:21,00:05:23,"of water, the river underneath the sea."
00:05:23,00:05:28,The river's got like banks and meanders and all the features that you have in a normal
00:05:28,00:05:29,river.
00:05:29,00:05:30,A lot of boat lakes.
00:05:30,00:05:31,A lot of boats.
00:05:31,00:05:32,A lot of boats.
00:05:32,00:05:33,A lot of boats.
00:05:33,00:05:34,A lot of boats.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"Yeah, yeah, a lot of banana boats."
00:05:35,00:05:40,And the shopping trolleys at the surface are nice.
00:05:40,00:05:46,"So the bridges is one way to get across now, but they also have now the underground rail."
00:05:46,00:05:49,And that started being built in 2004.
00:05:49,00:05:52,"They wanted to build it quite quickly, because one bridge, having that one bridge, was just"
00:05:52,00:05:54,crazy amount of traffic.
00:05:54,00:05:58,"The problem was, is they tried to pick a spot that just wouldn't have any archaeology around"
00:05:58,00:05:59,it.
00:05:59,00:06:00,"It's hard in Turkey, isn't it?"
00:06:00,00:06:01,So hard.
00:06:01,00:06:02,The center of the ancient world.
00:06:02,00:06:05,"Particularly when you've had like, you know, bridges that were made of boats, you know,"
00:06:05,00:06:09,"thousands of them, 700, sorry, Anna."
00:06:09,00:06:10,And so that's exactly what happened.
00:06:10,00:06:14,They started going down and they started finding all of these shipwrecks that had been buried
00:06:14,00:06:17,into the ground and they had to pause.
00:06:17,00:06:23,"And so between 2005 and 2013, they were just digging up something like 36 ships that they"
00:06:23,00:06:24,found.
00:06:24,00:06:25,They found all this pottery.
00:06:25,00:06:28,"And so after they found everything, they thought it was all done."
00:06:28,00:06:32,"They then said, okay, we just want one more quick look, just one little tiny look."
00:06:32,00:06:38,"And then discovered a 6000 BC, unknown Neolithic dwelling that they had no idea existed with"
00:06:38,00:06:39,everything down there.
00:06:39,00:06:41,And then it just took even more time.
00:06:41,00:06:43,But I feel a bit conflicted about that.
00:06:43,00:06:45,I just think we don't owe the past this much.
00:06:45,00:06:47,I'm sorry to irritate all archaeologists listening.
00:06:47,00:06:51,We wouldn't know about these things if it wasn't for the fact some brilliant person
00:06:51,00:06:55,"had the idea of building an underground railway, which is much cooler than an old boat."
00:06:55,00:06:56,I'm sorry.
00:06:56,00:06:57,Do you know whose side you're on here?
00:06:57,00:07:01,And I think this is going to make you happy because I know you're a big fan is Odeon felt
00:07:01,00:07:02,exactly the same as you.
00:07:02,00:07:04,And he said there's a bunch of rubbish pots and pans.
00:07:04,00:07:06,And the more important thing is infrastructure.
00:07:06,00:07:08,And I know you guys see I-to-I a lot.
00:07:08,00:07:12,So I think of myself as the strongman of this podcast.
00:07:12,00:07:17,And threw himself a pissed off birthday party in the unopened tunnel underneath saying this
00:07:17,00:07:18,has to be open.
00:07:18,00:07:19,This is enough.
00:07:19,00:07:20,This is too much.
00:07:20,00:07:23,And it eventually was on the date that he suggested.
00:07:23,00:07:25,A lot of traffic goes through those straights.
00:07:25,00:07:27,"The bus for a straight to the Dardanelles, doesn't it?"
00:07:27,00:07:37,"I think it's, is it 4 percent of the world's oil goes through there and there's a rule that"
00:07:37,00:07:42,"says that everyone has to pay, but it's a very small amount."
00:07:42,00:07:47,They did some sort of deal 50 years ago and said that one of those there's a toll bridge
00:07:47,00:07:50,in me where you pay to pay to pay to go across it.
00:07:50,00:07:51,Like that.
00:07:51,00:07:52,Yeah.
00:07:52,00:07:53,It's just one old boy who's collecting to pay.
00:07:53,00:07:54,"Sorry, Emma."
00:07:54,00:07:55,What's entry?
00:07:55,00:07:56,Are you living in?
00:07:56,00:07:57,What?
00:07:57,00:07:58,They exist.
00:07:58,00:07:59,They exist in Lancashire.
00:07:59,00:08:00,Fair bit.
00:08:00,00:08:01,I'm sorry.
00:08:01,00:08:04,Do you have to pay to pay every time you play five P the one in is to P and that the property
00:08:04,00:08:05,makes quite a lot of money out of it in a year.
00:08:05,00:08:07,It's enough to sustain the property.
00:08:07,00:08:08,Wow.
00:08:08,00:08:09,Do you have a role of two P's in your car?
00:08:09,00:08:13,"I actually think if you don't have the two P's they now let you go anyway, but you really"
00:08:13,00:08:14,should.
00:08:14,00:08:15,It's round upon not to.
00:08:15,00:08:16,What are they going to do?
00:08:16,00:08:20,"If you're sitting there blocking the two P toll, yeah, eventually it'll cost them more"
00:08:20,00:08:22,not to let you through.
00:08:22,00:08:23,You won't be popular.
00:08:23,00:08:24,Wow.
00:08:24,00:08:25,Yeah.
00:08:25,00:08:26,"I have been to one where it's 20 P. Actually, they hiked it to 15."
00:08:26,00:08:27,I was really annoyed.
00:08:27,00:08:28,"Is that what you're about to say, James?"
00:08:28,00:08:29,They hiked it.
00:08:29,00:08:30,"No, I'm not."
00:08:30,00:08:35,But this is what about turn of what is this ridiculous thing you're talking about Anna to.
00:08:35,00:08:36,Yeah.
00:08:36,00:08:37,I'm very familiar with those.
00:08:37,00:08:42,"I'm sorry for comic conceit I wanted to, you know, tease Anna, I wanted to have my cake"
00:08:42,00:08:43,and eat it.
00:08:43,00:08:48,"But anyway, so Turkey are now building a canal or they want to build a big old canal that"
00:08:48,00:08:52,goes right the way through Turkey so that you can either go on this route that goes
00:08:52,00:08:59,through the Dardanelles and through the Bosphorus and pay your two P or you can pay more and
00:08:59,00:09:02,"go through the canal, but you know, you get through quicker and you don't have to queue"
00:09:02,00:09:03,up.
00:09:03,00:09:04,It's an amazing idea.
00:09:04,00:09:05,It's like double Bosphorus.
00:09:05,00:09:09,"It's like imagine if you had a road where you had to pay two P to go across it, or then"
00:09:09,00:09:13,you had the M6 toll road that went the other way and you can't choose which way to go.
00:09:13,00:09:18,I think the first person who suggested that canal was Suleyman the Magnificent in the
00:09:18,00:09:19,1500s.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"And it's been suggested by almost every Turkish leader, Ottoman leader since then."
00:09:22,00:09:25,"But yeah, the ones caught on."
00:09:25,00:09:26,Just a quick thing on the Ottoman Empire.
00:09:26,00:09:30,I don't think we've said before much about the Ottomans.
00:09:30,00:09:36,"So if you became Sultan, the traditional thing to do was immediately off all your brothers"
00:09:36,00:09:42,"plus any uncles, cousins, like anyone would just murdered immediately."
00:09:42,00:09:45,Anyone who could possibly take over from you apart from your son.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Exactly.
00:09:46,00:09:47,But you've got 19 sons.
00:09:47,00:09:50,"And when your son becomes Sultan, he'll kill the other 18."
00:09:50,00:09:54,"And also your main son is cool, but all the other sons are like put in cages."
00:09:54,00:09:55,They're all put in cages.
00:09:55,00:09:56,I thought it was cages.
00:09:56,00:09:59,"Basically, it's a suite of rooms, but they're called the cages."
00:09:59,00:10:02,"And then they change their policy in about 1600 and they said, right, we can't keep on"
00:10:02,00:10:03,murdering everyone.
00:10:03,00:10:06,So we'll just keep everyone in the cages.
00:10:06,00:10:11,"And you would be kept there with some, apparently some concubines, but concubines who won't"
00:10:11,00:10:14,"have any children so that, you know, you don't present a threat because you're not producing"
00:10:14,00:10:15,more heirs.
00:10:15,00:10:16,How do you make sure?
00:10:16,00:10:18,So it's all sort of post-menopausal concubines?
00:10:18,00:10:21,"I believe, I think that's the drill, yeah, yeah."
00:10:21,00:10:23,And you only allowed a few very specific hobbies.
00:10:23,00:10:24,Apparently mainly macrame.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Making knots.
00:10:25,00:10:29,"It's basically elaborate knot, knot work."
00:10:29,00:10:32,And then you can tie yourself a rope ladder in it.
00:10:32,00:10:33,It's terrible.
00:10:33,00:10:38,"Like they went, another one's escaped Sultan, but by a rope bridge, yeah, rope bridge."
00:10:38,00:10:44,"That's why the multiple attempts at bridges across the Bosphorus are all rope based, none"
00:10:44,00:10:45,of them survived.
00:10:45,00:10:49,But every so often the Sultan would die and they'd have to get someone out of the cages.
00:10:49,00:10:52,And basically you'd have this blithering idiot who only knew how to do macrame and
00:10:52,00:10:56,not experienced in ruling the largest empire on the planet.
00:10:56,00:10:57,So weird.
00:10:57,00:10:58,Did that happen?
00:10:58,00:11:00,Did you have the cage ruler?
00:11:00,00:11:01,Yeah.
00:11:01,00:11:02,Wow.
00:11:02,00:11:07,"So imagine you're in the 17th century, you're visiting the Sultan, you're like a big wig"
00:11:07,00:11:11,but from another part of Turkey or the Ottoman Empire.
00:11:11,00:11:14,"You turn up at the Topkapi Palace in the middle of Istanbul, that's where he lives and he"
00:11:14,00:11:16,gives you some sorbet.
00:11:16,00:11:17,Okay.
00:11:17,00:11:23,"Normally you get some nice white sorbet, but this time it's red."
00:11:23,00:11:25,It's strawberry flavour.
00:11:25,00:11:26,What does that mean?
00:11:26,00:11:27,I'm about to be executed.
00:11:27,00:11:28,I'm afraid so.
00:11:28,00:11:29,No.
00:11:29,00:11:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:30,00:11:31,That's what would happen.
00:11:31,00:11:32,That's how you find out?
00:11:32,00:11:33,You see your sorbet?
00:11:33,00:11:37,"I just need to say, I need to say it was sherbet, not sorbet."
00:11:37,00:11:38,Sherbet.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Oh.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Which is a similar design.
00:11:40,00:11:41,Just as nice.
00:11:41,00:11:42,Yeah.
00:11:42,00:11:43,But I misread it on my file.
00:11:43,00:11:47,"And yeah, so you would give this sherbet, normally it'd be white with your little lolly"
00:11:47,00:11:51,"that you would dip in it and lick it, but now it was the red flavour."
00:11:51,00:11:53,"And so you're going to get executed, right?"
00:11:53,00:11:54,Yeah.
00:11:54,00:11:56,But there was a loophole.
00:11:56,00:12:02,You could escape execution if you could outrun the executioner in a 300-yard foot race.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Wow.
00:12:03,00:12:04,Okay.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"So the executioner who's also a gardener, by the way."
00:12:06,00:12:07,Yeah.
00:12:07,00:12:08,"Oh, so he might be a bit limber."
00:12:08,00:12:09,He is going to be limber.
00:12:09,00:12:10,Yeah.
00:12:10,00:12:11,He's going to be strong.
00:12:11,00:12:12,Yeah.
00:12:12,00:12:13,He's going to work outside a lot.
00:12:13,00:12:14,So how do you do it?
00:12:14,00:12:15,"Well, you just have to race him."
00:12:15,00:12:16,"Oh, I thought that was a question."
00:12:16,00:12:17,"If you beat him, you're fine."
00:12:17,00:12:20,"And if you don't beat him, you're executed and your body's held into the sea."
00:12:20,00:12:25,"See, I was thinking, pretend to eat the sherbet, keep it in your hand as you run, drop it down"
00:12:25,00:12:27,"as a trap, let him slip, easy peasy."
00:12:27,00:12:28,No.
00:12:28,00:12:29,"He's a gardener, damn."
00:12:29,00:12:33,What you want to do is you want to leave an unusual flower in his path.
00:12:33,00:12:35,So he can't help but stop and take a cutting for later.
00:12:35,00:12:36,Yes.
00:12:36,00:12:40,"No, what you want to do is you want to take him on a path where you come to a 2P toll and"
00:12:40,00:12:44,"you go through, but he, having left his change, back at the castle."
00:12:44,00:12:47,"Do you get to eat the sherbet beforehand, just in case you don't live to be able to"
00:12:47,00:12:48,eat it afterwards?
00:12:48,00:12:49,"I think you do, yeah."
00:12:49,00:12:50,"Oh, that's nice."
00:12:50,00:12:51,"It's a sort of last meal, isn't it?"
00:12:51,00:12:54,"It's going to put you off a little bit, though, because you know it's your last meal."
00:12:54,00:12:56,I don't think you're going to enjoy that sherbet quite as much.
00:12:56,00:12:59,Are there stats on how many people won or lost against the gardener?
00:12:59,00:13:02,"If there are, they didn't come up in the course of my research."
00:13:02,00:13:03,"Yeah, right."
00:13:03,00:13:04,Fair enough.
00:13:04,00:13:05,"This was 17th century, did you say?"
00:13:05,00:13:06,That's correct.
00:13:06,00:13:11,I was trying to look into anything else that has survived Istanbul from the 17th century
00:13:11,00:13:16,"onwards that we still have today, and I found, if you look at a drum kit on most of the biggest"
00:13:16,00:13:20,"bands out there in the world, you'll see on the symbols, a lot of them will say Zildjian."
00:13:20,00:13:24,"There's like four major symbol brands out there, right?"
00:13:24,00:13:31,"This one was created in 1623 by Evadas Zildjian, and it was a family that were trying to bring"
00:13:31,00:13:36,"metals together to create gold, but instead created these amazing symbols and they would"
00:13:36,00:13:40,"make little symbols that go on each finger, so you could make it, so as to create noise"
00:13:40,00:13:41,and war and so on.
00:13:41,00:13:46,"That's not going to be a big noise, the fingers imagine, 10,000 Ottomans."
00:13:46,00:13:50,"So this became a product that they started making, and it slowly over the years morphed"
00:13:50,00:13:55,"into becoming symbols that were being used by drummers, and then when the Beatles appeared"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"on the Ed Sullivan show, which was seen, probably the most viewed show, I think, at"
00:14:00,00:14:03,"its time, Zildjian was on there, and every drummer started taking it up."
00:14:03,00:14:04,Really?
00:14:04,00:14:07,"Yeah, it's become the biggest brand."
00:14:07,00:14:09,This is a Turkish Ottoman family in the 1600s.
00:14:09,00:14:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:14:10,00:14:11,"Yeah, in the 1600s."
00:14:11,00:14:12,That's fantastic.
00:14:12,00:14:14,"So that survived into pop, you'll see it at the Grammys, you'll see it everywhere in"
00:14:14,00:14:15,modern day.
00:14:15,00:14:19,"I just like it when Dan starts a fact, watching the excitement on your face and in your voice"
00:14:19,00:14:25,as you get closer and closer to the Beatles climax.
00:14:25,00:14:32,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is My Fact."
00:14:32,00:14:37,"My fact this week is that because he talks so fast, when Martin Scorsese spoke at an"
00:14:37,00:14:42,"international film festival, they had to provide an additional translator to first translate"
00:14:42,00:14:46,his fast words into slower words.
00:14:46,00:14:48,They're still the same words.
00:14:48,00:14:49,They're same words.
00:14:49,00:14:50,You wouldn't know.
00:14:50,00:14:51,They sound completely different.
00:14:51,00:14:55,Does this mean that the event went on way after Scorsese finished talking?
00:14:55,00:14:59,"Because what matters to the audience is hearing the words from the second interpreter, right?"
00:14:59,00:15:04,"So you've got Scorsese, who's going to be translated into, let's say it's French, right?"
00:15:04,00:15:08,"The French translator is listening to Scorsese going, ""I have no idea what you're saying"
00:15:08,00:15:09,"because you're so speedy."""
00:15:09,00:15:14,So they brought another English speaker in to listen to Scorsese speak really fast
00:15:14,00:15:17,"and then go, ""So what he's saying is in English..."""
00:15:17,00:15:19,"Yeah, so that will take twice as long, won't it?"
00:15:19,00:15:20,"Oh yeah, absolutely."
00:15:20,00:15:21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:21,00:15:22,You could trim it down a bit along the way.
00:15:22,00:15:23,You could.
00:15:23,00:15:26,"Unfortunately, Scorsese and his films are known for being break and slice and brief."
00:15:26,00:15:28,So I'm sure his speech is the same.
00:15:28,00:15:33,"Yeah, this is a very little known nugget that I got from Michael Palin's Diaries."
00:15:33,00:15:37,"So I'm reading his second volume of Diaries, Halfway to Hollywood."
00:15:37,00:15:40,"This happened on the 24th of September, 1980."
00:15:40,00:15:44,He was out to dinner in Los Angeles with Scorsese and he told them this over a dinner party.
00:15:44,00:15:48,"So I haven't seen that referenced anywhere else, but I had since asked a bunch of filmmakers"
00:15:48,00:15:52,"and watched a few interviews and yeah, he's powerhouse when he's speaking."
00:15:52,00:15:55,"It's funny because I wouldn't imagine it because of all his films, they have these"
00:15:55,00:16:00,languorous long pauses and people who speak very slowly before murdering people.
00:16:00,00:16:03,It's weird to think of him as just like a chipmunk.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"I've never heard him speak, I don't think."
00:16:04,00:16:05,"No, I mean either."
00:16:05,00:16:08,"He's slower these days, I would say, but he's 80."
00:16:08,00:16:11,"But you've seen him speak, I suppose, James, through cinema."
00:16:11,00:16:12,Oh.
00:16:12,00:16:15,You've heard what he wants to say.
00:16:15,00:16:20,"Yeah, I suppose I have for four hours at a time."
00:16:20,00:16:22,I thought I'd never seen one of his films.
00:16:22,00:16:25,"I had to look through the whole, I thought I'd managed it because it doesn't, it's not"
00:16:25,00:16:29,"my kind of thing, you know, like gangsters and mafia stuff, I don't know what I think."
00:16:29,00:16:30,No big worms.
00:16:30,00:16:31,No big worms.
00:16:31,00:16:33,It turns out I've seen two of his films.
00:16:33,00:16:34,You cannot get away from Scorsese.
00:16:34,00:16:35,I've seen Cape Fear.
00:16:35,00:16:36,Oh yeah.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"That's a bit of a stinker and Shutter Island, which is amazing."
00:16:39,00:16:40,"Yes, love Shutter Island."
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Oh, what a film."
00:16:41,00:16:42,So good.
00:16:42,00:16:43,I'm interested.
00:16:43,00:16:44,"Cape Fear isn't a stinker, is it?"
00:16:44,00:16:45,It's a classic.
00:16:45,00:16:46,"It's a classic, yeah."
00:16:46,00:16:47,"A bit silly, isn't it?"
00:16:47,00:16:48,I guess so.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Yeah.
00:16:49,00:16:50,A lot of our own opinions.
00:16:50,00:16:51,"Yeah, exactly."
00:16:51,00:16:52,Sorry.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"It's not like a classic, grassy kind of movie."
00:16:53,00:16:54,"No, sorry."
00:16:54,00:16:58,"What I mean is it's a highly garlanded, commercially successful and critically acclaimed stinker"
00:16:58,00:16:59,in my eyes.
00:16:59,00:17:04,"Yeah, but amazing filmmaker."
00:17:04,00:17:08,"So the movies, if you don't know, Taxi Driver, he made, he made, what else did he make?"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"Mean Streets, The Goodfellas, The King of New York, yeah."
00:17:12,00:17:13,"The Irishman, I watched."
00:17:13,00:17:14,The Irishman in Recent Times.
00:17:14,00:17:15,Yeah.
00:17:15,00:17:16,Raging Bull.
00:17:16,00:17:17,Raging Bull of Wall Street.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Oh yeah.
00:17:18,00:17:19,That's a big one.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Yeah.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Raging Bull does seem to have saved his life.
00:17:21,00:17:25,"Well, he was a huge, co-caddox, what's it mean, the '70s, and-"
00:17:25,00:17:27,So why he was speaking so fast?
00:17:27,00:17:29,I think it will have contributed.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Yes.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"He had something to do with it, actually, yeah."
00:17:32,00:17:36,"And he just made a film, which actually was a bit of a flop with what's she called Dorothy"
00:17:36,00:17:37,from The Wizard of Oz's Daughter.
00:17:37,00:17:38,Liza Minnelli.
00:17:38,00:17:39,Thank you.
00:17:39,00:17:40,He nearly died.
00:17:40,00:17:44,He ended up in hospital and he was really bleeding internally everywhere.
00:17:44,00:17:46,They thought he was going to brain hemorrhage.
00:17:46,00:17:49,"He said, ""I was bleeding internally everywhere and I didn't know it."
00:17:49,00:17:50,My eyes were bleeding.
00:17:50,00:17:51,"My hands, everything."
00:17:51,00:17:54,"My mouth, my nose, coughing up blood."""
00:17:54,00:17:58,"Anyway, he sort of was surviving, but he was very depressed."
00:17:58,00:18:01,"And he didn't really want to make Raging Bull, I don't think, but Robert De Niro, who'd"
00:18:01,00:18:03,"made a few films with him, was really keen on it."
00:18:03,00:18:07,And De Niro rocked up beside his hospital bed with a script for Raging Bull that I think
00:18:07,00:18:11,"had been sort of rewritten, re-drafted and said, ""Look, you've got to do this, mate."
00:18:11,00:18:12,What are you going to do?
00:18:12,00:18:14,"Are you going to sit here and die or are you going to do Raging Bull?"""
00:18:14,00:18:16,And he did it and it's one of the best films I've ever made.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"Another thing he made was a film called New York, New York."
00:18:19,00:18:20,Yes.
00:18:20,00:18:23,"It's the one we're talking about with Liza Manelli in it, maybe."
00:18:23,00:18:25,"I think it was, yes."
00:18:25,00:18:26,Yeah.
00:18:26,00:18:31,"And so she sang the song theme from New York, New York, which is the one that everyone knows."
00:18:31,00:18:32,"New York, New York."
00:18:32,00:18:33,No.
00:18:33,00:18:34,"New York, New York."
00:18:34,00:18:35,I want to be a part of it.
00:18:35,00:18:36,"Oh, that one."
00:18:36,00:18:37,"Yeah, yeah."
00:18:37,00:18:40,"There are two songs called New York, New York."
00:18:40,00:18:41,What's yours?
00:18:41,00:18:44,"That one's from an old sort of Bing Crosby film, isn't it?"
00:18:44,00:18:45,"New York, New York."
00:18:45,00:18:47,It's a hell of a town.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"Yeah, that one."
00:18:48,00:18:49,Something's up.
00:18:49,00:18:50,Yeah.
00:18:50,00:18:51,Exactly.
00:18:51,00:18:52,"But no, not that one."
00:18:52,00:18:53,So I was teasing.
00:18:53,00:18:54,You were.
00:18:54,00:18:55,It was real.
00:18:55,00:18:56,This is my 2P Tolbridge moment.
00:18:56,00:18:57,You all right?
00:18:57,00:18:58,I feel like a fool.
00:18:58,00:18:59,Thank you.
00:18:59,00:19:00,Have your money back.
00:19:00,00:19:04,"Well, so the interesting thing about that is that film came out in 1977 and Liza Manelli"
00:19:04,00:19:11,"sang the theme from New York, New York and then later in 1980, Frank Sinatra sang New"
00:19:11,00:19:15,"York, New York, which everyone thinks like associates Frank Sinatra with New York, New"
00:19:15,00:19:16,York.
00:19:16,00:19:19,He never sang until 1980 because it wasn't written until 1977.
00:19:19,00:19:20,That's insane.
00:19:20,00:19:21,I don't know.
00:19:21,00:19:22,He was still singing in 1980.
00:19:22,00:19:23,I know.
00:19:23,00:19:26,"So all of those times when he's in the rap park and, you know, doing, being absolutely"
00:19:26,00:19:29,"mega famous, he never sang New York, New York because it hadn't been written yet."
00:19:29,00:19:30,How interesting.
00:19:30,00:19:31,Isn't that interesting?
00:19:31,00:19:32,That's really odd.
00:19:32,00:19:33,Yeah.
00:19:33,00:19:37,I feel like I've got a false memory of being alive in the 50s and the 60s and hearing him
00:19:37,00:19:38,sing it.
00:19:38,00:19:39,Exactly.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"I think that like a lot of people who are older would know that, but for me it was really"
00:19:41,00:19:42,incongruous.
00:19:42,00:19:47,"Yeah, incongruous."
00:19:47,00:19:48,He loved his cocaine.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Massive in Coke in the Coke world.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"Well, he did it a lot, right?"
00:19:50,00:19:51,Yeah.
00:19:51,00:19:55,"I mean, he did it to the point that there was a film festival he went to in Cannes in '78."
00:19:55,00:19:56,He was unable to score a Coke there.
00:19:56,00:20:01,So he dispatched a private jet to go on a Coke run to pick it up for him and bring it
00:20:01,00:20:02,back.
00:20:02,00:20:03,So it was a massive thing.
00:20:03,00:20:05,And also he made a movie called The Last Waltz.
00:20:05,00:20:07,So he's quite an amazing director.
00:20:07,00:20:08,He doesn't just do films.
00:20:08,00:20:12,He does documentaries and quite seminal documentaries as well.
00:20:12,00:20:14,And so he's done a Beatles documentary.
00:20:14,00:20:15,Oh my gosh.
00:20:15,00:20:16,There we go.
00:20:16,00:20:17,Wow.
00:20:17,00:20:18,And let's move on.
00:20:18,00:20:19,Now we've loved that foil for this fact.
00:20:19,00:20:20,Let's plow on.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Shall we?
00:20:21,00:20:32,"But there was one which was called The Last Waltz and one of the musicians, Neil Young,"
00:20:32,00:20:36,had a bit of coke under his nose and this made it to the film.
00:20:36,00:20:39,"And so they were sitting in the editing room going, ""What do we do about this?"""
00:20:39,00:20:43,And he had VFX literally invent a whole new method that's still used in film today.
00:20:43,00:20:47,They called it the traveling bogey where they were able to knock out the coke from his nose
00:20:47,00:20:51,by having a thing follow and track the coke all along in the shot.
00:20:51,00:20:55,"So when you see it, the coke's not in the shot, but it was in the print."
00:20:55,00:20:57,And cinema was advanced as a result of it.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"That's basically a Snapchat filter, isn't it, really?"
00:21:00,00:21:01,Yeah.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Where they find one bit.
00:21:02,00:21:07,"All this is your nose or your ears or your eyes and they can scan and put, make you look"
00:21:07,00:21:08,like a potato or whatever.
00:21:08,00:21:09,Yeah.
00:21:09,00:21:10,That's a really good call.
00:21:10,00:21:11,They should have done that.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Just put a potato over his head.
00:21:12,00:21:13,I think it was Neil Young.
00:21:13,00:21:14,"Yeah, Neil Young."
00:21:14,00:21:20,"None of this stuff, I have to say, is in the IMDb on Martin Scorsese, which reads..."
00:21:20,00:21:22,"Let me just read you a couple of things from it, right?"
00:21:22,00:21:23,Okay.
00:21:23,00:21:25,Because I think Scorsese might have written this.
00:21:25,00:21:28,"Despite being known for directing extremely dark and often very violent movies, he is"
00:21:28,00:21:32,"known in real life to be a very friendly, polite and mild man person who gets along very"
00:21:32,00:21:34,well with his cast and crew.
00:21:34,00:21:37,"Because so many of his actors win or are nominated for awards, actors are dying to work with"
00:21:37,00:21:38,him.
00:21:38,00:21:42,Scorsese rarely uses our rated language in real life.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"I mean, it's just pure hagiography."
00:21:44,00:21:45,Yeah.
00:21:45,00:21:47,There's a film he made recently called The Irishman.
00:21:47,00:21:48,Yep.
00:21:48,00:21:49,Which I missed.
00:21:49,00:21:54,I watched it on the flight to Lanzarote and it was almost the exact length of the flight.
00:21:54,00:21:55,Nice.
00:21:55,00:21:57,It's about four hours.
00:21:57,00:21:58,It seems long.
00:21:58,00:21:59,"I mean, it is long, clearly."
00:21:59,00:22:03,"But one thing they did there, because James, am I right in thinking people age a bit?"
00:22:03,00:22:05,"Oh, I don't fucking remember it."
00:22:05,00:22:09,It was just four hours of tedious gangster stuff.
00:22:09,00:22:10,"Well, okay."
00:22:10,00:22:11,"Basically, people get older and then younger."
00:22:11,00:22:14,It's the same characters and you're going back in life and then forward in life and
00:22:14,00:22:15,then back together.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"That does happen, yeah."
00:22:16,00:22:17,"You know, they're 30 and then they're 80 and blah, blah, blah."
00:22:17,00:22:22,"Anyway, they had to have a posture coach telling people, ""No, stop it."
00:22:22,00:22:24,You're getting up from the chair like an 80-year-old.
00:22:24,00:22:25,"You're 30 in this scene."""
00:22:25,00:22:26,Oh.
00:22:26,00:22:31,"Just saying, ""No, look, for this scene, you are a healthy fit young man, so can you jump"
00:22:31,00:22:32,"out of it?"""
00:22:32,00:22:33,So confused.
00:22:33,00:22:34,That's very funny.
00:22:34,00:22:35,That's weird.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Another one he did was Hugo.
00:22:36,00:22:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:37,00:22:38,Probably my favorite Scorsese film.
00:22:38,00:22:39,Embarrassingly.
00:22:39,00:22:40,The Victor Hugo biopic.
00:22:40,00:22:41,"No, no."
00:22:41,00:22:45,It's like a family film about the early days of cinema and stuff.
00:22:45,00:22:46,Lumiere.
00:22:46,00:22:47,Is that what it's called?
00:22:47,00:22:48,Lumiere Brothers.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:50,It's a gorgeous film.
00:22:50,00:22:51,It's a really good film.
00:22:51,00:22:53,And it was in 3D.
00:22:53,00:22:55,It was one of the early 3D films.
00:22:55,00:22:59,And one interesting thing about it is there was a guy called Bruce Bridgeman.
00:22:59,00:23:00,Okay.
00:23:00,00:23:04,"He was a neuroscientist, but he had this weird thing where he couldn't perceive depth."
00:23:04,00:23:09,"So whenever he went to, like, let's say he went to a big church in Europe and he wanted"
00:23:09,00:23:14,"to admire it, he couldn't really tell what was here and what was there."
00:23:14,00:23:15,It was all flat to him.
00:23:15,00:23:20,So he used to walk up and down the church so that the things closer to him would move
00:23:20,00:23:22,quicker than things further away from him.
00:23:22,00:23:26,"You know, like when you're on a train and like anything that's really close to the train"
00:23:26,00:23:29,flies past and then the mountains in the background go really slowly.
00:23:29,00:23:33,He would use that parallax effect to understand depth.
00:23:33,00:23:38,"Anyway, he went to watch Hugo and he put on these 3D glasses and suddenly he could see"
00:23:38,00:23:42,"the 3D and when he left the movie, he could see 3D."
00:23:42,00:23:43,It had fixed his problem.
00:23:43,00:23:45,Isn't that amazing?
00:23:45,00:23:46,That's incredible.
00:23:46,00:23:47,That is good.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Yeah.
00:23:48,00:23:49,So he didn't have to keep the glasses on.
00:23:49,00:23:50,No.
00:23:50,00:23:51,It just fixes.
00:23:51,00:23:56,"No, it just fixed his 3D and kind of triggered something in his brain that said, ""Oh, this"
00:23:56,00:23:57,"is how it works."""
00:23:57,00:23:58,How weird.
00:23:58,00:23:59,Was that in the IMDB?
00:23:59,00:24:00,No.
00:24:00,00:24:04,What is going on?
00:24:04,00:24:10,"Just on interpreters, as this fact was about, it does sound insanely stressful."
00:24:10,00:24:14,"They do have, at the European Parliament, they have to switch every half an hour because"
00:24:14,00:24:17,"otherwise they just can't, they get very, very stressed and they can't have mistakes"
00:24:17,00:24:18,"as well, right?"
00:24:18,00:24:19,Exactly.
00:24:19,00:24:21,They can't have a booth with one other interpreter.
00:24:21,00:24:26,"So you seamlessly switch over every half an hour and if you're not on shift, you should"
00:24:26,00:24:27,not eat an apple.
00:24:27,00:24:28,You can eat a banana.
00:24:28,00:24:29,Why?
00:24:29,00:24:30,Because it's too noisy.
00:24:30,00:24:35,"It will distract your fellow interpreter who's trying desperately to listen to, ""Okay,"
00:24:35,00:24:39,"James is doing some Foley now and the audience is just listening to this disgusting sound."""
00:24:39,00:24:40,Wow.
00:24:40,00:24:41,That's cruel.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"And if James, you'd had a nana there, it would have been fine."
00:24:44,00:24:46,I've actually been eating a banana this whole time.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Exactly.
00:24:47,00:24:48,Exactly.
00:24:48,00:24:50,The gestures Dan's been doing have been actually more distracting.
00:24:50,00:24:53,"No, but half an hour, half an hour is about apparently the safe limit."
00:24:53,00:25:00,"And in 2009, Colonel Gaddafi spoke at the UN and his interpreter allegedly collapsed"
00:25:00,00:25:05,after 75 minutes of mental stuff from Gaddafi.
00:25:05,00:25:08,"He just, the interpreter's brain just went into spasm and he had to be helped away."
00:25:08,00:25:11,"He cried out or something like, ""I can't do this anymore."""
00:25:11,00:25:12,Yeah.
00:25:12,00:25:13,"I think that is a problem, isn't it?"
00:25:13,00:25:18,"So some interpreters talk about this with translating Donald Trump, which is you have"
00:25:18,00:25:21,certain phrases that he uses that just kind of doesn't make sense.
00:25:21,00:25:22,"But in English, we all kind of let it slip."
00:25:22,00:25:25,"But as a translator, you've got to do it."
00:25:25,00:25:27,"Yeah, you don't translate the words, do you?"
00:25:27,00:25:28,Translate the meaning of the words.
00:25:28,00:25:31,I think they just suffer from what he actually means is the issue.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:34,What is he actually trying to say there?
00:25:34,00:25:37,"The sentence lasts 20 minutes and it just goes, ""Yeah, yeah."""
00:25:37,00:25:39,And I think I can see how it's a pressurizing thing.
00:25:39,00:25:43,"Like a different kind of interpretation is to do sign language, right?"
00:25:43,00:25:47,And we have seen meltdowns publicly where they are often accused of not knowing sign
00:25:47,00:25:48,language.
00:25:48,00:25:49,I wonder if that's the case.
00:25:49,00:25:53,So do you remember there was the Obama speech after Mandela had died and the guy just clearly
00:25:53,00:25:54,didn't know.
00:25:54,00:25:57,"He still maintains that he does know it, but he was hallucinating."
00:25:57,00:26:02,"And in America, Hurricane Irma, there was a moment where on TV, they were saying, ""You've"
00:26:02,00:26:03,got to be safe.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"There's flood zones you've got to get to, you've got to consider saying in shelters."""
00:26:06,00:26:11,"And the guy who apparently knew sign language was just making words like, ""Bear monster"
00:26:11,00:26:12,"and pizza."""
00:26:12,00:26:16,"And he says, ""Well, my brother's deaf and I do know sign language, but I just, it was"
00:26:16,00:26:17,"too much."""
00:26:17,00:26:19,I think this is the stress of it.
00:26:19,00:26:23,"My cousin is actually a professional translator, a Russian translator and he was saying the"
00:26:23,00:26:26,"stress of it like, ""You're fluent, you've been fluent for years and then suddenly you'll"
00:26:26,00:26:27,"have a blank."""
00:26:27,00:26:32,He said he was translating Russian and at one point someone was talking about baking
00:26:32,00:26:33,and said the word kek.
00:26:33,00:26:36,"And he knew that's a loan word from British, so that's fine."
00:26:36,00:26:41,"So kek means cake in Russian, that's what the loan word they were using."
00:26:41,00:26:42,"He was like, ""I know it's a loan word from British."
00:26:42,00:26:43,What do I say with kek?
00:26:43,00:26:44,I can't get your keks on.
00:26:44,00:26:49,"There's trousers and there's translated cake as trousers and you panic in the moment."""
00:26:49,00:26:54,One thing interpreters all do apparently is they interrupt people.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Okay.
00:26:55,00:26:56,They're nearest to the noise.
00:26:56,00:27:00,I shouldn't have mentioned this fact.
00:27:00,00:27:01,I knew.
00:27:01,00:27:02,"I knew it would be you, James."
00:27:02,00:27:05,"If listen, you'd notice I haven't spoken for a while."
00:27:05,00:27:08,It's because I've literally been eating the apple the whole time.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"Unfortunately, swallowed it just in time to interrupt Andy."
00:27:10,00:27:11,Go back to it.
00:27:11,00:27:16,"No, basically the whole thing of being an interpreter is you learn what people around"
00:27:16,00:27:21,you are going to say and you slightly are anticipating the end of a sentence.
00:27:21,00:27:25,"So when they clock off after a long day of interpreting, they go home and their partner"
00:27:25,00:27:28,"says to them, ""I'm making,"" and they say, ""Chicken nuggets."
00:27:28,00:27:29,I know.
00:27:29,00:27:30,"I know."""
00:27:30,00:27:32,And their spouses and children are furious with them all the time because they just will
00:27:32,00:27:34,not let them finish the sentence.
00:27:34,00:27:40,"Certainly relatedly, I saw a head of an interpreting service who hires people out for like UN and"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"stuff, talking about how you do it."
00:27:42,00:27:46,"And he was saying in his video, ""You have to be really careful about what distance you"
00:27:46,00:27:48,"keep from the person who you're interpreting."""
00:27:48,00:27:52,"At first, I thought, ""Sure, you just keep the distance where you can hear them."""
00:27:52,00:27:53,Right.
00:27:53,00:27:57,But he meant in terms of the time you leave between when they speak and when you start
00:27:57,00:27:58,interpreting.
00:27:58,00:28:03,"So, you can't get too close to them as in if Andy starts speaking and I'm interpreting"
00:28:03,00:28:04,him.
00:28:04,00:28:08,"If I literally interpret after every single word he says, ""I'll mess up the grammar."
00:28:08,00:28:10,I won't be able to predict the end of the sentence.
00:28:10,00:28:11,"I won't get the syntax."""
00:28:11,00:28:14,"Yeah, because Andy might be starting a sentence and then go on one of his whimsical endings"
00:28:14,00:28:15,of a sentence.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Exactly.
00:28:16,00:28:17,You don't have to do that shit.
00:28:17,00:28:21,"Whereas if you're converting Dan, you just mentioned the Beatles, and you trust that"
00:28:21,00:28:25,train will come in.
00:28:25,00:28:32,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:28:32,00:28:37,My fact this week is that Indigenous Arctic peoples were absolutely banned from eating
00:28:37,00:28:40,the surf and turf.
00:28:40,00:28:45,"Now, we said before we went on air, before the mics came on, that neither one's going"
00:28:45,00:28:47,to know what surf and turf is.
00:28:47,00:28:53,"Yes, I thought this was a universally accepted cuisine, but Dan, maybe because of his unique"
00:28:53,00:28:55,upbringing and others don't.
00:28:55,00:28:59,"So, surf and turf is basically where you get dumped like a massive lobster next to a massive"
00:28:59,00:29:01,steak or meat and fish.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Land and sea.
00:29:02,00:29:03,Land and sea.
00:29:03,00:29:08,"I was wondering, can it be like oysters and ham?"
00:29:08,00:29:10,Is that technically surf and turf?
00:29:10,00:29:14,"Where I come from, it's usually scampy and very, very cheap steak."
00:29:14,00:29:16,"Oh, okay, okay."
00:29:16,00:29:20,"Fish fingers in a Scotch egg would technically count as surf and turf, right?"
00:29:20,00:29:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:21,00:29:22,"Yeah, there you go."
00:29:22,00:29:23,"So, there are lots of things that count."
00:29:23,00:29:28,You can all think of meat from land and meat from the sea and do it yourself at home.
00:29:28,00:29:29,Yes.
00:29:29,00:29:30,"Oh, it's a venomless fun."
00:29:30,00:29:31,"God, it's a fun game."
00:29:31,00:29:32,I don't know.
00:29:32,00:29:33,I don't know.
00:29:33,00:29:34,I think that's debatable.
00:29:34,00:29:37,"Anyway, I don't know if this is still true."
00:29:37,00:29:43,"Obviously, there are a lot of Inuits left across Alaska and Canada, Greenland, and the"
00:29:43,00:29:48,"Yupik people and the Elute people all from that kind of region of the world, all used"
00:29:48,00:29:53,"to do it, but they've obviously integrated more into the outside world in the last hundred"
00:29:53,00:29:54,years.
00:29:54,00:29:55,"So, I don't know if they still do."
00:29:55,00:30:00,"But anyway, it was the idea that land and sea absolutely could not be mixed, mostly because"
00:30:00,00:30:03,you'd really upset the mistress of the sea.
00:30:03,00:30:04,And they went to such lengths.
00:30:04,00:30:10,"So, essentially, the only foods they had, 90% of the time, were seal and caribou and"
00:30:10,00:30:11,fish.
00:30:11,00:30:12,And fish.
00:30:12,00:30:13,"And fish, yes."
00:30:13,00:30:17,And they could never be eaten together.
00:30:17,00:30:20,They could never be cooked or stored together.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"In the dark months of the year, so like half of the year, they'd go and live out on the"
00:30:23,00:30:24,sea ice.
00:30:24,00:30:29,"And because they're on sea there, the women who did all the sewing were absolutely forbidden"
00:30:29,00:30:32,from sewing clothes because they're made of caribou skins.
00:30:32,00:30:35,So they'd have to do all their sewing in summer because you can't take the caribou skins
00:30:35,00:30:37,out onto the sea because that's mixing land and sea.
00:30:37,00:30:38,Was that surf and turf?
00:30:38,00:30:39,Yeah.
00:30:39,00:30:40,Surf and turf.
00:30:40,00:30:41,You're allowed to wear the caribou skins.
00:30:41,00:30:42,"Weirdly, you're allowed to wear."
00:30:42,00:30:44,"Yeah, you don't have to go naked out to the sea."
00:30:44,00:30:46,"You're allowed to wear them weirdly, but just not make them."
00:30:46,00:30:48,This taboo was so strict.
00:30:48,00:30:52,"So there was one as the thread thing, and you had to process all your caribou in the autumn"
00:30:52,00:30:55,before you then started hunting seal.
00:30:55,00:30:56,But there was another taboo.
00:30:56,00:31:02,"So fish that were caught in rivers and lakes, so trout and salmon, must not be cooked over"
00:31:02,00:31:06,a driftwood fire because driftwood comes from the sea.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"Oh, wow."
00:31:07,00:31:12,"So that is a land sea taboo where it's kind of fish from the land, if you like, and wood"
00:31:12,00:31:13,from the sea.
00:31:13,00:31:16,What if you caught your fish in some brackish water?
00:31:16,00:31:18,I think it's a strong line.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Is it a freshwater fish?
00:31:19,00:31:21,"Well, a salmon would go in between, wouldn't it?"
00:31:21,00:31:22,Yeah.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"But as soon as they'd entered, it was like even if the salmon were just 20 yards upstream"
00:31:25,00:31:28,"having come from the sea, it's like, no, the sea's out now."
00:31:28,00:31:32,"They're now river fish, it's bizarre."
00:31:32,00:31:36,"It wasn't easy, was it, living the life of an arctic person a hundred years ago."
00:31:36,00:31:39,"You wouldn't have thought you'd be introduced, imagine you were practically starving to death"
00:31:39,00:31:42,and all you've got is a bit of driftwood to catch your caribou on.
00:31:42,00:31:43,"Oh, fuck."
00:31:43,00:31:45,I guess we're going to die.
00:31:45,00:31:46,So interesting.
00:31:46,00:31:49,Is it one of those things where there's a great reason behind it?
00:31:49,00:31:52,And actually the religious thing or the mistress of the sea thing is just a justification.
00:31:52,00:31:53,I don't know.
00:31:53,00:31:58,"You know, like there's a thing where people who don't eat pig products, perhaps, is because"
00:31:58,00:32:02,"if you didn't cook them properly, you'd get terrible parasites and stuff."
00:32:02,00:32:03,Right.
00:32:03,00:32:06,"And the meat spoils faster in the middle to the sun, so that's why there's a pork taboo,"
00:32:06,00:32:07,that kind of thing.
00:32:07,00:32:08,I don't know.
00:32:08,00:32:10,Could have been like if you take the caribou meat out to sea and like spoil by the time
00:32:10,00:32:13,"you're out at sea or something, but it's lost in the midst of time and now it's all about"
00:32:13,00:32:16,pissing off the sea goddess.
00:32:16,00:32:19,I was reading a bit about their diets and the stuff they ate and this is about the turn
00:32:19,00:32:24,"of the 20th century, quite a few explorers, memoirs who went and lived with Inuits for"
00:32:24,00:32:29,long periods of time and one guy who was living with the copper Inuits who were off the island
00:32:29,00:32:35,"off the north of Canada, said that the only non-meat he ever saw them eat is the half-digested"
00:32:35,00:32:38,moss from the first stomach of a caribou or a reindeer.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"Oh, Sandy."
00:32:39,00:32:40,Sounds good to me.
00:32:40,00:32:41,"Yeah, you would have loved it."
00:32:41,00:32:43,I think that's unnecessarily picky by that.
00:32:43,00:32:49,"Yeah, it's a thing called rock tripe is what they eat, which is this, it's kind of, I think"
00:32:49,00:32:54,"it's more like in the moss, Andy, just to say, but it would grow on the rocks and then"
00:32:54,00:32:59,"you would scrape it off and you would eat it, but you had to soak it for long periods"
00:32:59,00:33:03,"and change the water a lot because if you didn't, it would basically give you the constant"
00:33:03,00:33:04,shits.
00:33:04,00:33:05,"Oh, no."
00:33:05,00:33:06,So you had to.
00:33:06,00:33:07,Yeah.
00:33:07,00:33:09,"So has it been, if it's in an animal stomach, has it kind of been pre-soaked?"
00:33:09,00:33:10,That would do it.
00:33:10,00:33:11,"That would help it, I guess."
00:33:11,00:33:13,Maybe a ferments a little bit in there.
00:33:13,00:33:14,"Yeah, maybe that's why they did it."
00:33:14,00:33:16,It's like having your oats pre-milked.
00:33:16,00:33:17,Yeah.
00:33:17,00:33:21,"So it came in like, I'm sort of imagining like a meat loaf because often it would be in the"
00:33:21,00:33:25,caribou's stomach and they'd take the stomach out wholesale and it would freeze obviously
00:33:25,00:33:27,because it's freezing and then you just hack off bits.
00:33:27,00:33:32,"So what you get is a nice mixture of, you know, like if you have a sort of sausage meat"
00:33:32,00:33:35,"loaf with like herbs through it, it's like you get a mixture of caribou's stomach and"
00:33:35,00:33:36,moss.
00:33:36,00:33:37,"Yeah, lovely."
00:33:37,00:33:38,You're frozen.
00:33:38,00:33:39,Yeah.
00:33:39,00:33:40,Very nice.
00:33:40,00:33:44,Another explorary type who witnessed the way that they ate their food and then transposed
00:33:44,00:33:45,it.
00:33:45,00:33:46,It was Captain Bird's Eye.
00:33:46,00:33:48,I had no idea about this.
00:33:48,00:33:49,What was this?
00:33:49,00:33:55,Captain Bird's Eye basically was out in Labrador for quite a while and he noticed all the
00:33:55,00:34:01,indigenous Inuit freezing their food and then being able to heat it later and it tastes
00:34:01,00:34:02,really good.
00:34:02,00:34:06,"Frozen food was happening already around the world, but the thawing process was really"
00:34:06,00:34:07,bad.
00:34:07,00:34:09,"If you unfroze your food, it suddenly lost its taste."
00:34:09,00:34:12,It was really oddly and the texture of it and so on.
00:34:12,00:34:17,And he applied the method that he saw the Inuit do to his frozen food company and that's
00:34:17,00:34:20,what sparked frozen food as a massive industry.
00:34:20,00:34:25,"And of course, Bird's Eye today never sell sausages because it's so tough."
00:34:25,00:34:26,"Land, surf and turf."
00:34:26,00:34:27,Yeah.
00:34:27,00:34:33,The early caribou intestine and moss was not popular with kids at tea time.
00:34:33,00:34:35,"Oh, you battered that."
00:34:35,00:34:36,Anyone's eating it.
00:34:36,00:34:37,Yeah.
00:34:37,00:34:41,"He noticed that when they've caught some fish and froze it in the middle of winter, it tastes"
00:34:41,00:34:45,way better than when they caught it in like the spring and froze it because it was so
00:34:45,00:34:49,much quicker that the freezing process happened that it just made things taste better and
00:34:49,00:34:53,"then that made him, you know, do his own version."
00:34:53,00:34:55,So basically his trick is free stuff really quickly.
00:34:55,00:34:56,Free stuff really good.
00:34:56,00:34:57,Flash freezing.
00:34:57,00:34:58,Yeah.
00:34:58,00:34:59,Kind of like flash frying.
00:34:59,00:35:00,But the opposite.
00:35:00,00:35:01,Wise words.
00:35:01,00:35:02,"Yeah, wise."
00:35:02,00:35:03,Humpty mind.
00:35:03,00:35:04,Another taboo.
00:35:04,00:35:08,"Even if you're allowed to make reindeer based clothing, right?"
00:35:08,00:35:14,"In some groups of people, you would match your clothes to the sex of the caribou that"
00:35:14,00:35:15,the skin came from.
00:35:15,00:35:16,Cool.
00:35:16,00:35:20,"So men, human men would wear male caribou based skin clothing."
00:35:20,00:35:21,"Oh, okay."
00:35:21,00:35:23,Do you think you'd be able to tell the difference?
00:35:23,00:35:25,"I think if I was an Inuit, I would."
00:35:25,00:35:26,"Yeah, you probably could."
00:35:26,00:35:28,"Yeah, because apparently the skin is a bit tougher and therefore supposedly better for"
00:35:28,00:35:29,hunting in.
00:35:29,00:35:32,And the women would use the thinner skin from the female caribou for their own clothes.
00:35:32,00:35:33,Really?
00:35:33,00:35:35,"Because presumably they're, you know, doing the macrame or whatever."
00:35:35,00:35:38,"Again, if you've only got the male caribou and you're freezing to death."
00:35:38,00:35:39,I know.
00:35:39,00:35:42,How rigidly did they adhere to these rules?
00:35:42,00:35:43,I don't know.
00:35:43,00:35:44,I don't know.
00:35:44,00:35:48,"One thing is, Franklin, you know, Franklin went on an excision of the North and he got"
00:35:48,00:35:50,trapped and they had no food and stuff.
00:35:50,00:35:54,"He had some Inuit people with him there and he said that when they got really desperate,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,they would eat their clothes.
00:35:56,00:35:57,"Oh, okay."
00:35:57,00:35:58,That's not.
00:35:58,00:35:59,So that's quite useful.
00:35:59,00:36:00,Yeah.
00:36:00,00:36:01,"And sleds, right?"
00:36:01,00:36:02,As well?
00:36:02,00:36:06,"Yeah, sleds were sort of very frozen, they weren't frozen fish."
00:36:06,00:36:08,I think I remember they weren't frozen fish.
00:36:08,00:36:09,Some of them.
00:36:09,00:36:10,Wow.
00:36:10,00:36:11,"Really, really frozen, consistently frozen fish."
00:36:11,00:36:18,"And some of the Alu people, speaking of edible clothes, they had gut parkas."
00:36:18,00:36:24,"So any large sea mammal, their guts are very good for making a weatherproof, waterproof,"
00:36:24,00:36:26,windproof parka out of.
00:36:26,00:36:29,And some Alu people made robes from sea otter intestine.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Wow.
00:36:30,00:36:31,You know that?
00:36:31,00:36:34,"Did your parents ever say to you if you did something bad, they say, I'll have your guts"
00:36:34,00:36:35,for garters.
00:36:35,00:36:36,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:36,00:36:37,They were probably alliotes.
00:36:37,00:36:41,That's where it comes from.
00:36:41,00:36:44,"Because they really sort of had like three ingredients, they used all of it."
00:36:44,00:36:51,"So they ate caribou poo, a real delicacy was caribou head and fermented contents of caribou"
00:36:51,00:36:54,stomach and lots of caribou droppings made into a soup.
00:36:54,00:36:59,"Could we eat it with our, it was on a plate right now, would I get sick if I ate it?"
00:36:59,00:37:00,You might not be used to it.
00:37:00,00:37:01,I might well do.
00:37:01,00:37:03,"It's poo, like we're talking poo."
00:37:03,00:37:06,I think you'd struggle to keep it down in the first instance.
00:37:06,00:37:07,Yeah.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Okay.
00:37:08,00:37:09,But it's not poo because it's a herbivore poo.
00:37:09,00:37:11,"It's quite different to us eating our own poo, which is really, really bad for you."
00:37:11,00:37:13,It's like eating a cow pat.
00:37:13,00:37:14,Yeah.
00:37:14,00:37:15,I don't think we're recommending eating any poo.
00:37:15,00:37:16,"Sorry, Emma."
00:37:16,00:37:17,It's a good job.
00:37:17,00:37:22,"Captain Birdseye saw the fish freezing thing, not the poo eating thing."
00:37:22,00:37:27,"Caribou head poo soon, that has not taken off."
00:37:27,00:37:29,How different would the world be right now?
00:37:29,00:37:35,Waitrose freezer section would be an exciting place.
00:37:35,00:37:40,"There are damn things about whether Inuit people were especially adapted and were, because"
00:37:40,00:37:44,"they're, you know, this stuff about the Mediterranean diet, you know, lots of vegetables, lots of"
00:37:44,00:37:45,olive oil and so on.
00:37:45,00:37:49,People wondered for a long time why Inuit people were able to live on a diet that's basically
00:37:49,00:37:51,just fat and protein.
00:37:51,00:37:52,Yeah.
00:37:52,00:37:53,There's no carbohydrate.
00:37:53,00:37:54,Where's the vitamins coming from?
00:37:54,00:37:55,Where's the vitamins?
00:37:55,00:37:56,It's confusing.
00:37:56,00:37:59,"Almost no vegetation, apart from a little bit in summer."
00:37:59,00:38:04,"And they do have a few genetic adaptations, it's believed now, which make it easier for"
00:38:04,00:38:07,them to eat a lot more fat than everyone else and survive.
00:38:07,00:38:12,They have slightly bigger livers because they need to make more glucose from protein.
00:38:12,00:38:16,They whee a lot more to get rid of all the extra urea that they're taking in in their
00:38:16,00:38:17,diet.
00:38:17,00:38:20,"Oh, so annoying to be weeing so much when you're in such a cold place."
00:38:20,00:38:21,I know.
00:38:21,00:38:22,I know.
00:38:22,00:38:23,It's bad.
00:38:23,00:38:24,Yeah.
00:38:24,00:38:25,They must have a system where you don't need to take things out.
00:38:25,00:38:28,There's an otter-gut-tuned system that's...
00:38:28,00:38:31,"You've got to be like astronauts at that point, right?"
00:38:31,00:38:32,Yeah.
00:38:32,00:38:33,There are lots of...
00:38:33,00:38:38,"They were genuinely less healthy in other ways, as in, you know, they had lots of hardening"
00:38:38,00:38:42,"of the arteries dating back hundreds of years, just like this, urating mostly fat and protein."
00:38:42,00:38:43,Yeah.
00:38:43,00:38:44,Makes sense.
00:38:44,00:38:48,"Sometimes they just find a tiny bird, an arctic bird, and they swallow it whole."
00:38:48,00:38:51,"Skin it and swallow it whole, which I'm impressed you can swallow a bird whole."
00:38:51,00:38:52,This is just what the...
00:38:52,00:38:53,Helping is a bird?
00:38:53,00:38:54,Wait a minute.
00:38:54,00:38:57,Was there a spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside them?
00:38:57,00:38:58,Yeah.
00:38:58,00:39:01,Eventually they swallow the whole reindeer.
00:39:01,00:39:04,Kiviak is one thing that they do.
00:39:04,00:39:12,"So they get a seal skin, and they fill it with loads of tiny little orcs, little birds."
00:39:12,00:39:13,A-U-K.
00:39:13,00:39:14,Yeah.
00:39:14,00:39:15,Not A-W-K.
00:39:15,00:39:16,Orcs.
00:39:16,00:39:18,It's a bit orcs.
00:39:18,00:39:23,"So you have about 300 little orc birds, and you put them in a seal skin, and then you bury"
00:39:23,00:39:27,"it under some rocks and ferment it, and then eventually you eat it."
00:39:27,00:39:29,So you have to use orcs.
00:39:29,00:39:34,"In 2013, there was a load of people from the town of Sierra Palak, and they made Kiviak"
00:39:34,00:39:36,out of ideducks.
00:39:36,00:39:41,"And ideducks don't ferment as well as orcs, and a few people died because they need to"
00:39:41,00:39:45,ferment in the proper way that makes them edible.
00:39:45,00:39:46,Silly billies.
00:39:46,00:39:50,"That's why there are these taboos, is because it's actually really sound food guidance that"
00:39:50,00:39:52,people have learned through trial and error for centuries.
00:39:52,00:39:53,Yeah.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"I mean, that would make sense for there to be a taboo against eating ideducks fermented"
00:39:56,00:39:57,inside a seal.
00:39:57,00:39:58,Yeah.
00:39:58,00:39:59,Yeah.
00:39:59,00:40:03,Do you know what the Scandinavian Sammy use reindeer spleen for?
00:40:03,00:40:08,That is like a question for the news quiz.
00:40:08,00:40:15,"So this week, one of the Sammy people of the Arctic been doing with reindeer spleen."
00:40:15,00:40:16,Santa sacks?
00:40:16,00:40:19,"Oh, very nice."
00:40:19,00:40:23,"It is Dewey, but it's for a particular group of people in your civilization tweets."
00:40:23,00:40:24,"Well, babies."
00:40:24,00:40:25,Got any one?
00:40:25,00:40:26,"Oh, nice."
00:40:26,00:40:27,So they're easy to suck on.
00:40:27,00:40:28,They're slightly a sort of training food.
00:40:28,00:40:29,Okay.
00:40:29,00:40:30,Spleen.
00:40:30,00:40:33,That makes sense because a lot of the food that people were eating was just solid frozen.
00:40:33,00:40:37,"Even though you were saying they sometimes thawed it, very often they just didn't have"
00:40:37,00:40:40,"the equipment to make a fire, big enough to thaw it."
00:40:40,00:40:44,So and it's so hard for a newborn baby to chow down on a massive frozen chunk of raw
00:40:44,00:40:45,meat.
00:40:45,00:40:46,So frozen jerky.
00:40:46,00:40:49,Not the reason why very little baby food is frozen jerky.
00:40:49,00:40:50,Yeah.
00:40:50,00:40:51,Yeah.
00:40:51,00:40:53,"But yeah, reindeer spleen is apparently good for your tot."
00:40:53,00:40:54,"Well, there you go."
00:40:54,00:41:01,"And if you run out of those little Ella pouches, that's something to consider."
00:41:01,00:41:09,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:41:09,00:41:10,Okay.
00:41:10,00:41:15,My fact this week is that men can have three penises without knowing it.
00:41:15,00:41:19,So I checked.
00:41:19,00:41:20,And yeah.
00:41:20,00:41:21,Surprise.
00:41:21,00:41:22,Yeah.
00:41:22,00:41:23,Surprise.
00:41:23,00:41:27,"And then they have the normal four, the normal five."
00:41:27,00:41:28,Yeah.
00:41:28,00:41:29,"This is very interesting, isn't it?"
00:41:29,00:41:30,Because they're not obvious.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"No, they're not."
00:41:32,00:41:34,They're hidden inside your body.
00:41:34,00:41:36,This was a thing called trifalia.
00:41:36,00:41:42,And it was only seen in a human for the first time in 2020 in a newborn baby.
00:41:42,00:41:47,"But then in 2024, I think, or 2023, there was a recent study from the University of Birmingham"
00:41:47,00:41:54,Medical School where they dissected a 78-year-old man who donated his body to science and found
00:41:54,00:41:57,that he had an extra two penises hidden up there.
00:41:57,00:41:58,Yeah.
00:41:58,00:41:59,It's hidden inside.
00:41:59,00:42:00,And they were inside his scrotum.
00:42:00,00:42:01,Yeah.
00:42:01,00:42:02,So they were small.
00:42:02,00:42:03,"They were really, really small."
00:42:03,00:42:05,"Well, let's not judge, honey."
00:42:05,00:42:06,Okay.
00:42:06,00:42:07,Yeah.
00:42:07,00:42:08,They were really small.
00:42:08,00:42:15,"And they kind of, they attached to his normal penis, like the urethra kind of went through."
00:42:15,00:42:18,They said that there was no dead end.
00:42:18,00:42:24,"So if you imagine, like, if the urine had not had a real, just a straight place to go,"
00:42:24,00:42:26,then he might have got a lot of urine infections and stuff like that.
00:42:26,00:42:30,"But actually, it seemed like mostly everything was kind of fine there."
00:42:30,00:42:35,He might have experienced some pain during sex if he got some internal erections and
00:42:35,00:42:36,wondering what that was.
00:42:36,00:42:37,"That's ironic, isn't it?"
00:42:37,00:42:38,Yeah.
00:42:38,00:42:40,"Well, your free penises might make sex less pleasant."
00:42:40,00:42:41,"That's, you know."
00:42:41,00:42:42,That is ironic.
00:42:42,00:42:43,You think it would have the opposite effect.
00:42:43,00:42:44,Yeah.
00:42:44,00:42:47,"Seven thousand spoons when all you need is a knife, isn't it?"
00:42:47,00:42:48,Right.
00:42:48,00:42:50,Free penises when all you need is a good chag.
00:42:50,00:42:51,Okay.
00:42:51,00:42:55,"They were called two small, super-numerary penises stacked in a sagittal orientation"
00:42:55,00:42:58,posterior inferiorly to the primary penis.
00:42:58,00:42:59,Lovely stuff.
00:42:59,00:43:00,Right.
00:43:00,00:43:01,Sexy.
00:43:01,00:43:02,Yeah.
00:43:02,00:43:03,"And one was more of a main one, wasn't it?"
00:43:03,00:43:04,Yeah.
00:43:04,00:43:05,He had one.
00:43:05,00:43:06,He had one main penis.
00:43:06,00:43:07,"Oh, sorry."
00:43:07,00:43:08,Sorry.
00:43:08,00:43:09,He had the main main one.
00:43:09,00:43:10,The big guy.
00:43:10,00:43:11,And then he had two.
00:43:11,00:43:12,The big guy.
00:43:12,00:43:13,The big guy.
00:43:13,00:43:14,The sweet old guy.
00:43:14,00:43:17,The good enough guy.
00:43:17,00:43:22,"I didn't actually really know the layout, the structure of the penis very well until"
00:43:22,00:43:23,this.
00:43:23,00:43:26,"So you've got these two bodies of tissue, one on top and one underneath."
00:43:26,00:43:31,"The corpus cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum, the urethra runs through the middle."
00:43:31,00:43:34,"And so in his mini penises, he had those spongy bits as well."
00:43:34,00:43:39,"And in the secondary penis, the second main one, the stand-in, the urethra actually did"
00:43:39,00:43:41,still run through the middle of that.
00:43:41,00:43:42,Yeah.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"And then the second main one, the urethra didn't even bother, just skipped it out."
00:43:44,00:43:46,But it was so small that it didn't really matter.
00:43:46,00:43:47,Yeah.
00:43:47,00:43:49,But the corpus cavernosa is the bit that fills up with the blood.
00:43:49,00:43:52,"That's the, I think we might have mentioned it before."
00:43:52,00:43:54,"That's the bit that fills the blood, which allows you to have an erection."
00:43:54,00:43:55,Yeah.
00:43:55,00:43:56,Yeah.
00:43:56,00:43:57,Let's look at this guy.
00:43:57,00:43:58,This is quite recent news.
00:43:58,00:43:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:59,00:44:00,"He's lived a long life, 78 years."
00:44:00,00:44:03,"He's probably had chats with his family as he's going, ""What do you think I'll be remembered"
00:44:03,00:44:04,for?
00:44:04,00:44:05,"What do you think they'll talk about me?"""
00:44:05,00:44:09,He's got one of his kids sat there and his two tiny kids sat next to him.
00:44:09,00:44:15,I just think what a great tragedy he never knew.
00:44:15,00:44:16,Yeah.
00:44:16,00:44:17,I know.
00:44:17,00:44:18,Yeah.
00:44:18,00:44:19,"Exactly, right?"
00:44:19,00:44:20,So sad.
00:44:20,00:44:21,You'd want to know.
00:44:21,00:44:22,Yeah.
00:44:22,00:44:23,"I mean, who knows what everyone listening to this podcast will have?"
00:44:23,00:44:27,"People might have extra fingers or extra, also you can get extra nipples, can't you?"
00:44:27,00:44:30,But really subtle ones that you can barely tell that they're there.
00:44:30,00:44:31,Yeah.
00:44:31,00:44:32,Yeah.
00:44:32,00:44:33,"So, you know, there's all sorts you can have."
00:44:33,00:44:34,"Well, these things are quite rare."
00:44:34,00:44:37,And I was thinking about it would be good if we were more likely to have some of these
00:44:37,00:44:38,interesting extra body parts.
00:44:38,00:44:39,Yeah.
00:44:39,00:44:40,"So, I was looking at the more likely ones."
00:44:40,00:44:47,"And, you know, the 20% of people, maybe up to 30%, estimates vary, have an extra spleen."
00:44:47,00:44:50,"Oh, that would be useful when we're feeding our kids."
00:44:50,00:44:51,Yeah.
00:44:51,00:44:52,Is that right?
00:44:52,00:44:53,Yeah.
00:44:53,00:44:55,"The splinunculi, an extra spleen."
00:44:55,00:44:56,Yeah.
00:44:56,00:44:57,And it's a little accessory spleen.
00:44:57,00:45:01,They tend to be very small and quite near your main spleen.
00:45:01,00:45:02,And yeah.
00:45:02,00:45:03,I think we don't really know why.
00:45:03,00:45:05,I think they think it's often you'll get a little injured or bumped when you're younger
00:45:05,00:45:06,and it'll split off from the main spleen.
00:45:06,00:45:11,"So, this isn't done in the womb, it's not the fetus that causes it."
00:45:11,00:45:12,I don't think so.
00:45:12,00:45:13,"No, it's not."
00:45:13,00:45:15,"So, there was a guy who was playing Ultimate Frisbee one day."
00:45:15,00:45:16,He was slightly injured.
00:45:16,00:45:17,He rupted his spleen.
00:45:17,00:45:18,"So, not good."
00:45:18,00:45:21,"And the doctors who operated on him later said, ""By the way, you know about all your other"
00:45:21,00:45:22,"spleens?"""
00:45:22,00:45:23,And he didn't.
00:45:23,00:45:28,"And so, the spleen, it sort of filters out damaged red blood cells and it's very, very"
00:45:28,00:45:29,useful.
00:45:29,00:45:30,"Although, it's not crucial."
00:45:30,00:45:32,A lot of people have a spleen off and it's fine.
00:45:32,00:45:33,Yes.
00:45:33,00:45:34,That's true.
00:45:34,00:45:36,But it has a role in the immune system and things like that.
00:45:36,00:45:38,"And it's, as you say, it's not essential."
00:45:38,00:45:41,"But if it's hurt, bits of it splinter off through the body and it depends where they"
00:45:41,00:45:42,land.
00:45:42,00:45:46,"So, if they land somewhere with a good blood supply, they will grow into another micro"
00:45:46,00:45:47,spleen.
00:45:47,00:45:50,"And sometimes, if you're having your spleen out, the doctors will just chop it up and"
00:45:50,00:45:53,"hope a new one grows somewhere in you, like chopping up a worm, basically."
00:45:53,00:45:57,"Oh, does that actually, I thought they didn't know if that worked yet."
00:45:57,00:45:58,I said they hope.
00:45:58,00:45:59,I didn't say they guarantee it.
00:45:59,00:46:00,They hope.
00:46:00,00:46:05,"Because something else that I also read weirdly, conversely, is if you're having a splinectomy,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,"which is like if you've got blood disorder or something, you have to have your spleen"
00:46:07,00:46:08,out.
00:46:08,00:46:12,"The doctors have to know if you've got an extra spleen, because if your main spleen's"
00:46:12,00:46:16,"malfunctioning, your tiny extra one will also be malfunctioning somewhere."
00:46:16,00:46:19,"So you have the main one out, but, you know, the malfunction will stay."
00:46:19,00:46:23,"So you've got to search the whole, but you've got to open up someone's entire body and search."
00:46:23,00:46:24,Yeah.
00:46:24,00:46:28,"There's another thing which is called the LRP5 gene, which when it has a mutation,"
00:46:28,00:46:30,bones have a higher density about them.
00:46:30,00:46:34,So they've noticed that there are people who just can't break their bones.
00:46:34,00:46:38,"Obviously if you really, really went for it, ultimately it could break, but in a situation"
00:46:38,00:46:42,"where most people would break their bones, they would just not have a crack."
00:46:42,00:46:47,"And it seems to happen a lot in America, in Connecticut, who people have been identified."
00:46:47,00:46:48,So something's going on.
00:46:48,00:46:50,The mutation is passing through genetically.
00:46:50,00:46:55,But one of the symptoms where you could know that you have this is difficulty staying afloat
00:46:55,00:46:56,while swimming.
00:46:56,00:46:57,Anna.
00:46:57,00:46:58,Anna.
00:46:58,00:46:59,"Dun, dun, dun."
00:46:59,00:47:02,The only person we know to sink in the Dead Sea.
00:47:02,00:47:03,Oh my God.
00:47:03,00:47:07,"And my mum was so weirdly close to that guy from Connecticut, who used to visit all the"
00:47:07,00:47:10,time when I was a kid.
00:47:10,00:47:11,That's amazing.
00:47:11,00:47:13,Have you ever broken a bone?
00:47:13,00:47:14,No.
00:47:14,00:47:15,"Oh no, I've broken loads of bones."
00:47:15,00:47:16,Only small ones though.
00:47:16,00:47:18,Like wrist bones and my jaw.
00:47:18,00:47:19,I think it would count.
00:47:19,00:47:20,It still can't damage.
00:47:20,00:47:21,Good job.
00:47:21,00:47:22,Only the minor ones.
00:47:22,00:47:26,"You were with me when I broke my jaw in fact, weren't you?"
00:47:26,00:47:27,Yes.
00:47:27,00:47:29,I don't get any more facts wrong on QI.
00:47:29,00:47:30,Wow.
00:47:30,00:47:36,"It's a top shipping run, guys."
00:47:36,00:47:40,"There was an interesting thing in 2020, which is the first medical case I think of someone"
00:47:40,00:47:45,who was shot in the chest but survived because his heart was on the opposite side of his
00:47:45,00:47:46,body to most people.
00:47:46,00:47:47,Brilliant.
00:47:47,00:47:48,Cool.
00:47:48,00:47:49,It actually happened.
00:47:49,00:47:54,So this is a thing called cytosine versus where all of your organs are on the wrong side.
00:47:54,00:47:59,"There's about one in 6,000 to 12,000 people have it, but most people would never know"
00:47:59,00:48:01,they had it.
00:48:01,00:48:07,"But what's kind of interesting is Dr. No had it in the novel, in the James Bond novel."
00:48:07,00:48:11,And he was shot in the wrong side of his body just like this guy in the medical literature
00:48:11,00:48:12,a few years ago.
00:48:12,00:48:16,He survived and he got a God complex because he thought this makes me special and that's
00:48:16,00:48:18,why he became such a bad guy.
00:48:18,00:48:19,"Oh, sorry."
00:48:19,00:48:20,Dr. No did.
00:48:20,00:48:21,Not the other guy.
00:48:21,00:48:25,Did Dr. No think his heart was in the right place then?
00:48:25,00:48:26,No.
00:48:26,00:48:28,And that's where the saying comes from.
00:48:28,00:48:32,"No, he knew that, like the doctors told him and he was like, that makes me special."
00:48:32,00:48:35,So I should take off the world.
00:48:35,00:48:37,That has been used in a few plot points.
00:48:37,00:48:42,I remember my dad and I watching a movie and him explaining to me because a lady shoots
00:48:42,00:48:45,"a man in the chest and leads him to die, but she shot him."
00:48:45,00:48:46,She knows.
00:48:46,00:48:47,And it's love.
00:48:47,00:48:48,"Your heart is quite near the middle, isn't it?"
00:48:48,00:48:49,Yeah.
00:48:49,00:48:51,"It's nearer the middle than we all think, which is just out of the left nipple."
00:48:51,00:48:52,Yeah.
00:48:52,00:48:53,"It's got to be a very good shot, hasn't it?"
00:48:53,00:48:56,And you're still going to scrape probably a bit of it.
00:48:56,00:48:57,Because what does it really affect?
00:48:57,00:49:01,The Cetus inversus thing where you're the other way around because your lungs are unaffected.
00:49:01,00:49:02,Yeah.
00:49:02,00:49:03,"Oh, liver."
00:49:03,00:49:05,"Because you've only got one liver, one spleen, gallbladder."
00:49:05,00:49:11,"Also your spleen, as we've heard, could be literally anywhere, but your liver is a big"
00:49:11,00:49:12,"one, I think."
00:49:12,00:49:13,Yes.
00:49:13,00:49:14,Yeah.
00:49:14,00:49:15,"Because that's massive, isn't it?"
00:49:15,00:49:16,Yeah.
00:49:16,00:49:18,"I mean, you probably will die if you've been shot in the chest anyway, right?"
00:49:18,00:49:19,We should say.
00:49:19,00:49:20,Again.
00:49:20,00:49:21,Don't hope.
00:49:21,00:49:25,Don't eat poo and don't get shot in the chest on the wrong side if you're going to take
00:49:25,00:49:28,any message from this podcast.
00:49:28,00:49:31,All these things about unusual body parts that we're talking about.
00:49:31,00:49:37,"I think it might interest a guy called Etienne de Beaumont, who was someone living in Paris"
00:49:37,00:49:39,in the early 20th century.
00:49:39,00:49:43,"He was a big old posh-o, and he liked to do lots of parties and stuff."
00:49:43,00:49:48,"He was a friend of Coco Chanel, and one of his parties in 1919, the theme of it was that"
00:49:48,00:49:53,every guest had to arrive with the most interesting body parts exposed.
00:49:53,00:49:54,Cool.
00:49:54,00:49:58,"Whatever you think your most interesting body part is, if it's your head, lucky you."
00:49:58,00:50:01,"If it's your spleen, tough."
00:50:01,00:50:02,Very tough.
00:50:02,00:50:04,"What would you go for, Andy?"
00:50:04,00:50:05,Sorry to put you on the spot.
00:50:05,00:50:06,"No, it's fine."
00:50:06,00:50:08,"Well, that weird growth down there is..."
00:50:08,00:50:09,I would go with that one.
00:50:09,00:50:10,That'll be it.
00:50:10,00:50:11,That'll be it.
00:50:11,00:50:12,I've got a wood-shaped finger.
00:50:12,00:50:16,"The finger which got shut in the door when I was tiny, and it's permanently disfigured"
00:50:16,00:50:17,as a result.
00:50:17,00:50:18,"Oh, wow."
00:50:18,00:50:19,Yeah.
00:50:19,00:50:20,Do you think that would break the ice at this party?
00:50:20,00:50:21,I think I'm not getting invited to this party.
00:50:21,00:50:25,"If I filled in the form and put that on my RFP, this is the guy I'm going to come with"
00:50:25,00:50:26,exposed.
00:50:26,00:50:28,I think it's going to be a dull night for a little bit.
00:50:28,00:50:31,"That's weird because I was going to pick my finger as well, because I've got a little"
00:50:31,00:50:33,"freckle on it, which makes it..."
00:50:33,00:50:35,I can make my finger look like an elephant.
00:50:35,00:50:37,I've got a trunk and an ear.
00:50:37,00:50:39,I think we'd be put on the same table.
00:50:39,00:50:40,I don't think...
00:50:40,00:50:43,I think you'll be put on the table with other people who could do elephant impressions.
00:50:43,00:50:46,"Oh, no."
00:50:46,00:50:47,Do we know what...
00:50:47,00:50:49,If anyone beat Dan and Andy's suggestions for this party...
00:50:49,00:50:50,"No, I don't have..."
00:50:50,00:50:55,"I really tried to find out, and really every source just tells you that this existed."
00:50:55,00:50:57,"I got it from a biography of Coco Chanel, initially."
00:50:57,00:51:01,"Because you're either going for, ""Oh, my genitals are the most interesting part."
00:51:01,00:51:02,"Here they are."""
00:51:02,00:51:03,"Or, ""What is it?"
00:51:03,00:51:04,"What can you expose?"""
00:51:04,00:51:07,"Your knee, ankle, elbow."
00:51:07,00:51:08,It's joints and genitals.
00:51:08,00:51:09,It's going to be this party.
00:51:09,00:51:10,Genitals.
00:51:10,00:51:13,"You don't want interesting genitals, do you?"
00:51:13,00:51:15,I think you want standard genitals.
00:51:15,00:51:17,But they might be the most interesting thing about you.
00:51:17,00:51:18,Okay.
00:51:18,00:51:19,Yeah.
00:51:19,00:51:20,If you have three.
00:51:20,00:51:21,Yeah.
00:51:21,00:51:22,"Oh, God."
00:51:22,00:51:23,If you had three.
00:51:23,00:51:25,On things you don't know are inside your body.
00:51:25,00:51:26,Yeah.
00:51:26,00:51:27,"I mean, this is silly."
00:51:27,00:51:31,I was just reading a doctor talking on Reddit about experiences of patients with weird stuff
00:51:31,00:51:34,"inside the body and saying, ""A young man came in complaining of a headache."""
00:51:34,00:51:39,"And sorry, this was someone who worked in radiology and said, ""They wanted to find out"
00:51:39,00:51:40,"the cause of the headache."""
00:51:40,00:51:44,"And so I said, ""We asked for a history, anything that could be relevant to this headache."""
00:51:44,00:51:46,"The man said, ""Nothing to report."
00:51:46,00:51:51,"We scan his head, CT shows a bullet rattling loose between his nasal cavity and his brain."""
00:51:51,00:51:53,"So I asked the guy, ""Have you ever been shot in the face?"""
00:51:53,00:51:58,"And he said, ""Oh, yeah, I guess I forgot to mention that."""
00:51:58,00:52:00,You've got to run back through your full history sometimes.
00:52:00,00:52:01,Yeah.
00:52:01,00:52:02,That's amazing.
00:52:02,00:52:08,I read something about a guy in 1911 called Alexander Grail who fought two duels near
00:52:08,00:52:09,New Orleans.
00:52:09,00:52:14,"And the first one, someone sort of stabbed him with a sword and it went right through"
00:52:14,00:52:16,his lungs.
00:52:16,00:52:19,"And then he went to hospital, managed to come out, but he was really sick."
00:52:19,00:52:23,"He walked, they said in the newspapers, he was bowed like an octogenarian."
00:52:23,00:52:26,"He had a bit of surgery, but the doctors are like, ""Ah, this is not going to work, mate."
00:52:26,00:52:28,You've got a huge abscess there.
00:52:28,00:52:29,"You're going to die."""
00:52:29,00:52:33,"And he thought, ""Well, I'm going to die now, so I might as well do more duels."
00:52:33,00:52:37,"I might as well say fuck you to the people who upset me in the past."""
00:52:37,00:52:43,So he got into another duel and the person shot him in the exact place where the sword
00:52:43,00:52:46,had gone in and it drained the abscess and he got cured.
00:52:46,00:52:47,Yes.
00:52:47,00:52:48,"Oh, God."
00:52:48,00:52:49,I think you'd say that.
00:52:49,00:52:50,Wow.
00:52:50,00:52:54,"That is where we get the comic bonk on the head twice, restores your memory."
00:52:54,00:52:55,Yeah.
00:52:55,00:52:56,The 3D glasses.
00:52:56,00:52:57,3D version.
00:52:57,00:52:58,Wow.
00:52:58,00:53:01,"And sorry, is this one of the things we are recommending?"
00:53:01,00:53:02,"Yes, absolutely."
00:53:02,00:53:03,OK.
00:53:03,00:53:07,"If you've been in a duel and got an abscess on your lungs, get in another duel immediately."
00:53:07,00:53:14,"OK, that's it."
00:53:14,00:53:15,That is all of our facts.
00:53:15,00:53:16,Thank you so much for listening.
