00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,880
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,460
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,460
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Philippa Perry and once again we have gathered

25
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,200
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,840
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Philippa.

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,040
 Hi, child rearing advice in the 17th century included tossing your baby up in a blanket

28
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:38,380
 to strengthen its nerves or firing pistols near it to boost its endurance. Okay I'm just

29
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,420
 going to start by saying in case you suddenly want to run away and think that's a brilliant

30
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:52,620
 idea that if you toss a newborn into the air it might break its neck because it's got

31
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,600
 no neck muscles and a very big head so not a great idea. Is there a minimum age at which

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:11,700
 tossing can commence? When did you start tossing? We got quite personal quite quickly. If you're

33
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,600
 going to do something fun like toss somebody in the air it's a great idea if you've got

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,580
 a bond and a relationship with them first. So don't go up to a random baby and think

35
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,100
 oh babies love this and toss them into the air. A) they might break their neck if they

36
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:35,420
 haven't got neck muscles in it yet and B) you do that as part of an ongoing relationship

37
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:43,140
 and you have give and take with a baby. Okay so you can't exchange words but you exchange

38
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,620
 looks and laughs. One of the first games a baby likes playing let's start general folks

39
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:59,080
 is peek-a-boo. Now that is really scary for a baby. Especially when you fire a pistol.

40
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:07,120
 Can we just drop the firing of pistols? Don't do that okay. Peek-a-boo right it's really

41
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,480
 scary for a baby because they haven't got what we call object permanence. So if mummy

42
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,420
 leaves the room that's why baby goes because mummy doesn't exist anymore. So mummy's gone

43
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,480
 forever in the baby's eye. Possibly we haven't really got a concept of forever but mummy is

44
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,400
 not there and we haven't got a sense of mummy ongoing in the other room yet. So it's pretty

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,520
 scary and so peek-a-boo the baby thinks you've disappeared for a second and that is oh the

46
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,800
 jeopardy and then when you arrive again the relief is hilarious and then again they want

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,920
 to play that again and again and again that is the 17th century firing a pistol that we

48
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:59,640
 do in the what we in now 22nd century or something 21st century. I had to think. People might

49
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,720
 be listening to this in the 22nd century. Can I ask what the blanket tossing though?

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
 Is this a case of are we thinking of a laid out blanket where we're flinging a kid into

51
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,160
 the air like fox tossing the old sport? Yeah. So because I wondered if it was wrapping in

52
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,720
 a blanket and tossing them up and down while they're raps. While they're squaddled. While

53
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,680
 they're squaddled. Exactly. I think it's that. I think it's the old hold the blanket by the

54
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,400
 corners and then. I think so. If you're trying to spread it from the nerves then it must

55
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,240
 have some jeopardy I think. I think chucking a baby in the air at all is jeopardy. This

56
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:43,640
 thing about treating babies and children cruelly to make them stronger is a utter complete

57
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:50,720
 nasty myth that people still cling on to. My dear father for example when my daughter

58
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,600
 was about two years old and she'd just grown too large to stand up underneath the piano.

59
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,760
 She hit her head on the piano thing and I of course went to comfort her baby here. Dear

60
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,240
 dear. A cuddle cuddle kiss kiss. My dad said don't do that. She'll hurt herself all the

61
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,960
 time so that she can get that sort of comfort. You are rewarding her hurting herself. He

62
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:26,920
 said and I went oh my God. Suddenly I realized why I needed 25 years of therapy. I know.

63
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,240
 But is there a thing where if a small child let's say falls over right now they will sometimes

64
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,800
 if you're in the room with a small child and they fall over and they will sometimes give

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,360
 you a look as if they're kind of sizing up whether or not they're going to cry and if

66
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,080
 you react in a big way they might say all right that is my cue to cry. They're sort

67
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,520
 of engaging in it with you. Whereas if you say oh there we go and then you sort of you

68
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,960
 know it depends how frightened you are of the fall. I mean sometimes you see a fall

69
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,000
 and you think that doesn't hurt that much. That's what I mean. And so you go whoops a

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,860
 daisy and we all go whoops a daisy. But you know when they're covered in blood and there's

71
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,120
 a size of an egg on the head I think they're there darling that must hurt. Yeah isn't isn't

72
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,880
 too bad. Okay. Good call. Yeah. That's a good level of distinction. Yeah. I say to my son

73
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,720
 Wilf and Ted my sons when they're scootering if they fall over I say oh that was an amazing

74
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,000
 blooper because we sometimes film and then so. You're after those 250 quid that you've

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,960
 been framed don't you. Do it again in slow motion. My camera is not working in slow motion.

76
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,240
 But Wilf came home one day scratched up and he said dad had an amazing blooper today. So

77
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,600
 it kind of helps in a way. There's something else here as well is that children won't cry

78
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,740
 with people they don't feel particularly safe with. Like one day my daughter had a quite

79
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,080
 a nasty fall in the playground and the teachers were all saying to me when I went to pick

80
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,400
 her up like oh she was so brave. She didn't cry. She didn't make a fuss. I looked at her

81
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,920
 and think that's not like her weird. And so I went okay goodbye okay good. We walked around

82
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,440
 the corner away from the school as soon as we got around the corner. I really hurt myself

83
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:13,200
 really badly. And it was just delayed comfort. She didn't want comfort from the teachers.

84
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,920
 She wanted comfort from me and I'm not saying you're putting it on because you didn't do

85
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,880
 that at the time. Bollocks you just felt pretty sad about having fallen over and that was

86
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,240
 incompleted that sort of like I feel sad I need comfort. And so whenever a child wants

87
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,120
 comfort give it. Never mind this thing about what they're doing it for attention. Yes they

88
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,760
 are. And that means you need to give attention. Because once they've had enough attention

89
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,920
 that's then and only then that you learn to internalise the comfort you get from your

90
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,320
 loving ones so that you can tell yourself things like it hurts now but it won't hurt

91
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,120
 in a minute. You know you learn those things you learn to comfort yourself. You know if

92
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,640
 something awful happens to me like I don't know I get my credit card pocket picked that's

93
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:09,140
 the blooper of today or something like that. That's a great blooper. I want to ring up

94
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,400
 either my husband or my daughter and go wow wow wow and I spend all morning on the phone

95
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,120
 and getting things cancelled it's been really horrible. And I just want them to go there

96
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,040
 there. So even when we're quite old I'm 65 we still need some external comfort you know

97
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,720
 for big bloopers like and I'm expecting when I have my hip hop in a few weeks I'm expecting

98
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,600
 lots of sympathy from you lot please. So from the sound of it Philippa you don't agree

99
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,960
 with I've been looking up kind of historical you know childcare advice and parenting manuals

100
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,760
 and things like that. Yeah there was a manual in the 15th century by Giovanni Domenici who

101
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,200
 said that ideally you did I mean he did subscribe to Tuffening Children Up when small. Dress

102
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,120
 them in rough clothing get them to sleep in the cold the worst of all withhold food and

103
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:04,440
 wine. Oh what? No that's the last straw. Get child services out there right now. I mean

104
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,880
 if you're sort of left out in the cold with no comfort I think the least you could have

105
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,120
 would be a bit of wine to numb the pain. Nice wouldn't it. I'd be interested in the history

106
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,940
 of childcare whether it kind of goes in cycles of kind of hard love and soft love or whether

107
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,920
 we think we've kind of got to a point now and hopefully it'll kind of stay like this.

108
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,940
 Well it is still going in a cycle really because we tend to do things in extremes so we go

109
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,600
 from we must be authoritarian at all times and don't let them get away with anything

110
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,000
 to hey free easy and then we think oh my god those kids have got no boundaries they don't

111
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,360
 know where they are who they're allowed to be or anything they're all over the place

112
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,800
 they've gone mad. We better toughen up again. So it does tend to swing like that but of

113
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,080
 course after everybody's read my book you'll find the middle way where you have love plus

114
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:09,600
 boundaries can't go wrong with that. Oh nice. Hugs and guns it's cool. It's not cold.

115
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,280
 Were you when so when you had children that was some years ago as in when they were tiny

116
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,760
 how old are your children now? 30. So were you by any chance I don't know if he was still

117
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:27,360
 big then. A Spock reader. Dr Benjamin Spock. No. He was a bit before that wasn't he? Because

118
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,380
 I was reading about him and there was like this whole debate about you know tough love

119
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,200
 versus soft love and all of this because he his books were still being published you know

120
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,040
 new editions in the late 90s which is the only reason I ask but he published his first

121
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:46,240
 in 1946 and it saw 50 million copies by the time he died. Damn I've only said two million

122
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,160
 I've got to wait again. Wow that is embarrassing. Yeah I know I bet he lived long and prospered

123
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,520
 after that. Oh my god. Yeah. Yes. But he this is the crazy thing he was blamed for the eventual

124
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,440
 children who grew up where their parents had bought the book in the mid 40s you know the

125
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,200
 first edition. Yeah yeah because then in the late 60s he became a very prominent protester

126
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,680
 against the Vietnam War and he was very famously you know he was leading protests and he was

127
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,700
 told that his parenting style had led to permissiveness in the permissive society and that all these

128
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,920
 long-haired hippies protesting against the Vietnam War were basically his children you

129
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,000
 know and the parents brought them up in that style. This is like the rider of jaws then

130
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,400
 spending the rest of his life doing short protection stuff you know like going the opposite

131
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,840
 way for what he created. Yeah let's just stick to the middle way shall we. But he was a victim

132
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,640
 of tough love too as a child he wasn't allowed to have a banana until he was 12. Interesting

133
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,120
 really. What's what's what's the goss there. I have no more details than that I'm really

134
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,720
 sorry I did try to find that. Well the mind boggles. This is a cool thing. Parenthood

135
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,680
 during the pandemic was obviously an interesting thing if you had a baby during the pandemic

136
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,600
 which I did you. It wasn't anything else to do wasn't it. There was nothing else to do.

137
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,520
 Make a baby. Yeah exactly. But we had a thing where. We made sourdough. We made sourdough.

138
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,680
 I had babies. You obviously couldn't visit families and so on. So in Japan someone had

139
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,240
 this idea which worked really well which was a pandemic rice baby. So what you would do

140
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,120
 is you would send a picture of the baby the face to this company and you would send the

141
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,720
 weight of the baby. They would make a rice bag the exact weight of your baby with the

142
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,640
 face on it and send it to the parents or the auntie or uncle or whatever. And so while

143
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,760
 you were doing calls or whatever they could hold the rice baby and sort of feel like they

144
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,360
 had. No the rice baby has fallen into a pound of boiling water. It doesn't matter. I've

145
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,840
 been tossing the rice baby up into the air in a blanket with terrible results. So the

146
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,040
 company did this and it worked really well and then this is now a sort of growing trend

147
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,200
 in Japan at weddings now there's an opposite baby that gets handed to the parents of the

148
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:09,200
 bride and the groom which is very old man. Sorry what I mean is what you do is you would

149
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,360
 get a picture of say like James and his wife would get pictures of themselves as kids and

150
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,180
 then they would have them printed onto a rice baby and you would give yourself as a child

151
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,600
 back to your parents to say where I am now this is where I came from and you made me.

152
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,200
 This is a present to remind you of the journey that we've been on. Well it's a beautiful

153
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,400
 ritual. I think we should all integrate that into our lives. Yes. Put in your new book.

154
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:40,640
 You write another book down alright. You keep your ideas for your books and I'll keep mine

155
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,560
 for mine. Rice baby is going to be a best seller I'm telling you. No it's got to be

156
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,640
 a more British kind of food. It's got to be a classic British food. It's got to be a

157
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:59,560
 chips suet. Chippy baby. Yeah. Yorkshire pudding. Don't keep so well do they? I was reading about

158
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,760
 when child care manuals started when they first took off because there were a few in the middle

159
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,840
 ages but not very many and there wasn't you know mass literacy in the same way and it

160
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,240
 was partly and this is particularly in America I'm talking about it was partly because people

161
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,080
 were moving around more so you might be living 200 miles from your parents and your immediate

162
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,440
 family so you don't have the immediate experience of a baby you know you haven't grown up in

163
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,880
 loads of babies. People were moving around for work. A bit like nowadays really. So manual

164
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,880
 is a very useful thing. It's like the old time NCT group. Exactly it really is yeah yeah

165
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,320
 and that's when the manuals kicked off in a big way and now of course there are so many

166
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,320
 you know thousands of manuals. But there's only one you really need to buy. Rice baby

167
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:52,080
 is my dance driver. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this

168
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,880
 week is that France has lost at least two of its kings due to death by walking into the

169
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,640
 frame of a very low door. This is two that we know of. There may be more. To lose one

170
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,960
 king by walking into the frame of a very low door. You know what at first I thought that

171
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,780
 was a to lose joke. Yeah to lose as in as in La Trek. Oh I was thinking the southern

172
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:21,000
 French town. Both would have been better than what I was doing. That's cool. Yeah so which

173
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,240
 one's we talking. We're talking Louis the third who passed away in 882 the 882 and

174
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:34,320
 then Charles the eighth. I'm presuming not the same door. Different no it's not no there's

175
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,760
 no incriminating door here yeah. The killer door. It waits. Was there a bit of inbreeding

176
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,680
 the old French royal family because you know they had another one didn't they who thought

177
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,920
 he was made out of glass. Yes was that a French one. No it was a French I think it was one

178
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,880
 of the Charles's who suffered. No no Charles the mad for some reason. But inbreeding couldn't

179
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,000
 make you walk into a door frame. Well maybe you were brought up not to look where he would

180
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,280
 be going. Oh almost I guess if you're the king. Maybe the French royals had a person

181
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,960
 who would always tell you whenever you're about to hit a door frame. Yeah and it was

182
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:21,660
 his day off. What a day. It's so funny. He took two days off in over 500 years. So Charles

183
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,160
 the eighth his reason for running into the door was he was very excited to see a game

184
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,080
 of tennis so he was rushing out the door didn't notice the height you know when you're rushing

185
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,720
 out the door and you don't notice the height of a door you can crack your head. No. Tennis

186
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,200
 has killed quite a lot of royals. Has it. Over the years yeah. So Louis the tenth of

187
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,360
 France died of a chill after paying tennis on a cold day. James the first of Scotland

188
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,720
 drowned in a storm drain that he was using to escape assassins. But the drain was blocked

189
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,040
 by tennis balls and so he couldn't get out and he drowned. It's hard to blame that on

190
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,560
 the tennis balls really isn't it. No but they be called to the stand definitely. It would

191
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,520
 be especially ironic for him if he had been the one playing tennis and saying shall we

192
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,400
 go and get those balls. No I can't be bothered they're in the storm drain. And that's a good

193
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,960
 ironic. And Anne Boleyn was watching a tennis match at Hampton Court when she was arrested

194
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,360
 and beheaded. Again. Not fair to blame tennis. So even if she'd been watching a squash game

195
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,680
 they might have still arrested her. But that's a great connection and they're courts. Courts

196
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:41,000
 and courts. That's the other guy by the way Louis the other guy King Louis the third was

197
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,800
 chasing a girl into a house and she obviously bent and he didn't have been shorter than

198
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,800
 him. Yeah. Yeah. She could have been shorter than him. Is it is it true that the reason

199
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,880
 doors did use to be short is not because people obviously were smaller but because materials

200
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,920
 cost so much that it made more sense to have less material for a wooden door. It might

201
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,120
 have been because of the heating. So if you have a smaller door it keeps the heating more.

202
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,400
 Okay. Right. I don't know about that. But think before you enter. Yeah. Good idea. I

203
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,080
 really want to bend down to go into it. Yeah. So I mean yeah that's okay. Three loss to the

204
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,800
 tennis court. One Venn diagram overlap of two lost to low doors. The lintels of a door.

205
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 That's it. Do you think it's because Kings wouldn't die of normal things that normal people

206
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:31,280
 would die of? Of like so what like syphilis maybe they would but yeah as in they're more

207
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,580
 likely to die of weird things. It was obviously a much more dangerous time in terms of overall

208
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,800
 mortality and I don't know if Kings live longer or shorter than the average person because

209
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,800
 they were better fed. Better fed. Yeah. Might have been washed occasionally at least twice

210
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,160
 a year. Yeah. But you have more kind of aristocratic accidents and things like that because you've

211
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,240
 got more horsing and yes yeah. France they did have a lot of aristocratic accidents at

212
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,440
 the end of the 18th century. Yeah loads. It really racked up. Horses were a big one. Prince

213
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,320
 Philip of France he died when supposedly he was going through the street and his horse

214
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,320
 tripped over a black pig that was running out of a dung heap. That's bad luck isn't it?

215
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,640
 That's bad luck. Yeah. There was another one who rode a horse off a cliff if you remember.

216
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,720
 That's just careless. That is it's easy to do I almost ran off a cliff. On a horse? Not

217
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,240
 on a horse. You almost run off a cliff sorry. Yeah in Australia there was going to the beach

218
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,960
 and I saw the beach in the distance and I didn't have my glasses on me and I just ran

219
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,320
 and ran and ran and as I got to the edge of the cliff I dove to the ground and managed

220
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,680
 to stop myself just. I don't know why you've been let out at all. That's incredible. Have

221
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,840
 you? That's easy to do. Have you heard of Carlo Man the second of West France here? Actually

222
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,640
 no. Can you tell me all about him please? I only know about his death sadly but it's

223
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,640
 an unusual death. He died after being stabbed in the leg by his servant but told us while

224
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,800
 they were being attacked by a wild boar. So at this point we've got two low hanging

225
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,440
 door deaths. Yeah. We've got three horse deaths. We've got three tennis court deaths and we

226
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,660
 have now two pig based deaths as well. That's interesting. There's a lot of grouping going

227
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,440
 on here. Yeah do you know any other pillow fight deaths than the one I'm about to tell

228
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,040
 you? Oh well Mon Luther King. Mon Luther King had a pillow fight the day before he died

229
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,600
 but it wasn't what killed him. Yeah I think it might have even been the day of. It might

230
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,200
 have been like one of the last things he did. Can you start from the beginning? I forgot

231
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,840
 you're here this show would implode on itself. So Charles the second of Alois who was the

232
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,920
 son of Francis the first. He and his friends came across a load of buildings that had been

233
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,320
 closed off due to the plague and he said to his friends no son of a king of France has

234
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,320
 ever died of plague and so they went into these houses that had been closed off and

235
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,720
 they sort of rolled around on the beds and had a pillow fight. Full of sleaze those beds.

236
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,640
 Well full of yeah full of not nice stuff and sure enough a couple of days later he contracted

237
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,600
 the plague and he died. That's a bad hubris. That's really hubristic yeah that's bad. Louis

238
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,840
 the ninth also of France buried in Notre Dame so getting quite eminent now. Buried and now

239
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:36,000
 cremated due to the recent fire. Oh yeah too soon Phillip. There's a theory that he died

240
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,440
 because he refused to eat the local food when he was travelling. Staved? No it's worse than

241
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,480
 that he was leading the eighth crusade in 1270 AD and he supposedly refused to have any vegetables

242
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,040
 because it was you know some foreign muck and he only wanted. He only wanted old sausage

243
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,880
 then back two years old from home. And he had terrible scurvy we think and didn't take

244
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,480
 any vegetables from the surrounding countryside. That's a slightly simplified version of it.

245
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,840
 Well he wouldn't have known of course that that was all cost scurvy. Absolutely. The arrogance

246
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,760
 you get from being royal is really dangerous isn't it. You think you won't get plague.

247
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,680
 You think you don't need vegetables. Do you think it's a therapist that you would ever

248
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,040
 accept a case of a royal? Would it be very fascinating or too daunting? I couldn't possibly

249
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:34,880
 say what? Oh don't be stupid. Harry no. Don't be dark. Charles the mother of the bar. That's

250
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,160
 the word. He was called Charles the sign until he went to see Fred of the bar. No I haven't

251
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:48,040
 seen a royal. It's not fun. Therapising very famous people yes because the point of knowing

252
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,480
 very famous people is to gossip about them and you know on pain of death. So it's no

253
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,560
 fun at all. I've always wondered if I I've I'd like to have a therapist but I want to

254
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,000
 I almost feel like this needs therapy in itself. I would want a therapist who I found who is

255
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,480
 a famous therapist. Wow. Yeah. Anyway. I mean we could analyse why you want to see a famous

256
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,120
 therapist but I'm not going to do that in public. Okay. I can give you a clue. He's just obsessed

257
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,460
 with famous people. But it's no it's not that I want I want there's something interesting

258
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,640
 about them being famous and then becoming a therapist. I don't know. There's something

259
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,240
 interesting to me. I'll shorten it. There's something interesting about your projection.

260
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,560
 Yes. There's nothing interesting about the therapist themselves. Yeah. That's right. There

261
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,320
 you go. There we go. Okay. That's done. So that saved you a lot of trouble. Whoa. What's

262
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:50,360
 this immediate invoice. 5,000. Jesus. We're going to have to do a last square space advert.

263
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,780
 Anyway back to Kings back to Kings. Here's the thing. So this is James. You mentioned

264
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,300
 the the French Revolution. Yes. As it as it as it happened and so after the deaths of

265
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,840
 Louis the 16th wasn't it a marion tonette. There was a there was a son. They had they

266
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,320
 had a son who would have been Louis the 17th who had had very sadly died but this wasn't

267
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,720
 really widely known in France at the time. And there was this spell where dozens of impostors

268
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,760
 came out of the woodwork claiming to be the missing dofan and this this word spread and

269
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:34,780
 it's this is a really rare word is called the food domino for money. Why that stayed rare.

270
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,780
 Food the phantom any so the funny meaning the and fo meaning false. I think you needn't

271
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,380
 bother with the other. So I just love that and they had and they have varying degrees

272
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,620
 of success. You know some of them were very clearly one of them was Native American and

273
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,620
 just and still managed to succeed actually. He was called Reverend Elias Williams who did

274
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,200
 persuade some people. But yeah. Charles the second of Navarre. He was known as Charles

275
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,360
 the bad. He was sick and he was wrapped from head to toe in bandages soaked in brandy and

276
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,800
 then you might absorb some of that. That would be nice. That'd be a good way of getting getting

277
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,520
 your kicks wouldn't it. But unfortunately he was placed next to an open flame. Oh no.

278
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,020
 They're not bright are they. They're not bright. This French royal family at all. Because

279
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,180
 I think it's fair to not know that vegetables cause scurvy. But I think at that stage everyone

280
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:32,100
 knew that brandy is flammable. But what I like about him his mother was Joan the second

281
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:40,700
 who was the Queen of Navarre. And in 1328 she lost the areas of champagne and Bri. Of

282
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:48,340
 all the areas of France you want to lose. The brandy one. There's so the brother of

283
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,860
 King Richard the third. His death was he was to be executed. And so he asked that as part

284
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,020
 of his execution could he be drowned. But could he be drowned in a barrel of Malmse wine.

285
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,520
 So that was his choice. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't drunk it myself or drowned in it. But that's

286
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,380
 yeah. That was his way out. A legend obviously. Speaking of Kings being dipped in unusual

287
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,260
 liquids. Oh yes. We found our way there. Louis the 18th of France. His death is not interesting

288
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,500
 but his afterlife is fascinating. So he was the first king to be disinfected. His body

289
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:28,060
 after death. So he was washed with chlorides of lime which slows down decomposition. Okay.

290
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,660
 And it was so he could be presented to the public without odor. And this smell limey if

291
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,060
 anything should be nice. I don't think it's that sort of lime. It's not that kind of lime

292
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:42,380
 so be careful when you go to a bar. If you say can I have some lime with my gin and tonic.

293
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:50,740
 Yeah. Yeah. Don't get the one that is not. Oh no. Okay. All right. Oh boy. Anyway. Another

294
00:27:50,740 --> 00:28:03,620
 tragic death. It's not even a French royal. Okay. It is time for fact number three. That

295
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:10,300
 is Andy. My fact is that the natural history museum's collection of whale bones is so significant.

296
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,660
 They won't tell anyone where it is. So this is this bizarre installation that the natural

297
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:22,820
 history museum's got. And it's and where is it. I don't know. Tell us. It's secret. It's

298
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:29,740
 really secret. And they have so valuable about whale bones. Well it's it's an amazing archive

299
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,820
 of all sorts of species. So it's it's not only whales. It's dolphins, porpoises, and

300
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,500
 it's it's one of the most complete collections in the world. And they get a lot of bodies

301
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,460
 postmortem. If there have been whales or dolphins stranded, you know, they get the skeleton

302
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,820
 in the end. And what it means is if you have the skeleton, you can study all kinds of things

303
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:54,020
 about it. You can study diet. You can study the habitat. I know where they live. They live

304
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:03,940
 in the sea. I mean, you're not selling it to me this place. Well, which is where this

305
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:13,820
 guy who set up this place should go back to release some real estate wherever it is made.

306
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,900
 Well the things we do know about it, the secret location, supposedly it's behind a 10 foot

307
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:27,340
 tall door. So we can assume it's not in old France. But 10 foot tall. Is that because

308
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,980
 some of the bones are just so huge they need to. Oh, I guess so. I mean, no, actually,

309
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,380
 they might be tall and long. But if you put them the other way up, you can get them through

310
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,620
 the door. You know, but it's a good point that the article, which this came from, which

311
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,900
 was a Guardian article in the Journal somewhere around looking to it does not answer the question.

312
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,540
 Why is it secret? As in, okay, great. It's the biggest complete collection and so on.

313
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,820
 Just security. But from who? But no one's going around trying to steal. Maybe the Smithsonian,

314
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,580
 right? Who have the other largest collection. Did you see their collection? No, no. Is that

315
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,660
 secret as well? It's actually, they're a bit more confident. I think they publicly list

316
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,740
 the location. They have more animals. They have more individual animals. So 10,000. And

317
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,300
 they also, this is incredible. They have the largest blue whale jawbone ever found, which

318
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,180
 means that that is the largest bone of any animal ever found on the planet in its entire

319
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,380
 history. Wow. It's bigger than a, oh yeah, because it's bigger than dinosaurs. Blue whales

320
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,780
 the biggest animal ever to have lived. And that's the biggest bone in the biggest animal.

321
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,020
 And they have it. Wow. So cool. And that's, I find that interesting that the biggest bone

322
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,860
 in a whale is its jawbone. Actually, I don't know why I find that interesting, but that

323
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,140
 is good point. Not in humans. Yeah. No, no. Well, it wouldn't be the pelvis on a whale

324
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,980
 would it? On the femur. They've got big purposes though. Have they? Oh yeah. Have they? Oh yeah.

325
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,060
 They have. Oh, their pelvises are so interesting. I thought they sort of tapered off towards

326
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,260
 the end. Well, this thing. My bad. Well, because there's this whole thing that they have visigial

327
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,420
 pelvises, right? These legs that have, when they were walking on land and then they didn't

328
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,420
 need them all. So you can see. They went back in the sea. They went back in the sea. They

329
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,460
 got out of the sea. And then someone said, get in the sea. Yeah. And they went back in

330
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,940
 the sea. I think it was Philippa Perry. But yeah. So the story that I read, and this is

331
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,900
 from 2014, what they've noticed is a correlation between the size of the pelvis and the tessides

332
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,260
 and penis. And they think that with the muscles in between, the pelvis is basically used as

333
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,300
 a maneuvering object for when they're having sex in the sea. It's a thruster. Yeah. It's

334
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,060
 a thruster. It's a gripper. It's a controller. It's a controller. So the more the more convoluted

335
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:34,700
 the pelvis is, the better control the whale will have over its penis. And that means that

336
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,340
 if it's a, but you can tell how promiscuous the species of whale is by the shape of the

337
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,540
 pelvis. That is fascinating. Because a more convoluted one means more control, which is

338
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,460
 a vantage point. Is that true in the animal kingdom, do you think, like, or in the mammal

339
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,860
 kingdom? Are you just thinking about your own pelvis right now? I can't think of anything

340
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:56,580
 else. I don't know what that says about me. Yeah. But it's thought to be for sigil, isn't

341
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,140
 it? And this is the thing that we talk about, but they still use it. And also for the female

342
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,700
 whales, they think that it's possibly used for controlling the clitoris, but we can't

343
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,340
 see that because we don't have any of the bones or anything that remain. And we don't

344
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,300
 have scanners in the ocean. So how can we see whales having sex? They're trying to do

345
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,260
 things where they can, you know, mock up CGI, but that hasn't been done yet. Do we know

346
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:25,500
 how whales have sex? Very, very carefully. No, that's hedgehogs. Sorry. Like most mammals

347
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,780
 would do it doggy style, right? I think it's like that. Yeah. I'm not sure. I mean, one

348
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,460
 of your facts in the first ever episode of fish was about gray whales having sex in threesomes.

349
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,940
 That is true. And there's always, which means there's always a spare penis just flopping.

350
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:43,500
 I always find that's handy. I was just on this. I was reading the other day. One thing

351
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,660
 with the whales is quite often some of the, a lot of the ones that we have in the museum

352
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,380
 kind of washed up, right? They washed up on the beach and then we collected them and put

353
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,140
 them in museums. Yeah. And this is the thing that humans do, which is when a whale kind

354
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,460
 of goes on a beach, we decide that we need to clean it up. There's a few, lots of different

355
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,580
 reasons. One, they smell terrible, but two, they attract sharks. So if you've got a dead

356
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,340
 whale, sharks love it and you get more sharks in the area. But I was reading an article

357
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:17,420
 in what's that magazine that we all like online. It's about the sea. Okay. And they were saying

358
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,940
 that basically a beached whale was a really important ecosystem. Before humans used to

359
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,940
 take them all away. In 2020, there was a whale that washed up in, on a Dutch island and they

360
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,980
 left it there and they found it was visited by 57 species of beetle. And 21 of them had

361
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,780
 never been seen in that area before. So they just kind of came out of the woodwork and

362
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:43,700
 like got on this. And in Russia, they found a whale on the, in the north coast and they

363
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:49,260
 found that 180 polar bears were eating on this single carcass. But of course now, as

364
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,980
 soon as a whale gets washed up, we get rid of it. And it means that all these animals

365
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,820
 don't have the massive bounty that they would have otherwise had.

366
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,100
 Because it, yeah, it is amazing. Even not on land, but in the ocean, when a whale dies

367
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,100
 and it falls to the bottom, that's the beginning of a new city, basically. It's an extraordinary

368
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,900
 thing. You get every kind of life coming and living there. It's like dropping a skyscraper

369
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
 down.

370
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:19,420
 How long do blue whales live? The biggest creatures? Is it 200 or 300 years?

371
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
 It's a long time, isn't it?

372
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:27,380
 I think it's well over a hundred. Yeah. Yeah. Why? I'm just interested. Usually, the larger

373
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,900
 an animal is, the longer it lives, right? Generally speaking.

374
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
 Yeah.

375
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
 Yeah.

376
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,940
 And there are, we've, we, I think we've said before, there are some whales alive today

377
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,100
 that were alive before Moby Dick was written.

378
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
 Blind.

379
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
 Right.

380
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,900
 That was a really interesting thing about whales, which is that they have more cells,

381
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,100
 so you think they would get more cancer. And you would think that the bigger an animal is,

382
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,500
 the more cancer it should get, because it has more cells that could go wrong, but that

383
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,100
 doesn't happen. And we're not sure why.

384
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,300
 Maybe we need to study the bones and find out.

385
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
 Yes.

386
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,300
 If only we could find this.

387
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,900
 If only we had a depository of a massive amount of whale bones somewhere.

388
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:08,800
 Can I tell you, this is, this is pretty on topic for me. I found an article, headlined,

389
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,180
 whale bones, the world's most endangered bryophyte habitat, bryophytes is another word for mosses.

390
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:21,360
 And it is an article in the British bryological society journal. I love this. This is by a

391
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,580
 guy called Jeff Duckett, right?

392
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,740
 It was written a while ago now. And he says, however many times you've seen them, there

393
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,700
 is always a certain enchantment at finding members of the black naceae on dung pellets

394
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
 and rotting cadavers.

395
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,020
 This is a particular family of mosses. The stimulus for my present study was the chance

396
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:42,240
 discovery of tetrapodon manoidese growing on a decades old whale skeleton, the centerpiece

397
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,120
 in an Icelandic garden. What was, what was initially supposedly a bryophyte free holiday

398
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,520
 on Iceland then turned into a systematic search for mosses on whale bones.

399
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,040
 Imagine his wife. She's like, we're going to go to Iceland. There can't be any moss

400
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
 in Iceland.

401
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,320
 He's like Poirot, where Poirot always goes on holiday and none of that happens.

402
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
 There's a murder.

403
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
 Oh my God.

405
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
 Can I get down my favorite book?

406
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
 Please.

407
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
 Wow. I can get a favorite book.

408
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
 Oh.

409
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
 Whales bones.

410
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
 Wow.

411
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,500
 We've mentioned this very briefly on the podcast before, but it's called Whales Bones of the

412
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,460
 British Isles. And like we only mentioned it a couple of hundred episodes ago. So I think

413
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,800
 it's right for a retread. Oh, it was episode 28.

414
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,940
 So please can I mention this a second time.

415
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:30,100
 It's by Nicholas Redmond and his son and they are a father and son team. They spent 30 years

416
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:36,440
 traveling the UK just finding whale bone arches. This was a huge thing in the 19th century.

417
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,460
 You'd make an arch out of a whale's jawbone and they used to be a very famous one in Edinburgh.

418
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,780
 It's sort of solo standing that was sort of like out, out in the field or a pub sign.

419
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,000
 Look at that. The signboard of this public house in Downham is supported by a whale's

420
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 jawbone.

421
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 Wow.

422
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 They were.

423
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 They are big, those jawbones.

424
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 They're massive.

425
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 They were used for fencing.

426
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,340
 And that picture that you showed was the jawbone went to the just above the height of the actual

427
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,340
 pub itself.

428
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,340
 Yeah.

429
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,700
 So that's how tall it is for someone who's imagining it.

430
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
 Yeah.

431
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,500
 And the fence posts and crane hoist supports, I'm just reading a list of different users

432
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,580
 now, footstools, milking stools, benches, stepping stones.

433
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
 Amazing material.

434
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,580
 Yeah.

435
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,180
 So and yeah, this is just this book is such a labour of love.

436
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,500
 This is why the bit of the museum that houses the Whales Bones has to be top secret because

437
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,000
 it's such useful material.

438
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Yes.

439
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,200
 We'll start building houses out of them if we find where it is.

440
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
 This secret room.

441
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,280
 So the person who runs the secret room or at least as the head curator who seems to be

442
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,400
 asked about a lot is Richard Saban.

443
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,480
 And I actually met Richard years ago.

444
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,680
 I went for a tour of the natural history.

445
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
 Where?

446
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
 Where?

447
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
 Yes.

448
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
 Exactly.

449
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,680
 An industrial state off the M1 that he just by chance wanted to meet you at.

450
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,680
 Where?

451
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
 Where?

452
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,680
 That door.

453
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,440
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

454
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
 Okay.

455
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,760
 My fact this week is that Gerard Manley Hopkins once had nothing to drink for a week for a

456
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
 bet.

457
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,260
 He only stopped when his tongue went black.

458
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
 Good.

459
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,040
 He did that at school, I think.

460
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
 He did.

461
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
 Yeah.

462
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
 And he went to school high gay.

463
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
 High gay.

464
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
 Yeah.

465
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,400
 And he had more liquids than the body needed.

466
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
 Everyone was drinking too much.

467
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,000
 That's why he decided.

468
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
 And people said, no, no, what do you mean by that?

469
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,160
 And he really stuck by his guns and he said, no, I reckon I can go without any liquids

470
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,560
 for at least a week.

471
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
 Okay.

472
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,240
 So he did this bet with one of the other boys and not only his tongue went black, but he

473
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,040
 also collapsed and, you know, in the middle of a, you know, pee.

474
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
 Yeah.

475
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,640
 Pee would be the time you would collapse.

476
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
 Yeah.

477
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
 Absolutely.

478
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,080
 And the headmaster who was called John Bradley Dine, he sort of really punished him and he

479
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,760
 was forced to return the money, you know, because he got, they guys said, well, you

480
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,520
 know, you've done pretty well, so I'm going to give you the money, but he was forced to

481
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
 give it back.

482
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,600
 And he complained that he was being punished more than the other boy because not the other

483
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,960
 boy, they both got punished, but he also had to give the money back and just made the headmaster

484
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
 hate him even more.

485
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,560
 And he got, you know, he had a bit of a bad time at high gay.

486
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:25,600
 Um, it was a very original thinker and, uh, authority, like many teachers don't like

487
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
 that.

488
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,280
 They just want obedient children that don't ask too many questions and, uh, I expect he

489
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,240
 really irritated all his teachers because he was probably cleverer than they were.

490
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
 Yeah.

491
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,920
 But the thing with the liquids, yeah, isn't there a theory that if you ever have a pee

492
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,600
 or that shows you've been drinking too much, I said, no, no, no, you know, every time you

493
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,680
 have a pee, you're like, oh, you know what, I should have cut down on drinking earlier.

494
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,800
 Your pee should look like champagne, not stewed tea.

495
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
 Yeah.

496
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,320
 Whereas if you're not drinking very much, it will look like stewed tea.

497
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
 Mine is in cubes.

498
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,320
 Is that a problem?

499
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,040
 It's probably a problem when you're squeezing it out.

500
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
 I should think.

501
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
 Yeah.

502
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
 Okay.

503
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
 No.

504
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
 So he didn't think that he just thought people, it's a weird thing to decide that people

505
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
 are drinking too much.

506
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
 Yeah.

507
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
 Well, it would have been just a school argument that got out of hand, right?

508
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
 Yeah.

509
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
 That's all that.

510
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
 He did the same thing with salt, didn't he?

511
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
 Yeah.

512
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,120
 He had stayed from salt for a week for the same reason he wanted to show.

513
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
 Yeah.

514
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:28,600
 But what I think this shows is that he could steer his mind rather than just go with the

515
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,320
 flow and not be thoughtful and not be influenced.

516
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,640
 He could decide where he wanted to go in life rather than just be blown about in the wind.

517
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,240
 And these experiments who are doing, I think they're wonderful experiments to sort of,

518
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
 what can I do?

519
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
 What can my body do?

520
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
 What am I capable of?

521
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
 Yeah.

522
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
 Should we say who he is?

523
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
 Just quickly.

524
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
 Yeah.

525
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,740
 Because Philip, you're a fan, aren't you?

526
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,080
 Yeah, I did him for A level.

527
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
 I got a crush.

528
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,220
 And I bet he was gay, actually.

529
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,400
 I was just thinking about this now and I'm feeling slightly disappointed that I wouldn't

530
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
 have stood a chance.

531
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,280
 I'm afraid from the research he absolutely was, yeah.

532
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
 Oh, damn.

533
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
 Just quickly.

534
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,280
 He's like a really, really famous Victorian poet.

535
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
 Oh, yeah.

536
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,360
 He's a friend of Robert Bridges.

537
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
 Yeah.

538
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
 Another poet.

539
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
 Yeah.

540
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
 That's right.

541
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,640
 And he was sort of like late 19th century, wasn't he?

542
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
 Yeah.

543
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
 And I realise that's a very famous poet.

544
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,440
 And he invented something called sprung rhythm, which is, "I caught this morning's morning's

545
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,400
 minion dappled dawn drawn high there on a wimpling whim."

546
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
 Do you see what I mean?

547
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
 Yeah.

548
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
 You dance.

549
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
 The words dance.

550
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
 It's sort of...

551
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,680
 And where did you go there in terms of, if I was reading that on the page, am I on a

552
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,360
 third line or was that one line?

553
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
 I can't remember.

554
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
 Right, but...

555
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,960
 But it's not a big pentameter where you've got five feet, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum,

556
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
 ba-bum.

557
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
 Yeah.

558
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
 Ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum.

559
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,520
 It can go on forever and seems to fly like the birds he's talking about.

560
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,520
 Yeah.

561
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
 It's very jazzy.

562
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
 Yeah.

563
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,840
 And I was very taken with it as a keen A level student and he made me cry.

564
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,040
 I loved him so much.

565
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
 It was just so beautiful.

566
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,200
 And he never got to see any of it because he wasn't published until post his death, 30

567
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
 years after his death.

568
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,000
 He never got fangirled by me, which is probably quite glad to have him.

569
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 He was very slightly Hawaiian.

570
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Really?

571
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 Tell me more.

572
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,640
 Well, he had a strong Hawaiian connection in his life, basically.

573
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,360
 He wasn't personally Hawaiian himself.

574
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,680
 His uncle used to live there, right?

575
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,000
 Look, can you let me tell the story again?

576
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Right.

577
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,680
 He just had a lot of pineapple in his throat.

578
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,280
 He had a favourite pizza.

579
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,920
 His dad was the Hawaiian Consul General in London.

580
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
 Okay.

581
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,920
 So, and you write, Dan, yes, his uncle Charles had moved to Hawaii, but had fully learned

582
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,360
 the language and had established an Anglican bishopric in Honolulu.

583
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,800
 So I think he had lived there and then I think his father, who was called Manny Hopkins,

584
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
 that was his dad's name.

585
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
 Yeah.

586
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,680
 The son was Gerald Manny Hopkins, must have visited and been and, you know, sort of become

587
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,680
 the representative.

588
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
 I just think that's cool.

589
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,960
 You don't think of that with Manny Hopkins, you know.

590
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,520
 Well, because his family were Protestant, like you say, but then he just decided he

591
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,280
 was going to become Roman Catholic, didn't he?

592
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
 Yeah.

593
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,680
 And he was already writing some amazing poetry at that time, but when he became Roman Catholic,

594
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,240
 he decided to burn it all.

595
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
 Oh, yeah.

596
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,680
 This was, I'm just going to get rid of everything, I'm just going to stop becoming a poet, I'm

597
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,840
 just going to never do any poetry, I'm going to get rid of all my poetry.

598
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
 Yeah.

599
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,600
 I just don't understand that split with his parents because his parents sound really

600
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,000
 cool because they encouraged his original thinking.

601
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 And his mother was unusually highly educated for the time and also encouraged him.

602
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,640
 And do you think he went Roman Catholic because that's easier to be gay so you don't have

603
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,240
 to get married like you might if you're an angry connoisseur?

604
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,920
 We do know that he went, so like when he converted, he was trying to come home to see his family

605
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,480
 and so on for Christmases and stuff like that.

606
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,660
 And there are letters that sort of show that he would write to his dad saying, "Is it okay

607
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,840
 that I come back to the house?"

608
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
 And the suggestion...

609
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
 What causes these changes?

610
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,560
 Yeah, because the worry was that, and this was the condition, "Yes, you can come home,

611
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,800
 but absolutely by and of no means can you convert your brothers and sisters to your religion."

612
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,920
 So he had to promise he would not do that when he came back home.

613
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,720
 So it wasn't a complete rift as I'd been led to believe?

614
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,120
 It might have turned into that, but certainly for the first two Christmases after this letter,

615
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,160
 he was allowed to go back home and do that.

616
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,960
 You have to wear a lei, like everyone else at Christmas, you have to say hello to her,

617
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
 like all the rest of us.

618
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,000
 Oh, I know who's running a bit short.

619
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,320
 Can I just say about when he burned everything?

620
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,160
 So he burned everything at the age of 24, as in everything he wrote before the age of

621
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
 24, he burned.

622
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,840
 And it was as you say, James, because he got faith.

623
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,520
 And he gave up creativity because he couldn't reconcile his faith with his creativity.

624
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,040
 So he gave up writing for seven years and became a Jesuit.

625
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,240
 But what's the one thing you would do before becoming a Jesuit?

626
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
 So one thing that's not allowed.

627
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,760
 You want to have one last crazy blowout?

628
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,160
 Have a wank?

629
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
 Well, yeah.

630
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,600
 He did like orgasm.

631
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,280
 You can see a lot of metaphor for sort of orgasm things in the poem.

632
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,280
 Are there?

633
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,560
 We'll get back to yours in a second.

634
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,840
 He used to note that in his diary, there was a secret code, he used to say OH, which was

635
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
 old habits.

636
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
 And the old habits was…

637
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
 Having a wank.

638
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
 Having a wank.

639
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,040
 So he might have just been saying, oh.

640
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,780
 So what did he do before surfing?

641
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,440
 He ate a bit of fruit.

642
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440
 No.

643
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,840
 He visited Switzerland, which banned Jesuits from entering the country.

644
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,800
 So he took his opportunity to visit Switzerland, which might be code as well, for actually

645
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,800
 saying it now.

646
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
 It sounds like code.

647
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,800
 Visited Switzerland again this morning.

648
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:51,280
 Oh, I can't yodel.

649
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,640
 His big first poem, really sort of the one that he's largely known for these days.

650
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,640
 I know.

651
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,640
 I know.

652
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,720
 Wreck of the Deutschland.

653
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
 That's it.

654
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
 Correct.

655
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,720
 Yeah.

656
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
 So he wrote that.

657
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,360
 It was based on a shipwreck from the 1800s, 1875, and he was inspired by a group of nuns

658
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,800
 who were on the shipwreck who sort of prayed to God as they were going down, and that gave

659
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,560
 him the inspiration.

660
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,600
 And he, as part of writing it, created this amazing new technique in poetry, which it

661
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
 was called--

662
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,600
 Sprung rhythm.

663
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,000
 Sprung rhythm.

664
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 And so he sent it.

665
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,800
 He sent it into a Jesuit magazine called The Month to have it published, and they rejected

666
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,800
 it.

667
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,800
 No.

668
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,040
 And the article I was reading just had this really nice little sort of nugget of fact,

669
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,640
 which is that something that did make it into the Jesuit magazine as a poem was written

670
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:44,440
 by someone, a student, who identified himself as O-F-O, apostrophe F-W-W.

671
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,040
 Any idea who that could be?

672
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
 Gosh.

673
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
 O-O-F-O.

674
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,040
 O-O-F-O.

675
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,440
 F-W-W sounds like something to do with W-W-F.

676
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,440
 Nice.

677
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,440
 Well, wrestling.

678
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,440
 Wrestling Federation.

679
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,440
 Yeah, yeah.

680
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,440
 As a wrestler as Hulk Hogan.

681
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,440
 No, it's not.

682
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,680
 So it's Oscar, Fingle, O Flattery, Wills, Wild.

683
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,920
 It was Oscar Wilde's first ever published poem that made it into the Jesuit.

684
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
 Yeah.

685
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,920
 That's very nice.

686
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
 Yeah.

687
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,920
 Lovely.

688
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,920
 Dan, I think you said Flattery instead of Flaherty.

689
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,920
 Oh, did I?

690
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,920
 Sorry.

691
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
 Flaherty.

692
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
 Yeah.

693
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
 Flaherty will get you nowhere.

694
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,920
 I really hope someone gave Oscar Wilde a fun little sign for his house saying, "Flaherty

695
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
 will get you nowhere."

696
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,920
 For the loo or something.

697
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,920
 It's just so cute.

698
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,920
 Oh, Flaherty.

699
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,920
 That's amazing.

700
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,920
 Yeah.

701
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
 So that was the Jesuit.

702
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,920
 Sorry, that was the hinge moment at which Oscar Wilde got his break and Hawkins didn't.

703
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
 Yeah.

704
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,920
 And I think he wrote, was published until 30 years after he died.

705
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
 That's sort of true.

706
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,920
 It's sort of the slightly untrue because Robert Bridges.

707
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
 So who's that?

708
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
 Robert Bridges.

709
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,840
 He was an established poet.

710
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,560
 I think they met as fellows at Oxford or something.

711
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
 Yeah.

712
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,240
 And he was someone who Manly Hopkins would go to in order to impress and say, "Can you

713
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,240
 help me out?"

714
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,640
 And he read this amazing poem that we were just talking about, The Wreck.

715
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,120
 And he was like, "I don't want to read that again.

716
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
 That was painful.

717
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,120
 That was really hard."

718
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,240
 He sort of post-death became a champion of him.

719
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,520
 And so he thought the writing style was so difficult that Hopkins was doing that he would

720
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,120
 publish six poems as a sort of teaser taster just to get you used to the rhythms of this

721
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,120
 guy before publishing his collected works 30 years after his death.

722
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,680
 So there was a sort of like, you know, like putting out like a trailer episode of podcasts.

723
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,680
 Yeah.

724
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,200
 You know, it was kind of like that.

725
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,760
 He was also friends with Christina Rossetti, wasn't he?

726
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,760
 Oh, yeah.

727
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,760
 Hopkins.

728
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,760
 Yeah.

729
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,480
 And she wrote in the Bleak Midwinter, for instance.

730
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,120
 And I read one interesting poem.

731
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,240
 You made it sound like that was what she liked to write.

732
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,520
 She wrote the Da Vinci Code, but it was in the book.

733
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,280
 But she, I read this about her, which is really interesting, that she had a habit of stooping

734
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,680
 up to pick up stray pieces of paper in the street in case they had the Lord's name on

735
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,680
 them.

736
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,680
 Nice.

737
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,680
 Kind of.

738
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,760
 So there's a bit of paper and she's like, "Well, I don't want it blowing away if it says

739
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,760
 Jesus on it.

740
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,080
 I'm just going to pick it up just in case."

741
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,640
 She was the first person to collect those shopping lists that people make blogs out

742
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,640
 of.

743
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,640
 And she didn't like that.

744
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,640
 So she goes, "Oh, no.

745
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,160
 I'm just looking for Jesus."

746
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,280
 Do you want to hear a few words that Hopkins invented?

747
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,280
 Please.

748
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,280
 Yes.

749
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,280
 It's good.

750
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,160
 "Inscape," which is the essential quality of something, of anything really.

751
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
 Yeah.

752
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
 You know, the essence of it.

753
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
 Yeah.

754
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,680
 When kittenfishers catch fire, meaning when you see that sort of flash of their color,

755
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:35,160
 meaning that was deep in the core of them, and then it rippled out into the world, but

756
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,240
 it sort of came from their essence.

757
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,240
 Yeah.

758
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,560
 "Inscape" is sort of like the essence of a thing.

759
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
 Nice.

760
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
 He also coined the word "stressy."

761
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
 Stressy.

762
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,560
 Yeah.

763
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,560
 But he used it to mean, poetically, that it's characterized by stress and rhythm on the

764
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
 words.

765
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
 Oh, yeah.

766
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
 Brilliant.

767
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,560
 That's good.

768
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
 And no one, he wrote it in private correspondence.

769
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,280
 So he wrote it well before anyone else said, "I'm feeling really stressy today."

770
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,960
 Has anyone ever said that?

771
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,040
 I don't think I've ever said "stressy," actually.

772
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,040
 Don't be so stressy.

773
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,040
 Don't be so stressy.

774
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,040
 I think I have.

775
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,040
 People say it to me all the time.

776
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,040
 Yeah.

777
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,040
 The effect you have.

778
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
 Yeah.

779
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,200
 "Shivlight," that's another word by him.

780
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
 "Shivlight."

781
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,400
 "Shivlight," so S-H-I-V-E light.

782
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,800
 So it might be "shivlight" or "shivlight" in pronunciation.

783
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,240
 Does that mean "shimmery" or something?

784
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,320
 It's really beautiful.

785
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,360
 You know when you're walking through a wood and the sunlight passes through a tree and

786
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,680
 it breaks the beams, that's a shivlight.

787
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,840
 The shivlight you see, what breaks through the beams, and "silian" is another word that

788
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
 he came up with.

789
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,080
 It's the act of plowing a field and it's the sort of rich soil, the shiny soil that

790
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,120
 you get on a newly plowed field.

791
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:47,040
 If he had something that he felt so deeply about that language could not describe, he

792
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,080
 just made his own language up for it.

793
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,080
 So cool.

794
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,080
 Very cool.

795
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,480
 With his poems, I've had to have like a little glossary at the end to tell you what it means

796
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,480
 or would it be clear?

797
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,960
 It's only in the A-level notes, which I deeply relied on.

798
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,160
 Right, that is what, yeah.

799
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,080
 His love life is very sad and thwarted, basically, because he seems to have been gay in love

800
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:14,120
 with one man who died very tragically young and then never really recovered from that.

801
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:21,000
 He was in love with a young man called Digby McWorth Dolbin, who I just, I like this fact

802
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,680
 about him, so I like it so much.

803
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,240
 He was expelled from Eton.

804
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,240
 Can you guess what for?

805
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
 Wanking?

806
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
 No.

807
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,240
 It's not always the answer.

808
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,240
 But it will be.

809
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
 It will be.

810
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
 It will be.

811
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,240
 How are you on mastermind, that cycle?

812
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
 Dissort.

813
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
 Clean that chair.

814
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
 Dig started.

815
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
 I need to finish.

816
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
 What was it?

817
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:54,480
 Digby McWorth Dolbin, he was expelled from Eton.

818
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,160
 He's never going to get it in a million years for wandering the countryside dressed as a

819
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
 medieval monk.

820
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,160
 That's right.

821
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
 Shoeless.

822
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,160
 That's so sweet.

823
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,160
 I know.

824
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,160
 Isn't it?

825
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,640
 I can see why you fancied him.

826
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,640
 Yeah.

827
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:13,720
 It was sort of like imaginary world living in, a little bit poetic, flowing robes.

828
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
 Yeah.

829
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,720
 I know.

830
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,320
 And Hopkins confessed his love to his confessor because I think he was a fair bit older than

831
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,320
 Dolbin.

832
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,800
 And the confessor said, "Well, you can't have any contact with him except by letter."

833
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
 Oh.

834
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,920
 That's practically the same text as him now, isn't it?

835
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,920
 Oh.

836
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
 Oh.

837
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,920
 Oh.

838
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,240
 And then Dolbin tragically drowned just two years later, he was age 19.

839
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,240
 So young.

840
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,240
 It's really sad.

841
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
 Oh.

842
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,120
 That was a bit of a creepy age gap, actually, but you know.

843
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
 Yeah.

844
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,120
 I was sort of glossing over that.

845
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,120
 I think it's having more doom to romantic.

846
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,120
 Yeah.

847
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,320
 I'm sure we have enough.

848
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,320
 Yeah.

849
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,320
 Yeah.

850
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,320
 Yeah.

851
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,800
 Can somebody read us just one poem?

852
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
 Come on.

853
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
 Sounds like you can.

854
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,800
 Well, I do have one.

855
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,560
 Spring and fall, to a young child, Margaret, are you grieving over golden grove, unleaving

856
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,560
 leaves like the things of man you with your fresh thoughts care for?

857
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,560
 Can you?

858
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:18,440
 Oh, as the heart grows older, it will come to such sites colder, by and by, nor spare

859
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:26,680
 a sigh, though worlds of one wood leaf meal lie, and yet you will weep and know why.

860
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:35,960
 Now no matter child the name, sorrow springs are the same, nor mouth had, nor mind expressed,

861
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,440
 what heart heard of, ghost guessed.

862
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,640
 It is the blight man was born for.

863
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:54,640
 It is Margaret you mourn for.

864
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,640
 OK, that's it.

865
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,640
 That is all of our facts.

866
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,640
 Thank you so much for listening.

867
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,720

868
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,840
 the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

869
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,840
 I'm on @Sriberland.

870
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
 James.

871
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,840
 @JamesHarkin.

872
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,840
 @Andy.

873
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
 @AndrewHunterM.

874
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,840
 And @Philipa.

875
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,840
 @Philipa_Perry, I think.

876
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
 I'm not sure.

877
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
 It might just be @PhilipaPerry.

878
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,840
 No, it's @Philipa_Perry.

879
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
 OK.

880
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:21,840
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or our website, NoSuchThing

881
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,680
 isafish.com, all of our previous episodes are up there, and do make sure, more important

882
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,280
 than anything else, to look out for the future book of Philip Perrie.

883
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,120
 Let's see if she can remember what it's called.

884
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,600
 The book you wish everyone you love would read, and some of those you don't.

885
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,000
 That won't be published for months.

886
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,320
 No, not until October the 20th.

887
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,320
 Yeah.

888
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,560
 In the meantime, you could buy the book you wish you'll-- Oh, fuck, I can't remember.

889
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,640
 The book you wish your parents had read.

890
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,800
 And your children would be glad that they did.

891
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,800
 That you did.

892
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,800
 That you did.

893
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,800
 Fuck!

894
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,480
 It's a long time since I've done any publicity for that one.

895
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,480
 That's fine.

896
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,320
 Rice Babies will also be available this coming fall, by me, Dan Shriber.

897
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,440
 Otherwise, come back next week, we're going to have another episode.

898
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,440
 Another guest.

899
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
 We'll see you then.

900
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,440
 Bye.

901
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
 Bye.

902
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,440
 Bye.

903
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
 Bye.

904
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
 Bye.

905
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
 Bye.

906
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
 Bye.
