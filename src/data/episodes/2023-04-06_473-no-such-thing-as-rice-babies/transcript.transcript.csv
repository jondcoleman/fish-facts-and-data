00:02:01,00:02:06,"to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:02:06,00:02:11,"with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Philippa Perry and once again we have gathered"
00:02:11,00:02:16,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:02:16,00:02:21,order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Philippa.
00:02:21,00:02:29,"Hi, child rearing advice in the 17th century included tossing your baby up in a blanket"
00:02:29,00:02:38,to strengthen its nerves or firing pistols near it to boost its endurance. Okay I'm just
00:02:38,00:02:43,going to start by saying in case you suddenly want to run away and think that's a brilliant
00:02:43,00:02:52,idea that if you toss a newborn into the air it might break its neck because it's got
00:02:52,00:03:00,no neck muscles and a very big head so not a great idea. Is there a minimum age at which
00:03:00,00:03:11,tossing can commence? When did you start tossing? We got quite personal quite quickly. If you're
00:03:11,00:03:17,going to do something fun like toss somebody in the air it's a great idea if you've got
00:03:17,00:03:23,a bond and a relationship with them first. So don't go up to a random baby and think
00:03:23,00:03:28,oh babies love this and toss them into the air. A) they might break their neck if they
00:03:28,00:03:35,haven't got neck muscles in it yet and B) you do that as part of an ongoing relationship
00:03:35,00:03:43,and you have give and take with a baby. Okay so you can't exchange words but you exchange
00:03:43,00:03:50,looks and laughs. One of the first games a baby likes playing let's start general folks
00:03:50,00:03:59,is peek-a-boo. Now that is really scary for a baby. Especially when you fire a pistol.
00:03:59,00:04:07,Can we just drop the firing of pistols? Don't do that okay. Peek-a-boo right it's really
00:04:07,00:04:13,scary for a baby because they haven't got what we call object permanence. So if mummy
00:04:13,00:04:19,leaves the room that's why baby goes because mummy doesn't exist anymore. So mummy's gone
00:04:19,00:04:24,forever in the baby's eye. Possibly we haven't really got a concept of forever but mummy is
00:04:24,00:04:30,not there and we haven't got a sense of mummy ongoing in the other room yet. So it's pretty
00:04:30,00:04:38,scary and so peek-a-boo the baby thinks you've disappeared for a second and that is oh the
00:04:38,00:04:44,jeopardy and then when you arrive again the relief is hilarious and then again they want
00:04:44,00:04:50,to play that again and again and again that is the 17th century firing a pistol that we
00:04:50,00:04:59,do in the what we in now 22nd century or something 21st century. I had to think. People might
00:04:59,00:05:06,be listening to this in the 22nd century. Can I ask what the blanket tossing though?
00:05:06,00:05:11,Is this a case of are we thinking of a laid out blanket where we're flinging a kid into
00:05:11,00:05:17,the air like fox tossing the old sport? Yeah. So because I wondered if it was wrapping in
00:05:17,00:05:21,a blanket and tossing them up and down while they're raps. While they're squaddled. While
00:05:21,00:05:25,they're squaddled. Exactly. I think it's that. I think it's the old hold the blanket by the
00:05:25,00:05:29,corners and then. I think so. If you're trying to spread it from the nerves then it must
00:05:29,00:05:35,have some jeopardy I think. I think chucking a baby in the air at all is jeopardy. This
00:05:35,00:05:43,thing about treating babies and children cruelly to make them stronger is a utter complete
00:05:43,00:05:50,nasty myth that people still cling on to. My dear father for example when my daughter
00:05:50,00:05:56,was about two years old and she'd just grown too large to stand up underneath the piano.
00:05:56,00:06:04,She hit her head on the piano thing and I of course went to comfort her baby here. Dear
00:06:04,00:06:11,dear. A cuddle cuddle kiss kiss. My dad said don't do that. She'll hurt herself all the
00:06:11,00:06:17,time so that she can get that sort of comfort. You are rewarding her hurting herself. He
00:06:17,00:06:26,said and I went oh my God. Suddenly I realized why I needed 25 years of therapy. I know.
00:06:26,00:06:32,But is there a thing where if a small child let's say falls over right now they will sometimes
00:06:32,00:06:35,if you're in the room with a small child and they fall over and they will sometimes give
00:06:35,00:06:40,you a look as if they're kind of sizing up whether or not they're going to cry and if
00:06:40,00:06:44,you react in a big way they might say all right that is my cue to cry. They're sort
00:06:44,00:06:47,of engaging in it with you. Whereas if you say oh there we go and then you sort of you
00:06:47,00:06:51,know it depends how frightened you are of the fall. I mean sometimes you see a fall
00:06:51,00:06:55,and you think that doesn't hurt that much. That's what I mean. And so you go whoops a
00:06:55,00:07:00,daisy and we all go whoops a daisy. But you know when they're covered in blood and there's
00:07:00,00:07:06,a size of an egg on the head I think they're there darling that must hurt. Yeah isn't isn't
00:07:06,00:07:10,too bad. Okay. Good call. Yeah. That's a good level of distinction. Yeah. I say to my son
00:07:10,00:07:16,Wilf and Ted my sons when they're scootering if they fall over I say oh that was an amazing
00:07:16,00:07:23,blooper because we sometimes film and then so. You're after those 250 quid that you've
00:07:23,00:07:29,been framed don't you. Do it again in slow motion. My camera is not working in slow motion.
00:07:29,00:07:35,But Wilf came home one day scratched up and he said dad had an amazing blooper today. So
00:07:35,00:07:39,it kind of helps in a way. There's something else here as well is that children won't cry
00:07:39,00:07:44,with people they don't feel particularly safe with. Like one day my daughter had a quite
00:07:44,00:07:49,a nasty fall in the playground and the teachers were all saying to me when I went to pick
00:07:49,00:07:54,her up like oh she was so brave. She didn't cry. She didn't make a fuss. I looked at her
00:07:54,00:07:59,and think that's not like her weird. And so I went okay goodbye okay good. We walked around
00:07:59,00:08:06,the corner away from the school as soon as we got around the corner. I really hurt myself
00:08:06,00:08:13,really badly. And it was just delayed comfort. She didn't want comfort from the teachers.
00:08:13,00:08:16,She wanted comfort from me and I'm not saying you're putting it on because you didn't do
00:08:16,00:08:22,that at the time. Bollocks you just felt pretty sad about having fallen over and that was
00:08:22,00:08:29,incompleted that sort of like I feel sad I need comfort. And so whenever a child wants
00:08:29,00:08:34,comfort give it. Never mind this thing about what they're doing it for attention. Yes they
00:08:34,00:08:39,are. And that means you need to give attention. Because once they've had enough attention
00:08:39,00:08:45,that's then and only then that you learn to internalise the comfort you get from your
00:08:45,00:08:51,loving ones so that you can tell yourself things like it hurts now but it won't hurt
00:08:51,00:08:56,in a minute. You know you learn those things you learn to comfort yourself. You know if
00:08:56,00:09:01,something awful happens to me like I don't know I get my credit card pocket picked that's
00:09:01,00:09:09,the blooper of today or something like that. That's a great blooper. I want to ring up
00:09:09,00:09:13,either my husband or my daughter and go wow wow wow and I spend all morning on the phone
00:09:13,00:09:18,and getting things cancelled it's been really horrible. And I just want them to go there
00:09:18,00:09:25,there. So even when we're quite old I'm 65 we still need some external comfort you know
00:09:25,00:09:30,for big bloopers like and I'm expecting when I have my hip hop in a few weeks I'm expecting
00:09:30,00:09:36,lots of sympathy from you lot please. So from the sound of it Philippa you don't agree
00:09:36,00:09:41,with I've been looking up kind of historical you know childcare advice and parenting manuals
00:09:41,00:09:46,and things like that. Yeah there was a manual in the 15th century by Giovanni Domenici who
00:09:46,00:09:52,said that ideally you did I mean he did subscribe to Tuffening Children Up when small. Dress
00:09:52,00:09:56,them in rough clothing get them to sleep in the cold the worst of all withhold food and
00:09:56,00:10:04,wine. Oh what? No that's the last straw. Get child services out there right now. I mean
00:10:04,00:10:08,if you're sort of left out in the cold with no comfort I think the least you could have
00:10:08,00:10:15,would be a bit of wine to numb the pain. Nice wouldn't it. I'd be interested in the history
00:10:15,00:10:20,of childcare whether it kind of goes in cycles of kind of hard love and soft love or whether
00:10:20,00:10:25,we think we've kind of got to a point now and hopefully it'll kind of stay like this.
00:10:25,00:10:32,Well it is still going in a cycle really because we tend to do things in extremes so we go
00:10:32,00:10:38,from we must be authoritarian at all times and don't let them get away with anything
00:10:38,00:10:45,to hey free easy and then we think oh my god those kids have got no boundaries they don't
00:10:45,00:10:48,know where they are who they're allowed to be or anything they're all over the place
00:10:48,00:10:53,they've gone mad. We better toughen up again. So it does tend to swing like that but of
00:10:53,00:11:00,course after everybody's read my book you'll find the middle way where you have love plus
00:11:00,00:11:09,boundaries can't go wrong with that. Oh nice. Hugs and guns it's cool. It's not cold.
00:11:09,00:11:14,Were you when so when you had children that was some years ago as in when they were tiny
00:11:14,00:11:20,how old are your children now? 30. So were you by any chance I don't know if he was still
00:11:20,00:11:27,big then. A Spock reader. Dr Benjamin Spock. No. He was a bit before that wasn't he? Because
00:11:27,00:11:30,I was reading about him and there was like this whole debate about you know tough love
00:11:30,00:11:35,versus soft love and all of this because he his books were still being published you know
00:11:35,00:11:40,new editions in the late 90s which is the only reason I ask but he published his first
00:11:40,00:11:46,in 1946 and it saw 50 million copies by the time he died. Damn I've only said two million
00:11:46,00:11:52,I've got to wait again. Wow that is embarrassing. Yeah I know I bet he lived long and prospered
00:11:52,00:11:58,after that. Oh my god. Yeah. Yes. But he this is the crazy thing he was blamed for the eventual
00:11:58,00:12:03,children who grew up where their parents had bought the book in the mid 40s you know the
00:12:03,00:12:07,first edition. Yeah yeah because then in the late 60s he became a very prominent protester
00:12:07,00:12:12,against the Vietnam War and he was very famously you know he was leading protests and he was
00:12:12,00:12:17,told that his parenting style had led to permissiveness in the permissive society and that all these
00:12:17,00:12:21,long-haired hippies protesting against the Vietnam War were basically his children you
00:12:21,00:12:26,know and the parents brought them up in that style. This is like the rider of jaws then
00:12:26,00:12:31,spending the rest of his life doing short protection stuff you know like going the opposite
00:12:31,00:12:36,way for what he created. Yeah let's just stick to the middle way shall we. But he was a victim
00:12:36,00:12:41,of tough love too as a child he wasn't allowed to have a banana until he was 12. Interesting
00:12:41,00:12:45,really. What's what's what's the goss there. I have no more details than that I'm really
00:12:45,00:12:50,sorry I did try to find that. Well the mind boggles. This is a cool thing. Parenthood
00:12:50,00:12:54,during the pandemic was obviously an interesting thing if you had a baby during the pandemic
00:12:54,00:12:59,which I did you. It wasn't anything else to do wasn't it. There was nothing else to do.
00:12:59,00:13:04,Make a baby. Yeah exactly. But we had a thing where. We made sourdough. We made sourdough.
00:13:04,00:13:10,I had babies. You obviously couldn't visit families and so on. So in Japan someone had
00:13:10,00:13:16,this idea which worked really well which was a pandemic rice baby. So what you would do
00:13:16,00:13:21,is you would send a picture of the baby the face to this company and you would send the
00:13:21,00:13:25,weight of the baby. They would make a rice bag the exact weight of your baby with the
00:13:25,00:13:30,face on it and send it to the parents or the auntie or uncle or whatever. And so while
00:13:30,00:13:34,you were doing calls or whatever they could hold the rice baby and sort of feel like they
00:13:34,00:13:40,had. No the rice baby has fallen into a pound of boiling water. It doesn't matter. I've
00:13:40,00:13:46,been tossing the rice baby up into the air in a blanket with terrible results. So the
00:13:46,00:13:51,company did this and it worked really well and then this is now a sort of growing trend
00:13:51,00:13:56,in Japan at weddings now there's an opposite baby that gets handed to the parents of the
00:13:56,00:14:09,bride and the groom which is very old man. Sorry what I mean is what you do is you would
00:14:09,00:14:14,get a picture of say like James and his wife would get pictures of themselves as kids and
00:14:14,00:14:19,then they would have them printed onto a rice baby and you would give yourself as a child
00:14:19,00:14:23,back to your parents to say where I am now this is where I came from and you made me.
00:14:23,00:14:27,This is a present to remind you of the journey that we've been on. Well it's a beautiful
00:14:27,00:14:33,ritual. I think we should all integrate that into our lives. Yes. Put in your new book.
00:14:33,00:14:40,You write another book down alright. You keep your ideas for your books and I'll keep mine
00:14:40,00:14:44,for mine. Rice baby is going to be a best seller I'm telling you. No it's got to be
00:14:44,00:14:48,a more British kind of food. It's got to be a classic British food. It's got to be a
00:14:48,00:14:59,chips suet. Chippy baby. Yeah. Yorkshire pudding. Don't keep so well do they? I was reading about
00:14:59,00:15:03,when child care manuals started when they first took off because there were a few in the middle
00:15:03,00:15:07,ages but not very many and there wasn't you know mass literacy in the same way and it
00:15:07,00:15:11,was partly and this is particularly in America I'm talking about it was partly because people
00:15:11,00:15:17,were moving around more so you might be living 200 miles from your parents and your immediate
00:15:17,00:15:21,family so you don't have the immediate experience of a baby you know you haven't grown up in
00:15:21,00:15:25,loads of babies. People were moving around for work. A bit like nowadays really. So manual
00:15:25,00:15:30,is a very useful thing. It's like the old time NCT group. Exactly it really is yeah yeah
00:15:30,00:15:34,and that's when the manuals kicked off in a big way and now of course there are so many
00:15:34,00:15:40,you know thousands of manuals. But there's only one you really need to buy. Rice baby
00:15:40,00:15:52,is my dance driver. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this
00:15:52,00:15:57,week is that France has lost at least two of its kings due to death by walking into the
00:15:57,00:16:04,frame of a very low door. This is two that we know of. There may be more. To lose one
00:16:04,00:16:08,king by walking into the frame of a very low door. You know what at first I thought that
00:16:08,00:16:14,was a to lose joke. Yeah to lose as in as in La Trek. Oh I was thinking the southern
00:16:14,00:16:21,French town. Both would have been better than what I was doing. That's cool. Yeah so which
00:16:21,00:16:27,one's we talking. We're talking Louis the third who passed away in 882 the 882 and
00:16:27,00:16:34,then Charles the eighth. I'm presuming not the same door. Different no it's not no there's
00:16:34,00:16:41,no incriminating door here yeah. The killer door. It waits. Was there a bit of inbreeding
00:16:41,00:16:45,the old French royal family because you know they had another one didn't they who thought
00:16:45,00:16:51,he was made out of glass. Yes was that a French one. No it was a French I think it was one
00:16:51,00:16:58,of the Charles's who suffered. No no Charles the mad for some reason. But inbreeding couldn't
00:16:58,00:17:04,make you walk into a door frame. Well maybe you were brought up not to look where he would
00:17:04,00:17:09,be going. Oh almost I guess if you're the king. Maybe the French royals had a person
00:17:09,00:17:12,who would always tell you whenever you're about to hit a door frame. Yeah and it was
00:17:12,00:17:21,his day off. What a day. It's so funny. He took two days off in over 500 years. So Charles
00:17:21,00:17:26,the eighth his reason for running into the door was he was very excited to see a game
00:17:26,00:17:31,of tennis so he was rushing out the door didn't notice the height you know when you're rushing
00:17:31,00:17:37,out the door and you don't notice the height of a door you can crack your head. No. Tennis
00:17:37,00:17:43,has killed quite a lot of royals. Has it. Over the years yeah. So Louis the tenth of
00:17:43,00:17:48,France died of a chill after paying tennis on a cold day. James the first of Scotland
00:17:48,00:17:53,drowned in a storm drain that he was using to escape assassins. But the drain was blocked
00:17:53,00:17:58,by tennis balls and so he couldn't get out and he drowned. It's hard to blame that on
00:17:58,00:18:03,the tennis balls really isn't it. No but they be called to the stand definitely. It would
00:18:03,00:18:09,be especially ironic for him if he had been the one playing tennis and saying shall we
00:18:09,00:18:14,go and get those balls. No I can't be bothered they're in the storm drain. And that's a good
00:18:14,00:18:19,ironic. And Anne Boleyn was watching a tennis match at Hampton Court when she was arrested
00:18:19,00:18:25,and beheaded. Again. Not fair to blame tennis. So even if she'd been watching a squash game
00:18:25,00:18:31,they might have still arrested her. But that's a great connection and they're courts. Courts
00:18:31,00:18:41,and courts. That's the other guy by the way Louis the other guy King Louis the third was
00:18:41,00:18:46,chasing a girl into a house and she obviously bent and he didn't have been shorter than
00:18:46,00:18:50,him. Yeah. Yeah. She could have been shorter than him. Is it is it true that the reason
00:18:50,00:18:54,doors did use to be short is not because people obviously were smaller but because materials
00:18:54,00:18:58,cost so much that it made more sense to have less material for a wooden door. It might
00:18:58,00:19:03,have been because of the heating. So if you have a smaller door it keeps the heating more.
00:19:03,00:19:09,Okay. Right. I don't know about that. But think before you enter. Yeah. Good idea. I
00:19:09,00:19:14,really want to bend down to go into it. Yeah. So I mean yeah that's okay. Three loss to the
00:19:14,00:19:20,tennis court. One Venn diagram overlap of two lost to low doors. The lintels of a door.
00:19:20,00:19:24,That's it. Do you think it's because Kings wouldn't die of normal things that normal people
00:19:24,00:19:31,would die of? Of like so what like syphilis maybe they would but yeah as in they're more
00:19:31,00:19:35,likely to die of weird things. It was obviously a much more dangerous time in terms of overall
00:19:35,00:19:40,mortality and I don't know if Kings live longer or shorter than the average person because
00:19:40,00:19:45,they were better fed. Better fed. Yeah. Might have been washed occasionally at least twice
00:19:45,00:19:50,a year. Yeah. But you have more kind of aristocratic accidents and things like that because you've
00:19:50,00:19:57,got more horsing and yes yeah. France they did have a lot of aristocratic accidents at
00:19:57,00:20:02,the end of the 18th century. Yeah loads. It really racked up. Horses were a big one. Prince
00:20:02,00:20:07,Philip of France he died when supposedly he was going through the street and his horse
00:20:07,00:20:12,tripped over a black pig that was running out of a dung heap. That's bad luck isn't it?
00:20:12,00:20:16,That's bad luck. Yeah. There was another one who rode a horse off a cliff if you remember.
00:20:16,00:20:21,That's just careless. That is it's easy to do I almost ran off a cliff. On a horse? Not
00:20:21,00:20:26,on a horse. You almost run off a cliff sorry. Yeah in Australia there was going to the beach
00:20:26,00:20:29,and I saw the beach in the distance and I didn't have my glasses on me and I just ran
00:20:29,00:20:36,and ran and ran and as I got to the edge of the cliff I dove to the ground and managed
00:20:36,00:20:42,to stop myself just. I don't know why you've been let out at all. That's incredible. Have
00:20:42,00:20:47,you? That's easy to do. Have you heard of Carlo Man the second of West France here? Actually
00:20:47,00:20:52,no. Can you tell me all about him please? I only know about his death sadly but it's
00:20:52,00:20:59,an unusual death. He died after being stabbed in the leg by his servant but told us while
00:20:59,00:21:04,they were being attacked by a wild boar. So at this point we've got two low hanging
00:21:04,00:21:10,door deaths. Yeah. We've got three horse deaths. We've got three tennis court deaths and we
00:21:10,00:21:16,have now two pig based deaths as well. That's interesting. There's a lot of grouping going
00:21:16,00:21:20,on here. Yeah do you know any other pillow fight deaths than the one I'm about to tell
00:21:20,00:21:26,you? Oh well Mon Luther King. Mon Luther King had a pillow fight the day before he died
00:21:26,00:21:29,but it wasn't what killed him. Yeah I think it might have even been the day of. It might
00:21:29,00:21:34,have been like one of the last things he did. Can you start from the beginning? I forgot
00:21:34,00:21:39,you're here this show would implode on itself. So Charles the second of Alois who was the
00:21:39,00:21:45,son of Francis the first. He and his friends came across a load of buildings that had been
00:21:45,00:21:52,closed off due to the plague and he said to his friends no son of a king of France has
00:21:52,00:21:57,ever died of plague and so they went into these houses that had been closed off and
00:21:57,00:22:01,they sort of rolled around on the beds and had a pillow fight. Full of sleaze those beds.
00:22:01,00:22:06,Well full of yeah full of not nice stuff and sure enough a couple of days later he contracted
00:22:06,00:22:12,the plague and he died. That's a bad hubris. That's really hubristic yeah that's bad. Louis
00:22:12,00:22:19,the ninth also of France buried in Notre Dame so getting quite eminent now. Buried and now
00:22:19,00:22:36,cremated due to the recent fire. Oh yeah too soon Phillip. There's a theory that he died
00:22:36,00:22:41,because he refused to eat the local food when he was travelling. Staved? No it's worse than
00:22:41,00:22:48,that he was leading the eighth crusade in 1270 AD and he supposedly refused to have any vegetables
00:22:48,00:22:55,because it was you know some foreign muck and he only wanted. He only wanted old sausage
00:22:55,00:23:00,then back two years old from home. And he had terrible scurvy we think and didn't take
00:23:00,00:23:05,any vegetables from the surrounding countryside. That's a slightly simplified version of it.
00:23:05,00:23:10,Well he wouldn't have known of course that that was all cost scurvy. Absolutely. The arrogance
00:23:10,00:23:16,you get from being royal is really dangerous isn't it. You think you won't get plague.
00:23:16,00:23:20,You think you don't need vegetables. Do you think it's a therapist that you would ever
00:23:20,00:23:26,accept a case of a royal? Would it be very fascinating or too daunting? I couldn't possibly
00:23:26,00:23:34,say what? Oh don't be stupid. Harry no. Don't be dark. Charles the mother of the bar. That's
00:23:34,00:23:41,the word. He was called Charles the sign until he went to see Fred of the bar. No I haven't
00:23:41,00:23:48,seen a royal. It's not fun. Therapising very famous people yes because the point of knowing
00:23:48,00:23:54,very famous people is to gossip about them and you know on pain of death. So it's no
00:23:54,00:24:01,fun at all. I've always wondered if I I've I'd like to have a therapist but I want to
00:24:01,00:24:07,I almost feel like this needs therapy in itself. I would want a therapist who I found who is
00:24:07,00:24:15,a famous therapist. Wow. Yeah. Anyway. I mean we could analyse why you want to see a famous
00:24:15,00:24:20,therapist but I'm not going to do that in public. Okay. I can give you a clue. He's just obsessed
00:24:20,00:24:24,with famous people. But it's no it's not that I want I want there's something interesting
00:24:24,00:24:27,about them being famous and then becoming a therapist. I don't know. There's something
00:24:27,00:24:32,interesting to me. I'll shorten it. There's something interesting about your projection.
00:24:32,00:24:37,Yes. There's nothing interesting about the therapist themselves. Yeah. That's right. There
00:24:37,00:24:41,you go. There we go. Okay. That's done. So that saved you a lot of trouble. Whoa. What's
00:24:41,00:24:50,"this immediate invoice. 5,000. Jesus. We're going to have to do a last square space advert."
00:24:50,00:24:55,Anyway back to Kings back to Kings. Here's the thing. So this is James. You mentioned
00:24:55,00:25:00,the the French Revolution. Yes. As it as it as it happened and so after the deaths of
00:25:00,00:25:05,Louis the 16th wasn't it a marion tonette. There was a there was a son. They had they
00:25:05,00:25:11,had a son who would have been Louis the 17th who had had very sadly died but this wasn't
00:25:11,00:25:17,really widely known in France at the time. And there was this spell where dozens of impostors
00:25:17,00:25:24,came out of the woodwork claiming to be the missing dofan and this this word spread and
00:25:24,00:25:34,it's this is a really rare word is called the food domino for money. Why that stayed rare.
00:25:34,00:25:40,Food the phantom any so the funny meaning the and fo meaning false. I think you needn't
00:25:40,00:25:46,bother with the other. So I just love that and they had and they have varying degrees
00:25:46,00:25:50,of success. You know some of them were very clearly one of them was Native American and
00:25:50,00:25:55,just and still managed to succeed actually. He was called Reverend Elias Williams who did
00:25:55,00:26:01,persuade some people. But yeah. Charles the second of Navarre. He was known as Charles
00:26:01,00:26:07,the bad. He was sick and he was wrapped from head to toe in bandages soaked in brandy and
00:26:07,00:26:11,then you might absorb some of that. That would be nice. That'd be a good way of getting getting
00:26:11,00:26:16,your kicks wouldn't it. But unfortunately he was placed next to an open flame. Oh no.
00:26:16,00:26:22,They're not bright are they. They're not bright. This French royal family at all. Because
00:26:22,00:26:26,I think it's fair to not know that vegetables cause scurvy. But I think at that stage everyone
00:26:26,00:26:32,knew that brandy is flammable. But what I like about him his mother was Joan the second
00:26:32,00:26:40,who was the Queen of Navarre. And in 1328 she lost the areas of champagne and Bri. Of
00:26:40,00:26:48,all the areas of France you want to lose. The brandy one. There's so the brother of
00:26:48,00:26:52,King Richard the third. His death was he was to be executed. And so he asked that as part
00:26:52,00:26:58,of his execution could he be drowned. But could he be drowned in a barrel of Malmse wine.
00:26:58,00:27:04,So that was his choice. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't drunk it myself or drowned in it. But that's
00:27:04,00:27:09,yeah. That was his way out. A legend obviously. Speaking of Kings being dipped in unusual
00:27:09,00:27:16,liquids. Oh yes. We found our way there. Louis the 18th of France. His death is not interesting
00:27:16,00:27:21,but his afterlife is fascinating. So he was the first king to be disinfected. His body
00:27:21,00:27:28,after death. So he was washed with chlorides of lime which slows down decomposition. Okay.
00:27:28,00:27:32,And it was so he could be presented to the public without odor. And this smell limey if
00:27:32,00:27:37,anything should be nice. I don't think it's that sort of lime. It's not that kind of lime
00:27:37,00:27:42,so be careful when you go to a bar. If you say can I have some lime with my gin and tonic.
00:27:42,00:27:50,Yeah. Yeah. Don't get the one that is not. Oh no. Okay. All right. Oh boy. Anyway. Another
00:27:50,00:28:03,tragic death. It's not even a French royal. Okay. It is time for fact number three. That
00:28:03,00:28:10,is Andy. My fact is that the natural history museum's collection of whale bones is so significant.
00:28:10,00:28:15,They won't tell anyone where it is. So this is this bizarre installation that the natural
00:28:15,00:28:22,history museum's got. And it's and where is it. I don't know. Tell us. It's secret. It's
00:28:22,00:28:29,really secret. And they have so valuable about whale bones. Well it's it's an amazing archive
00:28:29,00:28:34,"of all sorts of species. So it's it's not only whales. It's dolphins, porpoises, and"
00:28:34,00:28:39,it's it's one of the most complete collections in the world. And they get a lot of bodies
00:28:39,00:28:44,"postmortem. If there have been whales or dolphins stranded, you know, they get the skeleton"
00:28:44,00:28:48,"in the end. And what it means is if you have the skeleton, you can study all kinds of things"
00:28:48,00:28:54,about it. You can study diet. You can study the habitat. I know where they live. They live
00:28:54,00:29:03,"in the sea. I mean, you're not selling it to me this place. Well, which is where this"
00:29:03,00:29:13,guy who set up this place should go back to release some real estate wherever it is made.
00:29:13,00:29:17,"Well the things we do know about it, the secret location, supposedly it's behind a 10 foot"
00:29:17,00:29:27,tall door. So we can assume it's not in old France. But 10 foot tall. Is that because
00:29:27,00:29:31,"some of the bones are just so huge they need to. Oh, I guess so. I mean, no, actually,"
00:29:31,00:29:36,"they might be tall and long. But if you put them the other way up, you can get them through"
00:29:36,00:29:40,"the door. You know, but it's a good point that the article, which this came from, which"
00:29:40,00:29:44,was a Guardian article in the Journal somewhere around looking to it does not answer the question.
00:29:44,00:29:50,"Why is it secret? As in, okay, great. It's the biggest complete collection and so on."
00:29:50,00:29:54,"Just security. But from who? But no one's going around trying to steal. Maybe the Smithsonian,"
00:29:54,00:29:58,"right? Who have the other largest collection. Did you see their collection? No, no. Is that"
00:29:58,00:30:02,"secret as well? It's actually, they're a bit more confident. I think they publicly list"
00:30:02,00:30:07,"the location. They have more animals. They have more individual animals. So 10,000. And"
00:30:07,00:30:13,"they also, this is incredible. They have the largest blue whale jawbone ever found, which"
00:30:13,00:30:18,means that that is the largest bone of any animal ever found on the planet in its entire
00:30:18,00:30:21,"history. Wow. It's bigger than a, oh yeah, because it's bigger than dinosaurs. Blue whales"
00:30:21,00:30:24,the biggest animal ever to have lived. And that's the biggest bone in the biggest animal.
00:30:24,00:30:28,"And they have it. Wow. So cool. And that's, I find that interesting that the biggest bone"
00:30:28,00:30:31,"in a whale is its jawbone. Actually, I don't know why I find that interesting, but that"
00:30:31,00:30:36,"is good point. Not in humans. Yeah. No, no. Well, it wouldn't be the pelvis on a whale"
00:30:36,00:30:40,would it? On the femur. They've got big purposes though. Have they? Oh yeah. Have they? Oh yeah.
00:30:40,00:30:45,"They have. Oh, their pelvises are so interesting. I thought they sort of tapered off towards"
00:30:45,00:30:49,"the end. Well, this thing. My bad. Well, because there's this whole thing that they have visigial"
00:30:49,00:30:54,"pelvises, right? These legs that have, when they were walking on land and then they didn't"
00:30:54,00:30:58,need them all. So you can see. They went back in the sea. They went back in the sea. They
00:30:58,00:31:02,"got out of the sea. And then someone said, get in the sea. Yeah. And they went back in"
00:31:02,00:31:08,"the sea. I think it was Philippa Perry. But yeah. So the story that I read, and this is"
00:31:08,00:31:13,"from 2014, what they've noticed is a correlation between the size of the pelvis and the tessides"
00:31:13,00:31:19,"and penis. And they think that with the muscles in between, the pelvis is basically used as"
00:31:19,00:31:24,a maneuvering object for when they're having sex in the sea. It's a thruster. Yeah. It's
00:31:24,00:31:29,a thruster. It's a gripper. It's a controller. It's a controller. So the more the more convoluted
00:31:29,00:31:34,"the pelvis is, the better control the whale will have over its penis. And that means that"
00:31:34,00:31:39,"if it's a, but you can tell how promiscuous the species of whale is by the shape of the"
00:31:39,00:31:43,"pelvis. That is fascinating. Because a more convoluted one means more control, which is"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"a vantage point. Is that true in the animal kingdom, do you think, like, or in the mammal"
00:31:46,00:31:49,kingdom? Are you just thinking about your own pelvis right now? I can't think of anything
00:31:49,00:31:56,"else. I don't know what that says about me. Yeah. But it's thought to be for sigil, isn't"
00:31:56,00:32:00,"it? And this is the thing that we talk about, but they still use it. And also for the female"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"whales, they think that it's possibly used for controlling the clitoris, but we can't"
00:32:04,00:32:09,see that because we don't have any of the bones or anything that remain. And we don't
00:32:09,00:32:14,have scanners in the ocean. So how can we see whales having sex? They're trying to do
00:32:14,00:32:18,"things where they can, you know, mock up CGI, but that hasn't been done yet. Do we know"
00:32:18,00:32:25,"how whales have sex? Very, very carefully. No, that's hedgehogs. Sorry. Like most mammals"
00:32:25,00:32:29,"would do it doggy style, right? I think it's like that. Yeah. I'm not sure. I mean, one"
00:32:29,00:32:34,of your facts in the first ever episode of fish was about gray whales having sex in threesomes.
00:32:34,00:32:37,"That is true. And there's always, which means there's always a spare penis just flopping."
00:32:37,00:32:43,I always find that's handy. I was just on this. I was reading the other day. One thing
00:32:43,00:32:47,"with the whales is quite often some of the, a lot of the ones that we have in the museum"
00:32:47,00:32:51,"kind of washed up, right? They washed up on the beach and then we collected them and put"
00:32:51,00:32:56,"them in museums. Yeah. And this is the thing that humans do, which is when a whale kind"
00:32:56,00:33:00,"of goes on a beach, we decide that we need to clean it up. There's a few, lots of different"
00:33:00,00:33:05,"reasons. One, they smell terrible, but two, they attract sharks. So if you've got a dead"
00:33:05,00:33:10,"whale, sharks love it and you get more sharks in the area. But I was reading an article"
00:33:10,00:33:17,in what's that magazine that we all like online. It's about the sea. Okay. And they were saying
00:33:17,00:33:22,that basically a beached whale was a really important ecosystem. Before humans used to
00:33:22,00:33:27,"take them all away. In 2020, there was a whale that washed up in, on a Dutch island and they"
00:33:27,00:33:32,left it there and they found it was visited by 57 species of beetle. And 21 of them had
00:33:32,00:33:36,never been seen in that area before. So they just kind of came out of the woodwork and
00:33:36,00:33:43,"like got on this. And in Russia, they found a whale on the, in the north coast and they"
00:33:43,00:33:49,"found that 180 polar bears were eating on this single carcass. But of course now, as"
00:33:49,00:33:52,"soon as a whale gets washed up, we get rid of it. And it means that all these animals"
00:33:52,00:33:56,don't have the massive bounty that they would have otherwise had.
00:33:56,00:34:01,"Because it, yeah, it is amazing. Even not on land, but in the ocean, when a whale dies"
00:34:01,00:34:06,"and it falls to the bottom, that's the beginning of a new city, basically. It's an extraordinary"
00:34:06,00:34:10,thing. You get every kind of life coming and living there. It's like dropping a skyscraper
00:34:10,00:34:11,down.
00:34:11,00:34:19,How long do blue whales live? The biggest creatures? Is it 200 or 300 years?
00:34:19,00:34:20,"It's a long time, isn't it?"
00:34:20,00:34:27,"I think it's well over a hundred. Yeah. Yeah. Why? I'm just interested. Usually, the larger"
00:34:27,00:34:30,"an animal is, the longer it lives, right? Generally speaking."
00:34:30,00:34:31,Yeah.
00:34:31,00:34:32,Yeah.
00:34:32,00:34:34,"And there are, we've, we, I think we've said before, there are some whales alive today"
00:34:34,00:34:37,that were alive before Moby Dick was written.
00:34:37,00:34:38,Blind.
00:34:38,00:34:39,Right.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"That was a really interesting thing about whales, which is that they have more cells,"
00:34:42,00:34:47,"so you think they would get more cancer. And you would think that the bigger an animal is,"
00:34:47,00:34:50,"the more cancer it should get, because it has more cells that could go wrong, but that"
00:34:50,00:34:52,doesn't happen. And we're not sure why.
00:34:52,00:34:55,Maybe we need to study the bones and find out.
00:34:55,00:34:56,Yes.
00:34:56,00:34:57,If only we could find this.
00:34:57,00:35:01,If only we had a depository of a massive amount of whale bones somewhere.
00:35:01,00:35:08,"Can I tell you, this is, this is pretty on topic for me. I found an article, headlined,"
00:35:08,00:35:16,"whale bones, the world's most endangered bryophyte habitat, bryophytes is another word for mosses."
00:35:16,00:35:21,And it is an article in the British bryological society journal. I love this. This is by a
00:35:21,00:35:22,"guy called Jeff Duckett, right?"
00:35:22,00:35:25,"It was written a while ago now. And he says, however many times you've seen them, there"
00:35:25,00:35:30,is always a certain enchantment at finding members of the black naceae on dung pellets
00:35:30,00:35:31,and rotting cadavers.
00:35:31,00:35:36,This is a particular family of mosses. The stimulus for my present study was the chance
00:35:36,00:35:42,"discovery of tetrapodon manoidese growing on a decades old whale skeleton, the centerpiece"
00:35:42,00:35:48,"in an Icelandic garden. What was, what was initially supposedly a bryophyte free holiday"
00:35:48,00:35:52,on Iceland then turned into a systematic search for mosses on whale bones.
00:35:52,00:35:57,"Imagine his wife. She's like, we're going to go to Iceland. There can't be any moss"
00:35:57,00:35:58,in Iceland.
00:35:58,00:36:01,"He's like Poirot, where Poirot always goes on holiday and none of that happens."
00:36:01,00:36:02,There's a murder.
00:36:02,00:36:03,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:03,00:36:04,Oh my God.
00:36:04,00:36:05,Can I get down my favorite book?
00:36:05,00:36:06,Please.
00:36:06,00:36:07,Wow. I can get a favorite book.
00:36:07,00:36:08,Oh.
00:36:08,00:36:09,Whales bones.
00:36:09,00:36:10,Wow.
00:36:10,00:36:14,"We've mentioned this very briefly on the podcast before, but it's called Whales Bones of the"
00:36:14,00:36:18,British Isles. And like we only mentioned it a couple of hundred episodes ago. So I think
00:36:18,00:36:20,"it's right for a retread. Oh, it was episode 28."
00:36:20,00:36:24,So please can I mention this a second time.
00:36:24,00:36:30,It's by Nicholas Redmond and his son and they are a father and son team. They spent 30 years
00:36:30,00:36:36,traveling the UK just finding whale bone arches. This was a huge thing in the 19th century.
00:36:36,00:36:41,You'd make an arch out of a whale's jawbone and they used to be a very famous one in Edinburgh.
00:36:41,00:36:47,"It's sort of solo standing that was sort of like out, out in the field or a pub sign."
00:36:47,00:36:51,Look at that. The signboard of this public house in Downham is supported by a whale's
00:36:51,00:36:52,jawbone.
00:36:52,00:36:53,Wow.
00:36:53,00:36:54,They were.
00:36:54,00:36:55,"They are big, those jawbones."
00:36:55,00:36:56,They're massive.
00:36:56,00:36:57,They were used for fencing.
00:36:57,00:37:02,And that picture that you showed was the jawbone went to the just above the height of the actual
00:37:02,00:37:03,pub itself.
00:37:03,00:37:04,Yeah.
00:37:04,00:37:06,So that's how tall it is for someone who's imagining it.
00:37:06,00:37:07,Yeah.
00:37:07,00:37:12,"And the fence posts and crane hoist supports, I'm just reading a list of different users"
00:37:12,00:37:16,"now, footstools, milking stools, benches, stepping stones."
00:37:16,00:37:17,Amazing material.
00:37:17,00:37:18,Yeah.
00:37:18,00:37:20,"So and yeah, this is just this book is such a labour of love."
00:37:20,00:37:25,This is why the bit of the museum that houses the Whales Bones has to be top secret because
00:37:25,00:37:27,it's such useful material.
00:37:27,00:37:28,Yes.
00:37:28,00:37:31,We'll start building houses out of them if we find where it is.
00:37:31,00:37:32,This secret room.
00:37:32,00:37:36,So the person who runs the secret room or at least as the head curator who seems to be
00:37:36,00:37:38,asked about a lot is Richard Saban.
00:37:38,00:37:40,And I actually met Richard years ago.
00:37:40,00:37:42,I went for a tour of the natural history.
00:37:42,00:37:43,Where?
00:37:43,00:37:44,Where?
00:37:44,00:37:45,Yes.
00:37:45,00:37:46,Exactly.
00:37:46,00:37:48,An industrial state off the M1 that he just by chance wanted to meet you at.
00:37:48,00:37:49,Where?
00:37:49,00:37:50,Where?
00:37:50,00:37:55,That door.
00:37:55,00:38:03,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James."
00:38:03,00:38:04,Okay.
00:38:04,00:38:08,My fact this week is that Gerard Manley Hopkins once had nothing to drink for a week for a
00:38:08,00:38:09,bet.
00:38:09,00:38:12,He only stopped when his tongue went black.
00:38:12,00:38:13,Good.
00:38:13,00:38:15,"He did that at school, I think."
00:38:15,00:38:16,He did.
00:38:16,00:38:17,Yeah.
00:38:17,00:38:18,And he went to school high gay.
00:38:18,00:38:19,High gay.
00:38:19,00:38:20,Yeah.
00:38:20,00:38:22,And he had more liquids than the body needed.
00:38:22,00:38:23,Everyone was drinking too much.
00:38:23,00:38:25,That's why he decided.
00:38:25,00:38:27,"And people said, no, no, what do you mean by that?"
00:38:27,00:38:32,"And he really stuck by his guns and he said, no, I reckon I can go without any liquids"
00:38:32,00:38:33,for at least a week.
00:38:33,00:38:34,Okay.
00:38:34,00:38:39,"So he did this bet with one of the other boys and not only his tongue went black, but he"
00:38:39,00:38:43,"also collapsed and, you know, in the middle of a, you know, pee."
00:38:43,00:38:44,Yeah.
00:38:44,00:38:45,Pee would be the time you would collapse.
00:38:45,00:38:46,Yeah.
00:38:46,00:38:47,Absolutely.
00:38:47,00:38:53,"And the headmaster who was called John Bradley Dine, he sort of really punished him and he"
00:38:53,00:38:57,"was forced to return the money, you know, because he got, they guys said, well, you"
00:38:57,00:39:00,"know, you've done pretty well, so I'm going to give you the money, but he was forced to"
00:39:00,00:39:01,give it back.
00:39:01,00:39:05,And he complained that he was being punished more than the other boy because not the other
00:39:05,00:39:10,"boy, they both got punished, but he also had to give the money back and just made the headmaster"
00:39:10,00:39:11,hate him even more.
00:39:11,00:39:15,"And he got, you know, he had a bit of a bad time at high gay."
00:39:15,00:39:25,"Um, it was a very original thinker and, uh, authority, like many teachers don't like"
00:39:25,00:39:26,that.
00:39:26,00:39:31,"They just want obedient children that don't ask too many questions and, uh, I expect he"
00:39:31,00:39:35,really irritated all his teachers because he was probably cleverer than they were.
00:39:35,00:39:36,Yeah.
00:39:36,00:39:41,"But the thing with the liquids, yeah, isn't there a theory that if you ever have a pee"
00:39:41,00:39:48,"or that shows you've been drinking too much, I said, no, no, no, you know, every time you"
00:39:48,00:39:51,"have a pee, you're like, oh, you know what, I should have cut down on drinking earlier."
00:39:51,00:39:54,"Your pee should look like champagne, not stewed tea."
00:39:54,00:39:55,Yeah.
00:39:55,00:39:58,"Whereas if you're not drinking very much, it will look like stewed tea."
00:39:58,00:39:59,Mine is in cubes.
00:39:59,00:40:01,Is that a problem?
00:40:01,00:40:05,It's probably a problem when you're squeezing it out.
00:40:05,00:40:06,I should think.
00:40:06,00:40:07,Yeah.
00:40:07,00:40:08,Okay.
00:40:08,00:40:09,No.
00:40:09,00:40:10,"So he didn't think that he just thought people, it's a weird thing to decide that people"
00:40:10,00:40:11,are drinking too much.
00:40:11,00:40:12,Yeah.
00:40:12,00:40:13,"Well, it would have been just a school argument that got out of hand, right?"
00:40:13,00:40:14,Yeah.
00:40:14,00:40:15,That's all that.
00:40:15,00:40:16,"He did the same thing with salt, didn't he?"
00:40:16,00:40:17,Yeah.
00:40:17,00:40:19,He had stayed from salt for a week for the same reason he wanted to show.
00:40:19,00:40:20,Yeah.
00:40:20,00:40:28,But what I think this shows is that he could steer his mind rather than just go with the
00:40:28,00:40:32,flow and not be thoughtful and not be influenced.
00:40:32,00:40:37,He could decide where he wanted to go in life rather than just be blown about in the wind.
00:40:37,00:40:42,"And these experiments who are doing, I think they're wonderful experiments to sort of,"
00:40:42,00:40:43,what can I do?
00:40:43,00:40:44,What can my body do?
00:40:44,00:40:45,What am I capable of?
00:40:45,00:40:46,Yeah.
00:40:46,00:40:47,Should we say who he is?
00:40:47,00:40:48,Just quickly.
00:40:48,00:40:49,Yeah.
00:40:49,00:40:50,"Because Philip, you're a fan, aren't you?"
00:40:50,00:40:52,"Yeah, I did him for A level."
00:40:52,00:40:54,I got a crush.
00:40:54,00:40:56,"And I bet he was gay, actually."
00:40:56,00:40:59,I was just thinking about this now and I'm feeling slightly disappointed that I wouldn't
00:40:59,00:41:00,have stood a chance.
00:41:00,00:41:03,"I'm afraid from the research he absolutely was, yeah."
00:41:03,00:41:04,"Oh, damn."
00:41:04,00:41:05,Just quickly.
00:41:05,00:41:08,"He's like a really, really famous Victorian poet."
00:41:08,00:41:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:09,00:41:11,He's a friend of Robert Bridges.
00:41:11,00:41:12,Yeah.
00:41:12,00:41:13,Another poet.
00:41:13,00:41:14,Yeah.
00:41:14,00:41:15,That's right.
00:41:15,00:41:19,"And he was sort of like late 19th century, wasn't he?"
00:41:19,00:41:20,Yeah.
00:41:20,00:41:21,And I realise that's a very famous poet.
00:41:21,00:41:27,"And he invented something called sprung rhythm, which is, ""I caught this morning's morning's"
00:41:27,00:41:32,"minion dappled dawn drawn high there on a wimpling whim."""
00:41:32,00:41:33,Do you see what I mean?
00:41:33,00:41:34,Yeah.
00:41:34,00:41:35,You dance.
00:41:35,00:41:36,The words dance.
00:41:36,00:41:37,It's sort of...
00:41:37,00:41:40,"And where did you go there in terms of, if I was reading that on the page, am I on a"
00:41:40,00:41:42,third line or was that one line?
00:41:42,00:41:43,I can't remember.
00:41:43,00:41:44,"Right, but..."
00:41:44,00:41:47,"But it's not a big pentameter where you've got five feet, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum,"
00:41:47,00:41:48,ba-bum.
00:41:48,00:41:49,Yeah.
00:41:49,00:41:50,"Ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum."
00:41:50,00:41:54,It can go on forever and seems to fly like the birds he's talking about.
00:41:54,00:41:55,Yeah.
00:41:55,00:41:56,It's very jazzy.
00:41:56,00:41:57,Yeah.
00:41:57,00:42:01,And I was very taken with it as a keen A level student and he made me cry.
00:42:01,00:42:03,I loved him so much.
00:42:03,00:42:04,It was just so beautiful.
00:42:04,00:42:09,"And he never got to see any of it because he wasn't published until post his death, 30"
00:42:09,00:42:10,years after his death.
00:42:10,00:42:15,"He never got fangirled by me, which is probably quite glad to have him."
00:42:15,00:42:16,He was very slightly Hawaiian.
00:42:16,00:42:17,Really?
00:42:17,00:42:18,Tell me more.
00:42:18,00:42:20,"Well, he had a strong Hawaiian connection in his life, basically."
00:42:20,00:42:22,He wasn't personally Hawaiian himself.
00:42:22,00:42:23,"His uncle used to live there, right?"
00:42:23,00:42:26,"Look, can you let me tell the story again?"
00:42:26,00:42:27,Right.
00:42:27,00:42:29,He just had a lot of pineapple in his throat.
00:42:29,00:42:34,He had a favourite pizza.
00:42:34,00:42:36,His dad was the Hawaiian Consul General in London.
00:42:36,00:42:37,Okay.
00:42:37,00:42:41,"So, and you write, Dan, yes, his uncle Charles had moved to Hawaii, but had fully learned"
00:42:41,00:42:47,the language and had established an Anglican bishopric in Honolulu.
00:42:47,00:42:51,"So I think he had lived there and then I think his father, who was called Manny Hopkins,"
00:42:51,00:42:52,that was his dad's name.
00:42:52,00:42:53,Yeah.
00:42:53,00:42:57,"The son was Gerald Manny Hopkins, must have visited and been and, you know, sort of become"
00:42:57,00:42:58,the representative.
00:42:58,00:42:59,I just think that's cool.
00:42:59,00:43:01,"You don't think of that with Manny Hopkins, you know."
00:43:01,00:43:05,"Well, because his family were Protestant, like you say, but then he just decided he"
00:43:05,00:43:07,"was going to become Roman Catholic, didn't he?"
00:43:07,00:43:08,Yeah.
00:43:08,00:43:11,"And he was already writing some amazing poetry at that time, but when he became Roman Catholic,"
00:43:11,00:43:13,he decided to burn it all.
00:43:13,00:43:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:14,00:43:17,"This was, I'm just going to get rid of everything, I'm just going to stop becoming a poet, I'm"
00:43:17,00:43:20,"just going to never do any poetry, I'm going to get rid of all my poetry."
00:43:20,00:43:21,Yeah.
00:43:21,00:43:25,I just don't understand that split with his parents because his parents sound really
00:43:25,00:43:29,cool because they encouraged his original thinking.
00:43:29,00:43:36,And his mother was unusually highly educated for the time and also encouraged him.
00:43:36,00:43:41,And do you think he went Roman Catholic because that's easier to be gay so you don't have
00:43:41,00:43:44,to get married like you might if you're an angry connoisseur?
00:43:44,00:43:50,"We do know that he went, so like when he converted, he was trying to come home to see his family"
00:43:50,00:43:52,and so on for Christmases and stuff like that.
00:43:52,00:43:56,"And there are letters that sort of show that he would write to his dad saying, ""Is it okay"
00:43:56,00:43:58,"that I come back to the house?"""
00:43:58,00:43:59,And the suggestion...
00:43:59,00:44:00,What causes these changes?
00:44:00,00:44:04,"Yeah, because the worry was that, and this was the condition, ""Yes, you can come home,"
00:44:04,00:44:08,"but absolutely by and of no means can you convert your brothers and sisters to your religion."""
00:44:08,00:44:11,So he had to promise he would not do that when he came back home.
00:44:11,00:44:15,So it wasn't a complete rift as I'd been led to believe?
00:44:15,00:44:19,"It might have turned into that, but certainly for the first two Christmases after this letter,"
00:44:19,00:44:21,he was allowed to go back home and do that.
00:44:21,00:44:24,"You have to wear a lei, like everyone else at Christmas, you have to say hello to her,"
00:44:24,00:44:26,like all the rest of us.
00:44:26,00:44:32,"Oh, I know who's running a bit short."
00:44:32,00:44:34,Can I just say about when he burned everything?
00:44:34,00:44:38,"So he burned everything at the age of 24, as in everything he wrote before the age of"
00:44:38,00:44:39,"24, he burned."
00:44:39,00:44:41,"And it was as you say, James, because he got faith."
00:44:41,00:44:45,And he gave up creativity because he couldn't reconcile his faith with his creativity.
00:44:45,00:44:50,So he gave up writing for seven years and became a Jesuit.
00:44:50,00:44:54,But what's the one thing you would do before becoming a Jesuit?
00:44:54,00:44:55,So one thing that's not allowed.
00:44:55,00:44:57,You want to have one last crazy blowout?
00:44:57,00:45:00,Have a wank?
00:45:00,00:45:01,"Well, yeah."
00:45:01,00:45:04,He did like orgasm.
00:45:04,00:45:08,You can see a lot of metaphor for sort of orgasm things in the poem.
00:45:08,00:45:09,Are there?
00:45:09,00:45:11,We'll get back to yours in a second.
00:45:11,00:45:15,"He used to note that in his diary, there was a secret code, he used to say OH, which was"
00:45:15,00:45:16,old habits.
00:45:16,00:45:17,And the old habits was…
00:45:17,00:45:18,Having a wank.
00:45:18,00:45:19,Having a wank.
00:45:19,00:45:22,"So he might have just been saying, oh."
00:45:22,00:45:26,So what did he do before surfing?
00:45:26,00:45:28,He ate a bit of fruit.
00:45:28,00:45:29,No.
00:45:29,00:45:33,"He visited Switzerland, which banned Jesuits from entering the country."
00:45:33,00:45:39,"So he took his opportunity to visit Switzerland, which might be code as well, for actually"
00:45:39,00:45:40,saying it now.
00:45:40,00:45:41,It sounds like code.
00:45:41,00:45:43,Visited Switzerland again this morning.
00:45:43,00:45:51,"Oh, I can't yodel."
00:45:51,00:45:55,"His big first poem, really sort of the one that he's largely known for these days."
00:45:55,00:45:56,I know.
00:45:56,00:45:57,I know.
00:45:57,00:45:58,Wreck of the Deutschland.
00:45:58,00:45:59,That's it.
00:45:59,00:46:00,Correct.
00:46:00,00:46:01,Yeah.
00:46:01,00:46:02,So he wrote that.
00:46:02,00:46:07,"It was based on a shipwreck from the 1800s, 1875, and he was inspired by a group of nuns"
00:46:07,00:46:10,"who were on the shipwreck who sort of prayed to God as they were going down, and that gave"
00:46:10,00:46:12,him the inspiration.
00:46:12,00:46:17,"And he, as part of writing it, created this amazing new technique in poetry, which it"
00:46:17,00:46:18,was called--
00:46:18,00:46:19,Sprung rhythm.
00:46:19,00:46:21,Sprung rhythm.
00:46:21,00:46:22,And so he sent it.
00:46:22,00:46:26,"He sent it into a Jesuit magazine called The Month to have it published, and they rejected"
00:46:26,00:46:27,it.
00:46:27,00:46:28,No.
00:46:28,00:46:33,"And the article I was reading just had this really nice little sort of nugget of fact,"
00:46:33,00:46:37,which is that something that did make it into the Jesuit magazine as a poem was written
00:46:37,00:46:44,"by someone, a student, who identified himself as O-F-O, apostrophe F-W-W."
00:46:44,00:46:46,Any idea who that could be?
00:46:46,00:46:47,Gosh.
00:46:47,00:46:48,O-O-F-O.
00:46:48,00:46:49,O-O-F-O.
00:46:49,00:46:51,F-W-W sounds like something to do with W-W-F.
00:46:51,00:46:52,Nice.
00:46:52,00:46:53,"Well, wrestling."
00:46:53,00:46:54,Wrestling Federation.
00:46:54,00:46:55,"Yeah, yeah."
00:46:55,00:46:56,As a wrestler as Hulk Hogan.
00:46:56,00:46:57,"No, it's not."
00:46:57,00:47:02,"So it's Oscar, Fingle, O Flattery, Wills, Wild."
00:47:02,00:47:06,It was Oscar Wilde's first ever published poem that made it into the Jesuit.
00:47:06,00:47:07,Yeah.
00:47:07,00:47:08,That's very nice.
00:47:08,00:47:09,Yeah.
00:47:09,00:47:10,Lovely.
00:47:10,00:47:11,"Dan, I think you said Flattery instead of Flaherty."
00:47:11,00:47:12,"Oh, did I?"
00:47:12,00:47:13,Sorry.
00:47:13,00:47:14,Flaherty.
00:47:14,00:47:15,Yeah.
00:47:15,00:47:16,Flaherty will get you nowhere.
00:47:16,00:47:19,"I really hope someone gave Oscar Wilde a fun little sign for his house saying, ""Flaherty"
00:47:19,00:47:20,"will get you nowhere."""
00:47:20,00:47:21,For the loo or something.
00:47:21,00:47:22,It's just so cute.
00:47:22,00:47:23,"Oh, Flaherty."
00:47:23,00:47:24,That's amazing.
00:47:24,00:47:25,Yeah.
00:47:25,00:47:26,So that was the Jesuit.
00:47:26,00:47:32,"Sorry, that was the hinge moment at which Oscar Wilde got his break and Hawkins didn't."
00:47:32,00:47:33,Yeah.
00:47:33,00:47:36,"And I think he wrote, was published until 30 years after he died."
00:47:36,00:47:37,That's sort of true.
00:47:37,00:47:39,It's sort of the slightly untrue because Robert Bridges.
00:47:39,00:47:40,So who's that?
00:47:40,00:47:41,Robert Bridges.
00:47:41,00:47:43,He was an established poet.
00:47:43,00:47:46,I think they met as fellows at Oxford or something.
00:47:46,00:47:47,Yeah.
00:47:47,00:47:51,"And he was someone who Manly Hopkins would go to in order to impress and say, ""Can you"
00:47:51,00:47:52,"help me out?"""
00:47:52,00:47:56,"And he read this amazing poem that we were just talking about, The Wreck."
00:47:56,00:47:59,"And he was like, ""I don't want to read that again."
00:47:59,00:48:00,That was painful.
00:48:00,00:48:01,"That was really hard."""
00:48:01,00:48:04,He sort of post-death became a champion of him.
00:48:04,00:48:09,And so he thought the writing style was so difficult that Hopkins was doing that he would
00:48:09,00:48:14,publish six poems as a sort of teaser taster just to get you used to the rhythms of this
00:48:14,00:48:18,guy before publishing his collected works 30 years after his death.
00:48:18,00:48:22,"So there was a sort of like, you know, like putting out like a trailer episode of podcasts."
00:48:22,00:48:23,Yeah.
00:48:23,00:48:25,"You know, it was kind of like that."
00:48:25,00:48:27,"He was also friends with Christina Rossetti, wasn't he?"
00:48:27,00:48:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:28,00:48:29,Hopkins.
00:48:29,00:48:30,Yeah.
00:48:30,00:48:34,"And she wrote in the Bleak Midwinter, for instance."
00:48:34,00:48:37,And I read one interesting poem.
00:48:37,00:48:40,You made it sound like that was what she liked to write.
00:48:40,00:48:44,"She wrote the Da Vinci Code, but it was in the book."
00:48:44,00:48:49,"But she, I read this about her, which is really interesting, that she had a habit of stooping"
00:48:49,00:48:53,up to pick up stray pieces of paper in the street in case they had the Lord's name on
00:48:53,00:48:54,them.
00:48:54,00:48:55,Nice.
00:48:55,00:48:56,Kind of.
00:48:56,00:48:58,"So there's a bit of paper and she's like, ""Well, I don't want it blowing away if it says"
00:48:58,00:48:59,Jesus on it.
00:48:59,00:49:01,"I'm just going to pick it up just in case."""
00:49:01,00:49:06,She was the first person to collect those shopping lists that people make blogs out
00:49:06,00:49:07,of.
00:49:07,00:49:08,And she didn't like that.
00:49:08,00:49:09,"So she goes, ""Oh, no."
00:49:09,00:49:13,"I'm just looking for Jesus."""
00:49:13,00:49:15,Do you want to hear a few words that Hopkins invented?
00:49:15,00:49:16,Please.
00:49:16,00:49:17,Yes.
00:49:17,00:49:18,It's good.
00:49:18,00:49:21,"""Inscape,"" which is the essential quality of something, of anything really."
00:49:21,00:49:22,Yeah.
00:49:22,00:49:23,"You know, the essence of it."
00:49:23,00:49:24,Yeah.
00:49:24,00:49:28,"When kittenfishers catch fire, meaning when you see that sort of flash of their color,"
00:49:28,00:49:35,"meaning that was deep in the core of them, and then it rippled out into the world, but"
00:49:35,00:49:38,it sort of came from their essence.
00:49:38,00:49:39,Yeah.
00:49:39,00:49:42,"""Inscape"" is sort of like the essence of a thing."
00:49:42,00:49:43,Nice.
00:49:43,00:49:44,"He also coined the word ""stressy."""
00:49:44,00:49:45,Stressy.
00:49:45,00:49:46,Yeah.
00:49:46,00:49:50,"But he used it to mean, poetically, that it's characterized by stress and rhythm on the"
00:49:50,00:49:51,words.
00:49:51,00:49:52,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:52,00:49:53,Brilliant.
00:49:53,00:49:54,That's good.
00:49:54,00:49:55,"And no one, he wrote it in private correspondence."
00:49:55,00:49:58,"So he wrote it well before anyone else said, ""I'm feeling really stressy today."""
00:49:58,00:50:00,Has anyone ever said that?
00:50:00,00:50:03,"I don't think I've ever said ""stressy,"" actually."
00:50:03,00:50:04,Don't be so stressy.
00:50:04,00:50:05,Don't be so stressy.
00:50:05,00:50:06,I think I have.
00:50:06,00:50:07,People say it to me all the time.
00:50:07,00:50:08,Yeah.
00:50:08,00:50:10,The effect you have.
00:50:10,00:50:11,Yeah.
00:50:11,00:50:14,"""Shivlight,"" that's another word by him."
00:50:14,00:50:15,"""Shivlight."""
00:50:15,00:50:17,"""Shivlight,"" so S-H-I-V-E light."
00:50:17,00:50:19,"So it might be ""shivlight"" or ""shivlight"" in pronunciation."
00:50:19,00:50:21,"Does that mean ""shimmery"" or something?"
00:50:21,00:50:22,It's really beautiful.
00:50:22,00:50:26,You know when you're walking through a wood and the sunlight passes through a tree and
00:50:26,00:50:30,"it breaks the beams, that's a shivlight."
00:50:30,00:50:34,"The shivlight you see, what breaks through the beams, and ""silian"" is another word that"
00:50:34,00:50:35,he came up with.
00:50:35,00:50:40,"It's the act of plowing a field and it's the sort of rich soil, the shiny soil that"
00:50:40,00:50:42,you get on a newly plowed field.
00:50:42,00:50:47,"If he had something that he felt so deeply about that language could not describe, he"
00:50:47,00:50:49,just made his own language up for it.
00:50:49,00:50:50,So cool.
00:50:50,00:50:51,Very cool.
00:50:51,00:50:54,"With his poems, I've had to have like a little glossary at the end to tell you what it means"
00:50:54,00:50:55,or would it be clear?
00:50:55,00:50:59,"It's only in the A-level notes, which I deeply relied on."
00:50:59,00:51:02,"Right, that is what, yeah."
00:51:02,00:51:08,"His love life is very sad and thwarted, basically, because he seems to have been gay in love"
00:51:08,00:51:14,with one man who died very tragically young and then never really recovered from that.
00:51:14,00:51:21,"He was in love with a young man called Digby McWorth Dolbin, who I just, I like this fact"
00:51:21,00:51:22,"about him, so I like it so much."
00:51:22,00:51:24,He was expelled from Eton.
00:51:24,00:51:25,Can you guess what for?
00:51:25,00:51:26,Wanking?
00:51:26,00:51:27,No.
00:51:27,00:51:29,It's not always the answer.
00:51:29,00:51:30,But it will be.
00:51:30,00:51:31,It will be.
00:51:31,00:51:32,It will be.
00:51:32,00:51:36,"How are you on mastermind, that cycle?"
00:51:36,00:51:37,Dissort.
00:51:37,00:51:38,Clean that chair.
00:51:38,00:51:39,Dig started.
00:51:39,00:51:40,I need to finish.
00:51:40,00:51:41,What was it?
00:51:41,00:51:54,"Digby McWorth Dolbin, he was expelled from Eton."
00:51:54,00:51:58,He's never going to get it in a million years for wandering the countryside dressed as a
00:51:58,00:51:59,medieval monk.
00:51:59,00:52:00,That's right.
00:52:00,00:52:01,Shoeless.
00:52:01,00:52:02,That's so sweet.
00:52:02,00:52:03,I know.
00:52:03,00:52:04,Isn't it?
00:52:04,00:52:06,I can see why you fancied him.
00:52:06,00:52:07,Yeah.
00:52:07,00:52:13,"It was sort of like imaginary world living in, a little bit poetic, flowing robes."
00:52:13,00:52:14,Yeah.
00:52:14,00:52:15,I know.
00:52:15,00:52:21,And Hopkins confessed his love to his confessor because I think he was a fair bit older than
00:52:21,00:52:22,Dolbin.
00:52:22,00:52:25,"And the confessor said, ""Well, you can't have any contact with him except by letter."""
00:52:25,00:52:26,Oh.
00:52:26,00:52:29,"That's practically the same text as him now, isn't it?"
00:52:29,00:52:30,Oh.
00:52:30,00:52:31,Oh.
00:52:31,00:52:32,Oh.
00:52:32,00:52:35,"And then Dolbin tragically drowned just two years later, he was age 19."
00:52:35,00:52:36,So young.
00:52:36,00:52:37,It's really sad.
00:52:37,00:52:38,Oh.
00:52:38,00:52:41,"That was a bit of a creepy age gap, actually, but you know."
00:52:41,00:52:42,Yeah.
00:52:42,00:52:43,I was sort of glossing over that.
00:52:43,00:52:46,I think it's having more doom to romantic.
00:52:46,00:52:47,Yeah.
00:52:47,00:52:49,I'm sure we have enough.
00:52:49,00:52:50,Yeah.
00:52:50,00:52:51,Yeah.
00:52:51,00:52:52,Yeah.
00:52:52,00:52:53,Can somebody read us just one poem?
00:52:53,00:52:54,Come on.
00:52:54,00:52:55,Sounds like you can.
00:52:55,00:52:58,"Well, I do have one."
00:52:58,00:53:05,"Spring and fall, to a young child, Margaret, are you grieving over golden grove, unleaving"
00:53:05,00:53:10,leaves like the things of man you with your fresh thoughts care for?
00:53:10,00:53:11,Can you?
00:53:11,00:53:18,"Oh, as the heart grows older, it will come to such sites colder, by and by, nor spare"
00:53:18,00:53:26,"a sigh, though worlds of one wood leaf meal lie, and yet you will weep and know why."
00:53:26,00:53:35,"Now no matter child the name, sorrow springs are the same, nor mouth had, nor mind expressed,"
00:53:35,00:53:40,"what heart heard of, ghost guessed."
00:53:40,00:53:44,It is the blight man was born for.
00:53:44,00:53:54,It is Margaret you mourn for.
00:53:54,00:53:55,"OK, that's it."
00:53:55,00:53:56,That is all of our facts.
00:53:56,00:53:57,Thank you so much for listening.
00:53:57,00:54:00,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that have been said over
00:54:00,00:54:03,"the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts."

00:54:11,00:54:12,I'm not sure.
00:54:12,00:54:13,It might just be @PhilipaPerry.
00:54:13,00:54:14,"No, it's @Philipa_Perry."
00:54:14,00:54:15,OK.
00:54:15,00:54:21,"Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or our website, NoSuchThing"
00:54:21,00:54:26,"isafish.com, all of our previous episodes are up there, and do make sure, more important"
00:54:26,00:54:30,"than anything else, to look out for the future book of Philip Perrie."
00:54:30,00:54:32,Let's see if she can remember what it's called.
00:54:32,00:54:38,"The book you wish everyone you love would read, and some of those you don't."
00:54:38,00:54:41,That won't be published for months.
00:54:41,00:54:43,"No, not until October the 20th."
00:54:43,00:54:44,Yeah.
00:54:44,00:54:49,"In the meantime, you could buy the book you wish you'll-- Oh, fuck, I can't remember."
00:54:49,00:54:51,The book you wish your parents had read.
00:54:51,00:54:53,And your children would be glad that they did.
00:54:53,00:54:54,That you did.
00:54:54,00:54:55,That you did.
00:54:55,00:54:56,Fuck!
00:54:56,00:54:59,It's a long time since I've done any publicity for that one.
00:54:59,00:55:00,That's fine.
00:55:00,00:55:04,"Rice Babies will also be available this coming fall, by me, Dan Shriber."
00:55:04,00:55:07,"Otherwise, come back next week, we're going to have another episode."
00:55:07,00:55:08,Another guest.
00:55:08,00:55:09,We'll see you then.
00:55:09,00:55:10,Bye.
