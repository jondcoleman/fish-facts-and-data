00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 (electronic music)

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.040
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 (electronic music)

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.040
 (electronic music)

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.840
 - Now, I'm a land welcome to another episode

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.240
 of no such thing as a fish-a-weekly podcast.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.360
 This week, coming to you live from Glasgow.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.120
 (cheering)

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.240
 - My name is Jan Schreiber and I am sitting here

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.840
 with Anich Zinski, Andrew Huntemari, and James Harkin.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.080
 and in no particular order.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.560
 Here, we go, starting with you, James.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there is only one person

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.280
 in the world who can predict the future using asparagus.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.640
 (laughing)

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.160
 - For 2019, she has predicted extreme temperatures,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.240
 a recession in the US, and an all-time high

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.880
 in asparagus sales.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.320
 (laughing)

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.720
 - So, when you say she can predict the future.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.040
 - What's that success rate?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 - Well, it was really hot last week.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.760
 - So 100%.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.080
 - Oh, so far.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 - Yep.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.960
 - Yeah, actually, she claims to have a very high percentage,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.040
 but these people always do, don't they?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.120
 Okay, let's see some of the other things that she says.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.280
 She says, "This year, fears of Brexit will be unfounded."

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.120
 Yeah, maybe.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.280
 "The trade war between China and the US will end,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 but there'll be a recession.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.640
 England's women's football team will win the World Cup,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.800
 fingers crossed."

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.600
 (laughing)

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.760
 (laughing)

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.360
 - Pick your audience, James, take your audience.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.160
 - You don't, you don't want you to forget which country you're in.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.000
 (laughing)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600
 - James looked genuinely shocked when he saw the boat.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.440
 - What happened?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.080
 - Why do they hate women so much?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.320
 (laughing)

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.400
 - Yeah, not cool that guy, not cool.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.880
 - That the hierarchy is nationalism, then feminism.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.160
 (laughing)

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.840
 - Good, anyway, yes, so there's this lady,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.960
 and she does that stuff, and it's obviously bullshit.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.200
 - She, well, she...

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.880
 - Well, hang on.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.560
 - She has a Twitter account, I went on it today,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.360
 and one of the other predictions that she had is that she said

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.400
 that the Oscars this year, a star is born, would have success,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.720
 but British actors will also be in the mix.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.000
 So she was correct about Olivia Cole,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.280
 and a star is born, I think, one, the best song,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.520
 and she wrote a tweet just going, "Got it right."

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.960
 She's very proud.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.760
 She said, "Another great success rate for the old."

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.080
 - What'd she call herself?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.240
 - She calls herself Mystic Veg.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.560
 (laughing)

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.520
 - She's pretty strong.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.360
 - Yeah, she's an asparamenser, it's called Asparamenser.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.360
 - You can just put "Moncer" on the end of any word,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.200
 and it means you tell the future by it, can't you?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.760
 And it's great, and they've been doing this.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.680
 It was in the medieval period, I think,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.320
 when they look back over classical texts,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.520
 and they went, "God, those old ancient Romans

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.520
 "and Greeks told the future in weird ass ways,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.720
 "let's just call them all "Moncer" some things."

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.560
 And so there are so many "Moncies", as Tyra "Moncy",

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.480
 which is one of my favorites,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.520
 which is telling the future by how cheese can regulate.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.520
 - Yeah, I read one version of this Tyra "Moncy",

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.960
 which is you get a cheese, you wait for it to go moldy,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.000
 and then you look at the mold,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.360
 and that tells you the name of your husband.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.600
 - Oh.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.480
 I thought, yeah, I read something similar to that,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.840
 which is it's the names of various suitors

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.200
 that you write onto the cheese,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.880
 and the bit that the mold grows over

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.960
 is who you're gonna pick grows over all the names,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.120
 you're in for a lot of...

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.160
 (laughing)

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.280
 - How does it tell you the name of your,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.360
 do you say the name of your husband?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.920
 - Yeah, actually,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.400
 but unusually for this podcast,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.800
 what Dan said sounded a lot more sensible to me.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.520
 (laughing)

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.640
 - Do you remember it's exactly like

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.880
 when we used to peel apples?

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.200
 Did everyone used to do this and you peeled an apple

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.640
 and then you threw the peel in the air?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.640
 And what it is probably just what girls did in the pre-Feminist world,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.040
 and the shape that Apple Peel landed in

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.800
 was the first letter of your future husband's name.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.920
 So everyone thought their future husband's name would start with S.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.880
 (laughing)

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.960
 - This is quite a cool thing.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.440
 There is a thing called allureomancy,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.880
 which is not about being alluring,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.720
 it's about baking messages into little balls of dough.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.680
 And this happened in ancient Greece,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.920
 and the balls would be mixed up,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.080
 and they'd have different messages on them,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.760
 and then you would pick one.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.840
 And that is basically a fortune cookie.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.680
 - Yeah.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.240
 - The ancient Greeks have fortune cookies.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.080
 That's what I'm trying to say.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.400
 - That's really cool.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.680
 - There's also gyramancy,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.320
 which is the idea of you just start walking in a circle

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.560
 and keep walking, and around the perimeter of where you're walking,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.360
 they leave letters at the alphabet,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.080
 so you start spelling something out,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.920
 and the idea is you keep going until you start stumbling

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.320
 into these letters, and then you keep going

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.440
 until it starts spelling something out,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.920
 and then you keep going until finally you spell out a consistent sentence.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.800
 And if you don't do that, you just keep going

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.880
 until either you die or go mad.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.960
 And that's what they used to do back in the day.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.960
 - Back in the day.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.960
 - Back in the day.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.800
 - Yeah.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.640
 - Back in the day.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.200
 - I know, it's just safe.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.040
 It's not BC, but it actually dates just back in the day.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.280
 - I like this kind of telling the future from Iran.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.840
 It's called Falguj.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.360
 And it's the act of standing in a dark corner

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.400
 and listening to the conversations of passes by.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.480
 - Oh, I didn't know there was a word for what I did.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.760
 (laughing)

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.320
 - That's great.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.520
 - In 2008, there was some research that found that you can make

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.000
 someone like certain foods.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.560
 If you convince them that they loved it the first time they tried it.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.640
 So you say to them, "When you were a kid,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.240
 "you had this and you absolutely loved it."

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.400
 And you can make it so that they used to hate something

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.840
 and now they really like it.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.440
 And that work was funded by the Asparagus Industry.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.960
 (laughing)

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.640
 - I didn't know this about Asparagus.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.360
 Asparagus can grow a centimeter an hour.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.160
 - Wow.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.000
 - What?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.840
 - It can.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.680
 - You can watch that.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.240
 If I had the day of work and I grew asparagus,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.040
 I'd probably try and see it move.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.480
 (laughing)

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.440
 - Is that how they do it?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.440
 Do they just go, "Boom."

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.400
 In the space of 24 hours, do we get them really quick?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.240
 - It grows fast.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.040
 - It literally, you just pull water on it

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.880
 and it goes, "Boom."

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.520
 In 24 hours, it doesn't lay that noise.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.720
 - It probably, if you spit it up, it probably does make that noise.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.640
 - That's incredible.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.480
 - I know.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480
 - What grows that fast?

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.480
 - The asparagus.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.760
 (laughing)

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.480
 - And bamboo, as we know.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.440
 - You know that all the asparagus that we eat is male.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.280
 - No.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.360
 - That's a good news for this woman hating audience.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.400
 (laughing)

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.720
 (laughing)

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.000
 - So those asparagus have rocketed in Glasgow.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 (laughing)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.720
 - I don't know if that's a win for women, isn't it?

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720
 I don't think you want to be.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.560
 - It is, yeah.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.680
 - So basically, the male stalks are a lot bigger

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.160
 and juicier than the female stalks,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.320
 but that's because...

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.160
 (laughing)

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.320
 No, you're writing your own jokes now, guys.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.160
 (laughing)

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.000
 Well, the reason is...

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.240
 (laughing)

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.920
 The reason is, because the females, they create the berries,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.400
 and so they need to use all the energy

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.240
 to do something actually useful.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.080
 - Oh.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.320
 - Whereas all the men have to do is just grow and be juicy.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.160
 - Right.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.080
 (laughing)

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.920
 Nice.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.800
 We're gonna have to move on shortly to our next fact.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.200
 I've just got one or two things.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.040
 Hey, if anyone, by the way, is thinking

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.240
 of going to the asparagus festival,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.040
 there is exciting stuff that goes on,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.640
 and the stuff that goes on afterwards,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.160
 they had a 10-year anniversary not too long ago,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.680
 and you can do tours on buses.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.520
 It's the asparagus bus tours, and yeah, those are really fun.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.520
 But actually, you've got to make sure to pick the right year

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.800
 'cause a few years ago, they had to cancel the festival

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.080
 due to lack of asparagus.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.920
 There wasn't enough.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.760
 There was a flooding, and it kind of ruined the crops

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.560
 that were growing.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.720
 - Oh, yeah.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.720
 - But it turns out that asparagus played a very important role

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.840
 in the formation of Darwin coming up

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.760
 with the theory of evolution.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.600
 - Yeah.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.280
 - Yeah, it was part of the evolution of the theory of evolution.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.640
 What it was is, Darwin kept wondering why things can be seen,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.920
 you know, it's a certain type of lettuces can be seen

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.040
 in places halfway across the world.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.880
 How do they get there?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.720
 How do they travel?

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.560
 What goes on?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.360
 So he had a butler called Mr. Parslow,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.880
 and Mr. Parslow and him filled a tub full of salt water

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.120
 to replicate the conditions of the ocean,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.240
 and they put a bunch of seeds in to see if the seeds would float

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.920
 and how long they would float for.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.640
 So they had cabbage seeds, radish seeds, and so on.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.720
 They lasted for 42 days, which was really impressive.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.280
 However, asparagus seeds lasted for 85 days,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.800
 they would float for that long.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.880
 But the important bit was they then took the seed

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.240
 out of the seawater tub and buried it,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.680
 and it grew into a asparagus like lit boots right away.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.720
 (audience laughing)

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.400
 And so that meant that they could travel,

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.640
 that they could still germinate once they were in the soil.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.480
 So then they put the seeds inside a bird,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.200
 and then they killed the bird,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.800
 and they threw them a bathtub.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.160
 What is the story?

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.160
 (audience laughing)

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.520
 The worst bedtime story.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.560
 (audience laughing)

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.280
 - Dan's child hasn't slept for three weeks during this story.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.400
 - Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.080
 or shoot the bird with the asparagus seed in its tummy.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.360
 (audience laughing)

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.760
 So then what they worked out was the bird,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.200
 still you could take the seed out of the bird

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.160
 all those days later, and it would still grow.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.400
 So the asparagus seed helped Darwin to realize

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.600
 it could travel via bird or via ocean.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.120
 - Do you know, can I just make sure

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.880
 that you know that has nothing to do with evolution?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.960
 (audience laughing)

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.120
 - What you just said.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.520
 (audience laughing)

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.320
 - That is not by, do you think evolution

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.320
 is the proof that stuff can travel long distances?

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.560
 (audience laughing)

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.800
 - That sounds like just an idle side project,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.760
 the whole drowning bird in the bathroom for Darwin.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.600
 (audience laughing)

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.600
 - Do you let me tell that whole story?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.240
 (audience laughing)

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.200
 - He still did it.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.600
 Could I just another famous person

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.320
 who looked into asparagus was Benjamin Franklin,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.960
 and he formed a theory based on the fact

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.960
 that it makes your wee smell.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.760
 Although does everyone have that eye,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.160
 'cause I don't think that asparagus makes your wee smell.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.440
 - Well, you are wrong, 'cause it does so.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.280
 - Well, no, some people can detect it and some people can't.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.440
 - Well, it's not my fault.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.600
 - Not many people can't detect it.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.400
 I think if you can't detect it.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.240
 - I'm special.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.080
 - You have a thing.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.400
 - Yeah, you've got a thing called specific a nozzmere.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.240
 So that's why you can't smell a particular smell.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.360
 - The asparagus wee smell, yeah.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.520
 - But the asparagus does other people claim it makes your wee smell.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.040
 And Ben Franklin wrote a letter to the Royal Academy of Brussels

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.360
 using as asparagus as an example of how what we eat

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.480
 can impact the smell of what we excrete.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.000
 So he was saying asparagus makes your wee smell kind of gross.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.920
 Well, how about we work on this, 'cause thoughts smell gross.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.680
 And if we know that stuff we eat

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.080
 can make what comes out,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.040
 can change the smell of stuff that comes out of us.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.840
 Why don't we work out what we need to eat

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.440
 in order for Farts to smell nice?

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.920
 And he thought it was a really big idea,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.880
 'cause he was saying cause his disease,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.640
 'cause well-bred people hold their Farts in solely

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.600
 because they're gonna stink the place out

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.960
 if they let one rip.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.480
 And so he said, if we could get a pill or something,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.440
 we could feed people to make your Farts smell like perfume,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.840
 then people would actually want to do it.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.440
 - And that's evolution.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.720
 (laughing)

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.960
 (laughing)

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.540
 (upbeat music)

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:34.320
 - Okay, and it's time for fact number two,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.440
 and that is Chazinski.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.840
 - My fact this week is that the composer,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.440
 Haydn's wife, cared so little about her husband's work

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.160
 that she used to tear up his scores

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
 to use as hair curlers and pastry underlays.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.200
 - That's crazy.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.840
 Was this sort of before, he sold them 21 or before,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.280
 was it just a thing that he did?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.520
 - It was just throughout his life.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.360
 So actually he wrote a lot and she just found them

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.400
 lying around and she knew nothing about music

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.320
 and did not care.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.720
 Haydn once said, it makes not a blind bit of difference

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.520
 to my wife whether I'm a musician or a cobbler.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.840
 And so she'd find them and she'd be like,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.000
 oh, that looks handy, I'll put a pie on that.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.760
 - Yeah, well, I mean, he wrote 108 symphonies,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.240
 20 operas, 47 of sonatas, 68 quartets,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.480
 178 trios, 14 masses and six oratorios.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.680
 So, I mean, that's a lot of paper.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.520
 - Yeah.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.800
 - Is it recycling?

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 - It's recycling.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.640
 - Yeah.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.200
 She didn't like him very much either.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.040
 - Oh, that is true.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.680
 - I think she was doing it deliberately.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.720
 They had a very sad marriage.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.920
 So he basically, he fell in love when he was very young,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.440
 her Joseph Haydn with a woman called Teresa.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.760
 And she couldn't marry him.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.520
 And so her father said, you want to marry her older sister

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.640
 who's this really unpleasant woman called Maria Anna.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.280
 And he felt bad.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.080
 So he was like, okay, cool, I'm marrying her

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.360
 and said that sounds great.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.120
 And apparently she had a very domineering

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.080
 and unfriendly character.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.040
 She used to spend all of his money very freely.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.160
 So he went to great lengths to hide his income

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.680
 so she wouldn't know about it.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.600
 And when she died, he was completely indifferent, apparently.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.840
 - Well, they lived apart, didn't they, for...

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.000
 - Towards the end they did here.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.680
 - Yes, for 40 years.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.120
 - Well, the last 40 years.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.120
 (audience laughing)

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.480
 - He was housed, he had a job where he was housed

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.360
 this printer's castle where she did live with him

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.480
 quite a lot of the time.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.320
 - Right, okay.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320
 - Because then he had to towards the end,

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.680
 he was in London and she sent him a letter saying,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.480
 she used to send him letters saying things like,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.720
 by the way, if you die tomorrow,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.680
 there's no money to bury you.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.720
 Really nice, love letters like that when he was away.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.040
 And she wrote him a letter in London saying,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.400
 I really need money because you're gonna die soon

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.200
 and I need a house to live in as a widow.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.760
 So can you please buy me one?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760
 And he did.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.720
 I read with the letters that it got to the point

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.160
 where they were communicating just by sending each other's

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.280
 letters, but I didn't never open the letters that she sent

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.560
 and he was convinced that she didn't either.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.440
 So they were just sending each other these things.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.680
 It remained completely unopened.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.200
 No idea what was being said.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.040
 - Wow.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.880
 - No communication.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.040
 - Yeah, pretty crazy.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.520
 - He item was very influential.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.680
 He's not very well-known these days, I think,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.400
 unless you're a classical music fan.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.880
 - He's less well-known than like Beethoven and Mozart.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.720
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.360
 - He was great friends with Mozart from this life.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.840
 - Yeah.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.000
 - And I really like, I've just been reading a tiny bit

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.320
 about Haydn's music.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.480
 So he wrote his string quartet in E flat

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.480
 is known as the joke.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.240
 'Cause he put, basically, he practical jokes in this string quartet

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.720
 'cause it's got lots of false endings

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.880
 to catch the audience out.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.960
 - That's quite cool, isn't it?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.800
 - Yeah.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.240
 - And he wrote something called the surprise symphony,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.240
 which is he used to just turn up a people's houses

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.040
 and play that, don't know.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.880
 - It's really, really quiet, apart from one very loud bit.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.400
 (laughing)

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.600
 And then it never gets referred to again.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.880
 It doesn't get repeated as a motif.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.880
 It's just really, really quiet.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.880
 All the way through, apart from one way.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.880
 He goes, "Wow!"

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.880
 (laughing)

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.240
 - I like, there's also one he wrote,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.960
 which is called the Palandrome, which starts one way,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.920
 and then it just goes back on itself as a musical piece.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.760
 - That's cool.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.240
 - But the first one, the joke is amazing,

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.920
 'cause he would literally, the piece would finish

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.920
 and the audience would go,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.320
 and then he would play again.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.640
 - And the whole thing just has the audience go,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.640
 "Ugh!"

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640
 - To a point.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.040
 - He was like Les Dorsen of his day, wasn't he?

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.440
 (laughing)

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.800
 - He was actually, he was a prankster.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.800
 - What's up?

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.760
 - I can't remember any of Les Dorsen's.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.400
 - I've got to say, that is not exactly a 2019 reference.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.200
 - No, it's a great reference.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.040
 - What do you mean?

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.480
 - No, it's a problem.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.320
 He got kicked out of his choir when he was very young,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.120
 because he chopped off one of the choir boys' pigtails.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.960
 - Wow.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.480
 - Just as a prank, just as a fun prank,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.200
 he was very good-natured apparently.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.880
 So he was known as Papa Hayden.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.920
 And yeah, as you say, he was best friends with Mozart.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.760
 There's a really moving moment

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.840
 when he was called to move to London,

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.760
 when he was about 60 by that point,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.080
 and he suddenly got this invitation,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.080
 and Mozart walked into the coaching station to say goodbye,

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.800
 and then they had a moment where Mozart said,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.840
 "I suppose this is the last time we'll see each other

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.240
 "in this life, 'cause Hayden's, you know,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.000
 "in those days I was getting on a bit."

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.040
 And Hayden said, "Oh, don't you worry about me,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.840
 "I'm feeling really strong,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.560
 "but then actually Mozart obviously died

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.000
 "at the age of 35, and that year, so he was fine."

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 - Oh, you were gonna say that Hayden got into the coach

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.200
 and drove off, and then he came back a minute later,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.240
 but it was surprise!

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.400
 (audience laughing)

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.160
 And one of the last time we'll see each other, I'm here.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.440
 - Have you, did you guys read about his boss?

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.280
 Hayden's boss?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.120
 - No.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.040
 - So he spent 30 years working for a royal house,

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.640
 'cause that was how you made your living as a musician.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.720
 You didn't have really big mass concerts,

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.160
 you had a private patron.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.880
 So his boss was Prince Paul and Ton Esther Hazee,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.040
 or Esther Hazee.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:35.960
 - Esther Houser.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.200
 - Esther Houser, sorry.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.680
 And he had total control, basically, of Hayden's life.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.200
 So he could dictate how he dressed.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.440
 Hayden wasn't automatically allowed to send

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.600
 and what he knew works.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.480
 He had to submit them all to his highness,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.280
 and he was partly paid in semolina beef,

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.920
 cabbages and lard during his work.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.640
 He wasn't allowed to eat and drink with the other musicians

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.160
 in case they stopped respecting him,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.400
 'cause he was the boss, and every morning and afternoon,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.880
 he had to go to the prince and say,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.760
 "Would you like to hear a concert or an opera tonight?"

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.960
 And if the prince had, yes, he had to go and prepare one.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.480
 - Wow, yeah.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.400
 He did insist on being paid partly in wine as well,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.360
 which is, along with other nasty stuff.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.040
 But he did, he lived in this place.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.240
 And Prince Esther Houser had this weird castle

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.120
 that he built like a fantasy castle,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.920
 which sounds awful in this big swamp,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.080
 where they had to spend about 10 months of the year,

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.520
 and he built this huge opera house

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.760
 where Hayden had to compose these operas

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.360
 that burned down, and he immediately built a new one.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.200
 And Hayden was still very popular there,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.480
 and he had this team of musicians around him,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.960
 and they all did indeed respect him a lot,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.920
 to the extent that the musicians used to go to the tavern,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.200
 which also the prince built on the land,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.520
 and they used to get really pissed,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.120
 and they weren't allowed their wives there,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.520
 so everyone was getting a bit antsy at month number nine,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.760
 and there was a moment where the cellist punched

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.040
 an oboist in the face when they got a bit pissed,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.680
 and he also-- - And Trombolus went,

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.880
 "Wah, wah, wah."

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.040
 (all laughing)

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.320
 - It's actually a really serious incident, so.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.440
 (all laughing)

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.200
 It's really unappreciated that Trombone moment.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.840
 He punched him in the face, and he lost an eye,

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.360
 'cause he was wearing his ring-- - Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.920
 - Not Bill, Bill. - No.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.920
 (all laughing)

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.000
 He was missing an eye, and he was a bit pissed off,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.200
 but Hayden stepped in, and managed to make them settle it

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.520
 amicably, so this guy has removed the eye of his coworker,

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.960
 and they worked together happily for another seven years.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.280
 - That's all right.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.600
 - And then he took the other eye, and that was too far,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.400
 'cause that was not funny.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.200
 - We should say, should we say what happened to Hayden after he died?

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.280
 - Oh, yeah. - I think we should.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.400
 It was very bizarre, so he died, finally, quite old,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.160
 and then as soon as he died, his head was stolen,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.200
 and it was stolen by a guy he knew, actually,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.920
 who's married, he'd helped to set up,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.240
 so it was planned to slap in the face,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.520
 this guy called Rosenbaum, who was very interested

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.640
 in phrenology, which was the study of skulls,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.840
 and what that meant about your intelligence,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.680
 and so he stole his head with his mate,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.520
 and it used to be displayed in his mate's house

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.880
 in this little box, which had a little glass window

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.400
 and it sat on a cushion, and imagine going to your friend's house,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.920
 and they said, "Oh, do you see something really cool?"

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.760
 And then you just got the dead head of your former mate,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.600
 sitting in a display case.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.400
 - Yeah, they didn't know about it until his patron,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.480
 who was a new prince by this time called Nicholas,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.040
 he decided, you know, the burial we gave Hayden,

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.680
 it wasn't good enough, he needs a more dignified burial place,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.160
 so they wanted to re-enter him somewhere grander,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.040
 they dug him up, and they found his head was missing,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.760
 and it was incredibly upsetting.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.320
 So the authorities, you know, prompted by the prince,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.320
 they searched the home of Rosenbaum,

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.880
 and he gave them a different skull,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.800
 I don't know where he got that one from.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.320
 - He collected skulls.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.360
 - And then they got wise to it,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.520
 'cause they looked at the skull, they'd be given,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.760
 he said, "This is a young man's skull,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.000
 it's not Hayden, it was very Albany died."

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.120
 And he said, "All right, you got me, here's Hayden skull."

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.480
 They gave him another fake skull.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.240
 So there were now three skulls in circulation,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.240
 one of which is Hayden.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.280
 - Do you know how they hid Hayden skull?

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.320
 - No. - It's very cool.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.880
 So they had Hayden skull in the house,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.040
 and they hid it inside the mattress,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.920
 and then he Rosenbaum made his wife lie on the mattress

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.640
 and pretend to be menstruating.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.520
 And everyone searching the house was too afraid

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.240
 to go near her, and so they didn't lie in the skull.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.960
 - That was a quick pretend to be menstruating.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.120
 - Ooh! - I know that's not what happened, so...

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.320
 (audience laughing)

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.600
 - You're confusing menstruating

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.920
 with being on a ghost train, don't you think?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.760
 - Ooh!

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.880
 - I like the way that these guys looking

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.120
 for Hayden are basically playing Hayden's seek.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.360
 - Ah! - Ah!

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.200
 - Wow.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.200
 (audience laughing)

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.800
 - Okay, we need to move on.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.120
 Do we get to the other side where we did?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.520
 Okay, let's move on.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.440
 It's time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.960
 My fact this week is that to stop people stealing

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.440
 American road signs with the number 69 on them,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.960
 Washington State has replaced many of them

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.960
 with signs that now read 68.9.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.960
 (audience laughing)

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.160
 How is there a big plan?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.560
 So this is a big problem in America.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.320
 This is a thing called mile markers.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.000
 So when you're driving, it tells you,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 either how many miles you have to get to somewhere

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.040
 or how many are left,

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.280
 and these keep getting stolen.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.760
 And it's not just 69 that get stolen.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.840
 There is also the 420.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840
 And yeah.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.000
 420 is a--

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.400
 - Well, the police have been notified

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.400
 of everyone who just came.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.560
 (audience laughing)

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.560
 - Yeah, so 420 is a drug reference

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.120
 for the 20th of April.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.960
 It's International Cannabis Day, I believe it is,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.040
 or Smokers Day, yeah.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.200
 - Okay.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.600
 - So those have been replaced as well.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.600
 So those are now 419.9, and this is a big problem in America.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.920
 'Cause they have, they've had 200 stolen

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.200
 over the last since about 2012.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.520
 They do cost a lot.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.480
 - There's a whole Wikipedia page on street sign theft.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.520
 So for instance, there's a big list of them.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.240
 Richard Bong State's recreation area,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.600
 keep having their sign stolen,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.920
 because there's a word Bong in there.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.360
 Ragged ass road in Yellow Knife.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.880
 (audience laughing)

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.320
 They had to keep changing their signs.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.040
 But whole road in England, they had to keep losing that.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.600
 They eventually renamed it to Archers Way.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.080
 So this is happening all over the world

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.760
 in hilariously named places.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.600
 (audience laughing)

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.280
 - Do you guys know about a place called Burgaults in the US?

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.440
 - Nope, no.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.120
 - No, you wouldn't, 'cause it's made up.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.360
 But this is a place.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.120
 This is a pair of men called Mika and Mont,

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.960
 who have been trying to redesign America's road signs.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.640
 And they finally confirm that they'd redesigned them recently.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.480
 And they've invented a fictional town called Burgaults,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.760
 ERGAULTS, because it involves some of the hardest letters

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.960
 to sign.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.480
 And that's all those vowels apparently.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.360
 They look really blurry.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.000
 They fill in a bit when you're far away.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.120
 The G always difficult.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.000
 Why does a G look completely different types

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.160
 than it does written?

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.520
 And so they have that as their archetypal.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.960
 - An amazing observation they can't even.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.280
 It's like Peter K was in the room.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.240
 - Wait till you find out about A.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.800
 - It's any GM, stuck on G.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.320
 - Okay.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.520
 - So yeah, and they would do it by they'd make signs

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.240
 saying Burgaults, and then they'd lean them against fences.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.480
 And then they'd like walk up a hill

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.800
 or walk 500 meters away.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.840
 And then they'd see how clear they could see them

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.600
 compared to our normal signposts.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.240
 And in this manner, they've convinced American Outer

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.960
 change all of its road sign fonts.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.880
 And they did that in 2004.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.680
 - But there's a lot of controversy about this.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.520
 - Yeah.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.200
 - So the original American font on all American roads

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.680
 was called Highway Gothic.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.400
 That was the name, which is pretty cool.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.640
 And then their font is called Clearview.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.480
 - Yeah.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.560
 - And there were all these studies saying

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.720
 it was much clearer to read, Clearview.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.760
 And you could see it, if you were driving at night,

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.480
 and you saw a sign that was in Clearview,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.520
 you could read it 74 feet further away than Highway Gothic.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.360
 - Wow.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.280
 - So that gives you a couple more seconds,

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.800
 let's say, of reaction time.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.280
 So it will stop you having a crash, perhaps.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.320
 And that could actually save lives.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.360
 More or fewer people could die on the roads,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.640
 depending on whether you choose Clearview or Highway Gothic.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.880
 But there have now been more studies

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.640
 saying that Highway Gothic is better.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.480
 So Clearview has just had its approval removed.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.600
 I think this year is, and it's approval put on hold.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.920
 - The Highway Gothic factions have come out.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.760
 - Right.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.000
 - They've been it down.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.960
 But it's all in caps lock Highway Gothic.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.360
 So with America, they have all their signs and capitals,

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.040
 which is terrible for signage.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.040
 Because capitals, you can't distinguish shapes.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.840
 It just looks like one big rectangle.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.560
 So when you're far away, you can't tell as much.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.080
 Whereas on our signs here,

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.560
 then you see the little tails of the G or the Y

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.760
 or the other tailed letters.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.400
 You all know what they are.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.480
 (all laughing)

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.040
 - G, Y, P. - P.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.120
 - P is another good one and a cue, of course.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.920
 - What was that?

00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.760
 - J. - J. - J.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.280
 - J. - J. - J.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.560
 - Anyway. - Maybe we should take this.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.360
 - No, no, I think we're on the brink of something.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.600
 - No, it's alright.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.880
 - Oh, I found out, in fact, mice make sign posts

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.240
 in their fields, and they make them out of leaves and twigs

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.200
 so they don't get lost.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.520
 - Oh. - Who the?

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.920
 - What font are they using?

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.040
 And as a capstock.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.200
 (all laughing)

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.960
 - This is wood mice.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.600
 They move objects, like a leaf or a twig,

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.480
 to mark a side that interests them.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.880
 And they regularly, when they're exploring around it,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.600
 they rear up on their hind legs and they look

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.200
 to make sure they can still see their little street sign

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.920
 before they explore.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.080
 - Oh, wow.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.720
 One place which has problems with losing signs

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.600
 is fin glass in North Dublin.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.480
 And that is because that is where Bono was born.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.720
 And so a lot of you two fans go and steal the road sign

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.000
 from his road.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.360
 So literally, the streets have no name.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.960
 (all laughing)

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:03.120
 It doesn't sound, it sounds like I've made it all up

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.280
 just for the puns like that.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.480
 - No, it really is true.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.640
 - It really is true.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.800
 - We're first designed for cyclist road signs

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.760
 in the 19th century to warning road signs.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.640
 But I want to test you guys because there was a study

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.240
 done recently that showed that most people

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.760
 can't identify most road signs now.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.360
 And even, actually this is gonna be hard

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.360
 'cause you probably read it.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.760
 But there are three basic shapes.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.600
 - I know one.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.040
 - So the circle where it's like a red circle

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.120
 with a white band in the middle of it.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.960
 - Yeah.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.440
 - That means shot cut.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.160
 (all laughing)

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.360
 - So three types of road signs,

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.440
 there's a circle, the triangle and the rectangle.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.280
 - Oh yeah.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.480
 - Does anyone know the difference between

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.000
 what those things mean?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.200
 - Is it the circle, was it circle, triangle,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.280
 and triangle's running?

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.600
 - Yeah, and circle is--

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.840
 - Circle is bad.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.360
 - Through this now, whatever it says,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.960
 you must bloody well do it.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.080
 And then the square is, there's a nice castle over there.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.120
 - Right, yeah.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.400
 - Okay, that's sort of, one is very wrong.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.160
 So I hope you're joking.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.360
 The circle is absolutely, don't do it.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.200
 Please don't.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.640
 But there are people don't understand this.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.760
 Anything in a red circle means

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.640
 this is bad, but I think it doesn't have a cross through it.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.480
 No one realizes.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.320
 So there was this survey done that said,

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.360
 what does this I mean that has a red circle?

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.640
 And it shows, it's known as the low flying motorbike sign,

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.120
 I think, because it shows a car.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.680
 And then on top of it, a little motorbike.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.120
 - So that means no vehicles.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.640
 - It means no vehicles.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.280
 Most people who did this survey said,

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.600
 well, it means only cars and motorbikes are allowed.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.040
 (all laughing)

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.480
 - People have no idea.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.200
 - That's the problem in Italy.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.640
 There's a town that has started,

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.200
 they have a big problem in this one town

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.560
 where there's a lot of prostitutes on the side of the road

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.320
 and they're trying to not encourage people to stop

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.200
 and do business with them.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.240
 So they created signs, again, with a pictogram

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.160
 on it of what was a prostitute.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.880
 And it says underneath it, prostitutes.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.320
 But most people didn't know if it was sort of saying,

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.160
 oh no.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.160
 (all laughing)

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.880
 They actually increased traffic

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.000
 because most people were slowing down.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.480
 (all laughing)

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.080
 (upbeat music)

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.480
 (upbeat music)

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.480
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.840
 And that is Andy.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.400
 - My fact is that flies like to date

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.560
 the same sort of flies as their fly friends.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.880
 (all laughing)

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.400
 - I don't even know where to start with that.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.240
 - Yeah.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.320
 - Do you mean fly friends?

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.520
 Are they really cool friends?

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.400
 - No, I just mean the friends who are flies.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.240
 - All right.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.680
 - So this is really cool.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.480
 It's all about how flies choose which other flies to court.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.840
 So scientists, they painted a load of male fruit flies

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.840
 different colors, okay?

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.240
 They painted some pink and some green.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.600
 And they set up a date between one female

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.920
 and the two males, one pink and one green.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.800
 And then behind some glass,

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.640
 they had another female fly watching this date.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.680
 - This sounds like a channel five show this year.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.880
 (all laughing)

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.960
 - And so the female inside chose one of the males.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.280
 She chose pink or green to make with.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.760
 And then the observer female flies

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.520
 who been watching this whole ring roll

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.320
 were given the chance a day later,

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.360
 which is quite a long time in fly years.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.480
 That's like three years later,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.560
 they get the chance for a date of their own.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.400
 And when they were given the chance,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.280
 they almost always picked the color

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.200
 that the female before had chosen.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.280
 So they remembered this.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.800
 And even when they were presented with two male flies

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.520
 that were apparently hideous.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.040
 - Yeah, I mean, 'cause they probably in real life

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.520
 don't see many flies painted pink and green, don't they?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.640
 - Yeah, yeah. - So yeah, it's very strange.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.560
 And so what does this tell us about flies?

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.400
 - I don't know.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.240
 - I don't know.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.480
 - Okay, well I thought you did, that's why I asked you.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.640
 So the idea is that because the flies

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.400
 are passing on behavioral traits between each other,

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.520
 they might have some kind of culture.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.280
 As in, a culture is where someone does something

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.960
 and then they kind of talk everyone else

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.520
 into doing it and then you become a kind of,

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.480
 everyone goes to Glastonbury.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.680
 - Right, they then got female observers again

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.880
 behind the glass to watch a fly orgy

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.120
 between lots of males and lots of females.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.160
 - These flies really lucked out, didn't they?

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.520
 They must have been bragging to their friends.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.360
 I've been involved in this study.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360
 You have no idea.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.080
 I never need to pay for porn again.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.280
 - Just an interesting thing about fly sex

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.080
 because if they're having this big orgy,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.800
 the problem is, is flies have sex while they're flying.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.440
 So they flies, certain flies have a special kind

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.360
 of genitalia gonads that just have to just move around

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.760
 to wherever the female fly is flying.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.600
 - Wow.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.480
 - Yeah, so if she banks left and he's like,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.840
 "Well, I've got to go, his gonads can go."

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.200
 And just I can go from anywhere from 90 to 360 degrees

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.800
 just around to just be making sure

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.880
 that the sex continues while all this very, you know,

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.600
 flying stuff is going on.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.680
 And that's very cool, 'cause it's hard to seduce the woman

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.760
 as a male fruit fly, this is, that you're talking about.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.480
 But they sing songs, so the males chase the females

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.840
 and then they will extend just one wing,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.680
 so they'll put one arm out and they vibrate it,

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.080
 and it produces a song.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.080
 And the song has two modes.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.880
 So there's just like two types of sound they can make.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.040
 And you have to amplify it by more than a million times

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.800
 to hear it with human ears, but we've done that,

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.280
 obviously because scientists are bored.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.280
 So they've got the sign and the pulse and the sign sounds like

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.760
 the wine of an approaching mosquito apparently.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.720
 And then the pulse sounds like a cat's per.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.920
 So if you're being seduced by a fly,

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.160
 it's a combination of a buzzing mosquito and a purring cat.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.200
 - But then once the male, once the female has accepted the male,

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.080
 the male licks the female for two minutes

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.000
 and then they mate for about 20 minutes.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.640
 And that's some scientists who I think were really bored.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.800
 They scrambled a fruit fly's courtship neurons in its brain

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.960
 so that they tried to copulate, lick and play the love song

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.160
 all at the same time.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.200
 (laughing)

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.680
 And what would normally take for a four minute

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.880
 quite delicate mating process was reduced to 10 seconds.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.200
 (laughing)

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.240
 - And we'll all be in there.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.640
 (laughing)

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.640
 - Who's your green friend?

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.920
 (laughing)

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:17.280
 - They have the only known aphrodisiac,

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.120
 fruit flies.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.520
 - Oh, like a proven one, you mean?

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.320
 - A proven one, fly agra.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.440
 (laughing)

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.760
 (cheering)

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.360
 And now they've got their PR guy, which is good.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.960
 He's gonna need a job after tonight.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.640
 They have the only aphrodisiac the scientists have ever proved

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.800
 exists is that actually makes you want to have sex,

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.200
 only works on fruit flies.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.000
 And it's the scent of rotting fruit.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.440
 So if they smell rotting fruit,

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:48.120
 that actually turns on their brain pathways

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.760
 that are the courtship initiating.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.480
 So they send rotting fruit,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.160
 and they immediately want to have a shag.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.280
 And that is useful, I think, because rotting fruit

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.160
 is a good place to lay eggs as a woman.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.440
 So if a man fancies you when you're near rotting fruit,

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.320
 that's handy, 'cause then you can put your baby's in fruit.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.000
 - Speaking of the chemicals,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.240
 if you have a fly that falls into your glass of wine,

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.800
 one single fly is enough to ruin the whole glass of wine.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.600
 Okay, but only if it's a female fly.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.520
 And it's because it's the pheromones in the fly

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.360
 that cause the wine to taste a bit skunky.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.840
 If the males go in, actually, it will still taste the same.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.160
 And they tested this by getting the pheromones out of the flies

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.440
 and then putting it into some wine

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.960
 and getting people to taste it.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.960
 And they found that just one nanogram of a pheromone

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.320
 was enough for a small glass of wine

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.880
 for them to be able to taste the difference with one nanogram,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.920
 which is like, I don't know, I think it's like

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.560
 a thousandth of a millionth of a gram or something like that.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.800
 - In a small glass of wine.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.640
 - In a small glass of wine.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.480
 - Sorry, hang on.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.920
 - And at a small glass of wine,

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.560
 it's the thing that's going on.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.880
 - It's what you've got left.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.320
 - Mine's become small.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.160
 It always goes through the small phase.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.280
 - So I worked out what the equivalent of this is.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.920
 And it's worth, it's the equivalent

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.800
 of putting one petal bin's worth of ribina into lockness.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.400
 And the whole lake tasting of black curd.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.240
 - Wow.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.080
 - That's great.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.440
 - There must be wine snobs who are tasting

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.680
 that one tiny nanogram of female pheromone.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.560
 I think it has to the flavour of anything.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.720
 I stirred flies into this before I came on.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.480
 - There was a study on flies response

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.400
 to carbonated beverages and their attraction

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.640
 to carbon dioxide.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.440
 And the sky report about it was headlined.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.960
 "Why do flies suddenly appear every time you open a beer?"

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.800
 (laughing)

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.640
 That's nice.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.000
 - We're gonna have to wrap up soon.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.040
 So before we do, you guys got?

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.120
 - I can tell you about Dung Beetle Sex.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.200
 - Yeah, please.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.200
 - Ooh.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.280
 - That is an unbelievably niche porn subject.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.040
 (laughing)

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.880
 - What do they do?

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.720
 - You need to delete your history immediately,

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.720
 whoever that was.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.720
 (laughing)

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.640
 Now what's interesting about them is that they get STDs,

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.480
 but actually it's a good thing for them.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.760
 If you're a Dung Beetle and you get an STD,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.360
 this is really good for you

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.600
 because they get this kind of nematode worm

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.920
 and it helps to get the right kind of bacteria.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.240
 It eats all the bad bacteria in their body,

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.520
 which means a good bacteria can come in

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.040
 and it means that then they can eat their food properly.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.680
 It's like if you have sex with someone

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.280
 and feed them yackels at the same time.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.120
 - Wow.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.400
 (laughing)

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.920
 - Another niche kind of porn reference.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.120
 (laughing)

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.760
 - With that bit of advice, so let's wrap it up again.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.000
 Okay, that is it.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.400
 That is all of our facts.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.760

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.360
 (audience cheering)

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.940
 (upbeat music)

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.520
 (upbeat music)

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.360
 (upbeat music)
