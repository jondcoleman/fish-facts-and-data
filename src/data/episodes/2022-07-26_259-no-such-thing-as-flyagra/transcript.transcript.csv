00:00:02,00:00:06,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:06,00:00:08,(electronic music)
00:00:08,00:00:11,(electronic music)
00:00:11,00:00:18,"- Now, I'm a land welcome to another episode"
00:00:18,00:00:22,of no such thing as a fish-a-weekly podcast.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"This week, coming to you live from Glasgow."
00:00:25,00:00:28,(cheering)
00:00:28,00:00:31,- My name is Jan Schreiber and I am sitting here
00:00:31,00:00:34,"with Anich Zinski, Andrew Huntemari, and James Harkin."
00:00:34,00:00:37,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:37,00:00:40,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:40,00:00:42,and in no particular order.
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Here, we go, starting with you, James."
00:00:45,00:00:48,"- Okay, my fact this week is that there is only one person"
00:00:48,00:00:52,in the world who can predict the future using asparagus.
00:00:52,00:00:54,(laughing)
00:00:54,00:00:58,"- For 2019, she has predicted extreme temperatures,"
00:00:58,00:01:01,"a recession in the US, and an all-time high"
00:01:01,00:01:02,in asparagus sales.
00:01:02,00:01:05,(laughing)
00:01:05,00:01:11,"- So, when you say she can predict the future."
00:01:11,00:01:13,- What's that success rate?
00:01:13,00:01:15,"- Well, it was really hot last week."
00:01:15,00:01:17,- So 100%.
00:01:17,00:01:19,"- Oh, so far."
00:01:19,00:01:19,- Yep.
00:01:19,00:01:22,"- Yeah, actually, she claims to have a very high percentage,"
00:01:22,00:01:25,"but these people always do, don't they?"
00:01:25,00:01:27,"Okay, let's see some of the other things that she says."
00:01:27,00:01:31,"She says, ""This year, fears of Brexit will be unfounded."""
00:01:31,00:01:32,"Yeah, maybe."
00:01:32,00:01:36,"""The trade war between China and the US will end,"
00:01:36,00:01:37,but there'll be a recession.
00:01:37,00:01:39,"England's women's football team will win the World Cup,"
00:01:39,00:01:40,"fingers crossed."""
00:01:40,00:01:42,(laughing)
00:01:42,00:01:43,(laughing)
00:01:43,00:01:46,"- Pick your audience, James, take your audience."
00:01:46,00:01:48,"- You don't, you don't want you to forget which country you're in."
00:01:48,00:01:50,(laughing)
00:01:50,00:01:52,- James looked genuinely shocked when he saw the boat.
00:01:52,00:01:53,- What happened?
00:01:53,00:01:55,- Why do they hate women so much?
00:01:55,00:01:57,(laughing)
00:01:57,00:02:00,"- Yeah, not cool that guy, not cool."
00:02:00,00:02:05,"- That the hierarchy is nationalism, then feminism."
00:02:05,00:02:08,(laughing)
00:02:08,00:02:09,"- Good, anyway, yes, so there's this lady,"
00:02:09,00:02:11,"and she does that stuff, and it's obviously bullshit."
00:02:11,00:02:13,"- She, well, she..."
00:02:13,00:02:15,"- Well, hang on."
00:02:15,00:02:19,"- She has a Twitter account, I went on it today,"
00:02:19,00:02:22,and one of the other predictions that she had is that she said
00:02:22,00:02:26,"that the Oscars this year, a star is born, would have success,"
00:02:26,00:02:29,but British actors will also be in the mix.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"So she was correct about Olivia Cole,"
00:02:32,00:02:35,"and a star is born, I think, one, the best song,"
00:02:35,00:02:38,"and she wrote a tweet just going, ""Got it right."""
00:02:38,00:02:39,She's very proud.
00:02:39,00:02:43,"She said, ""Another great success rate for the old."""
00:02:43,00:02:45,- What'd she call herself?
00:02:45,00:02:47,- She calls herself Mystic Veg.
00:02:47,00:02:48,(laughing)
00:02:48,00:02:49,- She's pretty strong.
00:02:49,00:02:54,"- Yeah, she's an asparamenser, it's called Asparamenser."
00:02:54,00:02:57,"- You can just put ""Moncer"" on the end of any word,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,"and it means you tell the future by it, can't you?"
00:02:59,00:03:00,"And it's great, and they've been doing this."
00:03:00,00:03:02,"It was in the medieval period, I think,"
00:03:02,00:03:04,"when they look back over classical texts,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"and they went, ""God, those old ancient Romans"
00:03:06,00:03:08,"""and Greeks told the future in weird ass ways,"
00:03:08,00:03:10,"""let's just call them all ""Moncer"" some things."""
00:03:10,00:03:14,"And so there are so many ""Moncies"", as Tyra ""Moncy"","
00:03:14,00:03:15,"which is one of my favorites,"
00:03:15,00:03:18,which is telling the future by how cheese can regulate.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"- Yeah, I read one version of this Tyra ""Moncy"","
00:03:21,00:03:24,"which is you get a cheese, you wait for it to go moldy,"
00:03:24,00:03:26,"and then you look at the mold,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,and that tells you the name of your husband.
00:03:28,00:03:29,- Oh.
00:03:29,00:03:31,"I thought, yeah, I read something similar to that,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,which is it's the names of various suitors
00:03:33,00:03:35,"that you write onto the cheese,"
00:03:35,00:03:36,and the bit that the mold grows over
00:03:36,00:03:39,"is who you're gonna pick grows over all the names,"
00:03:39,00:03:41,you're in for a lot of...
00:03:41,00:03:43,(laughing)
00:03:43,00:03:45,"- How does it tell you the name of your,"
00:03:45,00:03:46,do you say the name of your husband?
00:03:46,00:03:47,"- Yeah, actually,"
00:03:47,00:03:49,"but unusually for this podcast,"
00:03:49,00:03:51,what Dan said sounded a lot more sensible to me.
00:03:51,00:03:53,(laughing)
00:03:53,00:03:54,- Do you remember it's exactly like
00:03:54,00:03:55,when we used to peel apples?
00:03:55,00:03:57,Did everyone used to do this and you peeled an apple
00:03:57,00:03:58,and then you threw the peel in the air?
00:03:58,00:04:03,"And what it is probably just what girls did in the pre-Feminist world,"
00:04:03,00:04:06,and the shape that Apple Peel landed in
00:04:06,00:04:08,was the first letter of your future husband's name.
00:04:08,00:04:11,So everyone thought their future husband's name would start with S.
00:04:11,00:04:13,(laughing)
00:04:13,00:04:14,- This is quite a cool thing.
00:04:14,00:04:18,"There is a thing called allureomancy,"
00:04:18,00:04:19,"which is not about being alluring,"
00:04:19,00:04:23,it's about baking messages into little balls of dough.
00:04:23,00:04:25,"And this happened in ancient Greece,"
00:04:25,00:04:26,"and the balls would be mixed up,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"and they'd have different messages on them,"
00:04:28,00:04:29,and then you would pick one.
00:04:29,00:04:31,And that is basically a fortune cookie.
00:04:31,00:04:32,- Yeah.
00:04:32,00:04:34,- The ancient Greeks have fortune cookies.
00:04:34,00:04:35,That's what I'm trying to say.
00:04:35,00:04:36,- That's really cool.
00:04:36,00:04:38,"- There's also gyramancy,"
00:04:38,00:04:42,which is the idea of you just start walking in a circle
00:04:42,00:04:45,"and keep walking, and around the perimeter of where you're walking,"
00:04:45,00:04:47,"they leave letters at the alphabet,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,"so you start spelling something out,"
00:04:49,00:04:51,and the idea is you keep going until you start stumbling
00:04:51,00:04:54,"into these letters, and then you keep going"
00:04:54,00:04:56,"until it starts spelling something out,"
00:04:56,00:05:00,and then you keep going until finally you spell out a consistent sentence.
00:05:00,00:05:02,"And if you don't do that, you just keep going"
00:05:02,00:05:04,until either you die or go mad.
00:05:04,00:05:07,And that's what they used to do back in the day.
00:05:07,00:05:08,- Back in the day.
00:05:08,00:05:09,- Back in the day.
00:05:09,00:05:10,- Yeah.
00:05:10,00:05:11,- Back in the day.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"- I know, it's just safe."
00:05:13,00:05:16,"It's not BC, but it actually dates just back in the day."
00:05:16,00:05:19,- I like this kind of telling the future from Iran.
00:05:19,00:05:20,It's called Falguj.
00:05:20,00:05:23,And it's the act of standing in a dark corner
00:05:23,00:05:26,and listening to the conversations of passes by.
00:05:26,00:05:29,"- Oh, I didn't know there was a word for what I did."
00:05:29,00:05:31,(laughing)
00:05:31,00:05:33,- That's great.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"- In 2008, there was some research that found that you can make"
00:05:36,00:05:38,someone like certain foods.
00:05:38,00:05:41,If you convince them that they loved it the first time they tried it.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"So you say to them, ""When you were a kid,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"""you had this and you absolutely loved it."""
00:05:45,00:05:47,And you can make it so that they used to hate something
00:05:47,00:05:48,and now they really like it.
00:05:48,00:05:51,And that work was funded by the Asparagus Industry.
00:05:51,00:05:53,(laughing)
00:05:53,00:05:57,- I didn't know this about Asparagus.
00:05:57,00:06:00,Asparagus can grow a centimeter an hour.
00:06:00,00:06:02,- Wow.
00:06:02,00:06:03,- What?
00:06:03,00:06:03,- It can.
00:06:03,00:06:04,- You can watch that.
00:06:04,00:06:07,"If I had the day of work and I grew asparagus,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,I'd probably try and see it move.
00:06:09,00:06:10,(laughing)
00:06:10,00:06:12,- Is that how they do it?
00:06:12,00:06:13,"Do they just go, ""Boom."""
00:06:13,00:06:16,"In the space of 24 hours, do we get them really quick?"
00:06:16,00:06:17,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:18,- It grows fast.
00:06:18,00:06:20,"- It literally, you just pull water on it"
00:06:20,00:06:20,"and it goes, ""Boom."""
00:06:20,00:06:23,"In 24 hours, it doesn't lay that noise."
00:06:23,00:06:26,"- It probably, if you spit it up, it probably does make that noise."
00:06:26,00:06:27,- That's incredible.
00:06:27,00:06:28,- I know.
00:06:28,00:06:29,- What grows that fast?
00:06:29,00:06:30,- The asparagus.
00:06:30,00:06:32,(laughing)
00:06:32,00:06:35,"- And bamboo, as we know."
00:06:35,00:06:39,- You know that all the asparagus that we eat is male.
00:06:39,00:06:40,- No.
00:06:40,00:06:42,- That's a good news for this woman hating audience.
00:06:42,00:06:44,(laughing)
00:06:44,00:06:46,(laughing)
00:06:46,00:06:49,- So those asparagus have rocketed in Glasgow.
00:06:49,00:06:51,(laughing)
00:06:51,00:06:53,"- I don't know if that's a win for women, isn't it?"
00:06:53,00:06:54,I don't think you want to be.
00:06:54,00:06:55,"- It is, yeah."
00:06:55,00:06:57,"- So basically, the male stalks are a lot bigger"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"and juicier than the female stalks,"
00:06:59,00:07:00,but that's because...
00:07:00,00:07:02,(laughing)
00:07:02,00:07:04,"No, you're writing your own jokes now, guys."
00:07:04,00:07:06,(laughing)
00:07:06,00:07:08,"Well, the reason is..."
00:07:08,00:07:11,(laughing)
00:07:11,00:07:14,"The reason is, because the females, they create the berries,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,and so they need to use all the energy
00:07:16,00:07:18,to do something actually useful.
00:07:18,00:07:19,- Oh.
00:07:19,00:07:21,- Whereas all the men have to do is just grow and be juicy.
00:07:21,00:07:22,- Right.
00:07:22,00:07:23,(laughing)
00:07:23,00:07:23,Nice.
00:07:23,00:07:26,We're gonna have to move on shortly to our next fact.
00:07:26,00:07:29,I've just got one or two things.
00:07:29,00:07:31,"Hey, if anyone, by the way, is thinking"
00:07:31,00:07:33,"of going to the asparagus festival,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,"there is exciting stuff that goes on,"
00:07:35,00:07:36,"and the stuff that goes on afterwards,"
00:07:36,00:07:39,"they had a 10-year anniversary not too long ago,"
00:07:39,00:07:40,and you can do tours on buses.
00:07:40,00:07:44,"It's the asparagus bus tours, and yeah, those are really fun."
00:07:44,00:07:46,"But actually, you've got to make sure to pick the right year"
00:07:46,00:07:48,"'cause a few years ago, they had to cancel the festival"
00:07:48,00:07:51,due to lack of asparagus.
00:07:51,00:07:51,There wasn't enough.
00:07:51,00:07:54,"There was a flooding, and it kind of ruined the crops"
00:07:54,00:07:55,that were growing.
00:07:55,00:07:56,"- Oh, yeah."
00:07:56,00:08:01,- But it turns out that asparagus played a very important role
00:08:01,00:08:04,in the formation of Darwin coming up
00:08:04,00:08:06,with the theory of evolution.
00:08:06,00:08:07,- Yeah.
00:08:07,00:08:10,"- Yeah, it was part of the evolution of the theory of evolution."
00:08:10,00:08:14,"What it was is, Darwin kept wondering why things can be seen,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"you know, it's a certain type of lettuces can be seen"
00:08:16,00:08:19,in places halfway across the world.
00:08:19,00:08:19,How do they get there?
00:08:19,00:08:20,How do they travel?
00:08:20,00:08:21,What goes on?
00:08:21,00:08:23,"So he had a butler called Mr. Parslow,"
00:08:23,00:08:26,and Mr. Parslow and him filled a tub full of salt water
00:08:26,00:08:29,"to replicate the conditions of the ocean,"
00:08:29,00:08:32,and they put a bunch of seeds in to see if the seeds would float
00:08:32,00:08:33,and how long they would float for.
00:08:33,00:08:36,"So they had cabbage seeds, radish seeds, and so on."
00:08:36,00:08:39,"They lasted for 42 days, which was really impressive."
00:08:39,00:08:43,"However, asparagus seeds lasted for 85 days,"
00:08:43,00:08:44,they would float for that long.
00:08:44,00:08:46,But the important bit was they then took the seed
00:08:46,00:08:49,"out of the seawater tub and buried it,"
00:08:49,00:08:52,and it grew into a asparagus like lit boots right away.
00:08:52,00:08:53,(audience laughing)
00:08:53,00:08:55,"And so that meant that they could travel,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,that they could still germinate once they were in the soil.
00:08:57,00:09:00,"So then they put the seeds inside a bird,"
00:09:00,00:09:02,"and then they killed the bird,"
00:09:02,00:09:03,and they threw them a bathtub.
00:09:03,00:09:05,What is the story?
00:09:05,00:09:06,(audience laughing)
00:09:06,00:09:07,The worst bedtime story.
00:09:07,00:09:09,(audience laughing)
00:09:09,00:09:13,- Dan's child hasn't slept for three weeks during this story.
00:09:13,00:09:14,"- Twinkle, twinkle, little star,"
00:09:14,00:09:17,or shoot the bird with the asparagus seed in its tummy.
00:09:17,00:09:18,(audience laughing)
00:09:18,00:09:20,"So then what they worked out was the bird,"
00:09:20,00:09:23,still you could take the seed out of the bird
00:09:23,00:09:25,"all those days later, and it would still grow."
00:09:25,00:09:27,So the asparagus seed helped Darwin to realize
00:09:27,00:09:29,it could travel via bird or via ocean.
00:09:29,00:09:31,"- Do you know, can I just make sure"
00:09:31,00:09:33,that you know that has nothing to do with evolution?
00:09:33,00:09:34,(audience laughing)
00:09:34,00:09:36,- What you just said.
00:09:36,00:09:37,(audience laughing)
00:09:37,00:09:40,"- That is not by, do you think evolution"
00:09:40,00:09:43,is the proof that stuff can travel long distances?
00:09:43,00:09:45,(audience laughing)
00:09:45,00:09:47,"- That sounds like just an idle side project,"
00:09:47,00:09:50,the whole drowning bird in the bathroom for Darwin.
00:09:50,00:09:51,(audience laughing)
00:09:51,00:09:53,- Do you let me tell that whole story?
00:09:53,00:09:55,(audience laughing)
00:09:55,00:09:56,- He still did it.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Could I just another famous person
00:09:57,00:10:00,"who looked into asparagus was Benjamin Franklin,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,and he formed a theory based on the fact
00:10:02,00:10:04,that it makes your wee smell.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"Although does everyone have that eye,"
00:10:06,00:10:09,'cause I don't think that asparagus makes your wee smell.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"- Well, you are wrong, 'cause it does so."
00:10:11,00:10:14,"- Well, no, some people can detect it and some people can't."
00:10:14,00:10:15,"- Well, it's not my fault."
00:10:15,00:10:17,- Not many people can't detect it.
00:10:17,00:10:19,I think if you can't detect it.
00:10:19,00:10:20,- I'm special.
00:10:20,00:10:21,- You have a thing.
00:10:21,00:10:24,"- Yeah, you've got a thing called specific a nozzmere."
00:10:24,00:10:27,So that's why you can't smell a particular smell.
00:10:27,00:10:29,"- The asparagus wee smell, yeah."
00:10:29,00:10:32,- But the asparagus does other people claim it makes your wee smell.
00:10:32,00:10:36,And Ben Franklin wrote a letter to the Royal Academy of Brussels
00:10:36,00:10:39,using as asparagus as an example of how what we eat
00:10:39,00:10:42,can impact the smell of what we excrete.
00:10:42,00:10:46,So he was saying asparagus makes your wee smell kind of gross.
00:10:46,00:10:50,"Well, how about we work on this, 'cause thoughts smell gross."
00:10:50,00:10:52,And if we know that stuff we eat
00:10:52,00:10:54,"can make what comes out,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,can change the smell of stuff that comes out of us.
00:10:56,00:10:57,Why don't we work out what we need to eat
00:10:57,00:10:59,in order for Farts to smell nice?
00:10:59,00:11:01,"And he thought it was a really big idea,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"'cause he was saying cause his disease,"
00:11:03,00:11:06,'cause well-bred people hold their Farts in solely
00:11:06,00:11:08,because they're gonna stink the place out
00:11:08,00:11:09,if they let one rip.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"And so he said, if we could get a pill or something,"
00:11:12,00:11:15,"we could feed people to make your Farts smell like perfume,"
00:11:15,00:11:17,then people would actually want to do it.
00:11:17,00:11:19,- And that's evolution.
00:11:19,00:11:21,(laughing)
00:11:21,00:11:23,(laughing)
00:11:23,00:11:26,(upbeat music)
00:11:26,00:11:34,"- Okay, and it's time for fact number two,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,and that is Chazinski.
00:11:36,00:11:38,"- My fact this week is that the composer,"
00:11:38,00:11:42,"Haydn's wife, cared so little about her husband's work"
00:11:42,00:11:44,that she used to tear up his scores
00:11:44,00:11:47,to use as hair curlers and pastry underlays.
00:11:47,00:11:49,- That's crazy.
00:11:49,00:11:53,"Was this sort of before, he sold them 21 or before,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,was it just a thing that he did?
00:11:55,00:11:56,- It was just throughout his life.
00:11:56,00:11:59,So actually he wrote a lot and she just found them
00:11:59,00:12:01,lying around and she knew nothing about music
00:12:01,00:12:02,and did not care.
00:12:02,00:12:04,"Haydn once said, it makes not a blind bit of difference"
00:12:04,00:12:07,to my wife whether I'm a musician or a cobbler.
00:12:07,00:12:08,"And so she'd find them and she'd be like,"
00:12:08,00:12:11,"oh, that looks handy, I'll put a pie on that."
00:12:11,00:12:13,"- Yeah, well, I mean, he wrote 108 symphonies,"
00:12:13,00:12:17,"20 operas, 47 of sonatas, 68 quartets,"
00:12:17,00:12:20,"178 trios, 14 masses and six oratorios."
00:12:20,00:12:22,"So, I mean, that's a lot of paper."
00:12:22,00:12:23,- Yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:24,- Is it recycling?
00:12:24,00:12:25,- It's recycling.
00:12:25,00:12:26,- Yeah.
00:12:26,00:12:28,She didn't like him very much either.
00:12:28,00:12:29,"- Oh, that is true."
00:12:29,00:12:30,- I think she was doing it deliberately.
00:12:30,00:12:32,They had a very sad marriage.
00:12:32,00:12:35,"So he basically, he fell in love when he was very young,"
00:12:35,00:12:38,her Joseph Haydn with a woman called Teresa.
00:12:38,00:12:39,And she couldn't marry him.
00:12:39,00:12:42,"And so her father said, you want to marry her older sister"
00:12:42,00:12:45,who's this really unpleasant woman called Maria Anna.
00:12:45,00:12:47,And he felt bad.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"So he was like, okay, cool, I'm marrying her"
00:12:49,00:12:50,and said that sounds great.
00:12:50,00:12:52,And apparently she had a very domineering
00:12:52,00:12:54,and unfriendly character.
00:12:54,00:12:56,She used to spend all of his money very freely.
00:12:56,00:12:58,So he went to great lengths to hide his income
00:12:58,00:12:59,so she wouldn't know about it.
00:12:59,00:13:02,"And when she died, he was completely indifferent, apparently."
00:13:02,00:13:04,"- Well, they lived apart, didn't they, for..."
00:13:04,00:13:06,- Towards the end they did here.
00:13:06,00:13:07,"- Yes, for 40 years."
00:13:07,00:13:09,"- Well, the last 40 years."
00:13:09,00:13:12,(audience laughing)
00:13:13,00:13:17,"- He was housed, he had a job where he was housed"
00:13:17,00:13:19,this printer's castle where she did live with him
00:13:19,00:13:20,quite a lot of the time.
00:13:20,00:13:21,"- Right, okay."
00:13:21,00:13:22,"- Because then he had to towards the end,"
00:13:22,00:13:25,"he was in London and she sent him a letter saying,"
00:13:25,00:13:27,"she used to send him letters saying things like,"
00:13:27,00:13:28,"by the way, if you die tomorrow,"
00:13:28,00:13:30,there's no money to bury you.
00:13:30,00:13:32,"Really nice, love letters like that when he was away."
00:13:32,00:13:35,"And she wrote him a letter in London saying,"
00:13:35,00:13:37,I really need money because you're gonna die soon
00:13:37,00:13:39,and I need a house to live in as a widow.
00:13:39,00:13:40,So can you please buy me one?
00:13:40,00:13:41,And he did.
00:13:41,00:13:44,I read with the letters that it got to the point
00:13:44,00:13:47,where they were communicating just by sending each other's
00:13:47,00:13:51,"letters, but I didn't never open the letters that she sent"
00:13:51,00:13:53,and he was convinced that she didn't either.
00:13:53,00:13:55,So they were just sending each other these things.
00:13:55,00:13:56,It remained completely unopened.
00:13:56,00:13:58,No idea what was being said.
00:13:58,00:13:59,- Wow.
00:13:59,00:13:59,- No communication.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"- Yeah, pretty crazy."
00:14:01,00:14:02,- He item was very influential.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"He's not very well-known these days, I think,"
00:14:04,00:14:06,unless you're a classical music fan.
00:14:06,00:14:08,- He's less well-known than like Beethoven and Mozart.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:14:09,00:14:13,- He was great friends with Mozart from this life.
00:14:13,00:14:14,- Yeah.
00:14:14,00:14:17,"- And I really like, I've just been reading a tiny bit"
00:14:17,00:14:18,about Haydn's music.
00:14:18,00:14:21,So he wrote his string quartet in E flat
00:14:21,00:14:23,is known as the joke.
00:14:23,00:14:28,"'Cause he put, basically, he practical jokes in this string quartet"
00:14:28,00:14:29,'cause it's got lots of false endings
00:14:29,00:14:30,to catch the audience out.
00:14:30,00:14:31,"- That's quite cool, isn't it?"
00:14:31,00:14:32,- Yeah.
00:14:32,00:14:35,"- And he wrote something called the surprise symphony,"
00:14:35,00:14:38,which is he used to just turn up a people's houses
00:14:38,00:14:40,"and play that, don't know."
00:14:40,00:14:42,"- It's really, really quiet, apart from one very loud bit."
00:14:42,00:14:44,(laughing)
00:14:44,00:14:46,And then it never gets referred to again.
00:14:46,00:14:47,It doesn't get repeated as a motif.
00:14:47,00:14:48,"It's just really, really quiet."
00:14:48,00:14:49,"All the way through, apart from one way."
00:14:49,00:14:50,"He goes, ""Wow!"""
00:14:50,00:14:51,(laughing)
00:14:51,00:14:53,"- I like, there's also one he wrote,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"which is called the Palandrome, which starts one way,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,and then it just goes back on itself as a musical piece.
00:14:58,00:14:59,- That's cool.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"- But the first one, the joke is amazing,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,"'cause he would literally, the piece would finish"
00:15:03,00:15:04,"and the audience would go,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,and then he would play again.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"- And the whole thing just has the audience go,"
00:15:08,00:15:09,"""Ugh!"""
00:15:09,00:15:10,- To a point.
00:15:10,00:15:13,"- He was like Les Dorsen of his day, wasn't he?"
00:15:13,00:15:14,(laughing)
00:15:14,00:15:15,"- He was actually, he was a prankster."
00:15:15,00:15:16,- What's up?
00:15:16,00:15:18,- I can't remember any of Les Dorsen's.
00:15:18,00:15:21,"- I've got to say, that is not exactly a 2019 reference."
00:15:21,00:15:23,"- No, it's a great reference."
00:15:23,00:15:24,- What do you mean?
00:15:24,00:15:25,"- No, it's a problem."
00:15:25,00:15:28,"He got kicked out of his choir when he was very young,"
00:15:28,00:15:31,because he chopped off one of the choir boys' pigtails.
00:15:31,00:15:31,- Wow.
00:15:31,00:15:33,"- Just as a prank, just as a fun prank,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,he was very good-natured apparently.
00:15:35,00:15:36,So he was known as Papa Hayden.
00:15:36,00:15:39,"And yeah, as you say, he was best friends with Mozart."
00:15:39,00:15:41,There's a really moving moment
00:15:41,00:15:43,"when he was called to move to London,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"when he was about 60 by that point,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,"and he suddenly got this invitation,"
00:15:47,00:15:50,"and Mozart walked into the coaching station to say goodbye,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"and then they had a moment where Mozart said,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,"""I suppose this is the last time we'll see each other"
00:15:54,00:15:57,"""in this life, 'cause Hayden's, you know,"
00:15:57,00:15:59,"""in those days I was getting on a bit."""
00:15:59,00:16:01,"And Hayden said, ""Oh, don't you worry about me,"
00:16:01,00:16:02,"""I'm feeling really strong,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"""but then actually Mozart obviously died"
00:16:04,00:16:07,"""at the age of 35, and that year, so he was fine."""
00:16:07,00:16:09,"- Oh, you were gonna say that Hayden got into the coach"
00:16:09,00:16:11,"and drove off, and then he came back a minute later,"
00:16:11,00:16:12,but it was surprise!
00:16:12,00:16:13,(audience laughing)
00:16:13,00:16:16,"And one of the last time we'll see each other, I'm here."
00:16:16,00:16:18,"- Have you, did you guys read about his boss?"
00:16:18,00:16:19,Hayden's boss?
00:16:19,00:16:20,- No.
00:16:20,00:16:24,"- So he spent 30 years working for a royal house,"
00:16:24,00:16:25,'cause that was how you made your living as a musician.
00:16:25,00:16:29,"You didn't have really big mass concerts,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,you had a private patron.
00:16:31,00:16:33,"So his boss was Prince Paul and Ton Esther Hazee,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,or Esther Hazee.
00:16:35,00:16:35,- Esther Houser.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"- Esther Houser, sorry."
00:16:37,00:16:40,"And he had total control, basically, of Hayden's life."
00:16:40,00:16:43,So he could dictate how he dressed.
00:16:43,00:16:45,Hayden wasn't automatically allowed to send
00:16:45,00:16:46,and what he knew works.
00:16:46,00:16:50,"He had to submit them all to his highness,"
00:16:50,00:16:53,"and he was partly paid in semolina beef,"
00:16:53,00:16:55,cabbages and lard during his work.
00:16:55,00:16:58,He wasn't allowed to eat and drink with the other musicians
00:16:58,00:17:00,"in case they stopped respecting him,"
00:17:00,00:17:03,"'cause he was the boss, and every morning and afternoon,"
00:17:03,00:17:04,"he had to go to the prince and say,"
00:17:04,00:17:07,"""Would you like to hear a concert or an opera tonight?"""
00:17:07,00:17:09,"And if the prince had, yes, he had to go and prepare one."
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- Wow, yeah."
00:17:11,00:17:14,"He did insist on being paid partly in wine as well,"
00:17:14,00:17:17,"which is, along with other nasty stuff."
00:17:17,00:17:19,"But he did, he lived in this place."
00:17:19,00:17:22,And Prince Esther Houser had this weird castle
00:17:22,00:17:24,"that he built like a fantasy castle,"
00:17:24,00:17:25,"which sounds awful in this big swamp,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"where they had to spend about 10 months of the year,"
00:17:28,00:17:29,and he built this huge opera house
00:17:29,00:17:30,where Hayden had to compose these operas
00:17:30,00:17:33,"that burned down, and he immediately built a new one."
00:17:33,00:17:36,"And Hayden was still very popular there,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"and he had this team of musicians around him,"
00:17:38,00:17:40,"and they all did indeed respect him a lot,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,"to the extent that the musicians used to go to the tavern,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,"which also the prince built on the land,"
00:17:46,00:17:47,"and they used to get really pissed,"
00:17:47,00:17:49,"and they weren't allowed their wives there,"
00:17:49,00:17:52,"so everyone was getting a bit antsy at month number nine,"
00:17:52,00:17:55,and there was a moment where the cellist punched
00:17:55,00:17:58,"an oboist in the face when they got a bit pissed,"
00:17:58,00:17:59,"and he also-- - And Trombolus went,"
00:17:59,00:18:00,"""Wah, wah, wah."""
00:18:00,00:18:04,(all laughing)
00:18:04,00:18:07,"- It's actually a really serious incident, so."
00:18:07,00:18:09,(all laughing)
00:18:09,00:18:12,It's really unappreciated that Trombone moment.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"He punched him in the face, and he lost an eye,"
00:18:13,00:18:15,"'cause he was wearing his ring-- - Oh, no, no, no, no."
00:18:15,00:18:16,"- Not Bill, Bill. - No."
00:18:16,00:18:19,(all laughing)
00:18:19,00:18:22,"He was missing an eye, and he was a bit pissed off,"
00:18:22,00:18:24,"but Hayden stepped in, and managed to make them settle it"
00:18:24,00:18:28,"amicably, so this guy has removed the eye of his coworker,"
00:18:28,00:18:30,and they worked together happily for another seven years.
00:18:30,00:18:32,- That's all right.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- And then he took the other eye, and that was too far,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,'cause that was not funny.
00:18:36,00:18:39,"- We should say, should we say what happened to Hayden after he died?"
00:18:39,00:18:41,"- Oh, yeah. - I think we should."
00:18:41,00:18:44,"It was very bizarre, so he died, finally, quite old,"
00:18:44,00:18:47,"and then as soon as he died, his head was stolen,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,"and it was stolen by a guy he knew, actually,"
00:18:49,00:18:50,"who's married, he'd helped to set up,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,"so it was planned to slap in the face,"
00:18:52,00:18:54,"this guy called Rosenbaum, who was very interested"
00:18:54,00:18:56,"in phrenology, which was the study of skulls,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,"and what that meant about your intelligence,"
00:18:58,00:19:01,"and so he stole his head with his mate,"
00:19:01,00:19:04,and it used to be displayed in his mate's house
00:19:04,00:19:06,"in this little box, which had a little glass window"
00:19:06,00:19:10,"and it sat on a cushion, and imagine going to your friend's house,"
00:19:10,00:19:12,"and they said, ""Oh, do you see something really cool?"""
00:19:12,00:19:16,"And then you just got the dead head of your former mate,"
00:19:16,00:19:18,sitting in a display case.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"- Yeah, they didn't know about it until his patron,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,"who was a new prince by this time called Nicholas,"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"he decided, you know, the burial we gave Hayden,"
00:19:26,00:19:28,"it wasn't good enough, he needs a more dignified burial place,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"so they wanted to re-enter him somewhere grander,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"they dug him up, and they found his head was missing,"
00:19:33,00:19:34,and it was incredibly upsetting.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"So the authorities, you know, prompted by the prince,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,"they searched the home of Rosenbaum,"
00:19:39,00:19:41,"and he gave them a different skull,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,I don't know where he got that one from.
00:19:43,00:19:45,- He collected skulls.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"- And then they got wise to it,"
00:19:47,00:19:48,"'cause they looked at the skull, they'd be given,"
00:19:48,00:19:49,"he said, ""This is a young man's skull,"
00:19:49,00:19:51,"it's not Hayden, it was very Albany died."""
00:19:51,00:19:53,"And he said, ""All right, you got me, here's Hayden skull."""
00:19:53,00:19:56,They gave him another fake skull.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"So there were now three skulls in circulation,"
00:19:59,00:20:00,one of which is Hayden.
00:20:00,00:20:02,- Do you know how they hid Hayden skull?
00:20:02,00:20:03,- No. - It's very cool.
00:20:03,00:20:04,"So they had Hayden skull in the house,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,"and they hid it inside the mattress,"
00:20:07,00:20:09,and then he Rosenbaum made his wife lie on the mattress
00:20:09,00:20:11,and pretend to be menstruating.
00:20:11,00:20:13,And everyone searching the house was too afraid
00:20:13,00:20:17,"to go near her, and so they didn't lie in the skull."
00:20:17,00:20:20,- That was a quick pretend to be menstruating.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"- Ooh! - I know that's not what happened, so..."
00:20:24,00:20:26,(audience laughing)
00:20:26,00:20:27,- You're confusing menstruating
00:20:27,00:20:29,"with being on a ghost train, don't you think?"
00:20:29,00:20:30,- Ooh!
00:20:30,00:20:35,- I like the way that these guys looking
00:20:35,00:20:38,for Hayden are basically playing Hayden's seek.
00:20:38,00:20:40,- Ah! - Ah!
00:20:40,00:20:41,- Wow.
00:20:41,00:20:44,(audience laughing)
00:20:44,00:20:47,"- Okay, we need to move on."
00:20:47,00:20:49,Do we get to the other side where we did?
00:20:49,00:20:50,"Okay, let's move on."
00:20:50,00:20:53,"It's time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:20:53,00:20:56,My fact this week is that to stop people stealing
00:20:56,00:21:01,"American road signs with the number 69 on them,"
00:21:01,00:21:03,Washington State has replaced many of them
00:21:03,00:21:06,with signs that now read 68.9.
00:21:06,00:21:08,(audience laughing)
00:21:08,00:21:10,How is there a big plan?
00:21:10,00:21:12,So this is a big problem in America.
00:21:12,00:21:14,This is a thing called mile markers.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"So when you're driving, it tells you,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,either how many miles you have to get to somewhere
00:21:18,00:21:19,"or how many are left,"
00:21:19,00:21:21,and these keep getting stolen.
00:21:21,00:21:23,And it's not just 69 that get stolen.
00:21:23,00:21:25,There is also the 420.
00:21:25,00:21:26,And yeah.
00:21:26,00:21:29,420 is a--
00:21:29,00:21:30,"- Well, the police have been notified"
00:21:30,00:21:31,of everyone who just came.
00:21:31,00:21:33,(audience laughing)
00:21:33,00:21:36,"- Yeah, so 420 is a drug reference"
00:21:36,00:21:38,for the 20th of April.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"It's International Cannabis Day, I believe it is,"
00:21:40,00:21:43,"or Smokers Day, yeah."
00:21:43,00:21:44,- Okay.
00:21:44,00:21:45,- So those have been replaced as well.
00:21:45,00:21:50,"So those are now 419.9, and this is a big problem in America."
00:21:50,00:21:54,"'Cause they have, they've had 200 stolen"
00:21:54,00:21:58,over the last since about 2012.
00:21:58,00:21:59,They do cost a lot.
00:21:59,00:22:02,- There's a whole Wikipedia page on street sign theft.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"So for instance, there's a big list of them."
00:22:05,00:22:08,"Richard Bong State's recreation area,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,"keep having their sign stolen,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,because there's a word Bong in there.
00:22:12,00:22:15,Ragged ass road in Yellow Knife.
00:22:15,00:22:16,(audience laughing)
00:22:16,00:22:19,They had to keep changing their signs.
00:22:19,00:22:23,"But whole road in England, they had to keep losing that."
00:22:23,00:22:25,They eventually renamed it to Archers Way.
00:22:25,00:22:27,So this is happening all over the world
00:22:27,00:22:28,in hilariously named places.
00:22:28,00:22:29,(audience laughing)
00:22:29,00:22:33,- Do you guys know about a place called Burgaults in the US?
00:22:33,00:22:34,"- Nope, no."
00:22:34,00:22:36,"- No, you wouldn't, 'cause it's made up."
00:22:36,00:22:38,But this is a place.
00:22:38,00:22:41,"This is a pair of men called Mika and Mont,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,who have been trying to redesign America's road signs.
00:22:43,00:22:46,And they finally confirm that they'd redesigned them recently.
00:22:46,00:22:50,"And they've invented a fictional town called Burgaults,"
00:22:50,00:22:54,"ERGAULTS, because it involves some of the hardest letters"
00:22:54,00:22:55,to sign.
00:22:55,00:22:58,And that's all those vowels apparently.
00:22:58,00:22:59,They look really blurry.
00:22:59,00:23:01,They fill in a bit when you're far away.
00:23:01,00:23:03,The G always difficult.
00:23:03,00:23:05,Why does a G look completely different types
00:23:05,00:23:06,than it does written?
00:23:06,00:23:09,And so they have that as their archetypal.
00:23:09,00:23:11,- An amazing observation they can't even.
00:23:11,00:23:14,It's like Peter K was in the room.
00:23:14,00:23:16,- Wait till you find out about A.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"- It's any GM, stuck on G."
00:23:17,00:23:19,- Okay.
00:23:19,00:23:21,"- So yeah, and they would do it by they'd make signs"
00:23:21,00:23:24,"saying Burgaults, and then they'd lean them against fences."
00:23:24,00:23:25,And then they'd like walk up a hill
00:23:25,00:23:26,or walk 500 meters away.
00:23:26,00:23:28,And then they'd see how clear they could see them
00:23:28,00:23:30,compared to our normal signposts.
00:23:30,00:23:33,"And in this manner, they've convinced American Outer"
00:23:33,00:23:34,change all of its road sign fonts.
00:23:34,00:23:36,And they did that in 2004.
00:23:36,00:23:38,- But there's a lot of controversy about this.
00:23:38,00:23:39,- Yeah.
00:23:39,00:23:42,- So the original American font on all American roads
00:23:42,00:23:43,was called Highway Gothic.
00:23:43,00:23:45,"That was the name, which is pretty cool."
00:23:45,00:23:47,And then their font is called Clearview.
00:23:47,00:23:48,- Yeah.
00:23:48,00:23:49,- And there were all these studies saying
00:23:49,00:23:51,"it was much clearer to read, Clearview."
00:23:51,00:23:54,"And you could see it, if you were driving at night,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"and you saw a sign that was in Clearview,"
00:23:56,00:24:00,you could read it 74 feet further away than Highway Gothic.
00:24:00,00:24:01,- Wow.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- So that gives you a couple more seconds,"
00:24:03,00:24:04,"let's say, of reaction time."
00:24:04,00:24:07,"So it will stop you having a crash, perhaps."
00:24:07,00:24:10,And that could actually save lives.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"More or fewer people could die on the roads,"
00:24:12,00:24:14,depending on whether you choose Clearview or Highway Gothic.
00:24:14,00:24:15,But there have now been more studies
00:24:15,00:24:17,saying that Highway Gothic is better.
00:24:17,00:24:20,So Clearview has just had its approval removed.
00:24:20,00:24:23,"I think this year is, and it's approval put on hold."
00:24:23,00:24:25,- The Highway Gothic factions have come out.
00:24:25,00:24:26,- Right.
00:24:26,00:24:28,- They've been it down.
00:24:28,00:24:29,But it's all in caps lock Highway Gothic.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"So with America, they have all their signs and capitals,"
00:24:32,00:24:34,which is terrible for signage.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"Because capitals, you can't distinguish shapes."
00:24:37,00:24:38,It just looks like one big rectangle.
00:24:38,00:24:41,"So when you're far away, you can't tell as much."
00:24:41,00:24:43,"Whereas on our signs here,"
00:24:43,00:24:46,then you see the little tails of the G or the Y
00:24:46,00:24:47,or the other tailed letters.
00:24:47,00:24:49,You all know what they are.
00:24:49,00:24:52,(all laughing)
00:24:52,00:24:54,"- G, Y, P. - P."
00:24:54,00:24:57,"- P is another good one and a cue, of course."
00:24:57,00:24:58,- What was that?
00:24:58,00:24:59,- J. - J. - J.
00:24:59,00:25:01,- J. - J. - J.
00:25:01,00:25:03,- Anyway. - Maybe we should take this.
00:25:03,00:25:05,"- No, no, I think we're on the brink of something."
00:25:05,00:25:06,"- No, it's alright."
00:25:06,00:25:10,"- Oh, I found out, in fact, mice make sign posts"
00:25:10,00:25:14,"in their fields, and they make them out of leaves and twigs"
00:25:14,00:25:16,so they don't get lost.
00:25:16,00:25:18,- Oh. - Who the?
00:25:18,00:25:19,- What font are they using?
00:25:19,00:25:21,And as a capstock.
00:25:21,00:25:22,(all laughing)
00:25:22,00:25:23,- This is wood mice.
00:25:23,00:25:26,"They move objects, like a leaf or a twig,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,to mark a side that interests them.
00:25:28,00:25:30,"And they regularly, when they're exploring around it,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,they rear up on their hind legs and they look
00:25:32,00:25:35,to make sure they can still see their little street sign
00:25:35,00:25:36,before they explore.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- Oh, wow."
00:25:38,00:25:41,One place which has problems with losing signs
00:25:41,00:25:44,is fin glass in North Dublin.
00:25:44,00:25:47,And that is because that is where Bono was born.
00:25:47,00:25:50,And so a lot of you two fans go and steal the road sign
00:25:50,00:25:52,from his road.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"So literally, the streets have no name."
00:25:54,00:25:56,(all laughing)
00:25:56,00:26:03,"It doesn't sound, it sounds like I've made it all up"
00:26:03,00:26:04,just for the puns like that.
00:26:04,00:26:05,"- No, it really is true."
00:26:05,00:26:06,- It really is true.
00:26:06,00:26:08,- We're first designed for cyclist road signs
00:26:08,00:26:11,in the 19th century to warning road signs.
00:26:11,00:26:13,But I want to test you guys because there was a study
00:26:13,00:26:16,done recently that showed that most people
00:26:16,00:26:18,can't identify most road signs now.
00:26:18,00:26:20,"And even, actually this is gonna be hard"
00:26:20,00:26:21,'cause you probably read it.
00:26:21,00:26:22,But there are three basic shapes.
00:26:22,00:26:23,- I know one.
00:26:23,00:26:25,- So the circle where it's like a red circle
00:26:25,00:26:27,with a white band in the middle of it.
00:26:27,00:26:27,- Yeah.
00:26:27,00:26:29,- That means shot cut.
00:26:29,00:26:33,(all laughing)
00:26:33,00:26:34,"- So three types of road signs,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,"there's a circle, the triangle and the rectangle."
00:26:36,00:26:37,- Oh yeah.
00:26:37,00:26:38,- Does anyone know the difference between
00:26:38,00:26:40,what those things mean?
00:26:40,00:26:42,"- Is it the circle, was it circle, triangle,"
00:26:42,00:26:44,and triangle's running?
00:26:44,00:26:45,"- Yeah, and circle is--"
00:26:45,00:26:46,- Circle is bad.
00:26:46,00:26:48,"- Through this now, whatever it says,"
00:26:48,00:26:49,you must bloody well do it.
00:26:49,00:26:53,"And then the square is, there's a nice castle over there."
00:26:53,00:26:54,"- Right, yeah."
00:26:54,00:26:56,"- Okay, that's sort of, one is very wrong."
00:26:56,00:26:57,So I hope you're joking.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"The circle is absolutely, don't do it."
00:26:59,00:27:00,Please don't.
00:27:00,00:27:01,But there are people don't understand this.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Anything in a red circle means
00:27:02,00:27:04,"this is bad, but I think it doesn't have a cross through it."
00:27:04,00:27:05,No one realizes.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"So there was this survey done that said,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,what does this I mean that has a red circle?
00:27:09,00:27:12,"And it shows, it's known as the low flying motorbike sign,"
00:27:12,00:27:14,"I think, because it shows a car."
00:27:14,00:27:15,"And then on top of it, a little motorbike."
00:27:15,00:27:17,- So that means no vehicles.
00:27:17,00:27:18,- It means no vehicles.
00:27:18,00:27:20,"Most people who did this survey said,"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"well, it means only cars and motorbikes are allowed."
00:27:22,00:27:25,(all laughing)
00:27:25,00:27:26,- People have no idea.
00:27:26,00:27:28,- That's the problem in Italy.
00:27:28,00:27:29,"There's a town that has started,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,they have a big problem in this one town
00:27:31,00:27:33,where there's a lot of prostitutes on the side of the road
00:27:33,00:27:36,and they're trying to not encourage people to stop
00:27:36,00:27:38,and do business with them.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"So they created signs, again, with a pictogram"
00:27:40,00:27:42,on it of what was a prostitute.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"And it says underneath it, prostitutes."
00:27:44,00:27:47,"But most people didn't know if it was sort of saying,"
00:27:47,00:27:48,oh no.
00:27:48,00:27:51,(all laughing)
00:27:51,00:27:52,They actually increased traffic
00:27:52,00:27:55,because most people were slowing down.
00:27:55,00:27:56,(all laughing)
00:27:56,00:27:59,(upbeat music)
00:27:59,00:28:01,(upbeat music)
00:28:01,00:28:04,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:28:04,00:28:07,And that is Andy.
00:28:07,00:28:10,- My fact is that flies like to date
00:28:10,00:28:13,the same sort of flies as their fly friends.
00:28:13,00:28:15,(all laughing)
00:28:15,00:28:19,- I don't even know where to start with that.
00:28:19,00:28:20,- Yeah.
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Do you mean fly friends?
00:28:21,00:28:22,Are they really cool friends?
00:28:22,00:28:24,"- No, I just mean the friends who are flies."
00:28:24,00:28:25,- All right.
00:28:25,00:28:26,- So this is really cool.
00:28:26,00:28:30,It's all about how flies choose which other flies to court.
00:28:30,00:28:33,"So scientists, they painted a load of male fruit flies"
00:28:33,00:28:34,"different colors, okay?"
00:28:34,00:28:37,They painted some pink and some green.
00:28:37,00:28:39,And they set up a date between one female
00:28:39,00:28:41,"and the two males, one pink and one green."
00:28:41,00:28:43,"And then behind some glass,"
00:28:43,00:28:46,they had another female fly watching this date.
00:28:46,00:28:48,- This sounds like a channel five show this year.
00:28:48,00:28:51,(all laughing)
00:28:51,00:28:54,- And so the female inside chose one of the males.
00:28:54,00:28:57,She chose pink or green to make with.
00:28:57,00:28:59,And then the observer female flies
00:28:59,00:29:01,who been watching this whole ring roll
00:29:01,00:29:03,"were given the chance a day later,"
00:29:03,00:29:05,which is quite a long time in fly years.
00:29:05,00:29:07,"That's like three years later,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,they get the chance for a date of their own.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"And when they were given the chance,"
00:29:11,00:29:13,they almost always picked the color
00:29:13,00:29:16,that the female before had chosen.
00:29:16,00:29:18,So they remembered this.
00:29:18,00:29:21,And even when they were presented with two male flies
00:29:21,00:29:23,that were apparently hideous.
00:29:23,00:29:26,"- Yeah, I mean, 'cause they probably in real life"
00:29:26,00:29:29,"don't see many flies painted pink and green, don't they?"
00:29:29,00:29:32,"- Yeah, yeah. - So yeah, it's very strange."
00:29:32,00:29:35,And so what does this tell us about flies?
00:29:35,00:29:36,- I don't know.
00:29:36,00:29:38,- I don't know.
00:29:38,00:29:43,"- Okay, well I thought you did, that's why I asked you."
00:29:43,00:29:45,So the idea is that because the flies
00:29:45,00:29:48,"are passing on behavioral traits between each other,"
00:29:48,00:29:51,they might have some kind of culture.
00:29:51,00:29:54,"As in, a culture is where someone does something"
00:29:54,00:29:55,and then they kind of talk everyone else
00:29:55,00:29:57,"into doing it and then you become a kind of,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,everyone goes to Glastonbury.
00:29:59,00:30:02,"- Right, they then got female observers again"
00:30:02,00:30:04,behind the glass to watch a fly orgy
00:30:04,00:30:07,between lots of males and lots of females.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"- These flies really lucked out, didn't they?"
00:30:09,00:30:11,They must have been bragging to their friends.
00:30:11,00:30:13,I've been involved in this study.
00:30:13,00:30:14,You have no idea.
00:30:14,00:30:16,I never need to pay for porn again.
00:30:16,00:30:19,- Just an interesting thing about fly sex
00:30:19,00:30:21,"because if they're having this big orgy,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"the problem is, is flies have sex while they're flying."
00:30:23,00:30:27,"So they flies, certain flies have a special kind"
00:30:27,00:30:31,of genitalia gonads that just have to just move around
00:30:31,00:30:33,to wherever the female fly is flying.
00:30:33,00:30:34,- Wow.
00:30:34,00:30:35,"- Yeah, so if she banks left and he's like,"
00:30:35,00:30:37,"""Well, I've got to go, his gonads can go."""
00:30:37,00:30:42,And just I can go from anywhere from 90 to 360 degrees
00:30:42,00:30:44,just around to just be making sure
00:30:44,00:30:48,"that the sex continues while all this very, you know,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,flying stuff is going on.
00:30:50,00:30:54,"And that's very cool, 'cause it's hard to seduce the woman"
00:30:54,00:30:57,"as a male fruit fly, this is, that you're talking about."
00:30:57,00:31:01,"But they sing songs, so the males chase the females"
00:31:01,00:31:03,"and then they will extend just one wing,"
00:31:03,00:31:06,"so they'll put one arm out and they vibrate it,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,and it produces a song.
00:31:08,00:31:10,And the song has two modes.
00:31:10,00:31:12,So there's just like two types of sound they can make.
00:31:12,00:31:15,And you have to amplify it by more than a million times
00:31:15,00:31:16,"to hear it with human ears, but we've done that,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,obviously because scientists are bored.
00:31:18,00:31:23,So they've got the sign and the pulse and the sign sounds like
00:31:23,00:31:26,the wine of an approaching mosquito apparently.
00:31:26,00:31:28,And then the pulse sounds like a cat's per.
00:31:28,00:31:30,"So if you're being seduced by a fly,"
00:31:30,00:31:34,it's a combination of a buzzing mosquito and a purring cat.
00:31:34,00:31:37,"- But then once the male, once the female has accepted the male,"
00:31:37,00:31:39,the male licks the female for two minutes
00:31:39,00:31:41,and then they mate for about 20 minutes.
00:31:41,00:31:43,And that's some scientists who I think were really bored.
00:31:43,00:31:47,They scrambled a fruit fly's courtship neurons in its brain
00:31:47,00:31:50,"so that they tried to copulate, lick and play the love song"
00:31:50,00:31:52,all at the same time.
00:31:52,00:31:53,(laughing)
00:31:53,00:31:55,And what would normally take for a four minute
00:31:55,00:31:58,quite delicate mating process was reduced to 10 seconds.
00:31:58,00:32:00,(laughing)
00:32:00,00:32:01,- And we'll all be in there.
00:32:01,00:32:03,(laughing)
00:32:03,00:32:07,- Who's your green friend?
00:32:07,00:32:09,(laughing)
00:32:09,00:32:17,"- They have the only known aphrodisiac,"
00:32:17,00:32:18,fruit flies.
00:32:18,00:32:19,"- Oh, like a proven one, you mean?"
00:32:19,00:32:21,"- A proven one, fly agra."
00:32:21,00:32:22,(laughing)
00:32:22,00:32:24,(cheering)
00:32:24,00:32:28,"And now they've got their PR guy, which is good."
00:32:28,00:32:30,He's gonna need a job after tonight.
00:32:30,00:32:34,They have the only aphrodisiac the scientists have ever proved
00:32:34,00:32:37,"exists is that actually makes you want to have sex,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,only works on fruit flies.
00:32:39,00:32:42,And it's the scent of rotting fruit.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"So if they smell rotting fruit,"
00:32:44,00:32:48,that actually turns on their brain pathways
00:32:48,00:32:49,that are the courtship initiating.
00:32:49,00:32:51,"So they send rotting fruit,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,and they immediately want to have a shag.
00:32:53,00:32:55,"And that is useful, I think, because rotting fruit"
00:32:55,00:32:57,is a good place to lay eggs as a woman.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"So if a man fancies you when you're near rotting fruit,"
00:32:59,00:33:03,"that's handy, 'cause then you can put your baby's in fruit."
00:33:03,00:33:05,"- Speaking of the chemicals,"
00:33:05,00:33:08,"if you have a fly that falls into your glass of wine,"
00:33:08,00:33:10,one single fly is enough to ruin the whole glass of wine.
00:33:10,00:33:13,"Okay, but only if it's a female fly."
00:33:13,00:33:15,And it's because it's the pheromones in the fly
00:33:15,00:33:18,that cause the wine to taste a bit skunky.
00:33:18,00:33:20,"If the males go in, actually, it will still taste the same."
00:33:20,00:33:25,And they tested this by getting the pheromones out of the flies
00:33:25,00:33:26,and then putting it into some wine
00:33:26,00:33:27,and getting people to taste it.
00:33:27,00:33:31,And they found that just one nanogram of a pheromone
00:33:31,00:33:34,was enough for a small glass of wine
00:33:34,00:33:37,"for them to be able to taste the difference with one nanogram,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"which is like, I don't know, I think it's like"
00:33:39,00:33:42,a thousandth of a millionth of a gram or something like that.
00:33:42,00:33:43,- In a small glass of wine.
00:33:43,00:33:44,- In a small glass of wine.
00:33:44,00:33:45,"- Sorry, hang on."
00:33:45,00:33:46,"- And at a small glass of wine,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,it's the thing that's going on.
00:33:48,00:33:51,- It's what you've got left.
00:33:51,00:33:55,- Mine's become small.
00:33:55,00:33:58,It always goes through the small phase.
00:33:58,00:34:00,- So I worked out what the equivalent of this is.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"And it's worth, it's the equivalent"
00:34:01,00:34:05,of putting one petal bin's worth of ribina into lockness.
00:34:05,00:34:09,And the whole lake tasting of black curd.
00:34:09,00:34:10,- Wow.
00:34:10,00:34:11,- That's great.
00:34:11,00:34:13,- There must be wine snobs who are tasting
00:34:13,00:34:16,that one tiny nanogram of female pheromone.
00:34:16,00:34:18,I think it has to the flavour of anything.
00:34:18,00:34:22,I stirred flies into this before I came on.
00:34:22,00:34:25,- There was a study on flies response
00:34:25,00:34:28,to carbonated beverages and their attraction
00:34:28,00:34:29,to carbon dioxide.
00:34:29,00:34:31,And the sky report about it was headlined.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"""Why do flies suddenly appear every time you open a beer?"""
00:34:34,00:34:37,(laughing)
00:34:37,00:34:38,That's nice.
00:34:40,00:34:43,- We're gonna have to wrap up soon.
00:34:43,00:34:45,"So before we do, you guys got?"
00:34:45,00:34:49,- I can tell you about Dung Beetle Sex.
00:34:49,00:34:50,"- Yeah, please."
00:34:50,00:34:52,- Ooh.
00:34:52,00:34:56,- That is an unbelievably niche porn subject.
00:34:56,00:34:58,(laughing)
00:34:58,00:34:58,- What do they do?
00:34:58,00:35:00,"- You need to delete your history immediately,"
00:35:00,00:35:01,whoever that was.
00:35:01,00:35:02,(laughing)
00:35:02,00:35:06,"Now what's interesting about them is that they get STDs,"
00:35:06,00:35:09,but actually it's a good thing for them.
00:35:09,00:35:12,"If you're a Dung Beetle and you get an STD,"
00:35:12,00:35:14,this is really good for you
00:35:14,00:35:17,because they get this kind of nematode worm
00:35:17,00:35:19,and it helps to get the right kind of bacteria.
00:35:19,00:35:22,"It eats all the bad bacteria in their body,"
00:35:22,00:35:24,which means a good bacteria can come in
00:35:24,00:35:27,and it means that then they can eat their food properly.
00:35:27,00:35:28,It's like if you have sex with someone
00:35:28,00:35:31,and feed them yackels at the same time.
00:35:31,00:35:32,- Wow.
00:35:32,00:35:34,(laughing)
00:35:37,00:35:39,- Another niche kind of porn reference.
00:35:39,00:35:42,(laughing)
00:35:42,00:35:45,"- With that bit of advice, so let's wrap it up again."
00:35:45,00:35:47,"Okay, that is it."
00:35:47,00:35:48,That is all of our facts.
