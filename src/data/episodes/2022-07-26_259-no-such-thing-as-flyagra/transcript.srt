1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
 (electronic music)

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,040
 (electronic music)

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,040
 (electronic music)

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,840
 - Now, I'm a land welcome to another episode

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,240
 of no such thing as a fish-a-weekly podcast.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,360
 This week, coming to you live from Glasgow.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,120
 (cheering)

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,240
 - My name is Jan Schreiber and I am sitting here

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,840
 with Anich Zinski, Andrew Huntemari, and James Harkin.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,080
 and in no particular order.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,560
 Here, we go, starting with you, James.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there is only one person

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,280
 in the world who can predict the future using asparagus.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,640
 (laughing)

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
 - For 2019, she has predicted extreme temperatures,

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,240
 a recession in the US, and an all-time high

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,880
 in asparagus sales.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,320
 (laughing)

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,720
 - So, when you say she can predict the future.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,040
 - What's that success rate?

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,240
 - Well, it was really hot last week.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,760
 - So 100%.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,080
 - Oh, so far.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,920
 - Yep.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,960
 - Yeah, actually, she claims to have a very high percentage,

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,040
 but these people always do, don't they?

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,120
 Okay, let's see some of the other things that she says.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,280
 She says, "This year, fears of Brexit will be unfounded."

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,120
 Yeah, maybe.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,280
 "The trade war between China and the US will end,

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
 but there'll be a recession.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,640
 England's women's football team will win the World Cup,

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,800
 fingers crossed."

37
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,600
 (laughing)

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,760
 (laughing)

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,360
 - Pick your audience, James, take your audience.

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,160
 - You don't, you don't want you to forget which country you're in.

41
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,000
 (laughing)

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,600
 - James looked genuinely shocked when he saw the boat.

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,440
 - What happened?

44
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,080
 - Why do they hate women so much?

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,320
 (laughing)

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,400
 - Yeah, not cool that guy, not cool.

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,880
 - That the hierarchy is nationalism, then feminism.

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,160
 (laughing)

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
 - Good, anyway, yes, so there's this lady,

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,960
 and she does that stuff, and it's obviously bullshit.

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,200
 - She, well, she...

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,880
 - Well, hang on.

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,560
 - She has a Twitter account, I went on it today,

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,360
 and one of the other predictions that she had is that she said

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,400
 that the Oscars this year, a star is born, would have success,

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,720
 but British actors will also be in the mix.

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
 So she was correct about Olivia Cole,

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
 and a star is born, I think, one, the best song,

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,520
 and she wrote a tweet just going, "Got it right."

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,960
 She's very proud.

61
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,760
 She said, "Another great success rate for the old."

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,080
 - What'd she call herself?

63
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,240
 - She calls herself Mystic Veg.

64
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
 (laughing)

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,520
 - She's pretty strong.

66
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,360
 - Yeah, she's an asparamenser, it's called Asparamenser.

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
 - You can just put "Moncer" on the end of any word,

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
 and it means you tell the future by it, can't you?

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,760
 And it's great, and they've been doing this.

70
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,680
 It was in the medieval period, I think,

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,320
 when they look back over classical texts,

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,520
 and they went, "God, those old ancient Romans

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
 "and Greeks told the future in weird ass ways,

74
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,720
 "let's just call them all "Moncer" some things."

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,560
 And so there are so many "Moncies", as Tyra "Moncy",

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,480
 which is one of my favorites,

77
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,520
 which is telling the future by how cheese can regulate.

78
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,520
 - Yeah, I read one version of this Tyra "Moncy",

79
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,960
 which is you get a cheese, you wait for it to go moldy,

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,000
 and then you look at the mold,

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,360
 and that tells you the name of your husband.

82
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,600
 - Oh.

83
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,480
 I thought, yeah, I read something similar to that,

84
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,840
 which is it's the names of various suitors

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
 that you write onto the cheese,

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,880
 and the bit that the mold grows over

87
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,960
 is who you're gonna pick grows over all the names,

88
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120
 you're in for a lot of...

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,160
 (laughing)

90
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,280
 - How does it tell you the name of your,

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,360
 do you say the name of your husband?

92
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,920
 - Yeah, actually,

93
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,400
 but unusually for this podcast,

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,800
 what Dan said sounded a lot more sensible to me.

95
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,520
 (laughing)

96
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
 - Do you remember it's exactly like

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,880
 when we used to peel apples?

98
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,200
 Did everyone used to do this and you peeled an apple

99
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
 and then you threw the peel in the air?

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,640
 And what it is probably just what girls did in the pre-Feminist world,

101
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,040
 and the shape that Apple Peel landed in

102
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,800
 was the first letter of your future husband's name.

103
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,920
 So everyone thought their future husband's name would start with S.

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,880
 (laughing)

105
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
 - This is quite a cool thing.

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,440
 There is a thing called allureomancy,

107
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,880
 which is not about being alluring,

108
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,720
 it's about baking messages into little balls of dough.

109
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
 And this happened in ancient Greece,

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,920
 and the balls would be mixed up,

111
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,080
 and they'd have different messages on them,

112
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,760
 and then you would pick one.

113
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,840
 And that is basically a fortune cookie.

114
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
 - Yeah.

115
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,240
 - The ancient Greeks have fortune cookies.

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
 That's what I'm trying to say.

117
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,400
 - That's really cool.

118
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,680
 - There's also gyramancy,

119
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,320
 which is the idea of you just start walking in a circle

120
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,560
 and keep walking, and around the perimeter of where you're walking,

121
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,360
 they leave letters at the alphabet,

122
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,080
 so you start spelling something out,

123
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,920
 and the idea is you keep going until you start stumbling

124
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,320
 into these letters, and then you keep going

125
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,440
 until it starts spelling something out,

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,920
 and then you keep going until finally you spell out a consistent sentence.

127
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,800
 And if you don't do that, you just keep going

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
 until either you die or go mad.

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,960
 And that's what they used to do back in the day.

130
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
 - Back in the day.

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
 - Back in the day.

132
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,800
 - Yeah.

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,640
 - Back in the day.

134
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,200
 - I know, it's just safe.

135
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,040
 It's not BC, but it actually dates just back in the day.

136
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,280
 - I like this kind of telling the future from Iran.

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,840
 It's called Falguj.

138
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,360
 And it's the act of standing in a dark corner

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,400
 and listening to the conversations of passes by.

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,480
 - Oh, I didn't know there was a word for what I did.

141
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,760
 (laughing)

142
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
 - That's great.

143
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,520
 - In 2008, there was some research that found that you can make

144
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,000
 someone like certain foods.

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,560
 If you convince them that they loved it the first time they tried it.

146
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,640
 So you say to them, "When you were a kid,

147
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,240
 "you had this and you absolutely loved it."

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,400
 And you can make it so that they used to hate something

149
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,840
 and now they really like it.

150
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,440
 And that work was funded by the Asparagus Industry.

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,960
 (laughing)

152
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,640
 - I didn't know this about Asparagus.

153
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,360
 Asparagus can grow a centimeter an hour.

154
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,160
 - Wow.

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,000
 - What?

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,840
 - It can.

157
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,680
 - You can watch that.

158
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,240
 If I had the day of work and I grew asparagus,

159
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
 I'd probably try and see it move.

160
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,480
 (laughing)

161
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,440
 - Is that how they do it?

162
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 Do they just go, "Boom."

163
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
 In the space of 24 hours, do we get them really quick?

164
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

165
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,240
 - It grows fast.

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,040
 - It literally, you just pull water on it

167
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
 and it goes, "Boom."

168
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,520
 In 24 hours, it doesn't lay that noise.

169
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,720
 - It probably, if you spit it up, it probably does make that noise.

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,640
 - That's incredible.

171
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
 - I know.

172
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
 - What grows that fast?

173
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
 - The asparagus.

174
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,760
 (laughing)

175
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,480
 - And bamboo, as we know.

176
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,440
 - You know that all the asparagus that we eat is male.

177
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,280
 - No.

178
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,360
 - That's a good news for this woman hating audience.

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,400
 (laughing)

180
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,720
 (laughing)

181
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,000
 - So those asparagus have rocketed in Glasgow.

182
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 (laughing)

183
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,720
 - I don't know if that's a win for women, isn't it?

184
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 I don't think you want to be.

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
 - It is, yeah.

186
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,680
 - So basically, the male stalks are a lot bigger

187
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,160
 and juicier than the female stalks,

188
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,320
 but that's because...

189
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,160
 (laughing)

190
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,320
 No, you're writing your own jokes now, guys.

191
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
 (laughing)

192
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
 Well, the reason is...

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,240
 (laughing)

194
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,920
 The reason is, because the females, they create the berries,

195
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,400
 and so they need to use all the energy

196
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
 to do something actually useful.

197
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
 - Oh.

198
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,320
 - Whereas all the men have to do is just grow and be juicy.

199
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
 - Right.

200
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,080
 (laughing)

201
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
 Nice.

202
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,800
 We're gonna have to move on shortly to our next fact.

203
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,200
 I've just got one or two things.

204
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,040
 Hey, if anyone, by the way, is thinking

205
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,240
 of going to the asparagus festival,

206
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,040
 there is exciting stuff that goes on,

207
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,640
 and the stuff that goes on afterwards,

208
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,160
 they had a 10-year anniversary not too long ago,

209
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,680
 and you can do tours on buses.

210
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,520
 It's the asparagus bus tours, and yeah, those are really fun.

211
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
 But actually, you've got to make sure to pick the right year

212
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,800
 'cause a few years ago, they had to cancel the festival

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,080
 due to lack of asparagus.

214
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,920
 There wasn't enough.

215
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,760
 There was a flooding, and it kind of ruined the crops

216
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,560
 that were growing.

217
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,720
 - Oh, yeah.

218
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,720
 - But it turns out that asparagus played a very important role

219
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,840
 in the formation of Darwin coming up

220
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,760
 with the theory of evolution.

221
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
 - Yeah.

222
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,280
 - Yeah, it was part of the evolution of the theory of evolution.

223
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,640
 What it was is, Darwin kept wondering why things can be seen,

224
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,920
 you know, it's a certain type of lettuces can be seen

225
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,040
 in places halfway across the world.

226
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
 How do they get there?

227
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,720
 How do they travel?

228
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
 What goes on?

229
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,360
 So he had a butler called Mr. Parslow,

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,880
 and Mr. Parslow and him filled a tub full of salt water

231
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,120
 to replicate the conditions of the ocean,

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,240
 and they put a bunch of seeds in to see if the seeds would float

233
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,920
 and how long they would float for.

234
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,640
 So they had cabbage seeds, radish seeds, and so on.

235
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,720
 They lasted for 42 days, which was really impressive.

236
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,280
 However, asparagus seeds lasted for 85 days,

237
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,800
 they would float for that long.

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
 But the important bit was they then took the seed

239
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,240
 out of the seawater tub and buried it,

240
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,680
 and it grew into a asparagus like lit boots right away.

241
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,720
 (audience laughing)

242
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
 And so that meant that they could travel,

243
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,640
 that they could still germinate once they were in the soil.

244
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,480
 So then they put the seeds inside a bird,

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,200
 and then they killed the bird,

246
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
 and they threw them a bathtub.

247
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,160
 What is the story?

248
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
 (audience laughing)

249
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,520
 The worst bedtime story.

250
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,560
 (audience laughing)

251
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,280
 - Dan's child hasn't slept for three weeks during this story.

252
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,400
 - Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

253
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,080
 or shoot the bird with the asparagus seed in its tummy.

254
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,360
 (audience laughing)

255
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,760
 So then what they worked out was the bird,

256
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,200
 still you could take the seed out of the bird

257
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,160
 all those days later, and it would still grow.

258
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,400
 So the asparagus seed helped Darwin to realize

259
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,600
 it could travel via bird or via ocean.

260
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,120
 - Do you know, can I just make sure

261
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,880
 that you know that has nothing to do with evolution?

262
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,960
 (audience laughing)

263
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,120
 - What you just said.

264
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,520
 (audience laughing)

265
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,320
 - That is not by, do you think evolution

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 is the proof that stuff can travel long distances?

267
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,560
 (audience laughing)

268
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,800
 - That sounds like just an idle side project,

269
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,760
 the whole drowning bird in the bathroom for Darwin.

270
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,600
 (audience laughing)

271
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
 - Do you let me tell that whole story?

272
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,240
 (audience laughing)

273
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,200
 - He still did it.

274
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
 Could I just another famous person

275
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
 who looked into asparagus was Benjamin Franklin,

276
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,960
 and he formed a theory based on the fact

277
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
 that it makes your wee smell.

278
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,760
 Although does everyone have that eye,

279
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,160
 'cause I don't think that asparagus makes your wee smell.

280
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,440
 - Well, you are wrong, 'cause it does so.

281
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,280
 - Well, no, some people can detect it and some people can't.

282
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,440
 - Well, it's not my fault.

283
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
 - Not many people can't detect it.

284
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
 I think if you can't detect it.

285
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,240
 - I'm special.

286
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,080
 - You have a thing.

287
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,400
 - Yeah, you've got a thing called specific a nozzmere.

288
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,240
 So that's why you can't smell a particular smell.

289
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,360
 - The asparagus wee smell, yeah.

290
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,520
 - But the asparagus does other people claim it makes your wee smell.

291
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,040
 And Ben Franklin wrote a letter to the Royal Academy of Brussels

292
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,360
 using as asparagus as an example of how what we eat

293
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
 can impact the smell of what we excrete.

294
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,000
 So he was saying asparagus makes your wee smell kind of gross.

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,920
 Well, how about we work on this, 'cause thoughts smell gross.

296
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,680
 And if we know that stuff we eat

297
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,080
 can make what comes out,

298
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,040
 can change the smell of stuff that comes out of us.

299
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,840
 Why don't we work out what we need to eat

300
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,440
 in order for Farts to smell nice?

301
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,920
 And he thought it was a really big idea,

302
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,880
 'cause he was saying cause his disease,

303
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,640
 'cause well-bred people hold their Farts in solely

304
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,600
 because they're gonna stink the place out

305
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,960
 if they let one rip.

306
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,480
 And so he said, if we could get a pill or something,

307
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
 we could feed people to make your Farts smell like perfume,

308
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,840
 then people would actually want to do it.

309
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,440
 - And that's evolution.

310
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,720
 (laughing)

311
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,960
 (laughing)

312
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,540
 (upbeat music)

313
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:34,320
 - Okay, and it's time for fact number two,

314
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,440
 and that is Chazinski.

315
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
 - My fact this week is that the composer,

316
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,440
 Haydn's wife, cared so little about her husband's work

317
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,160
 that she used to tear up his scores

318
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,160
 to use as hair curlers and pastry underlays.

319
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,200
 - That's crazy.

320
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,840
 Was this sort of before, he sold them 21 or before,

321
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,280
 was it just a thing that he did?

322
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,520
 - It was just throughout his life.

323
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,360
 So actually he wrote a lot and she just found them

324
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,400
 lying around and she knew nothing about music

325
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,320
 and did not care.

326
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,720
 Haydn once said, it makes not a blind bit of difference

327
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,520
 to my wife whether I'm a musician or a cobbler.

328
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,840
 And so she'd find them and she'd be like,

329
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,000
 oh, that looks handy, I'll put a pie on that.

330
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,760
 - Yeah, well, I mean, he wrote 108 symphonies,

331
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,240
 20 operas, 47 of sonatas, 68 quartets,

332
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,480
 178 trios, 14 masses and six oratorios.

333
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,680
 So, I mean, that's a lot of paper.

334
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,520
 - Yeah.

335
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,800
 - Is it recycling?

336
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 - It's recycling.

337
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,640
 - Yeah.

338
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,200
 She didn't like him very much either.

339
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,040
 - Oh, that is true.

340
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,680
 - I think she was doing it deliberately.

341
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,720
 They had a very sad marriage.

342
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,920
 So he basically, he fell in love when he was very young,

343
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,440
 her Joseph Haydn with a woman called Teresa.

344
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,760
 And she couldn't marry him.

345
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,520
 And so her father said, you want to marry her older sister

346
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,640
 who's this really unpleasant woman called Maria Anna.

347
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,280
 And he felt bad.

348
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,080
 So he was like, okay, cool, I'm marrying her

349
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,360
 and said that sounds great.

350
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,120
 And apparently she had a very domineering

351
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,080
 and unfriendly character.

352
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,040
 She used to spend all of his money very freely.

353
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,160
 So he went to great lengths to hide his income

354
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
 so she wouldn't know about it.

355
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,600
 And when she died, he was completely indifferent, apparently.

356
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,840
 - Well, they lived apart, didn't they, for...

357
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,000
 - Towards the end they did here.

358
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
 - Yes, for 40 years.

359
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,120
 - Well, the last 40 years.

360
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
 (audience laughing)

361
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,480
 - He was housed, he had a job where he was housed

362
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,360
 this printer's castle where she did live with him

363
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,480
 quite a lot of the time.

364
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,320
 - Right, okay.

365
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 - Because then he had to towards the end,

366
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
 he was in London and she sent him a letter saying,

367
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,480
 she used to send him letters saying things like,

368
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,720
 by the way, if you die tomorrow,

369
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,680
 there's no money to bury you.

370
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,720
 Really nice, love letters like that when he was away.

371
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
 And she wrote him a letter in London saying,

372
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,400
 I really need money because you're gonna die soon

373
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
 and I need a house to live in as a widow.

374
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,760
 So can you please buy me one?

375
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
 And he did.

376
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,720
 I read with the letters that it got to the point

377
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,160
 where they were communicating just by sending each other's

378
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,280
 letters, but I didn't never open the letters that she sent

379
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,560
 and he was convinced that she didn't either.

380
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,440
 So they were just sending each other these things.

381
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,680
 It remained completely unopened.

382
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,200
 No idea what was being said.

383
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,040
 - Wow.

384
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,880
 - No communication.

385
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,040
 - Yeah, pretty crazy.

386
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,520
 - He item was very influential.

387
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,680
 He's not very well-known these days, I think,

388
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,400
 unless you're a classical music fan.

389
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,880
 - He's less well-known than like Beethoven and Mozart.

390
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,720
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

391
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,360
 - He was great friends with Mozart from this life.

392
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,840
 - Yeah.

393
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,000
 - And I really like, I've just been reading a tiny bit

394
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,320
 about Haydn's music.

395
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,480
 So he wrote his string quartet in E flat

396
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 is known as the joke.

397
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,240
 'Cause he put, basically, he practical jokes in this string quartet

398
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,720
 'cause it's got lots of false endings

399
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,880
 to catch the audience out.

400
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,960
 - That's quite cool, isn't it?

401
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,800
 - Yeah.

402
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,240
 - And he wrote something called the surprise symphony,

403
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,240
 which is he used to just turn up a people's houses

404
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,040
 and play that, don't know.

405
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,880
 - It's really, really quiet, apart from one very loud bit.

406
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,400
 (laughing)

407
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,600
 And then it never gets referred to again.

408
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,880
 It doesn't get repeated as a motif.

409
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
 It's just really, really quiet.

410
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
 All the way through, apart from one way.

411
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 He goes, "Wow!"

412
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
 (laughing)

413
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,240
 - I like, there's also one he wrote,

414
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,960
 which is called the Palandrome, which starts one way,

415
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,920
 and then it just goes back on itself as a musical piece.

416
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,760
 - That's cool.

417
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,240
 - But the first one, the joke is amazing,

418
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,920
 'cause he would literally, the piece would finish

419
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
 and the audience would go,

420
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,320
 and then he would play again.

421
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,640
 - And the whole thing just has the audience go,

422
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
 "Ugh!"

423
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
 - To a point.

424
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,040
 - He was like Les Dorsen of his day, wasn't he?

425
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,440
 (laughing)

426
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,800
 - He was actually, he was a prankster.

427
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
 - What's up?

428
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,760
 - I can't remember any of Les Dorsen's.

429
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,400
 - I've got to say, that is not exactly a 2019 reference.

430
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,200
 - No, it's a great reference.

431
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,040
 - What do you mean?

432
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,480
 - No, it's a problem.

433
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,320
 He got kicked out of his choir when he was very young,

434
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,120
 because he chopped off one of the choir boys' pigtails.

435
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,960
 - Wow.

436
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,480
 - Just as a prank, just as a fun prank,

437
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,200
 he was very good-natured apparently.

438
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,880
 So he was known as Papa Hayden.

439
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,920
 And yeah, as you say, he was best friends with Mozart.

440
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,760
 There's a really moving moment

441
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,840
 when he was called to move to London,

442
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,760
 when he was about 60 by that point,

443
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,080
 and he suddenly got this invitation,

444
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,080
 and Mozart walked into the coaching station to say goodbye,

445
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,800
 and then they had a moment where Mozart said,

446
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,840
 "I suppose this is the last time we'll see each other

447
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,240
 "in this life, 'cause Hayden's, you know,

448
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,000
 "in those days I was getting on a bit."

449
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,040
 And Hayden said, "Oh, don't you worry about me,

450
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,840
 "I'm feeling really strong,

451
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,560
 "but then actually Mozart obviously died

452
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,000
 "at the age of 35, and that year, so he was fine."

453
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 - Oh, you were gonna say that Hayden got into the coach

454
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,200
 and drove off, and then he came back a minute later,

455
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,240
 but it was surprise!

456
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,400
 (audience laughing)

457
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,160
 And one of the last time we'll see each other, I'm here.

458
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,440
 - Have you, did you guys read about his boss?

459
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,280
 Hayden's boss?

460
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,120
 - No.

461
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,040
 - So he spent 30 years working for a royal house,

462
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,640
 'cause that was how you made your living as a musician.

463
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,720
 You didn't have really big mass concerts,

464
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,160
 you had a private patron.

465
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,880
 So his boss was Prince Paul and Ton Esther Hazee,

466
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,040
 or Esther Hazee.

467
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,960
 - Esther Houser.

468
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,200
 - Esther Houser, sorry.

469
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,680
 And he had total control, basically, of Hayden's life.

470
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,200
 So he could dictate how he dressed.

471
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,440
 Hayden wasn't automatically allowed to send

472
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,600
 and what he knew works.

473
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,480
 He had to submit them all to his highness,

474
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,280
 and he was partly paid in semolina beef,

475
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,920
 cabbages and lard during his work.

476
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,640
 He wasn't allowed to eat and drink with the other musicians

477
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,160
 in case they stopped respecting him,

478
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,400
 'cause he was the boss, and every morning and afternoon,

479
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,880
 he had to go to the prince and say,

480
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,760
 "Would you like to hear a concert or an opera tonight?"

481
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,960
 And if the prince had, yes, he had to go and prepare one.

482
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,480
 - Wow, yeah.

483
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,400
 He did insist on being paid partly in wine as well,

484
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,360
 which is, along with other nasty stuff.

485
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,040
 But he did, he lived in this place.

486
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,240
 And Prince Esther Houser had this weird castle

487
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,120
 that he built like a fantasy castle,

488
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,920
 which sounds awful in this big swamp,

489
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,080
 where they had to spend about 10 months of the year,

490
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,520
 and he built this huge opera house

491
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,760
 where Hayden had to compose these operas

492
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,360
 that burned down, and he immediately built a new one.

493
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,200
 And Hayden was still very popular there,

494
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,480
 and he had this team of musicians around him,

495
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
 and they all did indeed respect him a lot,

496
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,920
 to the extent that the musicians used to go to the tavern,

497
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,200
 which also the prince built on the land,

498
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,520
 and they used to get really pissed,

499
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,120
 and they weren't allowed their wives there,

500
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,520
 so everyone was getting a bit antsy at month number nine,

501
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,760
 and there was a moment where the cellist punched

502
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,040
 an oboist in the face when they got a bit pissed,

503
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,680
 and he also-- - And Trombolus went,

504
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,880
 "Wah, wah, wah."

505
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,040
 (all laughing)

506
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,320
 - It's actually a really serious incident, so.

507
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,440
 (all laughing)

508
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,200
 It's really unappreciated that Trombone moment.

509
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,840
 He punched him in the face, and he lost an eye,

510
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,360
 'cause he was wearing his ring-- - Oh, no, no, no, no.

511
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,920
 - Not Bill, Bill. - No.

512
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,920
 (all laughing)

513
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,000
 He was missing an eye, and he was a bit pissed off,

514
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,200
 but Hayden stepped in, and managed to make them settle it

515
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,520
 amicably, so this guy has removed the eye of his coworker,

516
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,960
 and they worked together happily for another seven years.

517
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,280
 - That's all right.

518
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,600
 - And then he took the other eye, and that was too far,

519
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,400
 'cause that was not funny.

520
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
 - We should say, should we say what happened to Hayden after he died?

521
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,280
 - Oh, yeah. - I think we should.

522
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,400
 It was very bizarre, so he died, finally, quite old,

523
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,160
 and then as soon as he died, his head was stolen,

524
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,200
 and it was stolen by a guy he knew, actually,

525
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,920
 who's married, he'd helped to set up,

526
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,240
 so it was planned to slap in the face,

527
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,520
 this guy called Rosenbaum, who was very interested

528
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,640
 in phrenology, which was the study of skulls,

529
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,840
 and what that meant about your intelligence,

530
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,680
 and so he stole his head with his mate,

531
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,520
 and it used to be displayed in his mate's house

532
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,880
 in this little box, which had a little glass window

533
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,400
 and it sat on a cushion, and imagine going to your friend's house,

534
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,920
 and they said, "Oh, do you see something really cool?"

535
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,760
 And then you just got the dead head of your former mate,

536
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,600
 sitting in a display case.

537
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,400
 - Yeah, they didn't know about it until his patron,

538
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,480
 who was a new prince by this time called Nicholas,

539
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,040
 he decided, you know, the burial we gave Hayden,

540
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,680
 it wasn't good enough, he needs a more dignified burial place,

541
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,160
 so they wanted to re-enter him somewhere grander,

542
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,040
 they dug him up, and they found his head was missing,

543
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,760
 and it was incredibly upsetting.

544
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,320
 So the authorities, you know, prompted by the prince,

545
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
 they searched the home of Rosenbaum,

546
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,880
 and he gave them a different skull,

547
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,800
 I don't know where he got that one from.

548
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,320
 - He collected skulls.

549
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,360
 - And then they got wise to it,

550
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,520
 'cause they looked at the skull, they'd be given,

551
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,760
 he said, "This is a young man's skull,

552
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,000
 it's not Hayden, it was very Albany died."

553
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,120
 And he said, "All right, you got me, here's Hayden skull."

554
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,480
 They gave him another fake skull.

555
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,240
 So there were now three skulls in circulation,

556
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
 one of which is Hayden.

557
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,280
 - Do you know how they hid Hayden skull?

558
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,320
 - No. - It's very cool.

559
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,880
 So they had Hayden skull in the house,

560
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,040
 and they hid it inside the mattress,

561
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,920
 and then he Rosenbaum made his wife lie on the mattress

562
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,640
 and pretend to be menstruating.

563
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,520
 And everyone searching the house was too afraid

564
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,240
 to go near her, and so they didn't lie in the skull.

565
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,960
 - That was a quick pretend to be menstruating.

566
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,120
 - Ooh! - I know that's not what happened, so...

567
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,320
 (audience laughing)

568
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,600
 - You're confusing menstruating

569
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,920
 with being on a ghost train, don't you think?

570
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,760
 - Ooh!

571
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,880
 - I like the way that these guys looking

572
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,120
 for Hayden are basically playing Hayden's seek.

573
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,360
 - Ah! - Ah!

574
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,200
 - Wow.

575
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
 (audience laughing)

576
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,800
 - Okay, we need to move on.

577
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,120
 Do we get to the other side where we did?

578
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,520
 Okay, let's move on.

579
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,440
 It's time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

580
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,960
 My fact this week is that to stop people stealing

581
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,440
 American road signs with the number 69 on them,

582
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,960
 Washington State has replaced many of them

583
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,960
 with signs that now read 68.9.

584
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
 (audience laughing)

585
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,160
 How is there a big plan?

586
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,560
 So this is a big problem in America.

587
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,320
 This is a thing called mile markers.

588
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,000
 So when you're driving, it tells you,

589
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 either how many miles you have to get to somewhere

590
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,040
 or how many are left,

591
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,280
 and these keep getting stolen.

592
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,760
 And it's not just 69 that get stolen.

593
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,840
 There is also the 420.

594
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
 And yeah.

595
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,000
 420 is a--

596
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,400
 - Well, the police have been notified

597
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
 of everyone who just came.

598
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,560
 (audience laughing)

599
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,560
 - Yeah, so 420 is a drug reference

600
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,120
 for the 20th of April.

601
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,960
 It's International Cannabis Day, I believe it is,

602
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,040
 or Smokers Day, yeah.

603
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,200
 - Okay.

604
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,600
 - So those have been replaced as well.

605
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,600
 So those are now 419.9, and this is a big problem in America.

606
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,920
 'Cause they have, they've had 200 stolen

607
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,200
 over the last since about 2012.

608
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,520
 They do cost a lot.

609
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,480
 - There's a whole Wikipedia page on street sign theft.

610
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,520
 So for instance, there's a big list of them.

611
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,240
 Richard Bong State's recreation area,

612
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,600
 keep having their sign stolen,

613
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,920
 because there's a word Bong in there.

614
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,360
 Ragged ass road in Yellow Knife.

615
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
 (audience laughing)

616
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,320
 They had to keep changing their signs.

617
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,040
 But whole road in England, they had to keep losing that.

618
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,600
 They eventually renamed it to Archers Way.

619
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,080
 So this is happening all over the world

620
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,760
 in hilariously named places.

621
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,600
 (audience laughing)

622
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,280
 - Do you guys know about a place called Burgaults in the US?

623
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,440
 - Nope, no.

624
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,120
 - No, you wouldn't, 'cause it's made up.

625
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,360
 But this is a place.

626
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,120
 This is a pair of men called Mika and Mont,

627
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,960
 who have been trying to redesign America's road signs.

628
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,640
 And they finally confirm that they'd redesigned them recently.

629
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,480
 And they've invented a fictional town called Burgaults,

630
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,760
 ERGAULTS, because it involves some of the hardest letters

631
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
 to sign.

632
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,480
 And that's all those vowels apparently.

633
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,360
 They look really blurry.

634
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,000
 They fill in a bit when you're far away.

635
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,120
 The G always difficult.

636
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,000
 Why does a G look completely different types

637
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,160
 than it does written?

638
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,520
 And so they have that as their archetypal.

639
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,960
 - An amazing observation they can't even.

640
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,280
 It's like Peter K was in the room.

641
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,240
 - Wait till you find out about A.

642
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,800
 - It's any GM, stuck on G.

643
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,320
 - Okay.

644
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,520
 - So yeah, and they would do it by they'd make signs

645
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,240
 saying Burgaults, and then they'd lean them against fences.

646
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,480
 And then they'd like walk up a hill

647
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,800
 or walk 500 meters away.

648
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,840
 And then they'd see how clear they could see them

649
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,600
 compared to our normal signposts.

650
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,240
 And in this manner, they've convinced American Outer

651
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,960
 change all of its road sign fonts.

652
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
 And they did that in 2004.

653
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,680
 - But there's a lot of controversy about this.

654
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
 - Yeah.

655
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,200
 - So the original American font on all American roads

656
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,680
 was called Highway Gothic.

657
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,400
 That was the name, which is pretty cool.

658
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640
 And then their font is called Clearview.

659
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,480
 - Yeah.

660
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,560
 - And there were all these studies saying

661
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,720
 it was much clearer to read, Clearview.

662
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,760
 And you could see it, if you were driving at night,

663
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,480
 and you saw a sign that was in Clearview,

664
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,520
 you could read it 74 feet further away than Highway Gothic.

665
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,360
 - Wow.

666
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,280
 - So that gives you a couple more seconds,

667
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,800
 let's say, of reaction time.

668
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,280
 So it will stop you having a crash, perhaps.

669
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,320
 And that could actually save lives.

670
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,360
 More or fewer people could die on the roads,

671
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,640
 depending on whether you choose Clearview or Highway Gothic.

672
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,880
 But there have now been more studies

673
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,640
 saying that Highway Gothic is better.

674
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,480
 So Clearview has just had its approval removed.

675
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,600
 I think this year is, and it's approval put on hold.

676
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,920
 - The Highway Gothic factions have come out.

677
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,760
 - Right.

678
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,000
 - They've been it down.

679
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,960
 But it's all in caps lock Highway Gothic.

680
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,360
 So with America, they have all their signs and capitals,

681
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,040
 which is terrible for signage.

682
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,040
 Because capitals, you can't distinguish shapes.

683
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,840
 It just looks like one big rectangle.

684
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,560
 So when you're far away, you can't tell as much.

685
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,080
 Whereas on our signs here,

686
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,560
 then you see the little tails of the G or the Y

687
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,760
 or the other tailed letters.

688
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,400
 You all know what they are.

689
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,480
 (all laughing)

690
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,040
 - G, Y, P. - P.

691
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,120
 - P is another good one and a cue, of course.

692
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,920
 - What was that?

693
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,760
 - J. - J. - J.

694
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,280
 - J. - J. - J.

695
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,560
 - Anyway. - Maybe we should take this.

696
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,360
 - No, no, I think we're on the brink of something.

697
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,600
 - No, it's alright.

698
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,880
 - Oh, I found out, in fact, mice make sign posts

699
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,240
 in their fields, and they make them out of leaves and twigs

700
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,200
 so they don't get lost.

701
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,520
 - Oh. - Who the?

702
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,920
 - What font are they using?

703
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,040
 And as a capstock.

704
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,200
 (all laughing)

705
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,960
 - This is wood mice.

706
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,600
 They move objects, like a leaf or a twig,

707
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,480
 to mark a side that interests them.

708
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,880
 And they regularly, when they're exploring around it,

709
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,600
 they rear up on their hind legs and they look

710
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,200
 to make sure they can still see their little street sign

711
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,920
 before they explore.

712
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,080
 - Oh, wow.

713
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,720
 One place which has problems with losing signs

714
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,600
 is fin glass in North Dublin.

715
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,480
 And that is because that is where Bono was born.

716
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,720
 And so a lot of you two fans go and steal the road sign

717
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,000
 from his road.

718
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,360
 So literally, the streets have no name.

719
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,960
 (all laughing)

720
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,120
 It doesn't sound, it sounds like I've made it all up

721
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,280
 just for the puns like that.

722
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,480
 - No, it really is true.

723
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,640
 - It really is true.

724
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,800
 - We're first designed for cyclist road signs

725
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,760
 in the 19th century to warning road signs.

726
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,640
 But I want to test you guys because there was a study

727
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,240
 done recently that showed that most people

728
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,760
 can't identify most road signs now.

729
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,360
 And even, actually this is gonna be hard

730
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
 'cause you probably read it.

731
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,760
 But there are three basic shapes.

732
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,600
 - I know one.

733
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,040
 - So the circle where it's like a red circle

734
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,120
 with a white band in the middle of it.

735
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,960
 - Yeah.

736
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,440
 - That means shot cut.

737
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,160
 (all laughing)

738
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
 - So three types of road signs,

739
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,440
 there's a circle, the triangle and the rectangle.

740
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,280
 - Oh yeah.

741
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,480
 - Does anyone know the difference between

742
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,000
 what those things mean?

743
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,200
 - Is it the circle, was it circle, triangle,

744
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,280
 and triangle's running?

745
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,600
 - Yeah, and circle is--

746
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,840
 - Circle is bad.

747
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,360
 - Through this now, whatever it says,

748
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,960
 you must bloody well do it.

749
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,080
 And then the square is, there's a nice castle over there.

750
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,120
 - Right, yeah.

751
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,400
 - Okay, that's sort of, one is very wrong.

752
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,160
 So I hope you're joking.

753
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,360
 The circle is absolutely, don't do it.

754
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,200
 Please don't.

755
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,640
 But there are people don't understand this.

756
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,760
 Anything in a red circle means

757
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,640
 this is bad, but I think it doesn't have a cross through it.

758
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
 No one realizes.

759
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,320
 So there was this survey done that said,

760
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,360
 what does this I mean that has a red circle?

761
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,640
 And it shows, it's known as the low flying motorbike sign,

762
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,120
 I think, because it shows a car.

763
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,680
 And then on top of it, a little motorbike.

764
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,120
 - So that means no vehicles.

765
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,640
 - It means no vehicles.

766
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,280
 Most people who did this survey said,

767
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,600
 well, it means only cars and motorbikes are allowed.

768
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,040
 (all laughing)

769
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,480
 - People have no idea.

770
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,200
 - That's the problem in Italy.

771
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,640
 There's a town that has started,

772
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,200
 they have a big problem in this one town

773
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,560
 where there's a lot of prostitutes on the side of the road

774
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,320
 and they're trying to not encourage people to stop

775
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,200
 and do business with them.

776
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,240
 So they created signs, again, with a pictogram

777
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,160
 on it of what was a prostitute.

778
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,880
 And it says underneath it, prostitutes.

779
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,320
 But most people didn't know if it was sort of saying,

780
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,160
 oh no.

781
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,160
 (all laughing)

782
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,880
 They actually increased traffic

783
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,000
 because most people were slowing down.

784
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,480
 (all laughing)

785
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,080
 (upbeat music)

786
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,480
 (upbeat music)

787
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,480
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

788
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,840
 And that is Andy.

789
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,400
 - My fact is that flies like to date

790
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,560
 the same sort of flies as their fly friends.

791
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,880
 (all laughing)

792
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,400
 - I don't even know where to start with that.

793
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,240
 - Yeah.

794
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,320
 - Do you mean fly friends?

795
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,520
 Are they really cool friends?

796
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,400
 - No, I just mean the friends who are flies.

797
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,240
 - All right.

798
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,680
 - So this is really cool.

799
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,480
 It's all about how flies choose which other flies to court.

800
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,840
 So scientists, they painted a load of male fruit flies

801
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
 different colors, okay?

802
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,240
 They painted some pink and some green.

803
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,600
 And they set up a date between one female

804
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,920
 and the two males, one pink and one green.

805
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,800
 And then behind some glass,

806
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,640
 they had another female fly watching this date.

807
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,680
 - This sounds like a channel five show this year.

808
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,880
 (all laughing)

809
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,960
 - And so the female inside chose one of the males.

810
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,280
 She chose pink or green to make with.

811
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,760
 And then the observer female flies

812
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,520
 who been watching this whole ring roll

813
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,320
 were given the chance a day later,

814
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,360
 which is quite a long time in fly years.

815
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,480
 That's like three years later,

816
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,560
 they get the chance for a date of their own.

817
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,400
 And when they were given the chance,

818
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,280
 they almost always picked the color

819
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,200
 that the female before had chosen.

820
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,280
 So they remembered this.

821
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,800
 And even when they were presented with two male flies

822
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,520
 that were apparently hideous.

823
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,040
 - Yeah, I mean, 'cause they probably in real life

824
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,520
 don't see many flies painted pink and green, don't they?

825
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,640
 - Yeah, yeah. - So yeah, it's very strange.

826
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,560
 And so what does this tell us about flies?

827
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,400
 - I don't know.

828
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,240
 - I don't know.

829
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,480
 - Okay, well I thought you did, that's why I asked you.

830
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,640
 So the idea is that because the flies

831
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,400
 are passing on behavioral traits between each other,

832
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,520
 they might have some kind of culture.

833
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,280
 As in, a culture is where someone does something

834
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,960
 and then they kind of talk everyone else

835
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,520
 into doing it and then you become a kind of,

836
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,480
 everyone goes to Glastonbury.

837
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,680
 - Right, they then got female observers again

838
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,880
 behind the glass to watch a fly orgy

839
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,120
 between lots of males and lots of females.

840
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,160
 - These flies really lucked out, didn't they?

841
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,520
 They must have been bragging to their friends.

842
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,360
 I've been involved in this study.

843
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
 You have no idea.

844
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,080
 I never need to pay for porn again.

845
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,280
 - Just an interesting thing about fly sex

846
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,080
 because if they're having this big orgy,

847
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,800
 the problem is, is flies have sex while they're flying.

848
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,440
 So they flies, certain flies have a special kind

849
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,360
 of genitalia gonads that just have to just move around

850
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,760
 to wherever the female fly is flying.

851
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,600
 - Wow.

852
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,480
 - Yeah, so if she banks left and he's like,

853
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,840
 "Well, I've got to go, his gonads can go."

854
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,200
 And just I can go from anywhere from 90 to 360 degrees

855
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,800
 just around to just be making sure

856
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,880
 that the sex continues while all this very, you know,

857
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,600
 flying stuff is going on.

858
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,680
 And that's very cool, 'cause it's hard to seduce the woman

859
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,760
 as a male fruit fly, this is, that you're talking about.

860
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,480
 But they sing songs, so the males chase the females

861
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,840
 and then they will extend just one wing,

862
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,680
 so they'll put one arm out and they vibrate it,

863
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,080
 and it produces a song.

864
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
 And the song has two modes.

865
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
 So there's just like two types of sound they can make.

866
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,040
 And you have to amplify it by more than a million times

867
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,800
 to hear it with human ears, but we've done that,

868
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,280
 obviously because scientists are bored.

869
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,280
 So they've got the sign and the pulse and the sign sounds like

870
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,760
 the wine of an approaching mosquito apparently.

871
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,720
 And then the pulse sounds like a cat's per.

872
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,920
 So if you're being seduced by a fly,

873
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,160
 it's a combination of a buzzing mosquito and a purring cat.

874
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,200
 - But then once the male, once the female has accepted the male,

875
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,080
 the male licks the female for two minutes

876
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,000
 and then they mate for about 20 minutes.

877
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,640
 And that's some scientists who I think were really bored.

878
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,800
 They scrambled a fruit fly's courtship neurons in its brain

879
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,960
 so that they tried to copulate, lick and play the love song

880
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
 all at the same time.

881
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,200
 (laughing)

882
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,680
 And what would normally take for a four minute

883
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,880
 quite delicate mating process was reduced to 10 seconds.

884
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,200
 (laughing)

885
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,240
 - And we'll all be in there.

886
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,640
 (laughing)

887
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,640
 - Who's your green friend?

888
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,920
 (laughing)

889
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:17,280
 - They have the only known aphrodisiac,

890
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,120
 fruit flies.

891
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,520
 - Oh, like a proven one, you mean?

892
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,320
 - A proven one, fly agra.

893
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,440
 (laughing)

894
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,760
 (cheering)

895
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,360
 And now they've got their PR guy, which is good.

896
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,960
 He's gonna need a job after tonight.

897
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,640
 They have the only aphrodisiac the scientists have ever proved

898
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,800
 exists is that actually makes you want to have sex,

899
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,200
 only works on fruit flies.

900
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,000
 And it's the scent of rotting fruit.

901
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,440
 So if they smell rotting fruit,

902
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,120
 that actually turns on their brain pathways

903
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,760
 that are the courtship initiating.

904
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,480
 So they send rotting fruit,

905
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,160
 and they immediately want to have a shag.

906
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,280
 And that is useful, I think, because rotting fruit

907
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,160
 is a good place to lay eggs as a woman.

908
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,440
 So if a man fancies you when you're near rotting fruit,

909
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,320
 that's handy, 'cause then you can put your baby's in fruit.

910
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,000
 - Speaking of the chemicals,

911
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,240
 if you have a fly that falls into your glass of wine,

912
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,800
 one single fly is enough to ruin the whole glass of wine.

913
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,600
 Okay, but only if it's a female fly.

914
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,520
 And it's because it's the pheromones in the fly

915
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,360
 that cause the wine to taste a bit skunky.

916
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,840
 If the males go in, actually, it will still taste the same.

917
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,160
 And they tested this by getting the pheromones out of the flies

918
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,440
 and then putting it into some wine

919
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,960
 and getting people to taste it.

920
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,960
 And they found that just one nanogram of a pheromone

921
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,320
 was enough for a small glass of wine

922
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,880
 for them to be able to taste the difference with one nanogram,

923
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,920
 which is like, I don't know, I think it's like

924
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,560
 a thousandth of a millionth of a gram or something like that.

925
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,800
 - In a small glass of wine.

926
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,640
 - In a small glass of wine.

927
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,480
 - Sorry, hang on.

928
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,920
 - And at a small glass of wine,

929
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,560
 it's the thing that's going on.

930
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,880
 - It's what you've got left.

931
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,320
 - Mine's become small.

932
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,160
 It always goes through the small phase.

933
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,280
 - So I worked out what the equivalent of this is.

934
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,920
 And it's worth, it's the equivalent

935
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,800
 of putting one petal bin's worth of ribina into lockness.

936
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,400
 And the whole lake tasting of black curd.

937
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,240
 - Wow.

938
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,080
 - That's great.

939
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,440
 - There must be wine snobs who are tasting

940
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,680
 that one tiny nanogram of female pheromone.

941
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,560
 I think it has to the flavour of anything.

942
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,720
 I stirred flies into this before I came on.

943
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,480
 - There was a study on flies response

944
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,400
 to carbonated beverages and their attraction

945
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,640
 to carbon dioxide.

946
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,440
 And the sky report about it was headlined.

947
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,960
 "Why do flies suddenly appear every time you open a beer?"

948
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,800
 (laughing)

949
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,640
 That's nice.

950
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,000
 - We're gonna have to wrap up soon.

951
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,040
 So before we do, you guys got?

952
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,120
 - I can tell you about Dung Beetle Sex.

953
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,200
 - Yeah, please.

954
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
 - Ooh.

955
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,280
 - That is an unbelievably niche porn subject.

956
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,040
 (laughing)

957
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,880
 - What do they do?

958
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
 - You need to delete your history immediately,

959
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
 whoever that was.

960
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
 (laughing)

961
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,640
 Now what's interesting about them is that they get STDs,

962
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,480
 but actually it's a good thing for them.

963
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,760
 If you're a Dung Beetle and you get an STD,

964
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,360
 this is really good for you

965
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,600
 because they get this kind of nematode worm

966
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,920
 and it helps to get the right kind of bacteria.

967
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,240
 It eats all the bad bacteria in their body,

968
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,520
 which means a good bacteria can come in

969
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,040
 and it means that then they can eat their food properly.

970
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,680
 It's like if you have sex with someone

971
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,280
 and feed them yackels at the same time.

972
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,120
 - Wow.

973
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,400
 (laughing)

974
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,920
 - Another niche kind of porn reference.

975
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,120
 (laughing)

976
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,760
 - With that bit of advice, so let's wrap it up again.

977
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,000
 Okay, that is it.

978
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
 That is all of our facts.

979
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,760
