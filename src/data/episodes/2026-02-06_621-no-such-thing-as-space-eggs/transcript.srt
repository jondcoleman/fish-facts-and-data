00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,440
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish, where we were joined by a

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,280
 very, very good friend, Leven Scera. Now, regular listeners of No Such Things A Fish will be well

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,400
 aware of Leven. He has been on our show many, many times. He is always absolutely brilliant,

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,160
 and we always love it when he comes over from Belgium and tells us all his amazing facts about

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,440
 science. Now, if you would like to learn more about a particular kind of science, AI, then do I

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,840
 have good news for you? Because Leven is coming over in March to do a live tour across the UK,

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
 North, South, East, West. He's coming along and he will be telling you all about AI. Would you

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,880
 believe it's more complicated than just getting a program on your computer and asking it questions

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,000
 and getting the questions wrong? There is more to it and we're better to learn about it than with

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,960
 Leven Scera, the man sometimes called the Stephen Fry of Belgium. I know that quite a lot of companies

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,000
 are snapping up tickets because they want their employees to learn all about AI and Leven is

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,640
 such a good science communicator. Definitely, it is a place to go if you want to learn about

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,520
 that subject and have a laugh along the way. If you want to know more about that, then go to

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,440
 levenscera.com. Probably you can't spell that if you're British, so he has also bought the domain

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,480
 leaving Shire, like what a hobby it might do. Perhaps leaving Shire.com, if you type that into your

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,280
 address bar, you will get his website and you'll be able to get tickets. If you want to learn more

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,600
 about noses, it's things of fish. Then a good place to go at the moment is patreon.com/nosesthingsofish,

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,720
 where you can join any one of our three tiers, the lowest of which four pounds a month will get you

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,160
 dual droppers of line. Have you ever listened to the show and thought, "Those guys have got something

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,680
 wrong?" Well, if you have, then other people have thought that as well and they have sent us emails

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,880
 and Andy goes through them and picks out the very best and he quizzes us about them. It's not

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,680
 just things we got wrong, it's also people with extra material because there are so many experts

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,040
 listening to our show, so it's a really good place if you've enjoyed the previous episodes to learn

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,520
 a little bit more about those subjects. Patreon's also got a free tier. There's a little bit on there,

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,720
 I think, if you sign up to nosesthingsofish on the free tier, but it's also a place where we will

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,440
 announce new things as and when they happen and I could tell you a lot is cooking up and nosesthingsofish HQ.

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,360
 So if you want to learn more, go to patreon.com/nosesuchthing as a fish. Anyway, really hope you enjoy this

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
 week show with Leverna Schiller on with the podcast.

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:03:03,040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

31
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,120
 from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

32
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,480
 James Harkin, and Leven Scherah. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,480
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go. Starting with

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,760
 fact number one, and that is James. Okay, my fat this week is that when the father of supercomputing

35
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,800
 Seymour Kray got stuck on a problem, he would go into tunnels, he built under his house and speak to elves.

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:43,200
 My kind of guy. Yeah, so this is a guy called Seymour Kray. He built some of the first supercomputers,

37
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,040
 and according to one of his colleagues, who's John Role Wagon, Kray said that when he got stuck

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,600
 on a problem, he'd go under there and the elves come with the solutions to his problems. Why

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,960
 certainly true is that he was brilliant at sort of getting a computer problem, going away, just

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,280
 thinking about it and then getting the answer. Yeah, so it's an interesting story because it's sort of,

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,560
 he had such weird myths about him. Did he really talk to elves? Was he messing with his friend?

42
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,040
 There was a story that he built his own boat, and at the end of every year, he would burn the boat,

43
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,200
 and then he would build a new boat the next year because he loved building things and he loved

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,560
 creating a new thing on the blank page. I heard that he burned a boat just because he'd built a new one,

45
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,280
 and he didn't want to pay the tax on two boats. Unclared. Well, a lot of people think that he did

46
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,440
 do that once, and then it became the myth that he did it once a year, but he did like his thinking time.

47
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,120
 Yeah, have you come across this guy, Lever? No, I haven't. Some supercomputers have a great history,

48
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
 you know, that he was Air Force once built the supercomputer out of PlayStation Trees.

49
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,920
 No. The Condor console. Really? Yeah. They bought two million dollars of PlayStation Trees.

50
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,600
 Wow. They took out the computer chip. What were they trying to play? Analyzing satellite images.

51
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,920
 Cool. And the thing, I've not, I've not played that game. It sounds good. It sounds right up

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,680
 your street in Paris, Andy. Well, once flight simulator has been knocked on the head,

53
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,920
 you need 1,760 PS3s to to build a supercomputer. The reason they did it was that it saved them eight

54
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,040
 million dollars, but they weren't using the PlayStation itself. They were extracting a chip from it,

55
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,720
 did you say? I think they used most of the hardware. You could run Linux on it back in the day.

56
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,200
 So you're in the Russian military and your secrets are cracked by 1,700 PS3s. But so what is a

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,000
 supercomputer then? Because that's a collection of PlayStation. Does that count as a supercomputer? I think

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,200
 there's no like official definition of them. But it's a term that I think was coined to make the

59
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,480
 difference with the mainstream computing power of that time and that changes constantly.

60
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,440
 Now, the PS3 supercomputer was in the top 50 of computing power at that time, 2010. So it did

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,440
 qualify as a supercomputer. And this guy, Seymour Cray, his computers were super because he basically

62
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,160
 was one of the first people to use transistors. So a transistor is like an electrical switch.

63
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,920
 You know, a computer goes with zeros and one is your transistor. We'll tell you if it's a zero

64
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,000
 or a one because it switches one way or the other. Before that, they used vacuum tubes so like light bulbs

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,160
 almost. And whether the light bulb was on or whether it was off, that would be your zero or one.

66
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
 And that's how they work out all the logical things they had to work out. So he could suddenly make

67
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,520
 things much, much smaller. The fastest supercomputer right now. What can it do in the space of a second?

68
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,800
 So the fastest supercomputer I think at the moment is called El Capitan at the Lawrence Livermore

69
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,120
 National Laboratory. And let's say, Dan, you were to do a coin flip against everyone in Japan.

70
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,640
 Yeah. Okay. As you do. As I've been trying to do for many decades now. You'll get a yes from

71
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,360
 a commissioner one day. It's a great fun idea. And then once you've done, then Leven does the same

72
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,160
 against everyone in Japan. Yeah. And then Andy does. Then I do. And then everyone in the world

73
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,920
 does a coin flip against every single person in Japan. This El Capitan would be able to manage

74
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,600
 all those results in a single second, which is not a long TV show. I can see why AI is ruining the

75
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:18,080
 arts. Japan against the world. It's petaflop time. But I like this word petaflop. So flop is a floating

76
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,480
 floating point operations or an additional or a multiplication. And then petta comes after

77
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:33,200
 tera, I think mega giga X is after petaflop. X is even bigger. So we've got a new supercomputer in the UK.

78
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:41,040
 It opened up last summer. It's in Bristol. It's called Ismbard AI. And it's going to be used.

79
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,120
 The Guardian report of various things is going to be useful. Improving skin cancer detection rates.

80
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,560
 Right. Really good. Predicting crowd movements. And maybe if there's going to be an accident on

81
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,760
 a construction site, you know, it can sort of like a brick starts falling. It can work out where

82
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,520
 it's going to land. Exactly. I mean, or maybe even more useful than that. And also how to spot sick

83
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,160
 dairy cows in Somerset. That's good. And there are a lot of dairy cows in Somerset. And if they get

84
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,520
 if they're getting early signs of mistitis, that's a real pain for them. You know what? I went on to

85
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,280
 Google News last week. Yeah. And I searched for super computer. And these headlines were all on

86
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,800
 the first page. Super computer tips Morocco to win 2025 African nation's trophy. Super computer

87
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,000
 reveals who's had the easiest ties in the FA Cup. Super computer predicts man United finishes.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,360
 Michael Carrick takes over. Super computer delivers leech United versus bollum prediction.

89
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,320
 And super computer predicts where FA Cup journey will end for Mansfield Town. I can see who's

90
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,800
 funding the research. Yeah. And so that we're using city's worth of war for an electricity to come

91
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,880
 out with his vital stuff about Mansfield Town. It's not so weird. But what I think is happening

92
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,800
 is a normal computer is doing these calculations in a journalist office somewhere. And they're just

93
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,280
 thinking, let's call out a super computer. I assume that's what's happening, right? Yeah. It's

94
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,680
 not a protected term, is it? I don't think so. I don't think it is. Super in front of everything.

95
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,360
 I feel like Seymour Craze was the first properly called a super computer. Right. I think I just

96
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,640
 won last fact on him. So Dan, you said he had this intense focus. He would spend days in complete

97
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,040
 seclusion, maybe in the tunnels under his house. There are stories also that he was very afraid about

98
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,920
 nuclear war. So he dug, he was digging sort of bombshell or having bombshells as dug under his

99
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,640
 home. I don't know how true that is. But apparently he would often on family car journeys

100
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,800
 demand complete silence. So he could think for the entire duration of the journey. I mean,

101
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,080
 the dream. So, but wait a minute, Charlie, the kids are watching Frozen in the back.

102
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,400
 Have they watched that on mute? They're not allowed to watch anything.

103
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,120
 What? Family have to stay silent because dad is driving and thinking. They're watching a great man

104
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,560
 think. What more entertainment can you have? Let it go is nothing compared to Seymour Craze.

105
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,280
 Have a better idea. Pay to watch Seymour Craze think from the back of a car. I don't care how the

106
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,520
 wheels are the fucking bus going. I need to work on how many pizza flops in this computer.

107
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,360
 Or you will not have the iPad by 2010 to watch your shows on mute.

108
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,040
 Yes, exactly. And then when everybody else is science, you still have the elves bubbling in

109
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,160
 your ear of course. Shut up, Elf. Can I tell you a man thing about where super computers are going

110
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,960
 to go next? Oh, yes, please. Have a guess. League 2. That's our results.

111
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,640
 Where it's going to go next? Space. Quantum computing? Oh, computer's in space.

112
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,600
 It's going to go up there. It is. Yeah, for the cooling and the cold.

113
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
 China are trying to get what lots of people are trying to get a super computer in space.

114
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,880
 Everyone wants it to be in orbit. Bees awesome, all sorts of people.

115
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,120
 Basically, the theory is on the ground, all the computing power uses lots of energy and lots of

116
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,320
 water for the cooling and things like this. Up there, it's solar power. We have solar power down here,

117
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,840
 but solar and cooling requirements are not nearly as big. Well, solar power is 24 hours if you choose

118
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:08,240
 the right orbit. So you don't have nights. Cooling is a strange thing because it is very cold,

119
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,320
 but also there is very little materials. You're kind of in a vacuum. It's like you can't sweat.

120
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,440
 Yeah, so the ISS has this big gray things that some people think there are solar panels,

121
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,600
 but they're actually the only way to cool the ISS is by radiation, like radiate the power off,

122
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,200
 and these things are to radiate the power. So you need some sort of cooling in space too.

123
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,480
 But it's a different way than liquid cooling that we do here. Could we cook something with

124
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,160
 radiation in space and then that comes back to Earth? I guess so. Yeah. I've just had an idea

125
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,320
 that's all I'm just going to write a beasel after this. But why? Andrew, space sausage. I'm thinking

126
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:56,240
 space sausage. What when space eggs is straight there? Space eggs. Oh my god. I don't want to deal with

127
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:05,040
 masks. Space sausage. You send the satellite up surrounded by a thick layer of meat, right? It's

128
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,800
 like a Scotch egg. Don't Scotch egg as well. And as it cooks, it drops off and comes back to Earth.

129
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,600
 When it's cooked, how does it not burn on reentry? Oh, we'd have we'll salt this down the line.

130
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:25,440
 I'm asking for $100 million. Just bad news. Just quickly on Seymour Cray, he was born and eventually

131
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,880
 set up his offices in a place called Chippewa Falls in Wisconsin. Oh yeah. I tried to see if there

132
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,720
 had any other impact on the world, Chippewa Falls as well. So two I could find a lady called

133
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,120
 Judith Ann Hensk, who was a singer in America, was the original singer of a song that's had a bit

134
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,160
 of an influence on the world because the song was called High Flying Bird. Oh, and Nol Gallagher's

135
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,240
 band is named after it. Nol Gallagher's band is named after that. So yeah, huge influence on

136
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,120
 the world there. That's one. The second one is it's going to be better. I don't think I'd stop that.

137
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,480
 I don't think you're going to cap. Get ready. Go on. It is the hometown of Jack Dawson,

138
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,000
 who sadly died on the Titanic in the movie Titanic. What? Leonardo DiCaprio's character is called

139
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,040
 Jack Dawson. Okay. Okay. So there's a scene in the movie where Kate Winslet is standing on the front

140
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,840
 and she's about to jump off and he talks her out of it and he talks about the time when he was

141
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,560
 standing on a frozen lake in Chippewa Falls, his hometown and how it cracked and how cold it was when

142
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,800
 he went under and so on. And so that's the other main thing that they're known for except the lake

143
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 wasn't there until after the sinking of the Titanic. So it's a goof. There's a new lake. Yeah,

144
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,400
 it's sort of a man-made lake in Chippewa Falls and it wasn't made until 1917. Gosh. Now James Cameron did

145
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,360
 the whole thing where he changed the literal sky to put the stars in the right place when he redid

146
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,600
 the Titanic movie because he got it wrong. Neil the Grass Tyson complained about it. Yeah. Neil

147
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,400
 the Grass Tyson was watching the movie and at one point said the sky is wrong. I think Neil the Grass

148
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,640
 Tyson needs to get his priorities right with the complaining. Well Cameron changed it. He redid it

149
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,400
 for the anniversary release and he hasn't changed this. He's going to have to go back now and do it

150
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,480
 all over again. Wow. Yeah. You think you have the same authority as Neil the Grass Tyson when it

151
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,920
 comes to James Cameron's ear. Hundy P. Hundy P. Of course. Yeah. He'll probably just hand back all the

152
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,160
 money. I'm going to stop making Avatar 9 and I'm just going to focus the whole time on time

153
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,200
 traveling this lake back in time. That'll be his solution. Avatar by the way, which is 100%

154
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,920
 scientifically accurate on my show, right? Yeah, exactly. I haven't seen what the modern

155
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,200
 computers look like, the supercomputers, but aesthetically they were really beautiful the original

156
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,520
 Cray supercomputers. So Seymour Cray's Cray 1 was a sort of tall cylinder in the middle. Oh,

157
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,120
 that's right. And then it had sort of like leather seating around the bottom that you could

158
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,040
 genuinely sit on and it was because the cooling system that it needed was underneath and it just

159
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,280
 was a thing that was part of the design. Was it heated seats? Yeah, super heated seats. Yeah,

160
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,480
 he's getting referenced as love seats and there's a few suggestions that people would sleep on it.

161
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:19,280
 Not for 60s. Yeah, but is that a big cylindrical supercomputer in Japan? I'm afraid it's an exafop.

162
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:33,600
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Lieben. My fact is that a crane is called a crane

163
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,680
 because it looks like a crane. Any question? Yes. It's crane is wet. Aha. The crane, the machine

164
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:49,040
 is named after the crane the bird. And what does this have to do with Seymour Cray? Nothing yet.

165
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,680
 I'll ask the elves. Yeah. Medieval cranes looked like the birds. Have you seen a medieval crane

166
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,800
 on paintings? Only through the process of researching this, yeah. Oh yeah, before nine. Yeah,

167
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:08,640
 so a medieval crane would be a wooden building in a way. And it had these two, what do you call them,

168
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,280
 where the hamster would want to round them? Tread mills. Yeah, treadmills. So it had two big

169
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:20,160
 treadmills at the site and people would walk into treadmills to make the rope move. And then from

170
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,240
 these two large treadmills, there was kind of a wooden building diagonally going up like 10,

171
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,840
 15 meters. And then from the top, there would be a small piece going diagonally down again,

172
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,040
 where the rope would come out. And they would use this in harbours to take loads out of it.

173
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,640
 And these old medieval cranes, they look a lot like a crane, the bird standing in a field.

174
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,200
 And so that's why they were called cranes. So cool. They're very beautiful. I had not seen one

175
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:54,080
 of these before. These tread wheel cranes. And they're mad. I think there's a place where they're

176
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,480
 trying to build a castle authentically in France. And they're using one or two of these actual

177
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,680
 things. And Tom Scott, who's built this show, has made a video where he goes and like operates this

178
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,560
 crane. It's crazy. And they were used for like quite famous things like column cathedral. So much.

179
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,880
 Salisbury Cathedral. And it turns out that if you have enough people and enough time as well,

180
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,640
 because it moves slowly. But you can basically lift many, many, many tons in weight just by someone

181
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,880
 walking around. If you have the right gears. Yeah. If you have the right gears, then you can,

182
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,080
 you can certainly do it. Could you like ratchet it and then use it as a catapult or something?

183
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,480
 A trebuchet. I don't know. I don't know if, because then you need a lot of torque in there. And

184
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,040
 maybe the wood wouldn't, because I was thinking for Andy's meat in space business. Yes. That's how we'll

185
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,400
 get it back down. That's a good idea. Is that how you're lobbing it up? That's how I was lobbing it up.

186
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,000
 Oh, sorry. Okay. Can I get the sausage up there, mate? Is there that slang expression? I'm not

187
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,480
 familiar with it. Very, very normal expression here. I'll be okay. But your sausage hot, mate.

188
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,160
 There was a Roman one called a polyspaston, which could lift 3,000 kilos per person walking

189
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,000
 in this line. I mean, the gearings are amazing. And then they were used in ancient Rome, and then

190
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,360
 they weren't used for many centuries, and then in medieval times they came back. But they were still

191
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,960
 being installed in London in the 1850s. Okay. Wow. I think there's one down in Guilford, actually.

192
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,560
 It's not in operation to that. It's a historical one. But there are a few that can still be found

193
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,080
 in the sellers of cathedrals, because they used to move up with the floors. So if you've built the

194
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,200
 first floor, you would disassemble the entire crane and build it again on the first floor.

195
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,120
 So you could work your way up there. And then when they were at the top and the church was finished,

196
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,760
 they would just store it in the seller. Like they wouldn't build it up again. But all the material

197
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,880
 would be there. That's very good. Do you know what the world's biggest crane is right now?

198
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,040
 Right now. Probably the bigger machine. We're talking machine still, I think.

199
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,560
 Yes, sure. So this is guessable. Absolutely not. Is it? What would you call it? What would you call it?

200
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,320
 Manath. Manath. Oh, I see. Master Don't. These are great names. It's called Big Karl.

201
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,560
 And it's named after Karl Sarans, who works. He's a director of Sarans Engineering,

202
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,240
 which is a Flemish family business. Oh, which what what's it called? Sarans.

203
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,840
 Absolutely. I see Sarans cranes all the time. There are family business. They started

204
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,320
 moving trees with horses and carts as you do. And now they're into the world's biggest cranes.

205
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,080
 Right. And I was reading a trade magazine with an interview with Karl and they said what's going

206
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,120
 on with the crane industry and he said the whole industry is picking up. Brilliant.

207
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,960
 Which I don't think he deliberately did as a joke. Doesn't translate in Dutch actually.

208
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,080
 That's it. Through the roof. It's so good. In these medieval cranes, we had these big treadmills

209
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:57,680
 and they used people to walk in there sometimes children. Actually, in Ghent, there's still a crane

210
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,520
 children street. Can't get in there. So they weren't like really small kids, but they were like

211
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:11,840
 teenagers and that were used. And they used animals. Dogs, for example. There's still pictures of

212
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,760
 dogs standing in these treadmills kind of sealed off of the world with a small wooden wall left

213
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,840
 and right. So in the morning, you would put your dog in a treadmill and it would just walk in

214
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,800
 and evening, you opened the door and it could come out. You've got to make sure to put the dog

215
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,640
 in the right way around. Otherwise, you get over the end of the day. It's disassembled half a

216
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:38,320
 cathedral. My man. Not again, fee fee. These ones that we used. You've heard of a capstan, maybe.

217
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,120
 That's the thing. You see them on board a ship for lifting various things. It's where you've

218
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,960
 got a pole vertically and there are four spars coming out of it on the ground and you have people

219
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,040
 pushing them around in a circle. Oh yeah. And that lifts something upwards. That was a big thing.

220
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:01,440
 In the, they were used a lot in the 15th, 16th century, especially to raise obelisks because Rome

221
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,200
 basically got a lot of obelisks from its territories in Egypt. So they were all in Stull. Stull?

222
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,080
 Yeah. Why am I worried about medieval Romans coming at me? Yeah, they were all sort of nicked.

223
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,360
 But basically to raise these, they would use cap stands with hundreds of men and horses involved

224
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,920
 pushing them around to lift them up. And I just love this detail. This comes by the way from

225
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,520
 Low Tech magazine. It's amazing. It's about the past and forgotten tech and how it can actually be

226
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,680
 very useful today. The website is solar powered. It runs off the author's home solar power system.

227
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,640
 Anyway, to raise this obelisk in the Vatican in 1586, it used 800 men, 140 horses,

228
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,720
 and the best details, spectators were ordered not to speak or make a noise on pain of death.

229
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,240
 Oh god. Because hundreds of people were watching this very delicate operation.

230
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,640
 Like watching Snooker. It's like watching Snooker. And it was apparently enforced.

231
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,000
 Seymour Cray was there. Will you shut up? Oh, I want to see more Cray.

232
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,640
 So was the reason because like often you can't make noise because there's someone

233
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,720
 drumming to make sure everyone goes in the right. It might have, it might well have been that.

234
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,120
 I don't know whether it was that or just like a mistake from distraction could have been

235
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,640
 fatal. You know, but yeah, sounds exciting. One last thing on Cray and Cray. In 2005.

236
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,120
 Well, for these things are Cray and Cray. Which one are we talking about? Mechanical Cray.

237
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,720
 This is just a crazy story. It happened in London, south London, 2005.

238
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:44,240
 15 year old girl was found on a crane at night 130 feet above the ground. Riddle me this.

239
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,560
 Well, sleepwalk is the obvious one. She was asleep. She's like, she'd sleepwalked up there and a passer-by

240
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,720
 had seen someone up there called the authorities and then a fireman went up, crawled out,

241
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,280
 found her there asleep. Didn't know how to wake her up because thought if I wake her up,

242
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:07,280
 she might panic. Where was she asleep? I seem to have a vague memory of the story that she was on

243
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,080
 the weight on the other side. It's not even like she was in the cabin bit. No, no, no. She was quite

244
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:23,120
 not that. Quite not. So it seems like he got her phone out of her pocket and called her parents

245
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,440
 from the phone and said, can you ring back so that I can so that that'll wake her up. How did he get

246
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 her log into her foot? Did he lift up her head and hold the camera in front of it? It's 2006.

247
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,760
 It was a simpler time. It was a simpler time. What if you still had codes on first, did you? Maybe.

248
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,600
 Well, anyway, it was all fine in the end. How do you navigate that opening sentence with the

249
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:54,800
 parents? Yes. I'm on a crane. A crane crane? Crambrees are named after cranes. Really?

250
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,560
 Crane berries, yeah. The organic crane. Lovely. Because the plant stamens look a bit like the

251
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,960
 beaks of cranes. Geraniums are named after cranes. Wow. From the Greek Geranus, meaning crane,

252
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,120
 because their seeds look like the crane bills. The Dutch word for geraniums is a stalk beak.

253
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:21,040
 Stored bill. That's quite similar to that. Pedigree, the word pedigree also comes from the word

254
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:28,800
 for crane, the Geranus. That's because the foot of a crane has bits that stick out. When you draw

255
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:36,160
 like a family tree, you have bits that stick out. Pediggeranus, foot of a crane. That's really nice.

256
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,800
 Oh, I love these etymology things that suddenly remove the blanket for something.

257
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:49,120
 I love it. That's great. The crane is called a crane because of the noise. They have their

258
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,480
 migratary birds that use the right amount of syllables. Yes, migratary birds. And so they fly over

259
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,960
 Belgium and Holland in huge groups, sometimes thousands of them. They're quite high up. They have

260
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,880
 have these long necks and then you can hear... they make this crane crane. And so if you want to finish

261
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,640
 the etymology the machine is named after the bird and the bird is named after the sound it makes.

262
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:21,440
 And in Belgium we also say crane to tap water tap faucet because they also have... well they used to

263
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,000
 have this vertical piece and then the horizontal piece like a pump. Cranes, Britain's tallest bird.

264
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,960
 What are we talking? Oh nine, ten, twelve feet. That big. Are they? Why have you put them on a hill?

265
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,240
 Yeah, four feet or something. One one we did twenty something. Yeah, that is four feet.

266
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,680
 But they're making a comeback across the UK which is very nice because they were

267
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:52,560
 hunted and eaten to extinction of the UK. Also drying out wetlands. A lot of that went on in

268
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,720
 the Middle Ages and that really damages the habitats. People at cranes, I've never heard of that

269
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,800
 people eating cranes. Apparently they're... I'm afraid to say they're absolutely delicious.

270
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,600
 Well they certainly were in the 14th century when the food was a bit less nice. But no,

271
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,760
 in 1465 there was a new archbishop of York and 204 cranes were roasted to celebrate the fact

272
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,800
 at the feast. Right. And then by 1600 miraculously they were extinct. But they're back,

273
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,200
 they're back and it's partly because of random pair got blown off course as you were saying

274
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,080
 leave and they're migratory. In 1979 they got blown off course they ended up in the Norfolk

275
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,520
 Broads. And now there are maybe a couple of hundred and lots more breeding pairs which is obviously

276
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,440
 the main thing. And there's a place in Suffolk where they are breeding. An RSPB site,

277
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,800
 Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. And to help them breed the staff have cut runways

278
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,720
 for them in the grasses, in the reeds just to help them take off and land safely. With the light

279
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,960
 and everything under control and the guy with the ping pong bats. We've got five cranes,

280
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,200
 got three or five faster. Look out you got a bump into a crane. What kind of crane? A crane crane.

281
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,000
 Small fact about the light-hearted topic of eating birds into extinction.

282
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:25,760
 I, this week, I personally ate the stalk into extinction. No, I held with my hands the very last

283
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:34,640
 great ock that ever walked on this earth. Really? It was strangled in 1844 on L.A., an island in Iceland.

284
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:43,440
 And so great orcs got really rare because they can't fly so people used to eat them. And back then,

285
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,520
 like 19th century, if an animal became really rare, it became super expensive because all the

286
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,920
 collectioners wanted one. It's amazing. I read an article about this where it's like it would

287
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,320
 become well known that there was an animal that they were about to go extinct. And what people thought

288
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,440
 was not shall we save them. They were like, this is our last chance to catch one. And so these

289
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,920
 Icelandic sailors could make a nice buck out of strength. You have to strangle them because

290
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:16,960
 all the ways you damaged the meat in the skin. So they know that the last great ock was killed on

291
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,080
 that island. The intestines were capped at Copenhagen and for a long time they didn't know where the

292
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,640
 skin ended up. And then they did genetic testing on the intestines and on all the 67 great orcs that

293
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,920
 are in museums and it's in Brussels. So they found out this is the very last great ock that ever lived.

294
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:42,800
 And it's now up there. It's in a place called, well, it's our national institute for natural

295
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:52,720
 science. They have a huge collection of taxidermy. They have one million mammals, birds, amphibians,

296
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,520
 reptiles. And then they have, I think, 30 million if you count all the insects with it.

297
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,080
 And they have this separate room for extinct species. That is extra secured because they are very

298
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:12,880
 valuable. I met one of the conservators there. And almost weekly, he makes the sad walk with a new

299
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,480
 species to the extinction. This is, I want to film this one day, this weekly walk of getting the

300
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,480
 phone call like, yeah, you know, that bird over there in that island. Well, extinct now put it in

301
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,160
 it, put it in the special room. And then you have to take an animal to the extinction room.

302
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,840
 That's so sad. It is. You got anything funny to end the section? No.

303
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:44,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is Andy. My question is, a single gram

304
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:54,000
 of silica gel has an area of 800 square meters. Okay, strap it everyone. This is so much fun.

305
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,480
 You're about to go on the right of your life, guys. There's a fantastic website called Scope of

306
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,720
 Work. It's really good. It's amazing essays about all sorts of stuff. You know, the silica

307
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,680
 gel, the little packets do not eat, right? They often come in one gram packets. And they're to dry

308
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,840
 things out, right? They're to dry things out. They'll be in your shoes when you buy them all. Exactly.

309
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,720
 Or a bit of furniture or whatever. And that stuff in there is silica gel. And the reason it's amazing

310
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,560
 at drying things out is that when you zoom in on it, it's not like glass, which is silicon,

311
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:35,040
 silicon dioxide. It's much less dense than glass. Silica gel is full of these tiny, tiny, tiny

312
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,720
 pores. So they're 2.5 nanometers across, which is the width of one strand of DNA.

313
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,600
 But these little balls of silica gel are so riddled with these voids, these holes everywhere,

314
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,440
 that one gram of it has an internal area of 800 square meters. So that's 4 tennis courts.

315
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,480
 They're absolutely amazing at taking on their own weight and water vapor, because it all condenses

316
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,760
 in their tiny capillaries. So that's why they're so effective. And when you're a, you know,

317
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,880
 shoemaker, for example, you're trying to say they will say silica gel sellers, how big do you

318
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,440
 want to keep dry? How big an area? How big a volume? And how dry do you want it to be? What's the

319
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,320
 maximum moisture you want inside the shoebox? Yes. And they can just gear it exactly because they know

320
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,120
 how much silica gel can absorb. It is pretty amazing. I mean, we all know these packs. We've all

321
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,360
 got them in various items that we've bought. The say do not eat on it turns out that's not because

322
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,400
 as everyone assumes that they're toxic, they're not toxic, they're delicious. They're like the

323
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,800
 grains. I remember when the Archbishop of Durham came on a few years ago, they had 200,000

324
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,280
 silica gel packets. So don't eat them, but it's largely for the packet, isn't it? To say,

325
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,480
 don't eat, it's a choking hazard. It's very fun. We have to say don't eat them, because obviously

326
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,080
 we're not recommending people eat silica gel, but it doesn't seem like actual. I don't think it

327
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:05,200
 would be any good for you, because it would absorb all the water, sorry, it would absorb all the water,

328
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,560
 because it doesn't absorb. Absorb is like a sponge. You get the water goes inside of it.

329
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,920
 Absorb means that it sticks to the outside of it. It's really weird. But the outside is on the inside,

330
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,360
 precisely. Of the silica gel. It's like a weird net thing. But anyway, so yeah, if I think if you

331
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,760
 did eat a few of them and you had swallowing problems already, I don't think it would be that good.

332
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,840
 Yeah, definitely. It's not like, you're not going to, people won't find an ancient Egyptian mummy.

333
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
 If you, if you, have accidentally swallowing a tiny bit of it, it's not like it dries you into your

334
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,800
 past. An amazing assassination method. Like the end of Indiana Jones. That's how they

335
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,560
 achieve that effect. All of these telluses have got a bit of silica gel in them apart from one.

336
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:54,000
 We should say that the only potential reason you should need them is that some of the beads

337
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,880
 might have a little moisture indicator, like which is to indicate when they change color, like

338
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,360
 color chloride, which could be dangerous if you ate enough of it. Yeah, don't just don't eat them.

339
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,360
 Don't eat them. It says don't eat them. It says don't eat them. Take your advice from the packet and

340
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,520
 I'll remind you that you'll be fine. But one thing you could do, which I don't, I see that I get

341
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,920
 scared. It's toxic, chuck it in the bin. Yes. Actually, collecting them is quite useful because they

342
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,000
 can be used that aren't to eat. Not to eat. No. Sorry, but we've covered some pretty nerdy

343
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,040
 collections. Surely there are collections. It's not for the sake. It's not like a stamp collection.

344
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,360
 It is for if you drop your phone in the toilet or the bath. Instead of putting it in rice,

345
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,240
 put it in a box full of these little packs and it's going to probably act better than the rice.

346
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,880
 So they have their they have their uses. Apparently they're great for defogging windshields as well.

347
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:53,200
 Just chuck your hundred silica packs you've saved. I've heard musty smells of books. Yep. It

348
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,200
 add dissolves all of the musty smell. Rust in toolboxes. If you've got like a slightly damp

349
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,800
 garage or something, just pop a bit of that in. Allegedly, if you have a big enough packet,

350
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,000
 you can deodorize your laundry. But why don't we collect them and use them to lower the sea levels

351
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,520
 again? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The thing with these numbers is that people have no idea of how small

352
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:23,680
 atoms are. Yeah. It's just crazy. We can't get our head around it. I used to have an example in

353
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:29,920
 my show on genetics. I talked about Julius Caesar, who bled to death. Let's say he lost one liter of

354
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,160
 blood. You take one glass of water like I have in front of me. What is the chance that I have a

355
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,400
 molecule in here and H2O molecule that literally exited a wound of Caesar as you bled to death?

356
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,960
 It's about 2000 in each glass of water. Wow. Well, you definitely have that in there. Yeah.

357
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,040
 That belongs to the museum, man. Yeah. Well, the thing is that there are a lot more H2O molecules in

358
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,680
 a glass of water than there are glasses of water on earth. But so how much of history is sitting in

359
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,400
 that glass right now that everything from the beginning of the planet. Dinosaur piss. Dinosaur piss.

360
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,600
 Oh, a lot of dinosaur piss. That's what I always, that's what I always tell the homeopats. Like

361
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,720
 diluted dinosaur piss. Yeah. But maybe it turns out that actually dinosaur piss is the secret

362
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,200
 panacea medicine. And they've been right all this time. Who knows? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know. I've

363
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,880
 been drinking Hitler piss. There's some Dalai Lama piss in there too and some Magandhi piss so it

364
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,840
 kind of evens out. Okay. Here's something you can do with silica gel. You can make opals out of it.

365
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:39,280
 So the cars or the stones? The stones. All the fruits. Yeah. Now the stones. Basically opal is made of

366
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,880
 silica. But it's dehydrated and it's compressed by nature. But you can make opals in the lab by getting

367
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,080
 a load of silica gel, putting it in water, leaving it for weeks and weeks and months and months until

368
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,920
 it all sinks down and stacks itself perfectly. And then you remove all of the water and it's in a

369
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,920
 perfect lattice. And that's how you make lab made opals. That's very cool. This is the same material,

370
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,680
 basically, in a different crystal structure. When you start zooming in enough like this,

371
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,400
 everything gets a bit weird. I find like this stuff. Silica gel was first created in the early 20th

372
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,160
 century by a researcher at Johns Hopkins University called Walter Patrick and he created it out of a

373
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:30,000
 material called water glass, which as far as I can tell is water soluble glass. Okay. That's not

374
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,120
 very useful. What is construction? Quite hard to have a glass. That just feels like sandy water,

375
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,520
 doesn't it? I think if you pour the, if you pour, if you have a glass of this stuff and you pour some

376
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,600
 water in, it dissolves, which is a good prank. There's nothing else. But I just, I find it so bizarre

377
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,360
 that this exists and there's an amazing 1930 paper, The Story of Silica Gel, which I've read too much

378
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,680
 of, is by the main silica gel making company, basically. And it begins. I just like, people really

379
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,920
 knew how to write science in the old days. Oh, so it wasn't very dry. Oh my god.

380
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:15,040
 Walk right into that. You said it up yourself. I know. I know. I left the rake out. The story of

381
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,520
 silica gel, just listen to the way this begins. All right. Someday, the true history of mankind will

382
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,640
 be written, a history that will treat not the struggle of man against man, but of the epic struggle

383
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,120
 of man against the forces of nature. One great force of nature is oxidation, the intimate union of

384
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,880
 oxygen and carbon producing combustion, combustion produces heat and primitive man. So this is about

385
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,680
 silica gel. It's great. Wonderful. It's so good. It's Lord of the Rings-style science. It really is,

386
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,120
 though, isn't it? Yeah. One of us uses way more silica gel than the others. Can you guess? Is it

387
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,240
 me because there's a K-pop band called silica gel? That's not the reason. But it is you. Oh, well,

388
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,240
 I think I know why. Go on. I think just through my research. Yeah. I think it's James because of his cat.

389
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:07,200
 Yes. Okay. Oh, that's how I dry her. But that in the rain. In there with the shoes now.

390
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:17,840
 Don't eat it. It's cat litter. Cat litter, cat litter. Yeah. I think we've been used it so world

391
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,880
 one after the invention by Walter Patrick, it was used in gas masks. Yeah. Yeah. Salt shakers

392
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,080
 used to use it in the cap. You would put little bits of it so that the salt wouldn't dry out. Clump up.

393
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,120
 Yeah. So it doesn't clump up because people would put bits of rice in there, right?

394
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,200
 But you would actually put little silica inside the top of salt cap. I'm going to put some in my coffee

395
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,880
 tin when I get home. Do not eat. I'm sorry. How many times do we have to tell you? But am I allowed to

396
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,920
 drink it? You sounded like a health and safety dog like there. Do not eat. I just imagine that you

397
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
 put it in your coffee and you pour the water in your coffee and all the water's gone.

398
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:04,480
 Three capsules in here. You can do that with the powder from diapers. It's a typical magic

399
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,440
 trick that you do in science shows. You take like three cups, like non-transparent cups, like

400
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,840
 paper cups. And in one of them, you put the powder that is inside a diaper, like a baby diaper.

401
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,440
 You put it like one or two centimeters at the bottom and then you pour water in all three of them.

402
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,680
 And if you take the one that had the powder, you can turn it around over your head and

403
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,360
 nothing will come out because it absorbs or add soaps. But it also sticks to the sides.

404
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:37,760
 It turns a little bit white or something and I've seen people use it as fake snow bastard.

405
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,160
 Really? Don't eat the yellows now though.

406
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:53,760
 I had one more thing about these one atom layers. Oh yeah. Like graphene. So graphene is

407
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,680
 stuff that is made of one layer of carbon atoms all in hexagonal shapes.

408
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:06,960
 It's the stuff that your pencil is made of. So you're writing with graphene. And the

409
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,960
 cheapest way that they made one layered graph, it's very difficult to make something of one atom thick.

410
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,120
 The cheapest way was with sticky tape. You just put sticky tape on a pencil and you rip it off

411
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,400
 and then you put sticky tape on the sticky tape and you rip it off again and you keep going

412
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,880
 until there's just one layer left. It's got a low tech way to make to make graphene.

413
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,760
 This is silly question. How do you get off the sticky tape? I do not know. I think you study it

414
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,200
 on the sticky tape. Oh okay, so there's not for production. No. No. Then you put electricity on it

415
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:45,760
 in there. Yeah. We've met Andre Geim. Yeah. Discovered it, I think. But he won a Nobel prize for

416
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:53,120
 it definitely and he also won an ignoble prize for levitating frogs. Yes. That's right. He was

417
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,600
 at his university and there was a giant magnet and he was walking past it one day. And I think

418
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:04,160
 on a whim, he chucked a ham sandwich and just to see if it would float and it did. So then he

419
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,600
 he misses how these people cut like putting a sausage in space, putting a ham sandwich in a magnet.

420
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,000
 You know, these ideas, they seem stupid at the time. We do the impossible. And then 30 years from now,

421
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,360
 we get the call from the Nobel committee and it's like, yeah, thought that would happen

422
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:28,240
 later. It was the egg Nobel prize. He won for that one. The Nobel prize. The guy who does the egg

423
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,880
 Nobel prize, it sounds incredibly serious. He's the opposite of the Swedish chef. My favorite

424
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,800
 ignoble prize is also has to do with surface was mathematics. I think it was 2002. Ignoble

425
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,080
 prize in mathematics for an Indian researcher who calculated the entire surface if you were to

426
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:53,360
 fold an Indian elephant open. Yeah. So what is the surface? What is the surface of an Indian

427
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,120
 elephant if you were to fold it open? What do you mean by that? Yeah. Fold it open. Like you're

428
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,960
 doing cut in half and then fold. I think I think fold all the surface area. So it's very wrinkled.

429
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:11,600
 Yeah. And it was really useful research because for especially vats when they had to dose

430
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,840
 medication for elephants, they had to measure the height of the elephant and it was very dangerous.

431
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,960
 Because they're moody creatures. People get killed by them. And he could calculate it from a footprint.

432
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,120
 So he could just let an elephant walk over some mud and then measure the area of the footprint

433
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,120
 and then he could say the entire surface area of the elephant is this. So the dosage of the

434
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,600
 medication is this and you don't have to get near it and get killed. Wow. Yeah. You know what they

435
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,920
 say about elephants with big feet? They're just big in general. Yeah. That's what they say. That's

436
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:54,080
 another saying here. You don't look like the sausage up there. Okay. It is time for our final

437
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,600
 fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the first female scientist to be

438
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:06,160
 celebrated with a marble bust at the Royal Society was never able to visit it because women weren't

439
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:13,200
 allowed in the building. Wow. This is kind of a nice story at the start because she's got a bust.

440
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,080
 Yes. And then it tells off quite a lot of the end that. Yeah. And this was a fact that was told to

441
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,360
 me directly by a particle accelerator physicist from Australia called Dr. Susie Shihi. It's

442
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,200
 SHWHWF. Anyone wants to look her up? She's really awesome. And she was saying it's really fascinating.

443
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,600
 This incredible scientist who was born 1780 called Mary Somerville was known as the Queen of

444
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,880
 Sciences in her time. She was such an influence that all the members of the society wanted to

445
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,160
 commemorate her with a bust in her own lifetime. And they did so. But because the rules of the

446
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,960
 society did not allow women into the building, she was never literally allowed to go and see it.

447
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,360
 Yeah. They could have flexed the rules. But they didn't. She said it's outrageous in hindsight.

448
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:02,480
 It's absolutely outrageous. We could have seen it. I think because in 1834 when she was still alive,

449
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,520
 there was a ship that was named after her called the Mary Somerville ship and the figurehead

450
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,680
 of that ship was copied from that bust. And not only for the ship, a lot of the leading scientists

451
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,600
 of the Royal Society loved it so much that they asked for a casting of it for their own home.

452
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,680
 So she could have gone to their houses as well. Again, these are just bad reasons not to let her in.

453
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,360
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just livid about it. We're not, we're not saying if this is a good

454
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,840
 conversation, but she likely would have seen it in people's homes as the front of a ship. So it's

455
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,880
 pretty cool. It got a lot of outing. But her, her history at the Royal Society was amazing. She,

456
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,920
 I think, was she the first woman to have a paper read out, authored by her at the Royal Society,

457
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,400
 but she wasn't allowed in. Her husband had to read it out on her behalf. Yeah.

458
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,840
 You know, I think he had to get things out of the library from her. And she's amazing. She wrote so

459
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,920
 many extraordinary scientific works. She was an amazing mathematician. I mean, she just achieved so

460
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:07,600
 much in 19th century science. She pre-discovered a planet. So in 1842, she, she wrote, she wrote her

461
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,880
 work saying, you know, there are some get ready disturbances in the movements of Uranus. All right.

462
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,120
 Not giggling in the back. Thank you. Yeah. And she basically said, it looks like there might be

463
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,640
 something else that is causing these disturbances in the movements of Uranus. And she inspired an

464
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,120
 astronomer called Dronecouch Adams, lo and behold, four years later, Neptune is discovered. Yeah.

465
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,040
 Right where she said it would be. It's very cool. It is very cool. She and she tutored Ada Lovelace.

466
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,520
 Really? Yeah. So she was, she was really sort of a pivotal figure for science back then. But she

467
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,000
 was a woman, therefore, it was hard. And what was the reason that she got to science? Because

468
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,840
 of course, back then, you had to have time and money. Yeah. So she, when she was a child,

469
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:58,240
 she got into Euclid, like a lot of scientists did. So Euclid is an old Greek book where he

470
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,400
 approves lots of geometry. But it's really easy to follow. You can just pick it up from the first

471
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,880
 pages, like this is what a dot is, this is what a line is. And then the final pages, this is an

472
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,880
 incredibly complicated bit of geometry. So it's really interesting for younger people to go through.

473
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,040
 So she was interested in it. And then she married her cousin. And her cousin died, but he was very

474
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,760
 rich. So she became a woman of wealth. So she could do whatever she wants. She was quite young at this

475
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,080
 age. In actual fact, she then married another cousin of hers. She had a type. She had a type.

476
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:35,200
 But rich cousins. But she was, yeah, she was wealthy and she was interested in the sciences and so.

477
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,080
 And her parents originally didn't want her to learn too much. And I think for the first seven or

478
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,920
 eight years of her life, she, she wasn't taught to read. She wasn't taught anything. And eventually,

479
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,840
 her parents thought we better teach her, you know, the basics of reading and accounting. Then she

480
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,920
 was getting too good. She was reading too much Euclid and they freaked out a bit because they thought

481
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,680
 too much education had driven her sister insane. So her sister, her sister, yeah, she had an older sister,

482
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,600
 I think. And her first husband who you mentioned, James, who was cousin number one, Samuel Grieg,

483
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:08,960
 was a bit of a hindrance to her. He didn't agree with women being educated, basically.

484
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,520
 Happily, he died after three years, leaving her everything. So as you say, she then got the

485
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,760
 married cousin number two, who was a brilliant support all the way through her career, you know,

486
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,280
 and and, you know, hung back so she could shine as it were. It sounds like education was this

487
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,720
 green time of the children back then. Just half an hour of education today will drive you insane.

488
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,160
 They used to take her candles away at night. Yeah, the parents would come in and go and we're

489
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,560
 taking your candles. You're reading too much. But this is a thing you would like James, especially.

490
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,200
 I think she got into it because there was an algebra puzzle in a friend's fashion magazine.

491
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,240
 And that's what brought her to Euclid. She thought that seems interesting. She begged her brother's

492
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,800
 tutor to buy her the elements of drama tree. And I would like this because I like fashion magazines.

493
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,800
 That's it. You see James in public, he's never without a gratz here. I just think puzzles, I love

494
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,680
 puzzles. An era where fashion magazines printed algebra puzzles is a great era. So the raw

495
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:11,440
 society, they didn't allow women to be members and into the building until 1945. And it was founded

496
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,640
 around 1660. There was a moment where a woman did make it in Margaret Cavendish, who was also one of

497
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:24,960
 the early great female scientists of that period. She went in in May of 1667 and it caused such

498
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,120
 unuproar and scandal that no one was back until 1945 basically. She sort of got around with them or

499
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,560
 that was just this agreement. Yeah. I think she pointed out some mistakes in the experiments

500
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,440
 probably. She was really interested in science. Yeah. She was very extravagant for her age.

501
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:46,640
 She wore men's clothes, which was seen very strange at the time. John Evelyn, who was there, said her

502
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,800
 headgear was so pretty, I never saw anything so witty. Though I was half a beard. God bless us. When I

503
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,280
 did see her, she looked like a cavalier, but that she had no beard. Some of your peeps who was there,

504
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,920
 said the duchess have been good, calmly woman, but her dress is so amtic and her department so

505
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,000
 on ordinary that I do not like her at all. So I think she was just a bit like she wasn't what you would

506
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,680
 expect to be in the Royal Society at the time and that was it. But there was actually someone who

507
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:26,640
 was a fellow before 1945, a woman and that was Queen Victoria. She was an honorary royal fellow

508
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,560
 because it's the Royal Society and she was Royal Society. So she was allowed to be a member but like

509
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:38,560
 it was a member by name really. So this the idea of women not being part of these science institutions,

510
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:44,400
 not just the UK, like this was this was global. There's one great example, which is that in France,

511
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,680
 in 1911, the Academy rejected Marie Curie to be a member of it. 1911 is the year that she won her

512
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,840
 second Nobel Prize in sciences. If you get three, if you get three, we'll let you in. But two,

513
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:03,360
 I think you're still an amateur if you only have two Nobel prizes. So weird that you have these

514
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:10,480
 people who are supposed to be very logical doing experiments, but still the just the having a

515
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,800
 woman there who has won two Nobel prizes still going well now. I don't I don't think it's appropriate

516
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,200
 for you to enter here. How do you how do you get your head well? Humans are very creative in

517
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,720
 rationalising these things. Yeah. There was a to come back to the UK, the Royal Society,

518
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:31,120
 their earliest published report by a woman in their journal was attributed to Governor Belcher's

519
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:39,040
 lady. That's who's written right. Yeah. And there was a hertha Erton. She was a brilliant scientist

520
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,960
 and she she improved electric lighting dramatically. I think in the early 20th century and a group of

521
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,080
 scholars proposed that we really should let in a woman into the society. And then they said,

522
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:56,320
 oh, sorry, you're married. Sorry, if you've been single, different matter. And hertha Erton,

523
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,320
 she was told at the age of 52, I'm sorry, you're just too old to contribute to the Royal Society.

524
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:07,920
 While the society's president at the time was in his 80s, I mean, yeah, obviously massive

525
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,600
 double standards, but yeah. Maria Mitchell's another interesting one. So she was an astronomy

526
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:20,160
 person in the 19th century and she was friends with Mary Somerville. She came to over to Europe to

527
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:26,480
 meet her. She couldn't get into the Royal Society. They wouldn't let her in there. But when she met

528
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,800
 George Erie FRS, the British astronomer Royal, he said to her, in England, there is no astronomical

529
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:39,920
 public and we do not need to make science popular. Wow. So she went on around Europe and visited

530
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,760
 lots of people. And then she went to the Vatican where they had an amazing astronomy place and she

531
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,800
 wanted to go and look at their telescopes. And she was told that because she was a woman, she wasn't

532
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,760
 allowed there after dark. So she could go and look at the telescopes during the day. Oh, no.

533
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,920
 But as soon as it went dark, women were not allowed in. Oh, that's true. Isn't that amazing?

534
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:09,680
 We've mentioned that there was the Mary Somerville ship. And that was, again,

535
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,320
 in her lifetime that ship was out there. So she would have seen the bus. It sank with all hands

536
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,360
 aboard in her lifetime. Yes. It was about 20 years and then. Yeah, exactly. There's only one other

537
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:24,240
 fact as far as I can tell that also had a ship named after it that we've done on today's show.

538
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:31,440
 Little quiz question. Oh, we don't cry. It's incredible to see it plow its way across the sea bed.

539
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:39,840
 Always in dry dark. Is the correct answer. No, it was a ship that was named after silica.

540
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:47,920
 And it to also sank. So it's now at the bottom of the ocean somewhere, slowly getting bigger and

541
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,080
 bigger and bigger. Yeah. I wonder how much higher the ocean would be if that didn't. That's great.

542
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,640
 She's on the Scottish tenor now. Mary Somerville, which is nice because she grew up in Scotland

543
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,000
 as of 2017. And if you look at it under UV light, there's a little Easter egg

544
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,800
 hidden in there. It's a lunar diagram, which is from one of her books called The Mechanism of

545
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,800
 the Heavens. That's very cool. She was very also the other thing she did. She was a real science

546
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,560
 communicator, like she did do brilliant mathematical work and science in herself. But she also

547
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:22,400
 wrote these incredible books, which explained and drew together science to lots of people.

548
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,480
 And there's this report. You see in lots of places said that she was called the first person

549
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,720
 ever called a scientist because there was a review of one of her books by William Hewell,

550
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,600
 who coined the word scientist in review. He didn't actually call her a scientist. He just said it's

551
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,320
 crazy that we have chemists and biologists and we have bloodists and everything. But where's the word?

552
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,000
 Why don't we call them a scientist? And scientists at the time hated the idea of the word

553
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,680
 scientist. Yeah. Because they were getting very snotty about the idea of professional scientists

554
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,960
 coming and ruining a traditionally amateurs game for rich blocs. Well, as a physicist, you don't

555
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,400
 want to be in a Zoom rule with a chemist. Of course, you shouldn't be one word or an engineer.

556
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,840
 Can I tell you a thing about her husband, her second husband? Yes. So I've got here, you can see,

557
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:12,640
 this is reflections by Mary Somerville. This is a first edition of her memoir. Wow. Which was printed

558
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,680
 a couple of years after she died. Look, there's the bust. You can see the Royal Society bust.

559
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:25,200
 And it begins with a little intro from her daughter saying, this is genuinely how it begins, right?

560
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,640
 The life of a woman entirely devoted to her family duties and to scientific pursuits

561
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,080
 affords a little scope for a biography. Okay. Why have I just bought this? There are in it

562
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,000
 neither stirring events nor brilliant deeds. Okay. And my mother was strongly aversed to gossip and

563
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,080
 to revelations of private life or intimate correspondence. So nothing of the kind will be found in the

564
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,320
 following pages. Why have I bought this book? It's the silicon gel of literature as well.

565
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,720
 And she's under selling it, right? Because in the first two pages, there's a shipwreck,

566
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,960
 and there's two sea baffles and the American Revolution, and her father was involved in all of that.

567
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,520
 Oh, wow. And then get this. Get this about so her second husband, also her cousin, right?

568
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:12,320
 Yeah. Okay. I'm just going to read this. My mother was dangerously ill when Mary herself was born.

569
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:18,560
 But my aunt was about to wean her second daughter Janet. So my aunt nursed me till a wet nurse

570
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,520
 could be found. So I was born in the house of my future husband and nursed by his mother.

571
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:31,600
 See if they both. They both been suckled with this about the same age. They were about the same age.

572
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,760
 On each tea. It might have been no wonder the daughter's like nothing to read here.

573
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:43,120
 Maybe put it down. Just put it down. Five pages in. You're getting some double suckling stories.

574
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:52,960
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

575
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,800
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about things that we have said over the course of this

576
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:03,040
 podcast, we're all online. I'm on Instagram on @Streiberland. James, this morning, leave

577
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:08,720
 another me on LinkedIn. I did. So why not act me on LinkedIn as well? I got a request as well.

578
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:15,200
 Yeah, I can tell you why because I'm touring with this AI show. It's so popular amongst companies

579
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,320
 that I have to go to LinkedIn to promote this stuff. It's the boomer take talk and that's where I'm

580
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:26,880
 on it. Is there anywhere else to find you online? Yes, on my website, leaveinschaer.com, but because

581
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:36,000
 you cannot spell this, I've also registered leavingshire.com. Andy, I'm on Instagram @AndruhunterM.

582
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,160
 Yep, and you can get to us as a group online as well. But if you want to send us anything, podcast@qy.com,

583
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,880
 that is our email address. All the emails go to Andy. He reads them through. He collects the

584
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,640
 best of them and he brings it to our bonus episode, which is the mail bag episode called drop us a line.

585
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,200
 We do it every two weeks. We absolutely love it. So if you've got a great story about something you've

586
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,160
 heard us say, send it there. Or if you have a great fact, also send it there because Andy collects

587
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,880
 those and we bring it to little fish, which is our new Monday show. Hopefully you've heard it by

588
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:13,680
 now. We're instead of our facts. We do all of your facts. So if you want to listen to Jule, go to patreon.com/nosuchthing

589
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,880
 as a fish. You can join up there. We've got lots of fun tears if you want to just listen to our other

590
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,200
 shows or you want to check out anything else about us. Want to go to nosuchthing as a fish.com. All of

591
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,880
 our previous episodes are up there. And if you want to see an incredible night of science, go to

592
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,760
 Leavenskirer's AI tour, which is happening in the next couple of months. Leaven, when do you start?

593
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,680
 It's March. I start, I think, the 10th of March. I will start in Leeds and then I go all over

594
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,840
 the country. It's not in a geographical, logical order. So I'm going to drive up and down all the time.

595
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:51,360
 Amazing. Yeah. Okay. Great. So it's the last, the last three weeks of March and I, I'll end in London

596
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,240
 on March 28th. That's right. Let's do square theatre. That's very exciting. All right. Well, that is

597
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,000
 it for us. Thank you as well to our production team, Leigh Engley, Ethan Ruperrelia and all of the

598
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,240
 other fish busters who are working behind the scenes. And we're going to be back again next week

599
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:17,760
 with another episode. We'll see you then. Goodbye.
