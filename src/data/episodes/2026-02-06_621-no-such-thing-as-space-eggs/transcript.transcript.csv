00:00:03,00:00:07,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish, where we were joined by a"
00:00:07,00:00:13,"very, very good friend, Leven Scera. Now, regular listeners of No Such Things A Fish will be well"
00:00:13,00:00:18,"aware of Leven. He has been on our show many, many times. He is always absolutely brilliant,"
00:00:18,00:00:24,and we always love it when he comes over from Belgium and tells us all his amazing facts about
00:00:24,00:00:31,"science. Now, if you would like to learn more about a particular kind of science, AI, then do I"
00:00:31,00:00:37,"have good news for you? Because Leven is coming over in March to do a live tour across the UK,"
00:00:37,00:00:42,"North, South, East, West. He's coming along and he will be telling you all about AI. Would you"
00:00:42,00:00:48,believe it's more complicated than just getting a program on your computer and asking it questions
00:00:48,00:00:54,and getting the questions wrong? There is more to it and we're better to learn about it than with
00:00:54,00:01:00,"Leven Scera, the man sometimes called the Stephen Fry of Belgium. I know that quite a lot of companies"
00:01:00,00:01:06,are snapping up tickets because they want their employees to learn all about AI and Leven is
00:01:06,00:01:10,"such a good science communicator. Definitely, it is a place to go if you want to learn about"
00:01:10,00:01:15,"that subject and have a laugh along the way. If you want to know more about that, then go to"
00:01:15,00:01:23,"levenscera.com. Probably you can't spell that if you're British, so he has also bought the domain"
00:01:23,00:01:30,"leaving Shire, like what a hobby it might do. Perhaps leaving Shire.com, if you type that into your"
00:01:30,00:01:35,"address bar, you will get his website and you'll be able to get tickets. If you want to learn more"
00:01:35,00:01:41,"about noses, it's things of fish. Then a good place to go at the moment is patreon.com/nosesthingsofish,"
00:01:41,00:01:46,"where you can join any one of our three tiers, the lowest of which four pounds a month will get you"
00:01:46,00:01:52,"dual droppers of line. Have you ever listened to the show and thought, ""Those guys have got something"
00:01:52,00:01:57,"wrong?"" Well, if you have, then other people have thought that as well and they have sent us emails"
00:01:57,00:02:02,and Andy goes through them and picks out the very best and he quizzes us about them. It's not
00:02:02,00:02:07,"just things we got wrong, it's also people with extra material because there are so many experts"
00:02:07,00:02:13,"listening to our show, so it's a really good place if you've enjoyed the previous episodes to learn"
00:02:13,00:02:19,"a little bit more about those subjects. Patreon's also got a free tier. There's a little bit on there,"
00:02:19,00:02:24,"I think, if you sign up to nosesthingsofish on the free tier, but it's also a place where we will"
00:02:24,00:02:31,announce new things as and when they happen and I could tell you a lot is cooking up and nosesthingsofish HQ.
00:02:31,00:02:37,"So if you want to learn more, go to patreon.com/nosesuchthing as a fish. Anyway, really hope you enjoy this"
00:02:37,00:02:41,week show with Leverna Schiller on with the podcast.
00:02:41,00:03:03,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:03:03,00:03:09,"from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:03:09,00:03:14,"James Harkin, and Leven Scherah. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:03:14,00:03:20,"four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go. Starting with"
00:03:20,00:03:27,"fact number one, and that is James. Okay, my fat this week is that when the father of supercomputing"
00:03:27,00:03:34,"Seymour Kray got stuck on a problem, he would go into tunnels, he built under his house and speak to elves."
00:03:34,00:03:43,"My kind of guy. Yeah, so this is a guy called Seymour Kray. He built some of the first supercomputers,"
00:03:43,00:03:49,"and according to one of his colleagues, who's John Role Wagon, Kray said that when he got stuck"
00:03:49,00:03:53,"on a problem, he'd go under there and the elves come with the solutions to his problems. Why"
00:03:53,00:03:58,"certainly true is that he was brilliant at sort of getting a computer problem, going away, just"
00:03:58,00:04:03,"thinking about it and then getting the answer. Yeah, so it's an interesting story because it's sort of,"
00:04:03,00:04:08,he had such weird myths about him. Did he really talk to elves? Was he messing with his friend?
00:04:08,00:04:15,"There was a story that he built his own boat, and at the end of every year, he would burn the boat,"
00:04:15,00:04:19,and then he would build a new boat the next year because he loved building things and he loved
00:04:19,00:04:24,"creating a new thing on the blank page. I heard that he burned a boat just because he'd built a new one,"
00:04:24,00:04:31,"and he didn't want to pay the tax on two boats. Unclared. Well, a lot of people think that he did"
00:04:31,00:04:37,"do that once, and then it became the myth that he did it once a year, but he did like his thinking time."
00:04:37,00:04:43,"Yeah, have you come across this guy, Lever? No, I haven't. Some supercomputers have a great history,"
00:04:43,00:04:47,"you know, that he was Air Force once built the supercomputer out of PlayStation Trees."
00:04:47,00:04:53,No. The Condor console. Really? Yeah. They bought two million dollars of PlayStation Trees.
00:04:53,00:04:59,Wow. They took out the computer chip. What were they trying to play? Analyzing satellite images.
00:04:59,00:05:03,"Cool. And the thing, I've not, I've not played that game. It sounds good. It sounds right up"
00:05:03,00:05:07,"your street in Paris, Andy. Well, once flight simulator has been knocked on the head,"
00:05:07,00:05:15,"you need 1,760 PS3s to to build a supercomputer. The reason they did it was that it saved them eight"
00:05:15,00:05:21,"million dollars, but they weren't using the PlayStation itself. They were extracting a chip from it,"
00:05:21,00:05:26,did you say? I think they used most of the hardware. You could run Linux on it back in the day.
00:05:26,00:05:33,"So you're in the Russian military and your secrets are cracked by 1,700 PS3s. But so what is a"
00:05:33,00:05:38,supercomputer then? Because that's a collection of PlayStation. Does that count as a supercomputer? I think
00:05:38,00:05:43,there's no like official definition of them. But it's a term that I think was coined to make the
00:05:43,00:05:48,difference with the mainstream computing power of that time and that changes constantly.
00:05:48,00:05:55,"Now, the PS3 supercomputer was in the top 50 of computing power at that time, 2010. So it did"
00:05:55,00:06:01,"qualify as a supercomputer. And this guy, Seymour Cray, his computers were super because he basically"
00:06:01,00:06:06,was one of the first people to use transistors. So a transistor is like an electrical switch.
00:06:06,00:06:09,"You know, a computer goes with zeros and one is your transistor. We'll tell you if it's a zero"
00:06:09,00:06:16,"or a one because it switches one way or the other. Before that, they used vacuum tubes so like light bulbs"
00:06:16,00:06:20,"almost. And whether the light bulb was on or whether it was off, that would be your zero or one."
00:06:20,00:06:24,And that's how they work out all the logical things they had to work out. So he could suddenly make
00:06:24,00:06:29,"things much, much smaller. The fastest supercomputer right now. What can it do in the space of a second?"
00:06:29,00:06:34,So the fastest supercomputer I think at the moment is called El Capitan at the Lawrence Livermore
00:06:34,00:06:41,"National Laboratory. And let's say, Dan, you were to do a coin flip against everyone in Japan."
00:06:41,00:06:46,Yeah. Okay. As you do. As I've been trying to do for many decades now. You'll get a yes from
00:06:46,00:06:51,"a commissioner one day. It's a great fun idea. And then once you've done, then Leven does the same"
00:06:51,00:06:56,against everyone in Japan. Yeah. And then Andy does. Then I do. And then everyone in the world
00:06:56,00:07:01,does a coin flip against every single person in Japan. This El Capitan would be able to manage
00:07:01,00:07:09,"all those results in a single second, which is not a long TV show. I can see why AI is ruining the"
00:07:09,00:07:18,arts. Japan against the world. It's petaflop time. But I like this word petaflop. So flop is a floating
00:07:18,00:07:24,floating point operations or an additional or a multiplication. And then petta comes after
00:07:24,00:07:33,"tera, I think mega giga X is after petaflop. X is even bigger. So we've got a new supercomputer in the UK."
00:07:33,00:07:41,It opened up last summer. It's in Bristol. It's called Ismbard AI. And it's going to be used.
00:07:41,00:07:45,The Guardian report of various things is going to be useful. Improving skin cancer detection rates.
00:07:45,00:07:50,Right. Really good. Predicting crowd movements. And maybe if there's going to be an accident on
00:07:50,00:07:55,"a construction site, you know, it can sort of like a brick starts falling. It can work out where"
00:07:55,00:08:01,"it's going to land. Exactly. I mean, or maybe even more useful than that. And also how to spot sick"
00:08:01,00:08:06,dairy cows in Somerset. That's good. And there are a lot of dairy cows in Somerset. And if they get
00:08:06,00:08:11,"if they're getting early signs of mistitis, that's a real pain for them. You know what? I went on to"
00:08:11,00:08:17,Google News last week. Yeah. And I searched for super computer. And these headlines were all on
00:08:17,00:08:24,the first page. Super computer tips Morocco to win 2025 African nation's trophy. Super computer
00:08:24,00:08:30,reveals who's had the easiest ties in the FA Cup. Super computer predicts man United finishes.
00:08:30,00:08:35,Michael Carrick takes over. Super computer delivers leech United versus bollum prediction.
00:08:35,00:08:40,And super computer predicts where FA Cup journey will end for Mansfield Town. I can see who's
00:08:40,00:08:44,funding the research. Yeah. And so that we're using city's worth of war for an electricity to come
00:08:44,00:08:50,out with his vital stuff about Mansfield Town. It's not so weird. But what I think is happening
00:08:50,00:08:56,is a normal computer is doing these calculations in a journalist office somewhere. And they're just
00:08:56,00:09:01,"thinking, let's call out a super computer. I assume that's what's happening, right? Yeah. It's"
00:09:01,00:09:05,"not a protected term, is it? I don't think so. I don't think it is. Super in front of everything."
00:09:05,00:09:11,I feel like Seymour Craze was the first properly called a super computer. Right. I think I just
00:09:11,00:09:16,"won last fact on him. So Dan, you said he had this intense focus. He would spend days in complete"
00:09:16,00:09:21,"seclusion, maybe in the tunnels under his house. There are stories also that he was very afraid about"
00:09:21,00:09:25,"nuclear war. So he dug, he was digging sort of bombshell or having bombshells as dug under his"
00:09:25,00:09:30,home. I don't know how true that is. But apparently he would often on family car journeys
00:09:30,00:09:36,"demand complete silence. So he could think for the entire duration of the journey. I mean,"
00:09:36,00:09:44,"the dream. So, but wait a minute, Charlie, the kids are watching Frozen in the back."
00:09:44,00:09:46,Have they watched that on mute? They're not allowed to watch anything.
00:09:46,00:09:51,What? Family have to stay silent because dad is driving and thinking. They're watching a great man
00:09:51,00:09:56,think. What more entertainment can you have? Let it go is nothing compared to Seymour Craze.
00:09:56,00:10:01,Have a better idea. Pay to watch Seymour Craze think from the back of a car. I don't care how the
00:10:01,00:10:07,wheels are the fucking bus going. I need to work on how many pizza flops in this computer.
00:10:07,00:10:13,Or you will not have the iPad by 2010 to watch your shows on mute.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"Yes, exactly. And then when everybody else is science, you still have the elves bubbling in"
00:10:17,00:10:22,"your ear of course. Shut up, Elf. Can I tell you a man thing about where super computers are going"
00:10:22,00:10:26,"to go next? Oh, yes, please. Have a guess. League 2. That's our results."
00:10:28,00:10:32,"Where it's going to go next? Space. Quantum computing? Oh, computer's in space."
00:10:32,00:10:35,"It's going to go up there. It is. Yeah, for the cooling and the cold."
00:10:35,00:10:39,China are trying to get what lots of people are trying to get a super computer in space.
00:10:39,00:10:44,"Everyone wants it to be in orbit. Bees awesome, all sorts of people."
00:10:44,00:10:51,"Basically, the theory is on the ground, all the computing power uses lots of energy and lots of"
00:10:51,00:10:56,"water for the cooling and things like this. Up there, it's solar power. We have solar power down here,"
00:10:56,00:11:01,"but solar and cooling requirements are not nearly as big. Well, solar power is 24 hours if you choose"
00:11:01,00:11:08,"the right orbit. So you don't have nights. Cooling is a strange thing because it is very cold,"
00:11:08,00:11:14,but also there is very little materials. You're kind of in a vacuum. It's like you can't sweat.
00:11:14,00:11:21,"Yeah, so the ISS has this big gray things that some people think there are solar panels,"
00:11:21,00:11:27,"but they're actually the only way to cool the ISS is by radiation, like radiate the power off,"
00:11:27,00:11:33,and these things are to radiate the power. So you need some sort of cooling in space too.
00:11:33,00:11:38,But it's a different way than liquid cooling that we do here. Could we cook something with
00:11:38,00:11:44,radiation in space and then that comes back to Earth? I guess so. Yeah. I've just had an idea
00:11:44,00:11:48,"that's all I'm just going to write a beasel after this. But why? Andrew, space sausage. I'm thinking"
00:11:48,00:11:56,space sausage. What when space eggs is straight there? Space eggs. Oh my god. I don't want to deal with
00:11:56,00:12:05,"masks. Space sausage. You send the satellite up surrounded by a thick layer of meat, right? It's"
00:12:05,00:12:10,"like a Scotch egg. Don't Scotch egg as well. And as it cooks, it drops off and comes back to Earth."
00:12:10,00:12:15,"When it's cooked, how does it not burn on reentry? Oh, we'd have we'll salt this down the line."
00:12:15,00:12:25,"I'm asking for $100 million. Just bad news. Just quickly on Seymour Cray, he was born and eventually"
00:12:25,00:12:32,set up his offices in a place called Chippewa Falls in Wisconsin. Oh yeah. I tried to see if there
00:12:32,00:12:38,"had any other impact on the world, Chippewa Falls as well. So two I could find a lady called"
00:12:38,00:12:45,"Judith Ann Hensk, who was a singer in America, was the original singer of a song that's had a bit"
00:12:45,00:12:50,"of an influence on the world because the song was called High Flying Bird. Oh, and Nol Gallagher's"
00:12:50,00:12:56,"band is named after it. Nol Gallagher's band is named after that. So yeah, huge influence on"
00:12:56,00:13:01,the world there. That's one. The second one is it's going to be better. I don't think I'd stop that.
00:13:01,00:13:06,"I don't think you're going to cap. Get ready. Go on. It is the hometown of Jack Dawson,"
00:13:07,00:13:14,who sadly died on the Titanic in the movie Titanic. What? Leonardo DiCaprio's character is called
00:13:14,00:13:19,Jack Dawson. Okay. Okay. So there's a scene in the movie where Kate Winslet is standing on the front
00:13:19,00:13:23,and she's about to jump off and he talks her out of it and he talks about the time when he was
00:13:23,00:13:28,"standing on a frozen lake in Chippewa Falls, his hometown and how it cracked and how cold it was when"
00:13:28,00:13:34,he went under and so on. And so that's the other main thing that they're known for except the lake
00:13:34,00:13:40,"wasn't there until after the sinking of the Titanic. So it's a goof. There's a new lake. Yeah,"
00:13:40,00:13:48,it's sort of a man-made lake in Chippewa Falls and it wasn't made until 1917. Gosh. Now James Cameron did
00:13:48,00:13:53,the whole thing where he changed the literal sky to put the stars in the right place when he redid
00:13:53,00:13:57,the Titanic movie because he got it wrong. Neil the Grass Tyson complained about it. Yeah. Neil
00:13:57,00:14:02,the Grass Tyson was watching the movie and at one point said the sky is wrong. I think Neil the Grass
00:14:02,00:14:08,Tyson needs to get his priorities right with the complaining. Well Cameron changed it. He redid it
00:14:08,00:14:12,for the anniversary release and he hasn't changed this. He's going to have to go back now and do it
00:14:12,00:14:16,all over again. Wow. Yeah. You think you have the same authority as Neil the Grass Tyson when it
00:14:16,00:14:21,comes to James Cameron's ear. Hundy P. Hundy P. Of course. Yeah. He'll probably just hand back all the
00:14:21,00:14:28,money. I'm going to stop making Avatar 9 and I'm just going to focus the whole time on time
00:14:28,00:14:33,"traveling this lake back in time. That'll be his solution. Avatar by the way, which is 100%"
00:14:33,00:14:37,"scientifically accurate on my show, right? Yeah, exactly. I haven't seen what the modern"
00:14:37,00:14:43,"computers look like, the supercomputers, but aesthetically they were really beautiful the original"
00:14:43,00:14:49,"Cray supercomputers. So Seymour Cray's Cray 1 was a sort of tall cylinder in the middle. Oh,"
00:14:49,00:14:53,that's right. And then it had sort of like leather seating around the bottom that you could
00:14:53,00:14:59,genuinely sit on and it was because the cooling system that it needed was underneath and it just
00:14:59,00:15:05,"was a thing that was part of the design. Was it heated seats? Yeah, super heated seats. Yeah,"
00:15:05,00:15:10,he's getting referenced as love seats and there's a few suggestions that people would sleep on it.
00:15:10,00:15:19,"Not for 60s. Yeah, but is that a big cylindrical supercomputer in Japan? I'm afraid it's an exafop."
00:15:19,00:15:33,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Lieben. My fact is that a crane is called a crane"
00:15:33,00:15:41,"because it looks like a crane. Any question? Yes. It's crane is wet. Aha. The crane, the machine"
00:15:41,00:15:49,is named after the crane the bird. And what does this have to do with Seymour Cray? Nothing yet.
00:15:49,00:15:55,I'll ask the elves. Yeah. Medieval cranes looked like the birds. Have you seen a medieval crane
00:15:55,00:16:00,"on paintings? Only through the process of researching this, yeah. Oh yeah, before nine. Yeah,"
00:16:00,00:16:08,"so a medieval crane would be a wooden building in a way. And it had these two, what do you call them,"
00:16:08,00:16:13,"where the hamster would want to round them? Tread mills. Yeah, treadmills. So it had two big"
00:16:13,00:16:20,treadmills at the site and people would walk into treadmills to make the rope move. And then from
00:16:20,00:16:26,"these two large treadmills, there was kind of a wooden building diagonally going up like 10,"
00:16:26,00:16:31,"15 meters. And then from the top, there would be a small piece going diagonally down again,"
00:16:31,00:16:37,where the rope would come out. And they would use this in harbours to take loads out of it.
00:16:37,00:16:42,"And these old medieval cranes, they look a lot like a crane, the bird standing in a field."
00:16:42,00:16:47,And so that's why they were called cranes. So cool. They're very beautiful. I had not seen one
00:16:47,00:16:54,of these before. These tread wheel cranes. And they're mad. I think there's a place where they're
00:16:54,00:16:58,trying to build a castle authentically in France. And they're using one or two of these actual
00:16:58,00:17:03,"things. And Tom Scott, who's built this show, has made a video where he goes and like operates this"
00:17:03,00:17:10,crane. It's crazy. And they were used for like quite famous things like column cathedral. So much.
00:17:10,00:17:14,"Salisbury Cathedral. And it turns out that if you have enough people and enough time as well,"
00:17:14,00:17:20,"because it moves slowly. But you can basically lift many, many, many tons in weight just by someone"
00:17:20,00:17:24,"walking around. If you have the right gears. Yeah. If you have the right gears, then you can,"
00:17:24,00:17:30,you can certainly do it. Could you like ratchet it and then use it as a catapult or something?
00:17:30,00:17:34,"A trebuchet. I don't know. I don't know if, because then you need a lot of torque in there. And"
00:17:34,00:17:41,"maybe the wood wouldn't, because I was thinking for Andy's meat in space business. Yes. That's how we'll"
00:17:41,00:17:44,get it back down. That's a good idea. Is that how you're lobbing it up? That's how I was lobbing it up.
00:17:44,00:17:50,"Oh, sorry. Okay. Can I get the sausage up there, mate? Is there that slang expression? I'm not"
00:17:50,00:17:56,"familiar with it. Very, very normal expression here. I'll be okay. But your sausage hot, mate."
00:17:56,00:18:02,"There was a Roman one called a polyspaston, which could lift 3,000 kilos per person walking"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"in this line. I mean, the gearings are amazing. And then they were used in ancient Rome, and then"
00:18:06,00:18:11,"they weren't used for many centuries, and then in medieval times they came back. But they were still"
00:18:11,00:18:16,"being installed in London in the 1850s. Okay. Wow. I think there's one down in Guilford, actually."
00:18:16,00:18:22,It's not in operation to that. It's a historical one. But there are a few that can still be found
00:18:22,00:18:28,"in the sellers of cathedrals, because they used to move up with the floors. So if you've built the"
00:18:28,00:18:33,"first floor, you would disassemble the entire crane and build it again on the first floor."
00:18:33,00:18:37,"So you could work your way up there. And then when they were at the top and the church was finished,"
00:18:37,00:18:41,they would just store it in the seller. Like they wouldn't build it up again. But all the material
00:18:41,00:18:46,would be there. That's very good. Do you know what the world's biggest crane is right now?
00:18:46,00:18:51,"Right now. Probably the bigger machine. We're talking machine still, I think."
00:18:51,00:18:56,"Yes, sure. So this is guessable. Absolutely not. Is it? What would you call it? What would you call it?"
00:18:56,00:19:02,"Manath. Manath. Oh, I see. Master Don't. These are great names. It's called Big Karl."
00:19:02,00:19:08,"And it's named after Karl Sarans, who works. He's a director of Sarans Engineering,"
00:19:08,00:19:14,"which is a Flemish family business. Oh, which what what's it called? Sarans."
00:19:14,00:19:21,Absolutely. I see Sarans cranes all the time. There are family business. They started
00:19:21,00:19:26,moving trees with horses and carts as you do. And now they're into the world's biggest cranes.
00:19:26,00:19:32,Right. And I was reading a trade magazine with an interview with Karl and they said what's going
00:19:32,00:19:37,on with the crane industry and he said the whole industry is picking up. Brilliant.
00:19:37,00:19:42,Which I don't think he deliberately did as a joke. Doesn't translate in Dutch actually.
00:19:42,00:19:50,"That's it. Through the roof. It's so good. In these medieval cranes, we had these big treadmills"
00:19:50,00:19:57,"and they used people to walk in there sometimes children. Actually, in Ghent, there's still a crane"
00:19:57,00:20:03,"children street. Can't get in there. So they weren't like really small kids, but they were like"
00:20:03,00:20:11,"teenagers and that were used. And they used animals. Dogs, for example. There's still pictures of"
00:20:11,00:20:17,dogs standing in these treadmills kind of sealed off of the world with a small wooden wall left
00:20:17,00:20:21,"and right. So in the morning, you would put your dog in a treadmill and it would just walk in"
00:20:21,00:20:24,"and evening, you opened the door and it could come out. You've got to make sure to put the dog"
00:20:24,00:20:28,"in the right way around. Otherwise, you get over the end of the day. It's disassembled half a"
00:20:28,00:20:38,"cathedral. My man. Not again, fee fee. These ones that we used. You've heard of a capstan, maybe."
00:20:38,00:20:43,That's the thing. You see them on board a ship for lifting various things. It's where you've
00:20:43,00:20:48,got a pole vertically and there are four spars coming out of it on the ground and you have people
00:20:48,00:20:53,pushing them around in a circle. Oh yeah. And that lifts something upwards. That was a big thing.
00:20:53,00:21:01,"In the, they were used a lot in the 15th, 16th century, especially to raise obelisks because Rome"
00:21:01,00:21:07,basically got a lot of obelisks from its territories in Egypt. So they were all in Stull. Stull?
00:21:08,00:21:14,"Yeah. Why am I worried about medieval Romans coming at me? Yeah, they were all sort of nicked."
00:21:14,00:21:19,"But basically to raise these, they would use cap stands with hundreds of men and horses involved"
00:21:19,00:21:23,pushing them around to lift them up. And I just love this detail. This comes by the way from
00:21:23,00:21:29,Low Tech magazine. It's amazing. It's about the past and forgotten tech and how it can actually be
00:21:29,00:21:35,very useful today. The website is solar powered. It runs off the author's home solar power system.
00:21:36,00:21:42,"Anyway, to raise this obelisk in the Vatican in 1586, it used 800 men, 140 horses,"
00:21:42,00:21:48,"and the best details, spectators were ordered not to speak or make a noise on pain of death."
00:21:48,00:21:52,Oh god. Because hundreds of people were watching this very delicate operation.
00:21:52,00:21:56,Like watching Snooker. It's like watching Snooker. And it was apparently enforced.
00:21:56,00:22:02,"Seymour Cray was there. Will you shut up? Oh, I want to see more Cray."
00:22:05,00:22:10,So was the reason because like often you can't make noise because there's someone
00:22:10,00:22:14,"drumming to make sure everyone goes in the right. It might have, it might well have been that."
00:22:14,00:22:19,I don't know whether it was that or just like a mistake from distraction could have been
00:22:19,00:22:24,"fatal. You know, but yeah, sounds exciting. One last thing on Cray and Cray. In 2005."
00:22:24,00:22:31,"Well, for these things are Cray and Cray. Which one are we talking about? Mechanical Cray."
00:22:33,00:22:36,"This is just a crazy story. It happened in London, south London, 2005."
00:22:36,00:22:44,15 year old girl was found on a crane at night 130 feet above the ground. Riddle me this.
00:22:44,00:22:50,"Well, sleepwalk is the obvious one. She was asleep. She's like, she'd sleepwalked up there and a passer-by"
00:22:50,00:22:54,"had seen someone up there called the authorities and then a fireman went up, crawled out,"
00:22:54,00:22:59,"found her there asleep. Didn't know how to wake her up because thought if I wake her up,"
00:22:59,00:23:07,she might panic. Where was she asleep? I seem to have a vague memory of the story that she was on
00:23:07,00:23:14,"the weight on the other side. It's not even like she was in the cabin bit. No, no, no. She was quite"
00:23:14,00:23:23,not that. Quite not. So it seems like he got her phone out of her pocket and called her parents
00:23:23,00:23:29,"from the phone and said, can you ring back so that I can so that that'll wake her up. How did he get"
00:23:29,00:23:35,her log into her foot? Did he lift up her head and hold the camera in front of it? It's 2006.
00:23:35,00:23:39,"It was a simpler time. It was a simpler time. What if you still had codes on first, did you? Maybe."
00:23:39,00:23:43,"Well, anyway, it was all fine in the end. How do you navigate that opening sentence with the"
00:23:43,00:23:54,parents? Yes. I'm on a crane. A crane crane? Crambrees are named after cranes. Really?
00:23:54,00:24:00,"Crane berries, yeah. The organic crane. Lovely. Because the plant stamens look a bit like the"
00:24:00,00:24:06,"beaks of cranes. Geraniums are named after cranes. Wow. From the Greek Geranus, meaning crane,"
00:24:06,00:24:13,because their seeds look like the crane bills. The Dutch word for geraniums is a stalk beak.
00:24:13,00:24:21,"Stored bill. That's quite similar to that. Pedigree, the word pedigree also comes from the word"
00:24:21,00:24:28,"for crane, the Geranus. That's because the foot of a crane has bits that stick out. When you draw"
00:24:28,00:24:36,"like a family tree, you have bits that stick out. Pediggeranus, foot of a crane. That's really nice."
00:24:36,00:24:40,"Oh, I love these etymology things that suddenly remove the blanket for something."
00:24:40,00:24:49,I love it. That's great. The crane is called a crane because of the noise. They have their
00:24:49,00:24:56,"migratary birds that use the right amount of syllables. Yes, migratary birds. And so they fly over"
00:24:56,00:25:00,"Belgium and Holland in huge groups, sometimes thousands of them. They're quite high up. They have"
00:25:00,00:25:08,have these long necks and then you can hear... they make this crane crane. And so if you want to finish
00:25:08,00:25:12,the etymology the machine is named after the bird and the bird is named after the sound it makes.
00:25:12,00:25:21,And in Belgium we also say crane to tap water tap faucet because they also have... well they used to
00:25:21,00:25:28,"have this vertical piece and then the horizontal piece like a pump. Cranes, Britain's tallest bird."
00:25:28,00:25:34,"What are we talking? Oh nine, ten, twelve feet. That big. Are they? Why have you put them on a hill?"
00:25:34,00:25:40,"Yeah, four feet or something. One one we did twenty something. Yeah, that is four feet."
00:25:40,00:25:45,But they're making a comeback across the UK which is very nice because they were
00:25:45,00:25:52,hunted and eaten to extinction of the UK. Also drying out wetlands. A lot of that went on in
00:25:52,00:25:56,"the Middle Ages and that really damages the habitats. People at cranes, I've never heard of that"
00:25:56,00:26:00,people eating cranes. Apparently they're... I'm afraid to say they're absolutely delicious.
00:26:00,00:26:07,"Well they certainly were in the 14th century when the food was a bit less nice. But no,"
00:26:07,00:26:13,in 1465 there was a new archbishop of York and 204 cranes were roasted to celebrate the fact
00:26:13,00:26:20,"at the feast. Right. And then by 1600 miraculously they were extinct. But they're back,"
00:26:20,00:26:25,they're back and it's partly because of random pair got blown off course as you were saying
00:26:25,00:26:30,leave and they're migratory. In 1979 they got blown off course they ended up in the Norfolk
00:26:30,00:26:35,Broads. And now there are maybe a couple of hundred and lots more breeding pairs which is obviously
00:26:35,00:26:41,"the main thing. And there's a place in Suffolk where they are breeding. An RSPB site,"
00:26:41,00:26:46,Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. And to help them breed the staff have cut runways
00:26:46,00:26:52,"for them in the grasses, in the reeds just to help them take off and land safely. With the light"
00:26:52,00:26:56,"and everything under control and the guy with the ping pong bats. We've got five cranes,"
00:26:56,00:27:03,got three or five faster. Look out you got a bump into a crane. What kind of crane? A crane crane.
00:27:03,00:27:10,Small fact about the light-hearted topic of eating birds into extinction.
00:27:11,00:27:25,"I, this week, I personally ate the stalk into extinction. No, I held with my hands the very last"
00:27:25,00:27:34,"great ock that ever walked on this earth. Really? It was strangled in 1844 on L.A., an island in Iceland."
00:27:35,00:27:43,"And so great orcs got really rare because they can't fly so people used to eat them. And back then,"
00:27:43,00:27:49,"like 19th century, if an animal became really rare, it became super expensive because all the"
00:27:49,00:27:53,collectioners wanted one. It's amazing. I read an article about this where it's like it would
00:27:53,00:27:58,become well known that there was an animal that they were about to go extinct. And what people thought
00:27:58,00:28:03,"was not shall we save them. They were like, this is our last chance to catch one. And so these"
00:28:03,00:28:07,Icelandic sailors could make a nice buck out of strength. You have to strangle them because
00:28:07,00:28:16,all the ways you damaged the meat in the skin. So they know that the last great ock was killed on
00:28:16,00:28:22,that island. The intestines were capped at Copenhagen and for a long time they didn't know where the
00:28:22,00:28:28,skin ended up. And then they did genetic testing on the intestines and on all the 67 great orcs that
00:28:28,00:28:35,are in museums and it's in Brussels. So they found out this is the very last great ock that ever lived.
00:28:35,00:28:42,"And it's now up there. It's in a place called, well, it's our national institute for natural"
00:28:42,00:28:52,"science. They have a huge collection of taxidermy. They have one million mammals, birds, amphibians,"
00:28:52,00:28:57,"reptiles. And then they have, I think, 30 million if you count all the insects with it."
00:28:58,00:29:04,And they have this separate room for extinct species. That is extra secured because they are very
00:29:04,00:29:12,"valuable. I met one of the conservators there. And almost weekly, he makes the sad walk with a new"
00:29:12,00:29:20,"species to the extinction. This is, I want to film this one day, this weekly walk of getting the"
00:29:20,00:29:24,"phone call like, yeah, you know, that bird over there in that island. Well, extinct now put it in"
00:29:24,00:29:30,"it, put it in the special room. And then you have to take an animal to the extinction room."
00:29:30,00:29:33,That's so sad. It is. You got anything funny to end the section? No.
00:29:33,00:29:44,"Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is Andy. My question is, a single gram"
00:29:44,00:29:54,"of silica gel has an area of 800 square meters. Okay, strap it everyone. This is so much fun."
00:29:54,00:29:58,"You're about to go on the right of your life, guys. There's a fantastic website called Scope of"
00:29:58,00:30:02,"Work. It's really good. It's amazing essays about all sorts of stuff. You know, the silica"
00:30:02,00:30:09,"gel, the little packets do not eat, right? They often come in one gram packets. And they're to dry"
00:30:09,00:30:13,"things out, right? They're to dry things out. They'll be in your shoes when you buy them all. Exactly."
00:30:13,00:30:20,Or a bit of furniture or whatever. And that stuff in there is silica gel. And the reason it's amazing
00:30:20,00:30:28,"at drying things out is that when you zoom in on it, it's not like glass, which is silicon,"
00:30:28,00:30:35,"silicon dioxide. It's much less dense than glass. Silica gel is full of these tiny, tiny, tiny"
00:30:35,00:30:40,"pores. So they're 2.5 nanometers across, which is the width of one strand of DNA."
00:30:40,00:30:47,"But these little balls of silica gel are so riddled with these voids, these holes everywhere,"
00:30:47,00:30:53,that one gram of it has an internal area of 800 square meters. So that's 4 tennis courts.
00:30:53,00:31:00,"They're absolutely amazing at taking on their own weight and water vapor, because it all condenses"
00:31:00,00:31:05,"in their tiny capillaries. So that's why they're so effective. And when you're a, you know,"
00:31:05,00:31:10,"shoemaker, for example, you're trying to say they will say silica gel sellers, how big do you"
00:31:10,00:31:15,want to keep dry? How big an area? How big a volume? And how dry do you want it to be? What's the
00:31:15,00:31:20,maximum moisture you want inside the shoebox? Yes. And they can just gear it exactly because they know
00:31:20,00:31:25,"how much silica gel can absorb. It is pretty amazing. I mean, we all know these packs. We've all"
00:31:25,00:31:31,got them in various items that we've bought. The say do not eat on it turns out that's not because
00:31:31,00:31:36,"as everyone assumes that they're toxic, they're not toxic, they're delicious. They're like the"
00:31:36,00:31:42,"grains. I remember when the Archbishop of Durham came on a few years ago, they had 200,000"
00:31:42,00:31:49,"silica gel packets. So don't eat them, but it's largely for the packet, isn't it? To say,"
00:31:49,00:31:54,"don't eat, it's a choking hazard. It's very fun. We have to say don't eat them, because obviously"
00:31:54,00:31:58,"we're not recommending people eat silica gel, but it doesn't seem like actual. I don't think it"
00:31:58,00:32:05,"would be any good for you, because it would absorb all the water, sorry, it would absorb all the water,"
00:32:05,00:32:10,because it doesn't absorb. Absorb is like a sponge. You get the water goes inside of it.
00:32:10,00:32:15,"Absorb means that it sticks to the outside of it. It's really weird. But the outside is on the inside,"
00:32:15,00:32:21,"precisely. Of the silica gel. It's like a weird net thing. But anyway, so yeah, if I think if you"
00:32:21,00:32:25,"did eat a few of them and you had swallowing problems already, I don't think it would be that good."
00:32:25,00:32:29,"Yeah, definitely. It's not like, you're not going to, people won't find an ancient Egyptian mummy."
00:32:29,00:32:33,"If you, if you, have accidentally swallowing a tiny bit of it, it's not like it dries you into your"
00:32:33,00:32:40,past. An amazing assassination method. Like the end of Indiana Jones. That's how they
00:32:40,00:32:46,achieve that effect. All of these telluses have got a bit of silica gel in them apart from one.
00:32:46,00:32:54,We should say that the only potential reason you should need them is that some of the beads
00:32:54,00:32:58,"might have a little moisture indicator, like which is to indicate when they change color, like"
00:32:58,00:33:03,"color chloride, which could be dangerous if you ate enough of it. Yeah, don't just don't eat them."
00:33:03,00:33:07,Don't eat them. It says don't eat them. It says don't eat them. Take your advice from the packet and
00:33:07,00:33:13,"I'll remind you that you'll be fine. But one thing you could do, which I don't, I see that I get"
00:33:13,00:33:17,"scared. It's toxic, chuck it in the bin. Yes. Actually, collecting them is quite useful because they"
00:33:17,00:33:22,"can be used that aren't to eat. Not to eat. No. Sorry, but we've covered some pretty nerdy"
00:33:22,00:33:29,collections. Surely there are collections. It's not for the sake. It's not like a stamp collection.
00:33:29,00:33:35,"It is for if you drop your phone in the toilet or the bath. Instead of putting it in rice,"
00:33:35,00:33:40,put it in a box full of these little packs and it's going to probably act better than the rice.
00:33:40,00:33:44,So they have their they have their uses. Apparently they're great for defogging windshields as well.
00:33:45,00:33:53,Just chuck your hundred silica packs you've saved. I've heard musty smells of books. Yep. It
00:33:53,00:33:59,add dissolves all of the musty smell. Rust in toolboxes. If you've got like a slightly damp
00:33:59,00:34:02,"garage or something, just pop a bit of that in. Allegedly, if you have a big enough packet,"
00:34:02,00:34:08,you can deodorize your laundry. But why don't we collect them and use them to lower the sea levels
00:34:08,00:34:15,again? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The thing with these numbers is that people have no idea of how small
00:34:15,00:34:23,atoms are. Yeah. It's just crazy. We can't get our head around it. I used to have an example in
00:34:23,00:34:29,"my show on genetics. I talked about Julius Caesar, who bled to death. Let's say he lost one liter of"
00:34:29,00:34:34,blood. You take one glass of water like I have in front of me. What is the chance that I have a
00:34:34,00:34:40,molecule in here and H2O molecule that literally exited a wound of Caesar as you bled to death?
00:34:40,00:34:44,"It's about 2000 in each glass of water. Wow. Well, you definitely have that in there. Yeah."
00:34:44,00:34:51,"That belongs to the museum, man. Yeah. Well, the thing is that there are a lot more H2O molecules in"
00:34:51,00:34:57,a glass of water than there are glasses of water on earth. But so how much of history is sitting in
00:34:57,00:35:02,that glass right now that everything from the beginning of the planet. Dinosaur piss. Dinosaur piss.
00:35:02,00:35:07,"Oh, a lot of dinosaur piss. That's what I always, that's what I always tell the homeopats. Like"
00:35:07,00:35:12,diluted dinosaur piss. Yeah. But maybe it turns out that actually dinosaur piss is the secret
00:35:12,00:35:17,panacea medicine. And they've been right all this time. Who knows? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know. I've
00:35:17,00:35:22,been drinking Hitler piss. There's some Dalai Lama piss in there too and some Magandhi piss so it
00:35:22,00:35:29,kind of evens out. Okay. Here's something you can do with silica gel. You can make opals out of it.
00:35:29,00:35:39,So the cars or the stones? The stones. All the fruits. Yeah. Now the stones. Basically opal is made of
00:35:39,00:35:46,silica. But it's dehydrated and it's compressed by nature. But you can make opals in the lab by getting
00:35:46,00:35:52,"a load of silica gel, putting it in water, leaving it for weeks and weeks and months and months until"
00:35:52,00:35:57,it all sinks down and stacks itself perfectly. And then you remove all of the water and it's in a
00:35:57,00:36:03,"perfect lattice. And that's how you make lab made opals. That's very cool. This is the same material,"
00:36:03,00:36:09,"basically, in a different crystal structure. When you start zooming in enough like this,"
00:36:09,00:36:16,everything gets a bit weird. I find like this stuff. Silica gel was first created in the early 20th
00:36:16,00:36:22,century by a researcher at Johns Hopkins University called Walter Patrick and he created it out of a
00:36:22,00:36:30,"material called water glass, which as far as I can tell is water soluble glass. Okay. That's not"
00:36:30,00:36:35,"very useful. What is construction? Quite hard to have a glass. That just feels like sandy water,"
00:36:35,00:36:39,"doesn't it? I think if you pour the, if you pour, if you have a glass of this stuff and you pour some"
00:36:39,00:36:45,"water in, it dissolves, which is a good prank. There's nothing else. But I just, I find it so bizarre"
00:36:45,00:36:51,"that this exists and there's an amazing 1930 paper, The Story of Silica Gel, which I've read too much"
00:36:51,00:36:57,"of, is by the main silica gel making company, basically. And it begins. I just like, people really"
00:36:57,00:37:03,"knew how to write science in the old days. Oh, so it wasn't very dry. Oh my god."
00:37:03,00:37:15,Walk right into that. You said it up yourself. I know. I know. I left the rake out. The story of
00:37:15,00:37:19,"silica gel, just listen to the way this begins. All right. Someday, the true history of mankind will"
00:37:19,00:37:24,"be written, a history that will treat not the struggle of man against man, but of the epic struggle"
00:37:24,00:37:31,"of man against the forces of nature. One great force of nature is oxidation, the intimate union of"
00:37:31,00:37:36,"oxygen and carbon producing combustion, combustion produces heat and primitive man. So this is about"
00:37:36,00:37:41,"silica gel. It's great. Wonderful. It's so good. It's Lord of the Rings-style science. It really is,"
00:37:41,00:37:47,"though, isn't it? Yeah. One of us uses way more silica gel than the others. Can you guess? Is it"
00:37:47,00:37:52,"me because there's a K-pop band called silica gel? That's not the reason. But it is you. Oh, well,"
00:37:52,00:37:58,I think I know why. Go on. I think just through my research. Yeah. I think it's James because of his cat.
00:37:58,00:38:07,"Yes. Okay. Oh, that's how I dry her. But that in the rain. In there with the shoes now."
00:38:07,00:38:17,"Don't eat it. It's cat litter. Cat litter, cat litter. Yeah. I think we've been used it so world"
00:38:17,00:38:24,"one after the invention by Walter Patrick, it was used in gas masks. Yeah. Yeah. Salt shakers"
00:38:24,00:38:30,used to use it in the cap. You would put little bits of it so that the salt wouldn't dry out. Clump up.
00:38:30,00:38:33,"Yeah. So it doesn't clump up because people would put bits of rice in there, right?"
00:38:33,00:38:37,But you would actually put little silica inside the top of salt cap. I'm going to put some in my coffee
00:38:37,00:38:42,tin when I get home. Do not eat. I'm sorry. How many times do we have to tell you? But am I allowed to
00:38:42,00:38:49,drink it? You sounded like a health and safety dog like there. Do not eat. I just imagine that you
00:38:49,00:38:53,put it in your coffee and you pour the water in your coffee and all the water's gone.
00:38:53,00:39:04,Three capsules in here. You can do that with the powder from diapers. It's a typical magic
00:39:04,00:39:09,"trick that you do in science shows. You take like three cups, like non-transparent cups, like"
00:39:09,00:39:15,"paper cups. And in one of them, you put the powder that is inside a diaper, like a baby diaper."
00:39:15,00:39:21,You put it like one or two centimeters at the bottom and then you pour water in all three of them.
00:39:21,00:39:25,"And if you take the one that had the powder, you can turn it around over your head and"
00:39:25,00:39:31,nothing will come out because it absorbs or add soaps. But it also sticks to the sides.
00:39:31,00:39:37,It turns a little bit white or something and I've seen people use it as fake snow bastard.
00:39:37,00:39:40,Really? Don't eat the yellows now though.
00:39:40,00:39:53,I had one more thing about these one atom layers. Oh yeah. Like graphene. So graphene is
00:39:53,00:39:59,stuff that is made of one layer of carbon atoms all in hexagonal shapes.
00:39:59,00:40:06,It's the stuff that your pencil is made of. So you're writing with graphene. And the
00:40:06,00:40:12,"cheapest way that they made one layered graph, it's very difficult to make something of one atom thick."
00:40:12,00:40:19,The cheapest way was with sticky tape. You just put sticky tape on a pencil and you rip it off
00:40:19,00:40:22,and then you put sticky tape on the sticky tape and you rip it off again and you keep going
00:40:22,00:40:26,until there's just one layer left. It's got a low tech way to make to make graphene.
00:40:26,00:40:31,This is silly question. How do you get off the sticky tape? I do not know. I think you study it
00:40:31,00:40:37,"on the sticky tape. Oh okay, so there's not for production. No. No. Then you put electricity on it"
00:40:37,00:40:45,"in there. Yeah. We've met Andre Geim. Yeah. Discovered it, I think. But he won a Nobel prize for"
00:40:45,00:40:53,it definitely and he also won an ignoble prize for levitating frogs. Yes. That's right. He was
00:40:53,00:40:57,at his university and there was a giant magnet and he was walking past it one day. And I think
00:40:57,00:41:04,"on a whim, he chucked a ham sandwich and just to see if it would float and it did. So then he"
00:41:04,00:41:09,"he misses how these people cut like putting a sausage in space, putting a ham sandwich in a magnet."
00:41:09,00:41:14,"You know, these ideas, they seem stupid at the time. We do the impossible. And then 30 years from now,"
00:41:14,00:41:17,"we get the call from the Nobel committee and it's like, yeah, thought that would happen"
00:41:17,00:41:28,later. It was the egg Nobel prize. He won for that one. The Nobel prize. The guy who does the egg
00:41:28,00:41:34,"Nobel prize, it sounds incredibly serious. He's the opposite of the Swedish chef. My favorite"
00:41:34,00:41:40,ignoble prize is also has to do with surface was mathematics. I think it was 2002. Ignoble
00:41:40,00:41:46,prize in mathematics for an Indian researcher who calculated the entire surface if you were to
00:41:46,00:41:53,fold an Indian elephant open. Yeah. So what is the surface? What is the surface of an Indian
00:41:53,00:41:57,elephant if you were to fold it open? What do you mean by that? Yeah. Fold it open. Like you're
00:41:57,00:42:02,doing cut in half and then fold. I think I think fold all the surface area. So it's very wrinkled.
00:42:02,00:42:11,Yeah. And it was really useful research because for especially vats when they had to dose
00:42:11,00:42:15,"medication for elephants, they had to measure the height of the elephant and it was very dangerous."
00:42:15,00:42:22,Because they're moody creatures. People get killed by them. And he could calculate it from a footprint.
00:42:22,00:42:29,So he could just let an elephant walk over some mud and then measure the area of the footprint
00:42:29,00:42:33,and then he could say the entire surface area of the elephant is this. So the dosage of the
00:42:33,00:42:37,medication is this and you don't have to get near it and get killed. Wow. Yeah. You know what they
00:42:37,00:42:41,say about elephants with big feet? They're just big in general. Yeah. That's what they say. That's
00:42:41,00:42:54,another saying here. You don't look like the sausage up there. Okay. It is time for our final
00:42:54,00:42:59,fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the first female scientist to be
00:42:59,00:43:06,celebrated with a marble bust at the Royal Society was never able to visit it because women weren't
00:43:06,00:43:13,allowed in the building. Wow. This is kind of a nice story at the start because she's got a bust.
00:43:13,00:43:18,Yes. And then it tells off quite a lot of the end that. Yeah. And this was a fact that was told to
00:43:18,00:43:23,me directly by a particle accelerator physicist from Australia called Dr. Susie Shihi. It's
00:43:23,00:43:29,SHWHWF. Anyone wants to look her up? She's really awesome. And she was saying it's really fascinating.
00:43:29,00:43:35,This incredible scientist who was born 1780 called Mary Somerville was known as the Queen of
00:43:35,00:43:40,Sciences in her time. She was such an influence that all the members of the society wanted to
00:43:40,00:43:46,commemorate her with a bust in her own lifetime. And they did so. But because the rules of the
00:43:46,00:43:50,"society did not allow women into the building, she was never literally allowed to go and see it."
00:43:50,00:43:55,Yeah. They could have flexed the rules. But they didn't. She said it's outrageous in hindsight.
00:43:55,00:44:02,"It's absolutely outrageous. We could have seen it. I think because in 1834 when she was still alive,"
00:44:02,00:44:07,there was a ship that was named after her called the Mary Somerville ship and the figurehead
00:44:07,00:44:13,"of that ship was copied from that bust. And not only for the ship, a lot of the leading scientists"
00:44:13,00:44:17,of the Royal Society loved it so much that they asked for a casting of it for their own home.
00:44:17,00:44:21,"So she could have gone to their houses as well. Again, these are just bad reasons not to let her in."
00:44:21,00:44:25,"I'm just, I'm just, I'm just livid about it. We're not, we're not saying if this is a good"
00:44:25,00:44:29,"conversation, but she likely would have seen it in people's homes as the front of a ship. So it's"
00:44:29,00:44:34,"pretty cool. It got a lot of outing. But her, her history at the Royal Society was amazing. She,"
00:44:34,00:44:39,"I think, was she the first woman to have a paper read out, authored by her at the Royal Society,"
00:44:39,00:44:44,but she wasn't allowed in. Her husband had to read it out on her behalf. Yeah.
00:44:44,00:44:49,"You know, I think he had to get things out of the library from her. And she's amazing. She wrote so"
00:44:49,00:44:55,"many extraordinary scientific works. She was an amazing mathematician. I mean, she just achieved so"
00:44:55,00:45:07,"much in 19th century science. She pre-discovered a planet. So in 1842, she, she wrote, she wrote her"
00:45:07,00:45:12,"work saying, you know, there are some get ready disturbances in the movements of Uranus. All right."
00:45:12,00:45:19,"Not giggling in the back. Thank you. Yeah. And she basically said, it looks like there might be"
00:45:19,00:45:24,something else that is causing these disturbances in the movements of Uranus. And she inspired an
00:45:24,00:45:29,"astronomer called Dronecouch Adams, lo and behold, four years later, Neptune is discovered. Yeah."
00:45:29,00:45:35,Right where she said it would be. It's very cool. It is very cool. She and she tutored Ada Lovelace.
00:45:35,00:45:41,"Really? Yeah. So she was, she was really sort of a pivotal figure for science back then. But she"
00:45:41,00:45:46,"was a woman, therefore, it was hard. And what was the reason that she got to science? Because"
00:45:46,00:45:51,"of course, back then, you had to have time and money. Yeah. So she, when she was a child,"
00:45:51,00:45:58,"she got into Euclid, like a lot of scientists did. So Euclid is an old Greek book where he"
00:45:58,00:46:04,approves lots of geometry. But it's really easy to follow. You can just pick it up from the first
00:46:04,00:46:08,"pages, like this is what a dot is, this is what a line is. And then the final pages, this is an"
00:46:08,00:46:12,incredibly complicated bit of geometry. So it's really interesting for younger people to go through.
00:46:12,00:46:19,"So she was interested in it. And then she married her cousin. And her cousin died, but he was very"
00:46:19,00:46:23,rich. So she became a woman of wealth. So she could do whatever she wants. She was quite young at this
00:46:23,00:46:28,"age. In actual fact, she then married another cousin of hers. She had a type. She had a type."
00:46:28,00:46:35,"But rich cousins. But she was, yeah, she was wealthy and she was interested in the sciences and so."
00:46:35,00:46:40,And her parents originally didn't want her to learn too much. And I think for the first seven or
00:46:40,00:46:43,"eight years of her life, she, she wasn't taught to read. She wasn't taught anything. And eventually,"
00:46:43,00:46:47,"her parents thought we better teach her, you know, the basics of reading and accounting. Then she"
00:46:47,00:46:51,was getting too good. She was reading too much Euclid and they freaked out a bit because they thought
00:46:51,00:46:57,"too much education had driven her sister insane. So her sister, her sister, yeah, she had an older sister,"
00:46:57,00:47:03,"I think. And her first husband who you mentioned, James, who was cousin number one, Samuel Grieg,"
00:47:03,00:47:08,"was a bit of a hindrance to her. He didn't agree with women being educated, basically."
00:47:08,00:47:13,"Happily, he died after three years, leaving her everything. So as you say, she then got the"
00:47:13,00:47:17,"married cousin number two, who was a brilliant support all the way through her career, you know,"
00:47:17,00:47:23,"and and, you know, hung back so she could shine as it were. It sounds like education was this"
00:47:23,00:47:28,green time of the children back then. Just half an hour of education today will drive you insane.
00:47:28,00:47:34,"They used to take her candles away at night. Yeah, the parents would come in and go and we're"
00:47:34,00:47:38,"taking your candles. You're reading too much. But this is a thing you would like James, especially."
00:47:38,00:47:43,I think she got into it because there was an algebra puzzle in a friend's fashion magazine.
00:47:43,00:47:48,And that's what brought her to Euclid. She thought that seems interesting. She begged her brother's
00:47:48,00:47:52,tutor to buy her the elements of drama tree. And I would like this because I like fashion magazines.
00:47:52,00:47:58,"That's it. You see James in public, he's never without a gratz here. I just think puzzles, I love"
00:47:58,00:48:03,puzzles. An era where fashion magazines printed algebra puzzles is a great era. So the raw
00:48:03,00:48:11,"society, they didn't allow women to be members and into the building until 1945. And it was founded"
00:48:11,00:48:16,"around 1660. There was a moment where a woman did make it in Margaret Cavendish, who was also one of"
00:48:16,00:48:24,the early great female scientists of that period. She went in in May of 1667 and it caused such
00:48:24,00:48:31,unuproar and scandal that no one was back until 1945 basically. She sort of got around with them or
00:48:31,00:48:34,that was just this agreement. Yeah. I think she pointed out some mistakes in the experiments
00:48:34,00:48:39,probably. She was really interested in science. Yeah. She was very extravagant for her age.
00:48:40,00:48:46,"She wore men's clothes, which was seen very strange at the time. John Evelyn, who was there, said her"
00:48:46,00:48:52,"headgear was so pretty, I never saw anything so witty. Though I was half a beard. God bless us. When I"
00:48:52,00:48:59,"did see her, she looked like a cavalier, but that she had no beard. Some of your peeps who was there,"
00:48:59,00:49:05,"said the duchess have been good, calmly woman, but her dress is so amtic and her department so"
00:49:05,00:49:12,on ordinary that I do not like her at all. So I think she was just a bit like she wasn't what you would
00:49:12,00:49:17,expect to be in the Royal Society at the time and that was it. But there was actually someone who
00:49:17,00:49:26,"was a fellow before 1945, a woman and that was Queen Victoria. She was an honorary royal fellow"
00:49:26,00:49:32,because it's the Royal Society and she was Royal Society. So she was allowed to be a member but like
00:49:32,00:49:38,"it was a member by name really. So this the idea of women not being part of these science institutions,"
00:49:38,00:49:44,"not just the UK, like this was this was global. There's one great example, which is that in France,"
00:49:44,00:49:51,"in 1911, the Academy rejected Marie Curie to be a member of it. 1911 is the year that she won her"
00:49:51,00:49:57,"second Nobel Prize in sciences. If you get three, if you get three, we'll let you in. But two,"
00:49:57,00:50:03,I think you're still an amateur if you only have two Nobel prizes. So weird that you have these
00:50:03,00:50:10,"people who are supposed to be very logical doing experiments, but still the just the having a"
00:50:10,00:50:14,woman there who has won two Nobel prizes still going well now. I don't I don't think it's appropriate
00:50:14,00:50:19,for you to enter here. How do you how do you get your head well? Humans are very creative in
00:50:19,00:50:24,"rationalising these things. Yeah. There was a to come back to the UK, the Royal Society,"
00:50:24,00:50:31,their earliest published report by a woman in their journal was attributed to Governor Belcher's
00:50:31,00:50:39,lady. That's who's written right. Yeah. And there was a hertha Erton. She was a brilliant scientist
00:50:39,00:50:44,and she she improved electric lighting dramatically. I think in the early 20th century and a group of
00:50:44,00:50:50,"scholars proposed that we really should let in a woman into the society. And then they said,"
00:50:50,00:50:56,"oh, sorry, you're married. Sorry, if you've been single, different matter. And hertha Erton,"
00:50:56,00:51:02,"she was told at the age of 52, I'm sorry, you're just too old to contribute to the Royal Society."
00:51:02,00:51:07,"While the society's president at the time was in his 80s, I mean, yeah, obviously massive"
00:51:07,00:51:13,"double standards, but yeah. Maria Mitchell's another interesting one. So she was an astronomy"
00:51:13,00:51:20,person in the 19th century and she was friends with Mary Somerville. She came to over to Europe to
00:51:20,00:51:26,meet her. She couldn't get into the Royal Society. They wouldn't let her in there. But when she met
00:51:26,00:51:32,"George Erie FRS, the British astronomer Royal, he said to her, in England, there is no astronomical"
00:51:32,00:51:39,public and we do not need to make science popular. Wow. So she went on around Europe and visited
00:51:39,00:51:45,lots of people. And then she went to the Vatican where they had an amazing astronomy place and she
00:51:45,00:51:50,"wanted to go and look at their telescopes. And she was told that because she was a woman, she wasn't"
00:51:50,00:51:55,"allowed there after dark. So she could go and look at the telescopes during the day. Oh, no."
00:51:55,00:52:01,"But as soon as it went dark, women were not allowed in. Oh, that's true. Isn't that amazing?"
00:52:01,00:52:09,"We've mentioned that there was the Mary Somerville ship. And that was, again,"
00:52:09,00:52:14,in her lifetime that ship was out there. So she would have seen the bus. It sank with all hands
00:52:14,00:52:19,"aboard in her lifetime. Yes. It was about 20 years and then. Yeah, exactly. There's only one other"
00:52:19,00:52:24,fact as far as I can tell that also had a ship named after it that we've done on today's show.
00:52:24,00:52:31,"Little quiz question. Oh, we don't cry. It's incredible to see it plow its way across the sea bed."
00:52:32,00:52:39,"Always in dry dark. Is the correct answer. No, it was a ship that was named after silica."
00:52:39,00:52:47,"And it to also sank. So it's now at the bottom of the ocean somewhere, slowly getting bigger and"
00:52:47,00:52:52,bigger and bigger. Yeah. I wonder how much higher the ocean would be if that didn't. That's great.
00:52:52,00:52:56,"She's on the Scottish tenor now. Mary Somerville, which is nice because she grew up in Scotland"
00:52:56,00:53:02,"as of 2017. And if you look at it under UV light, there's a little Easter egg"
00:53:02,00:53:06,"hidden in there. It's a lunar diagram, which is from one of her books called The Mechanism of"
00:53:06,00:53:10,the Heavens. That's very cool. She was very also the other thing she did. She was a real science
00:53:10,00:53:16,"communicator, like she did do brilliant mathematical work and science in herself. But she also"
00:53:16,00:53:22,"wrote these incredible books, which explained and drew together science to lots of people."
00:53:22,00:53:26,And there's this report. You see in lots of places said that she was called the first person
00:53:26,00:53:30,"ever called a scientist because there was a review of one of her books by William Hewell,"
00:53:30,00:53:35,who coined the word scientist in review. He didn't actually call her a scientist. He just said it's
00:53:35,00:53:40,crazy that we have chemists and biologists and we have bloodists and everything. But where's the word?
00:53:40,00:53:44,Why don't we call them a scientist? And scientists at the time hated the idea of the word
00:53:44,00:53:47,scientist. Yeah. Because they were getting very snotty about the idea of professional scientists
00:53:47,00:53:52,"coming and ruining a traditionally amateurs game for rich blocs. Well, as a physicist, you don't"
00:53:52,00:53:58,"want to be in a Zoom rule with a chemist. Of course, you shouldn't be one word or an engineer."
00:54:00,00:54:05,"Can I tell you a thing about her husband, her second husband? Yes. So I've got here, you can see,"
00:54:05,00:54:12,this is reflections by Mary Somerville. This is a first edition of her memoir. Wow. Which was printed
00:54:12,00:54:17,"a couple of years after she died. Look, there's the bust. You can see the Royal Society bust."
00:54:17,00:54:25,"And it begins with a little intro from her daughter saying, this is genuinely how it begins, right?"
00:54:26,00:54:30,The life of a woman entirely devoted to her family duties and to scientific pursuits
00:54:30,00:54:36,affords a little scope for a biography. Okay. Why have I just bought this? There are in it
00:54:36,00:54:42,neither stirring events nor brilliant deeds. Okay. And my mother was strongly aversed to gossip and
00:54:42,00:54:46,to revelations of private life or intimate correspondence. So nothing of the kind will be found in the
00:54:46,00:54:50,following pages. Why have I bought this book? It's the silicon gel of literature as well.
00:54:53,00:54:56,"And she's under selling it, right? Because in the first two pages, there's a shipwreck,"
00:54:56,00:55:00,"and there's two sea baffles and the American Revolution, and her father was involved in all of that."
00:55:00,00:55:05,"Oh, wow. And then get this. Get this about so her second husband, also her cousin, right?"
00:55:05,00:55:12,Yeah. Okay. I'm just going to read this. My mother was dangerously ill when Mary herself was born.
00:55:12,00:55:18,But my aunt was about to wean her second daughter Janet. So my aunt nursed me till a wet nurse
00:55:18,00:55:23,could be found. So I was born in the house of my future husband and nursed by his mother.
00:55:23,00:55:31,See if they both. They both been suckled with this about the same age. They were about the same age.
00:55:31,00:55:35,On each tea. It might have been no wonder the daughter's like nothing to read here.
00:55:35,00:55:43,Maybe put it down. Just put it down. Five pages in. You're getting some double suckling stories.
00:55:43,00:55:52,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening."
00:55:52,00:55:56,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about things that we have said over the course of this
00:55:56,00:56:03,"podcast, we're all online. I'm on Instagram on @Streiberland. James, this morning, leave"
00:56:03,00:56:08,another me on LinkedIn. I did. So why not act me on LinkedIn as well? I got a request as well.
00:56:08,00:56:15,"Yeah, I can tell you why because I'm touring with this AI show. It's so popular amongst companies"
00:56:15,00:56:20,that I have to go to LinkedIn to promote this stuff. It's the boomer take talk and that's where I'm
00:56:20,00:56:26,"on it. Is there anywhere else to find you online? Yes, on my website, leaveinschaer.com, but because"
00:56:26,00:56:36,"you cannot spell this, I've also registered leavingshire.com. Andy, I'm on Instagram @AndruhunterM."
00:56:36,00:56:42,"Yep, and you can get to us as a group online as well. But if you want to send us anything, podcast@qy.com,"
00:56:42,00:56:46,that is our email address. All the emails go to Andy. He reads them through. He collects the
00:56:46,00:56:52,"best of them and he brings it to our bonus episode, which is the mail bag episode called drop us a line."
00:56:52,00:56:57,We do it every two weeks. We absolutely love it. So if you've got a great story about something you've
00:56:57,00:57:02,"heard us say, send it there. Or if you have a great fact, also send it there because Andy collects"
00:57:02,00:57:06,"those and we bring it to little fish, which is our new Monday show. Hopefully you've heard it by"

00:57:23,00:57:28,"our previous episodes are up there. And if you want to see an incredible night of science, go to"
00:57:28,00:57:33,"Leavenskirer's AI tour, which is happening in the next couple of months. Leaven, when do you start?"
00:57:33,00:57:39,"It's March. I start, I think, the 10th of March. I will start in Leeds and then I go all over"
00:57:39,00:57:43,"the country. It's not in a geographical, logical order. So I'm going to drive up and down all the time."
00:57:43,00:57:51,"Amazing. Yeah. Okay. Great. So it's the last, the last three weeks of March and I, I'll end in London"
00:57:51,00:57:56,"on March 28th. That's right. Let's do square theatre. That's very exciting. All right. Well, that is"
