 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,360
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you from the Northwall Art Center in Oxford.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to stage Andy Murray Anichesinski and James Harkin.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:43,520
 [ Cheers and applause ]

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days,

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,480
 and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Chuzinski.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,680
 Yep, my fact this week is that the world's only Cornish Pasty Museum is in Mexico.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
 [ Laughter ]

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,320
 These planning permission things are cool. So why and when did it go up?

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,440
 Well, so this is because there's actually a significant like Cornish diaspora in Mexico,

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,640
 because Mexico needed miners in the early 19th century, a bunch of Cornish men emigrated out there,

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,800
 and they brought their pasties with them, and pasties have been a delicacy in Mexico,

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,160
 and it's particularly in these two areas. It's in the municipality of Real Del Monte,

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,520
 and yeah, and a place called Pachuca. Pachusa. I don't know. Is there any Mexicans in here who

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,840
 are going to correct me on that? No, cool. But yeah, it's 4,500 miles away from Cornwall,

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
 and it is a Cornish Pasty Museum. It was set off about five years ago.

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
 What's in a Cornish Pasty Museum? I feel like the clue is in the title.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,040
 Some medieval helmets and a viking ship. It's actually miss me.

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,760
 I mean, once you've seen a Cornish Pasty, I'm Andy.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,320
 You have not seen a Cornish Pasty.

22
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,520
 Yeah, it seems like it's partly a culinary school disguises a museum.

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,800
 There's a pasty-making lessons, and in fact, so recent, I think, in 2014,

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 a team of Mexican bakers took a trip to Cornwall so they could pick up some new tips

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,880
 about how to make pasties, specifically the art of crimping, which is, you know,

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,920
 getting that little handhold bit on the side, right? There is actually going to be a Cornish Pasty

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,920
 Museum in the UK soon. Where will it be? Orkney?

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,360
 No, this is a guy called Malcolm Ball. He's hoping to open what he's calling a planet Hollywood

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,000
 with a Cornish Pasty twist. And he said he started to research whether there's any visitor

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,400
 attractions in the UK focusing on the Cornish Pasty, and that was absolutely staggered

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,880
 to find out that there wasn't a single one.

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:53,200
 Is the twist on the planet Hollywood thing that it's got no celebrities, no memorabilia,

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,280
 and is just Cornish Pasty? There's going to be memorabilia, but it'll be pasty memorabilia.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,440
 Pasties. Yeah, yeah. So if anyone listens to this in a year, I wanted to say, please don't

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,360
 write in and say my fact was wrong. It just will be wrong in about six months' time because

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,600
 there is going to be a second pasty museum. But, yeah, the Cornish had a really big influence

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,520
 in Mexico. So they also imported football in the 1890s, I think it was about, set up the first

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,320
 football team in Mexico. And in fact, FIFA's only football hall of fame is now in Patroosa,

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,640
 in that little town in Mexico. Wow. Yeah. I was looking into the history of Cornish Pasties.

40
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,920
 And in the early days, both husband and wife would initial the husband's name onto the end of

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,720
 the Cornish Pasty so that they knew it was their lunchbox effectively. So you could go, that's my

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,560
 Cornish Pasty. Look, Darren is written on it. And then also to test whether a good Cornish Pasty

43
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,320
 is good as it can be, is that they would drop it down a mine and if it survives, then they're like,

44
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,680
 that's a damn good Cornish Pasty. They dropped it down a mine. They didn't drop it down a mine.

45
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,800
 So are the internet. People do say that. That also implies that a good way to test for a good

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,240
 Cornish Pasty is try and bite into it. And if you can't, then it probably is good. The fact of

47
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,880
 dropping a Cornish Pasty down a mine is much greater than biting it. So if it does survive, then it's

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,960
 inedible. Yeah. I read the other day that it's impossible to tell if an apple is ripe without biting

49
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,760
 into it. But I'm not sure anyone's ever thought of putting it down a mine. Yeah, just drop it down a

50
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,560
 mine. Yeah. The thing with the, with the initials on the Pasty, what they used to do is they used to

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
 hold it kind of, kind of upright and they would keep the initial at the bottom and then we'd eat

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,800
 it from the top. And so you would always kind of have the initial at the bottom for the whole thing.

53
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,480
 And then once you got down to the bottom with the initial, you would throw it away. And you'd throw

54
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,640
 it for what they called the mining gremlins. Oh, they called them knockers. Did they? Yes. They were the

55
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,680
 sort of little people in the mines who, if they, you gave them a bit of food, they wouldn't give you

56
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,560
 bad luck. You also, some people say that they didn't eat the, the reason they have that handled

57
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,360
 bit, the crimped handled bit was to hold on to. And that was discarded at the end because so Corn

58
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,240
 was the, it had the largest tin mining, but it also had the largest arsenic mining. There's a lot

59
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,600
 of arsenic down there. And so these miners hands were covered in arsenic, which they didn't want to eat.

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,360
 So I think they chucked away the bit they held on to. Mind for arsenic. Yeah, apparently Corn was one

61
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,480
 of the country's biggest providers of arsenic. Do you not get your arsenic supplies from Cornwall?

62
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,480
 We, I do, obviously, I do. And also they're throwing the food down into the arsenic mines before

63
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:36,640
 they eat it. Yeah. Just pick it up, three-second rule, brush off the arsenic. They'd have a different

64
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:44,160
 second rule. It takes a long time to get there. Right. You know the chant that goes oggy, oggy,

65
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,200
 oggy, oggy, oggy, oggy. Yeah, there you go, but not in that tone of voice in like a different tone

66
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,200
 of voice. So that chant is thought to come from the Cornish word for pasty, which is hoggan or

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,920
 hoggan, and it's thought, and this again is probably just missed. It's been passed down the generations,

68
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,360
 but at lunchtime the wives would come to the top of the mines and they'd shout out oggy, oggy, oggy,

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,840
 and the miners downstairs would go, oh, oh, oh, oh, and they'd be like, all right, he wants it.

70
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,120
 And then you do the drop test. And then you drop them. Countless miners were killed by their

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,600
 rock hard pasties. Goals of death, lunch, lunch, lunch.

72
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,400
 I read a dictionary of slang from 1811, the gross dictionary of slang, and the only thing for pasties

73
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,520
 that I could find is that to deliver a flying pasty meant to take a poo, wrap it in paper, and throw

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:49,360
 it over a neighbor's wall. You didn't get that from a dictionary. I was going to mention I

75
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,200
 thought it would be a bit to like just juvenile to do, but since you bring it up, I read a story about,

76
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,800
 it was about a someone's housemate who got evicted from the house because they found them eating a

77
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,800
 pasty full of poo. And they said, yeah, so here's the thing, he wasn't feeding it to anyone else.

78
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,040
 He was just mining his own business, having a pasty on his own in the kitchen, and then they said,

79
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,320
 we don't want someone eating poo. He said he wasn't feeding it to anyone, but she did make the good

80
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,720
 point and she didn't want to use the oven afterwards, which I think is totally fair. Something else that's

81
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,160
 disgusting that goes into college pasties. They used to put jam at the bottom and meat at the top,

82
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,960
 didn't they? And so that was so that you could have a full meal, you'd have your first boss there,

83
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,200
 and you're putting at the end. But there must have been a bit in between that was kind of jammy meat.

84
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,880
 That was sorbet. Yeah, it's a nice palette cleanser for the gourmet miner.

85
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,200
 We're going to have to move on to the next bag. Soonish, if you guys have anything else?

86
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,280
 Okay, can I just say a thing about museums? I found this thing the other day. Apparently in 1846,

87
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:57,360
 a snail arrived at the British Museum. As I read that, and they said, you're late, where are you being?

88
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,760
 Yeah, someone sent a snail into the British Museum, and it was stuck onto a piece of cardboard,

89
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,240
 and then they noticed four years later that the card was slightly discolored. They put it all into

90
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,440
 some warm water, and it turned out that the snail wasn't dead, and it woke up, and it became really

91
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,960
 famous, and it was like the most famous snail in Britain in 1850. That's not a composition in that year,

92
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,880
 1850. 1850, that was. It was so famous, it was painted by John William Waterhouse. What kind of?

93
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:37,280
 I just like that that there was a most famous snail in Britain, and Waterhouse I like as well,

94
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,440
 because he painted pre-Raphaelite style, but like decades after everyone's lights. He didn't really

95
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,240
 want to do it anymore, so he was like a post-pre-Raphaelite. I think they just call them "Raphaelites."

96
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,360
 Have we got any more on this? I think a good thing to look into if you fancy or researching more about

97
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,160
 Cornish pasties is the British newspaper archive, where I was reading up on other 19th century pasties

98
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,520
 stories, and there were a couple of good ones, so one of them was a travel writer in the Leeds Times in

99
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,600
 1861, a visited Cornwall, and said of the pasties, "The name is generally applicable to anything that by

100
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
 any stretch of the culinary imagination could be conceived as existing under a crust."

101
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:23,280
 So he wasn't a fan, and in 1889 two Cornish miners got trapped in a mine, so they were stuck underground,

102
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,320
 and all they had to eat was four pasties that their wives had given them before. They got

103
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,560
 trapped underground. They were trapped underground for four and a half days, and they didn't even

104
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:40,560
 finish the pasties, because they were unfit to eat apparently, so yeah. This one's been in

105
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,160
 the ground for four seconds because of the Leeds. Okay, I'm going to move us on to our next fact,

106
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,960
 and that is James Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that 20% of people wake up wearing fewer

107
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,480
 clothes than they went to bed with. Do we know who's removing them? Do we know who's taking them on?

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,560
 We don't know. Well, we think probably them. Okay. All the clothes fairy. Well, there is one theory

109
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,480
 that if you wake, if you go to bed wearing pajamas and you wake up not wearing them, you've been

110
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,680
 abducted by aliens. There's a website called Abduct Anon, and it says, "How to tell if you've been

111
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,400
 abducted by aliens?" And that's one of them. If you enter bed wearing pajamas and you woke up

112
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,400
 nude, that's one of them. The other one is electronic appliances behave strangely when you pass by.

113
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,320
 Another one is you have an uncontrollable urge to take vitamins. Don't really understand that one.

114
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,200
 Three out of three so far. And the other one, I really like this, the scene of your

115
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,560
 abduction has been staged to look as if nothing happened. So if you ever wake up in the morning

116
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,280
 and everything looks exactly the same, it's aliens I'm afraid. I was really that when aliens do

117
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,480
 abduct humans, I don't believe it, by the way, but when they when they say they adopt them, the abductees

118
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,400
 say that when they get up there, the aliens do some probes and they often have to do it in a sort of

119
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,800
 slightly inappropriate kind of sexual manner, they try and transform their bodies so that they look

120
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
 as if they're comfortable sights to you. So it just feels like, "Oh, this is this is quite a nice

121
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,400
 scene." And the list of things that they dress up as body-wise is the Pope. That's the thing that's

122
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,520
 most likely to put something up your ass. The other is a deceased relative and that's what they say

123
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,320
 will make you feel like, "Well, this is a pleasant experience." I do this. I do this. I do what they say.

124
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:42,640
 I'm drawing this. I can't bring it back to the conversation before. I wake up sometimes not

125
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,280
 wearing, if I have socks on, when I go to sleep, I wake up not wearing the socks. Yeah, um, 13. I'm so

126
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,240
 uncomfortable telling you that as well. I feel like you've all been left in now. You're not wearing

127
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:07,040
 the sock on your penis, are you? Look, my room is drafty and cold. And I'm a real man, I don't

128
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,400
 wear pajamas. Oh, god. Do you actually wake up with no socks? Yeah. Thank you. What did you say?

129
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:23,120
 I've got a friend and supporter in tonight. So anyway, so this was a, it was a survey by a memory foam

130
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,640
 mattress company called Ergo Flex. And they said that socks are the most commonly removed item

131
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,720
 with 31% of people who remove things saying that they don't keep them on at night. So you're in,

132
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,360
 you know, a good company. One of the other things I found is that the average length of time

133
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,600
 men wear pajamas before washing them is 13 nights. And women, it's 17 nights.

134
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,080
 Whereas we all know the correct answer is you're in for one night and then you incinerate them.

135
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,880
 And you buy a new pen. So when you say you're a real man, you don't wear pajamas.

136
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:06,080
 Are we so glossed over that? I think whether that's a thing because there was a survey done

137
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,640
 into who wears pajamas and who doesn't and far, far fewer men wear pajamas than women.

138
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,880
 So I think it was something like 13% of men wear pajamas and about 30% of women do. So is this

139
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,600
 something in the male community that sort of is emasculating? I think it's thought of as being not

140
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:30,400
 the act of a room and where I've got six pairs of soap operas, I'm fine. One sock. In the survey

141
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,440
 they did, people were asked what they wore in bed and one percent of people said they had no opinion.

142
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,840
 The aliens look after that stuff to be honest with you.

143
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:49,840
 The idea of doing things while you're asleep is called parasomnia. And there have been examples

144
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,640
 of people doing various things. Texting while asleep, eating while asleep is a bad one because

145
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,200
 you can put on a lot of weight. Driving cars while asleep, there's one or two people who've done that.

146
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,320
 And there was one sleep doctor who described how he treated someone who dismantled

147
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,880
 grandfather clocks while asleep. There's, you know, you used to be able to text in their sleep.

148
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:18,720
 Yeah. There was a, the first example of someone using the internet while asleep was in 2008.

149
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,080
 And this was a 44-year-old woman who in her, in her sleep, she got out of bed, she went over to her

150
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,440
 computer, she logged in and she fired off three emails. One of which read, "Come tomorrow and

151
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
 sort this hellhole out. Dinner and drinks 4pm. Bring wine and caviar only."

152
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,520
 Awesome dream, was she?

153
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,840
 There's a really cool thing as well that they've noticed in recent times when they've been doing

154
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,520
 studies that anyone playing video games and so younger children and really cool awesome adults.

155
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:57,200
 They have ability, they say, in their dream to suddenly take charge and control the dream

156
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,600
 as if they were playing called duty or something like that. So they don't have nightmares because

157
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,960
 nightmares for them are a challenge where they can then slaughter dragons and sort out, I don't know.

158
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,360
 Yeah, it's called lucid dreaming, right? Yeah. The idea is that you keep looking at your watch

159
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,120
 during the day and then you start dreaming that you're looking at your watch and you realise that

160
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,560
 it's not moving and then you can realise you're in a dream, as soon as you realise you're in a dream,

161
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,920
 then you can start doing things in there. And there are quite a few people who can do it.

162
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,680
 I've done it a couple of times, but only a couple of times my whole life I can remember having a lucid dream.

163
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,160
 Wow. It's really cool. Yeah, I bet. I just fly. Just a quick thing on pajamas.

164
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,640
 I was looking for information on astronaut pajamas, what they were in space, whether they were

165
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,920
 wear pajamas, whether they take them. And so I googled do astronauts immediately type in wear

166
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,360
 pajamas. And the first thing that came up is do astronauts masturbate in space? So I clicked

167
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,560
 on that instead. There's a website called Quora where people write their own answers to questions,

168
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,800
 people post up. And there was an article on Quora which gave an answer and I just wanted to read it out.

169
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,360
 This is the answer on Quora. This is at least the tenth time I've answered a question about sex,

170
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,520
 masturbation, or romance in space. Please search before posting. And it goes on, it gives the answer.

171
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,520
 He says, "Yes, each astronaut has a private sleeping area." No, there isn't a space just for masturbation.

172
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:24,320
 No, the guy's a NASA would have built that into a station.

173
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,680
 Well, we've got the sleeping quarters, the masturbatorium.

174
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,520
 Sorry.

175
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:41,280
 There was an article in the Daily Mail which said, "I should have really looked into whether this

176
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,640
 could possibly be right." But it said it had interviewed an independent sleep expert who said that

177
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,360
 "Resist the temptation to strip off at nights when you're hot and muggy. It's actually cooler if

178
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,400
 you wear pajamas because the pajama fabric draws sweat away from your body and will make you feel a

179
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,720
 lot cooler and more comfortable." So, doesn't that imply that whenever you're too hot, you should put more

180
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,440
 clothes on? Can that be true? I don't know. It doesn't sound very true, does it? It really doesn't.

181
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:14,560
 Speaking of things that happen while you were asleep, a 64-year-old man has told how he passed out

182
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,800
 after a heavy night's drinking and woke up to find that his penis was missing. Neighbours of

183
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,720
 Gerardo Ramos claimed that he was attacked by a dog as he stumbled around the Dominican Republic

184
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:34,560
 naked while drunk. He has decided to stop drinking. Sounds like a good decision.

185
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,640
 It sounds like a bit of a stable door and horse-bolted decision to be honest.

186
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:49,200
 We're going to have to move on very soon. Okay. In China, people were pajamas quite a lot. In

187
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,840
 their evenings, people will just go out wearing pajamas. In 2010, they had pajama police in Shanghai

188
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,360
 to stop people from wearing pajamas because there was an expo in town and they didn't want people to

189
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,760
 think that they were sluvinely or whatever. So, they tried to stop anyone from wearing pajamas

190
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,360
 and they even had celebrities on TV saying that the idea of going out in pajamas was backward

191
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,320
 and uncivilized. But what's the definition of pajamas? I just think that's really hard to police.

192
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,440
 But I think they do like in Japan. So, in the survey that was down asking if people wear

193
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,600
 pajamas or wear something else in bed or sleep naked, the Brits love to sleep naked, actually.

194
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,760
 We're up there in the top naked sleeping countries, 30% of us, only 12% in the US. In Japan,

195
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,200
 in the survey, it wasn't even a zero percent. It was just not applicable. I think the Japanese

196
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,720
 were just like, "I'm not going to answer that question." That is disgusting. So, yeah, they're not

197
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,480
 up for it. Okay, should we move on to our next panel? Okay, it is time for fact number three and

198
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,160
 that is Andrew Hunter Murray. My fact this week is that there are people who mine for jeans.

199
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,360
 They literally go into mines looking for jeans. Yeah, this is really amazing. So, it's basically

200
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,800
 back in the day when people were doing mining, they would bring their jeans down, leave eyes were

201
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,760
 made kind of specifically for mining. And then for some reason, this is the bit I haven't worked

202
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,840
 out in the story. They would come up without their jeans. And so, you know, it's warm, isn't it?

203
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,120
 You've got to, yeah, but there are lots of things left down there. There are loads of silver mines

204
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,360
 in the American West, which are just completely abandoned. And so, there is a thriving trade already

205
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,400
 in people who bring up old whiskey bottles because they were left down there when they'd been finished

206
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,600
 and collectors will pay for them so you can go down looking for them. And then there is a guy.

207
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,640
 There are several of these guys. One of them is called Michael Allen Harris and he found some old

208
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,680
 scraps of denim and he realised that a collector of sort of antique denim might pay good money for that too.

209
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,920
 And he has had an amazing run of going down with his father-in-law into these abandoned mines.

210
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:01,280
 He's sold one pair of jeans he found for $30,000 to a collector. And his father-in-law,

211
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,160
 it's really, really cool. He found the oldest ever pair of leave eyes that are from 1873,

212
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,480
 which is the first year of production. I don't think they've sold them yet,

213
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,840
 but those can sell for over $100,000, an intact pair of original, they were called waste overalls back then.

214
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,040
 I think he hadn't offered, didn't he? And he said he doesn't want to sell them.

215
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,240
 Yeah, he doesn't. He said I do have two daughters to put through college so I might reconsider,

216
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,720
 but now I'd rather own a really old pair of jeans that have $100,000.

217
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,440
 This still doesn't answer my question. Why were they going down to the mines and coming back

218
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,200
 up without their trousers on? Well, I think the heat is one reason, actually,

219
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,760
 but I think another reason is if there was like a pipe which had kind of leaked or something,

220
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,040
 they would take them off and tie them around pipes and stuff like that, because they

221
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,640
 were such a durable material. They were kind of useful for anything, really.

222
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,560
 Right. Maybe bring down an extra pair of jeans, that kind of stuff.

223
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,200
 Maybe that's what they did. Yeah. We don't have photographs of miners emerging

224
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,080
 and just like naked from the waist down. I do, but we'll talk about that later.

225
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,360
 There are people trying to mine asteroids at the moment. That's a big thing, isn't it?

226
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,000
 There's a load of metals in asteroids, and I think if they could somehow capture one and get up

227
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
 there and get all the metal out of there, then they'll be able to make a load of money.

228
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,640
 Yeah. Three quite big ears.

229
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,920
 Well, they reckon a single asteroid will be worth $60 trillion if they could mine it.

230
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,160
 It's a company called Planetary Resources, which is backed by James Cameron,

231
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,360
 the film director, and they're going to try and do this.

232
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,640
 And I worked out that if they managed to get this asteroid, then he could remake Avatar every day

233
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,800
 for the next 1,000 years. So fingers crossed, everyone.

234
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,160
 A famous movie made in one day.

235
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:55,280
 So another thing about mines and miners, this is very cool.

236
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,320
 There are some miners who are called ghost miners in South Africa, in the mines there.

237
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,920
 They live underground and they're not official mine employees, but they sneak into the mines

238
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,400
 when security is distracted. And then they then live underground.

239
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,520
 And they just look for ghosts.

240
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,320
 Ah, I've misexplained very poorly here.

241
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,760
 So yeah, they live underground and their skin goes gray because they don't ever see the sun again.

242
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,000
 And there's this whole economy because they can mine sort of extra dangerous bits which have

243
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,200
 been abandoned by the main body of the miners. And so where a loaf of bread might cost one dollar

244
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,240
 above ground to smuggle it into a mine, you'll pay $12 underground for it.

245
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,920
 So this whole secret economy going on underground in these mines.

246
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,800
 Yeah, yeah.

247
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,840
 Yeah, that's out. Well, I mean, just in terms of underground economy, we talked about this, I think,

248
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,880
 on the podcast, ages ago, the large Hadron collider is actually used for smuggling fruit across

249
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,480
 from one country to another because apparently it's cheaper to buy fruit.

250
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,400
 And they fire it through the ludge.

251
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,880
 Never makes it through.

252
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,560
 That's how smooth these are made, just to put that as smashing into each other.

253
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,160
 It's amazing they're so cheap really, isn't it?

254
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,080
 How expensive is fruit in France?

255
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,360
 How many Higgs boson false positives did they get? Which turned out to just be a pair, do we know?

256
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
 Can I do something on jeans very quickly?

257
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,800
 Yeah, of course.

258
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,400
 Okay, a hipster's skinny jeans have filed a group of would-be thieves because they were

259
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,240
 unable to remove his belongings from his exceptionally tight pockets.

260
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:40,800
 German cents 27 told the New York Post they couldn't even get a finger in.

261
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,080
 Oh my god!

262
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,080
 Even though they appeared to him and the guys of the Pope.

263
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,320
 And they, the squabbling thieves gave up after two minutes.

264
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,040
 So they were two minutes trying to get in there.

265
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,520
 Wow.

266
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
 The hips are just starting there going, yeah, I'll tell you the time, I know I'm safe.

267
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,640
 There was a thing like that in Cuba, in post-revolutionary Cuba, there was a thing called the lemon test

268
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,920
 where you would be stopped on the street by gangs of revolutionaries and they would, to make sure

269
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,080
 your trousers weren't too tight and cool and American looking, they would try and get a lemon

270
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,720
 through your waistband and down through your trousers to the, to the, the hem of your trousers.

271
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,040
 Really?

272
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,840
 And if a lemon would pass through then you were okay and if a lemon wouldn't pass through then

273
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
 you got some on the spot tailoring.

274
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,280
 Yeah, they were very popular in Cuba and you're not allowed to wear jeans in a North

275
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,240
 career at all because they're a sign of American capsules Monday.

276
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,360
 But actually that being too tight thing defeats the original purpose of jeans because

277
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,160
 so the word jeans is from a genoa where they were first designed and they were worn by fishermen

278
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,120
 and they were worn specifically, they were designed to be easy to remove if a fisherman fell

279
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,800
 overboard. So the point of jeans was meant to be that you could whip them off in the air in order

280
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,240
 that you didn't drown, yeah.

281
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,480
 Why is he trying to take his jeans off?

282
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
 I think they get waterlogged and weigh it down.

283
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,240
 Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

284
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,000
 Yeah, but try to swim in jeans, it's very difficult.

285
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,720
 I've never tried to swim in jeans.

286
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,680
 Actually I have, you did that survival test when you were at school.

287
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,640
 When you took jeans.

288
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,520
 I know that you have to go in pajamas but Andy was just wearing one sock.

289
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,600
 I ace that test.

290
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 And then I went back a second time to get the sock.

291
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:33,840
 We're going to have to move on very soon to the final fact, anything before we do.

292
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,720
 This is the most bizarre case, the world's most expensive pair of jeans in a way.

293
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,680
 Do you guys know about these? The Pearson versus Chung jeans?

294
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:49,120
 Right, so this is a lawsuit that was launched in 2005 when this judge called Roy Pearson,

295
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,640
 who lived in the US, took his jeans to be cleaned for $10.

296
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,920
 And he took them to a dry clean as it was owned by South Koreans,

297
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:02,880
 Key and Jin Mann, Chung, and they lost the jeans and he claimed that they owed him $67 million.

298
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
 That was for things like the emotional damage, the mental anguish,

299
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
 the legal fees he had to pay to launch this court case.

300
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
 And the 66 million pounds he added his pocket.

301
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,400
 And this went on for years.

302
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,800
 So it was only settled in about 2010, I think.

303
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,960
 At one point, so Mr. Pearson, because he was a judge,

304
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
 represented himself in court and at one point he broke down in tears

305
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,320
 and had to take a break from testimony while questioning himself because he grew too emotional.

306
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,960
 Also, they said, so at one point, about a week after he launched the court case,

307
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,040
 they were in court and the Chung said that we found the jeans.

308
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,840
 Okay, they were just in the back of the dry cleaners and they brought the jeans into court.

309
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,400
 And they were like, these are your jeans, aren't they? These are your trousers, aren't they?

310
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,320
 And he said, he insisted, these are not my pants.

311
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,680
 I have in my adult life with one exception, never worn pants with cuffs.

312
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,160
 But we don't know what that exception was.

313
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,040
 All right, I'm going to move us on to our final fact.

314
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,640
 Time for our final fact of the evening and that is my fact.

315
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,640
 My fact this week is that Jesus had a monobrow.

316
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,520
 No way.

317
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
 Well, okay, yeah, good point.

318
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,560
 As a fair point.

319
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,520
 So basically, there's not many descriptions of Jesus out there.

320
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,600
 We don't have any first-hand accounts.

321
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,680
 We have one description which it turns out was written by someone who never existed.

322
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,560
 And that's quite a classic, quite a classic description.

323
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,680
 But there's a guy called Tom Schivers and he's on Twitter,

324
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,440
 so highly recommend checking out because he has an amazing blog and he writes a lot about this stuff.

325
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,880
 And he was looking through a lot of descriptions of Jesus

326
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,080
 and various different texts over the years and ancient texts.

327
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,480
 And he found this constant line that came up which was with eyebrows meeting.

328
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,000
 So it happened in at least three texts that there was the the Coptic Acts of Paul and Thachler.

329
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,960
 And Paul describes him as a man small and size, bold-headed with eyebrows meeting.

330
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,960
 And there's a monk who also put it, it's just counts accounts.

331
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,480
 I say countless.

332
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,720
 Three accounts, that is round.

333
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,880
 But potentially, Jesus had a monobrow.

334
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,600
 And I think that's a cool thing, yeah.

335
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,720
 We don't, so the Bible doesn't really describe Jesus' appearance almost at all, does it?

336
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,280
 There's one account in the book of revelations, I think, where it says that his feet were like

337
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,600
 onto burnt brass, who knows what that means.

338
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,920
 His head and his hairs were white like wool and white as snow.

339
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,560
 This vision is usually considered to refer to Jesus in heavenly form,

340
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,320
 not his appearance during his earthly life in that he had a completely white head.

341
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,240
 I guess, but that's the only description I think that comes straight from the New Testament.

342
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,480
 Yeah, there are a bunch of those descriptions where they say that his face

343
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,680
 was like the appearance of lightning and all these descriptions.

344
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,600
 And I did think at the time, you know, if you were trying to describe what someone

345
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,960
 looked like to a police sketch artist, that was very unhelpful.

346
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,760
 Had hair like wool, face like lightning.

347
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,960
 You were attacked by a collage of weird random things.

348
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,360
 There was a first century historian called Josephus who wrote that Jesus

349
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,200
 stood three qubits high and a qubit at the time on average,

350
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,200
 because it was a variable measurement, but it was about 18 inches.

351
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,400
 A three qubits is 56 inches, which is 4 foot 8.

352
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,640
 So I think it might have been Yoda all along.

353
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,560
 The gospel of Luke, this is like a gospel.

354
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,880
 It was written obviously a long time after Jesus died.

355
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,720
 But there's someone called Zaccheus trying to see Jesus preaching.

356
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,840
 And he says, and he sought to see Jesus, who he was.

357
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,880
 And he could not for the crowd because he was low of stature.

358
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,120
 So I think with Zaccheus, he was a small guy because he climbed up a tree to be able to see Jesus.

359
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,520
 But he might have only had to climb up the tree because Jesus was so sure.

360
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,560
 That is an excellent sign.

361
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,160
 I think it's not even specified, yeah.

362
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
 Yeah, that's a good pipe.

363
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,400
 Much more detailed descriptions of Jesus come from Islam, which obviously was much later.

364
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,760
 But in Quran and Hadith traditions, they have lots of physical descriptions of Jesus.

365
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,360
 Because Muhammad, I think, met him when he went up to heaven.

366
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,960
 And there were various other descriptions.

367
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,320
 They often they contradict each other.

368
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,840
 So at some point he's curly head and at some points he's straight head, although he might have had like crimpers or something.

369
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,760
 Also, he doesn't have a beard in the oldest portrait that we have of him, which is a Syrian one in 235 AD.

370
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,280
 So he didn't have a beard until about the fourth century in depictions.

371
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,600
 He was based on a sort of classical Roman gods for the first few hundred years.

372
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,040
 Wasn't he, and he has a curly blonde hair and completely well-shaved face.

373
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,080
 I just think it's amazing how quickly we were told this is the image of someone from history

374
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,120
 where it must be quite hard to have known exactly what they look like.

375
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,880
 And we just accept it and we never question it.

376
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,000
 I mean, Shakespeare, by all accounts, mustn't have looked like he does.

377
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
 Because the people who drew that of him, they didn't meet him.

378
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,640
 He'd been dead for a long time.

379
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
 Jane Austen, we only have one picture of her drawn by her sister,

380
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,440
 who everyone said throughout her life was a crap drawer.

381
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,960
 So it's just obviously not going to look quite like that.

382
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,800
 She's going on the bank notes pretty soon.

383
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,760
 The one that they, the picture that they've chosen is a very purified later Victorian

384
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
 representation of Jane Austen.

385
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,720
 And it's not anywhere near like the picture that her sister drew of her.

386
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,120
 So yeah, it's very, very inaccurate.

387
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,880
 Another person who you one necessarily think looked as they did.

388
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,280
 John Wilkes Booth, who shot Erlingon.

389
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,720
 He was described as the handsomest man in all America.

390
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,520
 He wasn't that tall, but people said that it was made up for

391
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,720
 by his extraordinary presence and magnetism.

392
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,120
 Whereas English political activist John Wilkes, without the Booth,

393
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,040
 he was famously ugly.

394
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,160
 He had a sloping forehead, hanging jaw, bad teeth, bad breath, a severe squint.

395
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,480
 And he was advised never to risk showing his face to a pregnant woman.

396
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,680
 Oh, my God.

397
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,040
 But he didn't kill anyone.

398
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,880
 That's true.

399
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,160
 Oh, my God.

400
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,520
 Was he able to that sentence?

401
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,080
 But he's my son, and I love him, and who did say that about it?

402
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,640
 I think it was probably one of his detractors.

403
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,200
 His detractors, they've never got a good word to say about you.

404
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,640
 Do you want to hear some cool stuff about eyebrows?

405
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,280
 Yes, please.

406
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,680
 Oh, yeah.

407
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
 OK.

408
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,560
 Well, this is more about facial expressions than eyebrows.

409
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,320
 But there's an author called David Eagleman,

410
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,360
 who is a great writer about science and neuroscience.

411
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,880
 And there's a fact in his latest book, which is just out,

412
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,640
 that when people have had Botox, they find it harder to recognize

413
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,880
 facial expressions in other people.

414
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,360
 What?

415
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,000
 Yeah.

416
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,960
 So they've tested people who've not had Botox treatments,

417
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,840
 and they've tested people who have had Botox treatments.

418
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,400
 And if you have, it's hard of you to mirror their facial expression.

419
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,760
 And it's hard of you to--

420
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,280
 literally, if you recognize what you're looking at on someone else's face.

421
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,720
 So if Dan looks baffled like you do now,

422
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,920
 I would kind of copy what you're doing,

423
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,800
 and then I would empathize in your baffled.

424
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,320
 Exactly.

425
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,680
 But this is the other cool thing is that married couples

426
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,160
 start to look like each other over time,

427
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,640
 because they are constantly mirroring each other's facial expressions,

428
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,320
 and they get the same patterns of wrinkles.

429
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,880
 That is excellent news for me, but terrible news for my wife.

430
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,680
 [LAUGHTER]

431
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,040
 Also, I was reading eyebrows.

432
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,840
 Eyebrows are the most essential bit of your head generally.

433
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,320
 I mean, I'm going to go close second after brain.

434
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,440
 Eyes, mouth, ears.

435
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,600
 Your eyebrows are the 19th most essential bit of your head.

436
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,320
 This is why I read.

437
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,480
 And no, they were saying because for communication,

438
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,200
 the eyebrows, actually, they do the talking when they're talking.

439
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
 If you're talking to someone--

440
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,520
 Not if you've kept your mouth on the tick-bolt sheet.

441
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,600
 [LAUGHTER]

442
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,320
 If you were talking to me, and you said,

443
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,280
 oh, can you believe this?

444
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,720
 I, with my eyebrows, would go, whoa.

445
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,640
 So if I shaved my eyebrows, you wouldn't know what I was thinking.

446
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,480
 Yeah, I think that's similar to the Botox thing, I guess, right?

447
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,880
 I read somewhere that eyebrows evolved partly

448
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,160
 because they aid in sex differentiation in humans.

449
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,320
 So people kept on accidentally trying

450
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,720
 to procreate with the same sex.

451
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,280
 And so they gave men slightly thicker eyebrows.

452
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,840
 That did seem to be what they were saying.

453
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,240
 And you just look at one of those two things.

454
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,760
 [LAUGHTER]

455
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,240
 But here's the weird thing about that,

456
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,280
 which I thought that was weird, but apparently,

457
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,880
 computers can determine someone's gender, 96% of the time,

458
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,160
 just by looking at the eyebrows and nothing else.

459
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,160
 So why?

460
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,200
 Kind of makes sense.

461
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,200
 So we've kind of assumed that Mono-Brow is a negative aesthetic

462
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,280
 feature on Jesus.

463
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,000
 Oh, you haven't.

464
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,640
 No, I think that's great.

465
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,440
 I think people with Mono-Brow's

466
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,720
 are the great heroes of planet Earth.

467
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,400
 They constantly--

468
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,080
 Wow.

469
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,480
 Again, a bold claim.

470
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,000
 Well, it is the most essential bit of the head,

471
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,800
 and don't forget that.

472
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,880
 Who here has seen someone with the Mono-Brow

473
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,480
 and hasn't just stared at the Mono-Brow,

474
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,240
 the entire conversation that they've been having with them?

475
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,480
 And that says more about the person with the Mono-Brow

476
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,960
 than it does you the person staring,

477
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,920
 because it says to me that they're going,

478
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,120
 I know it's here.

479
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
 I know it's here, and I love it.

480
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,440
 And that's what I really like that.

481
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,720
 I think that the bravest humans alive.

482
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,800
 Well, so in--

483
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
 I can't see fire, I can't see fire, I like it.

484
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,200
 I'm going to call point of information on fire,

485
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,600
 but it's weird.

486
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,640
 My old list of best humans was one.

487
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,320
 People with Mono-Brow's, too, Jesus.

488
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,720
 Now Jesus has made his way to the top of the list.

489
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
 It's very amazing.

490
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,280
 So in Tajikistan, Mono-Brow's are attractive

491
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,920
 and sought after, aren't they?

492
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,200
 So in women, especially, and markets in Tajikistan,

493
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,960
 you can buy this herb, uzma, which women will buy.

494
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,280
 And you can rub it on your brow to make sure you turn those two

495
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,400
 eyebrows into one.

496
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,200
 And this is a desirable thing.

497
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,760
 And I think there might be the only country in the world

498
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,160
 where the Mono-Brow is genuinely desirable.

499
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,520
 Well, there may be a turning.

500
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,400
 So at the moment, in the NBA, one of the biggest stars.

501
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,680
 And we're talking at someone who's

502
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,560
 in the kind of level of Michael Jordan

503
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,840
 and of modern day.

504
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,560
 It's a guy called Anthony Davis.

505
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,240
 And he has a monobrow.

506
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,840
 And he has trademarked.

507
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,560
 Basically, he's turned his monobrow into a business.

508
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,680
 His monobrow has catchphrases that you

509
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,920
 would not allow to repeat on any product.

510
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,400
 It's fear of the brow and raise the brow.

511
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,000
 And he's turned his monobrow into an actual business now.

512
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,040
 And I didn't know that you could trade mine.

513
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,000
 I mean, the quote from him is, I don't want anyone else

514
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,320
 to try and grow a uni-brow because of me

515
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,680
 and then try to make money out of it.

516
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,080
 What else is suspicious is this man of other humans?

517
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,440
 What would Jesus have said if he had that?

518
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,600
 But I kind of-- I slightly like the idea of trademarking.

519
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,920
 Because when I realized you could trademark a simple thing

520
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,600
 like that towards a facial feature or something,

521
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,240
 I thought, well, who else has done that?

522
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
 And there's a guy, Michael Buffer.

523
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,800
 He was a boxing announcer.

524
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,600
 He was the person to say, let's get ready to rumble.

525
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,160
 That's his trademark.

526
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,360
 He has made, since he trademarked it--

527
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,000
 since he first set in, trademarked it-- $400,000

528
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,440
 American Dollars from movies using it, from TV shows

529
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,120
 using it songs.

530
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,960
 Yeah.

531
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
 There's a little more.

532
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,440
 How hard is it to come up with a different phrase that

533
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,760
 means basically the same thing?

534
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,480
 And then not have to pay this guy $400,000?

535
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,960
 Just say, let's get ready to tumble.

536
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,080
 And then--

537
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,520
 It's washing machine noise.

538
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,280
 Thanks, Carl.

539
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,560
 We're going to have to wrap up really soon.

540
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,640
 We've got any final facts.

541
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,760
 We want to throw in.

542
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,200
 The tactical name for the monobrow

543
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,400
 is Sinophrous, just so you know.

544
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,520
 And the founder of criminology, Cesare Lombrazo,

545
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,440
 thought that Sinophrous was a sure sign.

546
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,480
 You were a criminal.

547
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,200
 And that's the founder of criminology.

548
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,840
 One other thing as well.

549
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,920
 You can tell if dogs like you, because when they see you,

550
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,960
 they lift the left eyebrow upwards half a second

551
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,520
 after they first see you.

552
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,640
 And that was a study done using high-speed cameras.

553
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,240
 So that's one way to speak.

554
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,400
 They don't greyhounds.

555
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,440
 And as they pass the camera, they sort of give a little--

556
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,720
 Hey, how you doing?

557
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,400
 Why high-speed cameras?

558
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,920
 Just so that, because actually, it's

559
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
 a very, very microscopic little life.

560
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,560
 You can either see if its eyebrow is very slightly raised

561
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,200
 or you can work out if you are the person that provides

562
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,400
 its food every day.

563
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,440
 And one of those two things will tell you

564
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,320
 if a dog likes you.

565
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,680
 If a dog doesn't like you, it bites your penis off.

566
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,000
 [LAUGHTER]

567
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,320
 No high-speed camera necessary for that one.

568
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,400
 [LAUGHTER]

569
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,640
 OK, that's it.

570
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,680
 That's all of our facts.

571
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,440
