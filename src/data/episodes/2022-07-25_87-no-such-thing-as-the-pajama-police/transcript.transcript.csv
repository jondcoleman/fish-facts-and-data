00:00:11,00:00:16,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:16,00:00:21,a weekly podcast this week coming to you from the Northwall Art Center in Oxford.
00:00:21,00:00:26,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to stage Andy Murray Anichesinski and James Harkin."
00:00:26,00:00:43,[ Cheers and applause ]
00:00:43,00:00:48,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:48,00:00:52,"and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Chuzinski."
00:00:52,00:00:57,"Yep, my fact this week is that the world's only Cornish Pasty Museum is in Mexico."
00:00:57,00:01:00,[ Laughter ]
00:01:00,00:01:06,These planning permission things are cool. So why and when did it go up?
00:01:06,00:01:11,"Well, so this is because there's actually a significant like Cornish diaspora in Mexico,"
00:01:11,00:01:16,"because Mexico needed miners in the early 19th century, a bunch of Cornish men emigrated out there,"
00:01:16,00:01:20,"and they brought their pasties with them, and pasties have been a delicacy in Mexico,"
00:01:20,00:01:26,"and it's particularly in these two areas. It's in the municipality of Real Del Monte,"
00:01:26,00:01:31,"and yeah, and a place called Pachuca. Pachusa. I don't know. Is there any Mexicans in here who"
00:01:31,00:01:37,"are going to correct me on that? No, cool. But yeah, it's 4,500 miles away from Cornwall,"
00:01:37,00:01:41,and it is a Cornish Pasty Museum. It was set off about five years ago.
00:01:41,00:01:45,What's in a Cornish Pasty Museum? I feel like the clue is in the title.
00:01:46,00:01:51,Some medieval helmets and a viking ship. It's actually miss me.
00:01:51,00:01:53,"I mean, once you've seen a Cornish Pasty, I'm Andy."
00:01:53,00:01:56,You have not seen a Cornish Pasty.
00:01:56,00:01:59,"Yeah, it seems like it's partly a culinary school disguises a museum."
00:01:59,00:02:04,"There's a pasty-making lessons, and in fact, so recent, I think, in 2014,"
00:02:04,00:02:08,a team of Mexican bakers took a trip to Cornwall so they could pick up some new tips
00:02:08,00:02:12,"about how to make pasties, specifically the art of crimping, which is, you know,"
00:02:12,00:02:17,"getting that little handhold bit on the side, right? There is actually going to be a Cornish Pasty"
00:02:17,00:02:21,Museum in the UK soon. Where will it be? Orkney?
00:02:21,00:02:29,"No, this is a guy called Malcolm Ball. He's hoping to open what he's calling a planet Hollywood"
00:02:29,00:02:36,with a Cornish Pasty twist. And he said he started to research whether there's any visitor
00:02:36,00:02:42,"attractions in the UK focusing on the Cornish Pasty, and that was absolutely staggered"
00:02:42,00:02:44,to find out that there wasn't a single one.
00:02:44,00:02:53,"Is the twist on the planet Hollywood thing that it's got no celebrities, no memorabilia,"
00:02:53,00:02:57,"and is just Cornish Pasty? There's going to be memorabilia, but it'll be pasty memorabilia."
00:02:57,00:03:03,"Pasties. Yeah, yeah. So if anyone listens to this in a year, I wanted to say, please don't"
00:03:03,00:03:07,write in and say my fact was wrong. It just will be wrong in about six months' time because
00:03:07,00:03:11,"there is going to be a second pasty museum. But, yeah, the Cornish had a really big influence"
00:03:11,00:03:17,"in Mexico. So they also imported football in the 1890s, I think it was about, set up the first"
00:03:17,00:03:24,"football team in Mexico. And in fact, FIFA's only football hall of fame is now in Patroosa,"
00:03:24,00:03:30,in that little town in Mexico. Wow. Yeah. I was looking into the history of Cornish Pasties.
00:03:30,00:03:35,"And in the early days, both husband and wife would initial the husband's name onto the end of"
00:03:35,00:03:40,"the Cornish Pasty so that they knew it was their lunchbox effectively. So you could go, that's my"
00:03:40,00:03:48,"Cornish Pasty. Look, Darren is written on it. And then also to test whether a good Cornish Pasty"
00:03:48,00:03:54,"is good as it can be, is that they would drop it down a mine and if it survives, then they're like,"
00:03:54,00:03:59,that's a damn good Cornish Pasty. They dropped it down a mine. They didn't drop it down a mine.
00:03:59,00:04:02,So are the internet. People do say that. That also implies that a good way to test for a good
00:04:02,00:04:08,"Cornish Pasty is try and bite into it. And if you can't, then it probably is good. The fact of"
00:04:08,00:04:12,"dropping a Cornish Pasty down a mine is much greater than biting it. So if it does survive, then it's"
00:04:12,00:04:18,inedible. Yeah. I read the other day that it's impossible to tell if an apple is ripe without biting
00:04:18,00:04:23,"into it. But I'm not sure anyone's ever thought of putting it down a mine. Yeah, just drop it down a"
00:04:23,00:04:28,"mine. Yeah. The thing with the, with the initials on the Pasty, what they used to do is they used to"
00:04:28,00:04:33,"hold it kind of, kind of upright and they would keep the initial at the bottom and then we'd eat"
00:04:33,00:04:38,it from the top. And so you would always kind of have the initial at the bottom for the whole thing.
00:04:38,00:04:42,"And then once you got down to the bottom with the initial, you would throw it away. And you'd throw"
00:04:42,00:04:48,"it for what they called the mining gremlins. Oh, they called them knockers. Did they? Yes. They were the"
00:04:48,00:04:53,"sort of little people in the mines who, if they, you gave them a bit of food, they wouldn't give you"
00:04:53,00:04:58,"bad luck. You also, some people say that they didn't eat the, the reason they have that handled"
00:04:58,00:05:03,"bit, the crimped handled bit was to hold on to. And that was discarded at the end because so Corn"
00:05:03,00:05:08,"was the, it had the largest tin mining, but it also had the largest arsenic mining. There's a lot"
00:05:08,00:05:13,"of arsenic down there. And so these miners hands were covered in arsenic, which they didn't want to eat."
00:05:13,00:05:19,"So I think they chucked away the bit they held on to. Mind for arsenic. Yeah, apparently Corn was one"
00:05:19,00:05:22,of the country's biggest providers of arsenic. Do you not get your arsenic supplies from Cornwall?
00:05:22,00:05:28,"We, I do, obviously, I do. And also they're throwing the food down into the arsenic mines before"
00:05:28,00:05:36,"they eat it. Yeah. Just pick it up, three-second rule, brush off the arsenic. They'd have a different"
00:05:36,00:05:44,"second rule. It takes a long time to get there. Right. You know the chant that goes oggy, oggy,"
00:05:44,00:05:49,"oggy, oggy, oggy, oggy. Yeah, there you go, but not in that tone of voice in like a different tone"
00:05:49,00:05:55,"of voice. So that chant is thought to come from the Cornish word for pasty, which is hoggan or"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"hoggan, and it's thought, and this again is probably just missed. It's been passed down the generations,"
00:05:59,00:06:05,"but at lunchtime the wives would come to the top of the mines and they'd shout out oggy, oggy, oggy,"
00:06:05,00:06:09,"and the miners downstairs would go, oh, oh, oh, oh, and they'd be like, all right, he wants it."
00:06:09,00:06:15,And then you do the drop test. And then you drop them. Countless miners were killed by their
00:06:15,00:06:21,"rock hard pasties. Goals of death, lunch, lunch, lunch."
00:06:23,00:06:30,"I read a dictionary of slang from 1811, the gross dictionary of slang, and the only thing for pasties"
00:06:30,00:06:37,"that I could find is that to deliver a flying pasty meant to take a poo, wrap it in paper, and throw"
00:06:37,00:06:49,it over a neighbor's wall. You didn't get that from a dictionary. I was going to mention I
00:06:49,00:06:55,"thought it would be a bit to like just juvenile to do, but since you bring it up, I read a story about,"
00:06:55,00:06:58,it was about a someone's housemate who got evicted from the house because they found them eating a
00:06:58,00:07:04,"pasty full of poo. And they said, yeah, so here's the thing, he wasn't feeding it to anyone else."
00:07:04,00:07:09,"He was just mining his own business, having a pasty on his own in the kitchen, and then they said,"
00:07:09,00:07:12,"we don't want someone eating poo. He said he wasn't feeding it to anyone, but she did make the good"
00:07:12,00:07:16,"point and she didn't want to use the oven afterwards, which I think is totally fair. Something else that's"
00:07:16,00:07:22,"disgusting that goes into college pasties. They used to put jam at the bottom and meat at the top,"
00:07:22,00:07:26,"didn't they? And so that was so that you could have a full meal, you'd have your first boss there,"
00:07:26,00:07:31,and you're putting at the end. But there must have been a bit in between that was kind of jammy meat.
00:07:31,00:07:36,"That was sorbet. Yeah, it's a nice palette cleanser for the gourmet miner."
00:07:36,00:07:43,"We're going to have to move on to the next bag. Soonish, if you guys have anything else?"
00:07:43,00:07:49,"Okay, can I just say a thing about museums? I found this thing the other day. Apparently in 1846,"
00:07:49,00:07:57,"a snail arrived at the British Museum. As I read that, and they said, you're late, where are you being?"
00:07:57,00:08:03,"Yeah, someone sent a snail into the British Museum, and it was stuck onto a piece of cardboard,"
00:08:03,00:08:10,and then they noticed four years later that the card was slightly discolored. They put it all into
00:08:10,00:08:15,"some warm water, and it turned out that the snail wasn't dead, and it woke up, and it became really"
00:08:15,00:08:20,"famous, and it was like the most famous snail in Britain in 1850. That's not a composition in that year,"
00:08:20,00:08:28,"1850. 1850, that was. It was so famous, it was painted by John William Waterhouse. What kind of?"
00:08:28,00:08:37,"I just like that that there was a most famous snail in Britain, and Waterhouse I like as well,"
00:08:37,00:08:43,"because he painted pre-Raphaelite style, but like decades after everyone's lights. He didn't really"
00:08:43,00:08:48,"want to do it anymore, so he was like a post-pre-Raphaelite. I think they just call them ""Raphaelites."""
00:08:48,00:08:55,Have we got any more on this? I think a good thing to look into if you fancy or researching more about
00:08:55,00:09:00,"Cornish pasties is the British newspaper archive, where I was reading up on other 19th century pasties"
00:09:00,00:09:05,"stories, and there were a couple of good ones, so one of them was a travel writer in the Leeds Times in"
00:09:05,00:09:11,"1861, a visited Cornwall, and said of the pasties, ""The name is generally applicable to anything that by"
00:09:11,00:09:15,"any stretch of the culinary imagination could be conceived as existing under a crust."""
00:09:15,00:09:23,"So he wasn't a fan, and in 1889 two Cornish miners got trapped in a mine, so they were stuck underground,"
00:09:23,00:09:28,and all they had to eat was four pasties that their wives had given them before. They got
00:09:28,00:09:32,"trapped underground. They were trapped underground for four and a half days, and they didn't even"
00:09:32,00:09:40,"finish the pasties, because they were unfit to eat apparently, so yeah. This one's been in"
00:09:40,00:09:46,"the ground for four seconds because of the Leeds. Okay, I'm going to move us on to our next fact,"
00:09:46,00:09:52,"and that is James Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that 20% of people wake up wearing fewer"
00:09:52,00:09:58,clothes than they went to bed with. Do we know who's removing them? Do we know who's taking them on?
00:09:58,00:10:04,"We don't know. Well, we think probably them. Okay. All the clothes fairy. Well, there is one theory"
00:10:04,00:10:08,"that if you wake, if you go to bed wearing pajamas and you wake up not wearing them, you've been"
00:10:08,00:10:13,"abducted by aliens. There's a website called Abduct Anon, and it says, ""How to tell if you've been"
00:10:13,00:10:18,"abducted by aliens?"" And that's one of them. If you enter bed wearing pajamas and you woke up"
00:10:18,00:10:24,"nude, that's one of them. The other one is electronic appliances behave strangely when you pass by."
00:10:24,00:10:30,Another one is you have an uncontrollable urge to take vitamins. Don't really understand that one.
00:10:30,00:10:35,"Three out of three so far. And the other one, I really like this, the scene of your"
00:10:35,00:10:42,abduction has been staged to look as if nothing happened. So if you ever wake up in the morning
00:10:42,00:10:49,"and everything looks exactly the same, it's aliens I'm afraid. I was really that when aliens do"
00:10:49,00:10:54,"abduct humans, I don't believe it, by the way, but when they when they say they adopt them, the abductees"
00:10:54,00:11:00,"say that when they get up there, the aliens do some probes and they often have to do it in a sort of"
00:11:00,00:11:06,"slightly inappropriate kind of sexual manner, they try and transform their bodies so that they look"
00:11:06,00:11:11,"as if they're comfortable sights to you. So it just feels like, ""Oh, this is this is quite a nice"
00:11:11,00:11:18,"scene."" And the list of things that they dress up as body-wise is the Pope. That's the thing that's"
00:11:18,00:11:25,most likely to put something up your ass. The other is a deceased relative and that's what they say
00:11:25,00:11:32,"will make you feel like, ""Well, this is a pleasant experience."" I do this. I do this. I do what they say."
00:11:32,00:11:42,I'm drawing this. I can't bring it back to the conversation before. I wake up sometimes not
00:11:42,00:11:49,"wearing, if I have socks on, when I go to sleep, I wake up not wearing the socks. Yeah, um, 13. I'm so"
00:11:49,00:11:54,uncomfortable telling you that as well. I feel like you've all been left in now. You're not wearing
00:11:54,00:12:07,"the sock on your penis, are you? Look, my room is drafty and cold. And I'm a real man, I don't"
00:12:07,00:12:14,"wear pajamas. Oh, god. Do you actually wake up with no socks? Yeah. Thank you. What did you say?"
00:12:14,00:12:23,"I've got a friend and supporter in tonight. So anyway, so this was a, it was a survey by a memory foam"
00:12:23,00:12:28,mattress company called Ergo Flex. And they said that socks are the most commonly removed item
00:12:28,00:12:34,"with 31% of people who remove things saying that they don't keep them on at night. So you're in,"
00:12:34,00:12:39,"you know, a good company. One of the other things I found is that the average length of time"
00:12:39,00:12:45,"men wear pajamas before washing them is 13 nights. And women, it's 17 nights."
00:12:45,00:12:52,Whereas we all know the correct answer is you're in for one night and then you incinerate them.
00:12:52,00:12:58,"And you buy a new pen. So when you say you're a real man, you don't wear pajamas."
00:12:58,00:13:06,Are we so glossed over that? I think whether that's a thing because there was a survey done
00:13:06,00:13:10,"into who wears pajamas and who doesn't and far, far fewer men wear pajamas than women."
00:13:10,00:13:16,So I think it was something like 13% of men wear pajamas and about 30% of women do. So is this
00:13:16,00:13:21,something in the male community that sort of is emasculating? I think it's thought of as being not
00:13:21,00:13:30,"the act of a room and where I've got six pairs of soap operas, I'm fine. One sock. In the survey"
00:13:30,00:13:35,"they did, people were asked what they wore in bed and one percent of people said they had no opinion."
00:13:35,00:13:41,The aliens look after that stuff to be honest with you.
00:13:41,00:13:49,The idea of doing things while you're asleep is called parasomnia. And there have been examples
00:13:49,00:13:54,"of people doing various things. Texting while asleep, eating while asleep is a bad one because"
00:13:54,00:13:59,"you can put on a lot of weight. Driving cars while asleep, there's one or two people who've done that."
00:13:59,00:14:04,And there was one sleep doctor who described how he treated someone who dismantled
00:14:04,00:14:10,"grandfather clocks while asleep. There's, you know, you used to be able to text in their sleep."
00:14:10,00:14:18,"Yeah. There was a, the first example of someone using the internet while asleep was in 2008."
00:14:18,00:14:24,"And this was a 44-year-old woman who in her, in her sleep, she got out of bed, she went over to her"
00:14:24,00:14:29,"computer, she logged in and she fired off three emails. One of which read, ""Come tomorrow and"
00:14:29,00:14:33,"sort this hellhole out. Dinner and drinks 4pm. Bring wine and caviar only."""
00:14:33,00:14:37,"Awesome dream, was she?"
00:14:37,00:14:43,There's a really cool thing as well that they've noticed in recent times when they've been doing
00:14:43,00:14:49,studies that anyone playing video games and so younger children and really cool awesome adults.
00:14:49,00:14:57,"They have ability, they say, in their dream to suddenly take charge and control the dream"
00:14:57,00:15:01,as if they were playing called duty or something like that. So they don't have nightmares because
00:15:01,00:15:06,"nightmares for them are a challenge where they can then slaughter dragons and sort out, I don't know."
00:15:06,00:15:11,"Yeah, it's called lucid dreaming, right? Yeah. The idea is that you keep looking at your watch"
00:15:11,00:15:15,during the day and then you start dreaming that you're looking at your watch and you realise that
00:15:15,00:15:18,"it's not moving and then you can realise you're in a dream, as soon as you realise you're in a dream,"
00:15:18,00:15:21,then you can start doing things in there. And there are quite a few people who can do it.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"I've done it a couple of times, but only a couple of times my whole life I can remember having a lucid dream."
00:15:25,00:15:32,"Wow. It's really cool. Yeah, I bet. I just fly. Just a quick thing on pajamas."
00:15:32,00:15:38,"I was looking for information on astronaut pajamas, what they were in space, whether they were"
00:15:38,00:15:43,"wear pajamas, whether they take them. And so I googled do astronauts immediately type in wear"
00:15:43,00:15:49,pajamas. And the first thing that came up is do astronauts masturbate in space? So I clicked
00:15:49,00:15:56,"on that instead. There's a website called Quora where people write their own answers to questions,"
00:15:56,00:16:00,people post up. And there was an article on Quora which gave an answer and I just wanted to read it out.
00:16:00,00:16:05,"This is the answer on Quora. This is at least the tenth time I've answered a question about sex,"
00:16:05,00:16:11,"masturbation, or romance in space. Please search before posting. And it goes on, it gives the answer."
00:16:11,00:16:17,"He says, ""Yes, each astronaut has a private sleeping area."" No, there isn't a space just for masturbation."
00:16:17,00:16:24,"No, the guy's a NASA would have built that into a station."
00:16:24,00:16:29,"Well, we've got the sleeping quarters, the masturbatorium."
00:16:30,00:16:33,Sorry.
00:16:33,00:16:41,"There was an article in the Daily Mail which said, ""I should have really looked into whether this"
00:16:41,00:16:46,"could possibly be right."" But it said it had interviewed an independent sleep expert who said that"
00:16:46,00:16:51,"""Resist the temptation to strip off at nights when you're hot and muggy. It's actually cooler if"
00:16:51,00:16:56,you wear pajamas because the pajama fabric draws sweat away from your body and will make you feel a
00:16:56,00:17:00,"lot cooler and more comfortable."" So, doesn't that imply that whenever you're too hot, you should put more"
00:17:00,00:17:07,"clothes on? Can that be true? I don't know. It doesn't sound very true, does it? It really doesn't."
00:17:07,00:17:14,"Speaking of things that happen while you were asleep, a 64-year-old man has told how he passed out"
00:17:14,00:17:20,after a heavy night's drinking and woke up to find that his penis was missing. Neighbours of
00:17:20,00:17:26,Gerardo Ramos claimed that he was attacked by a dog as he stumbled around the Dominican Republic
00:17:26,00:17:34,naked while drunk. He has decided to stop drinking. Sounds like a good decision.
00:17:34,00:17:38,It sounds like a bit of a stable door and horse-bolted decision to be honest.
00:17:38,00:17:49,"We're going to have to move on very soon. Okay. In China, people were pajamas quite a lot. In"
00:17:49,00:17:55,"their evenings, people will just go out wearing pajamas. In 2010, they had pajama police in Shanghai"
00:17:55,00:18:01,to stop people from wearing pajamas because there was an expo in town and they didn't want people to
00:18:01,00:18:05,"think that they were sluvinely or whatever. So, they tried to stop anyone from wearing pajamas"
00:18:05,00:18:11,and they even had celebrities on TV saying that the idea of going out in pajamas was backward
00:18:11,00:18:18,and uncivilized. But what's the definition of pajamas? I just think that's really hard to police.
00:18:18,00:18:21,"But I think they do like in Japan. So, in the survey that was down asking if people wear"
00:18:21,00:18:25,"pajamas or wear something else in bed or sleep naked, the Brits love to sleep naked, actually."
00:18:25,00:18:31,"We're up there in the top naked sleeping countries, 30% of us, only 12% in the US. In Japan,"
00:18:31,00:18:37,"in the survey, it wasn't even a zero percent. It was just not applicable. I think the Japanese"
00:18:37,00:18:42,"were just like, ""I'm not going to answer that question."" That is disgusting. So, yeah, they're not"
00:18:42,00:18:48,"up for it. Okay, should we move on to our next panel? Okay, it is time for fact number three and"
00:18:48,00:18:54,that is Andrew Hunter Murray. My fact this week is that there are people who mine for jeans.
00:18:54,00:19:01,"They literally go into mines looking for jeans. Yeah, this is really amazing. So, it's basically"
00:19:01,00:19:06,"back in the day when people were doing mining, they would bring their jeans down, leave eyes were"
00:19:06,00:19:11,"made kind of specifically for mining. And then for some reason, this is the bit I haven't worked"
00:19:11,00:19:17,"out in the story. They would come up without their jeans. And so, you know, it's warm, isn't it?"
00:19:17,00:19:23,"You've got to, yeah, but there are lots of things left down there. There are loads of silver mines"
00:19:23,00:19:27,"in the American West, which are just completely abandoned. And so, there is a thriving trade already"
00:19:27,00:19:32,in people who bring up old whiskey bottles because they were left down there when they'd been finished
00:19:32,00:19:37,and collectors will pay for them so you can go down looking for them. And then there is a guy.
00:19:37,00:19:42,There are several of these guys. One of them is called Michael Allen Harris and he found some old
00:19:42,00:19:47,scraps of denim and he realised that a collector of sort of antique denim might pay good money for that too.
00:19:47,00:19:53,And he has had an amazing run of going down with his father-in-law into these abandoned mines.
00:19:53,00:20:01,"He's sold one pair of jeans he found for $30,000 to a collector. And his father-in-law,"
00:20:01,00:20:06,"it's really, really cool. He found the oldest ever pair of leave eyes that are from 1873,"
00:20:06,00:20:10,"which is the first year of production. I don't think they've sold them yet,"
00:20:10,00:20:17,"but those can sell for over $100,000, an intact pair of original, they were called waste overalls back then."
00:20:17,00:20:21,"I think he hadn't offered, didn't he? And he said he doesn't want to sell them."
00:20:21,00:20:26,"Yeah, he doesn't. He said I do have two daughters to put through college so I might reconsider,"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"but now I'd rather own a really old pair of jeans that have $100,000."
00:20:30,00:20:35,This still doesn't answer my question. Why were they going down to the mines and coming back
00:20:35,00:20:39,"up without their trousers on? Well, I think the heat is one reason, actually,"
00:20:39,00:20:43,"but I think another reason is if there was like a pipe which had kind of leaked or something,"
00:20:43,00:20:47,"they would take them off and tie them around pipes and stuff like that, because they"
00:20:47,00:20:50,"were such a durable material. They were kind of useful for anything, really."
00:20:50,00:20:54,"Right. Maybe bring down an extra pair of jeans, that kind of stuff."
00:20:54,00:21:01,Maybe that's what they did. Yeah. We don't have photographs of miners emerging
00:21:01,00:21:06,"and just like naked from the waist down. I do, but we'll talk about that later."
00:21:06,00:21:11,"There are people trying to mine asteroids at the moment. That's a big thing, isn't it?"
00:21:11,00:21:16,"There's a load of metals in asteroids, and I think if they could somehow capture one and get up"
00:21:16,00:21:19,"there and get all the metal out of there, then they'll be able to make a load of money."
00:21:19,00:21:20,Yeah. Three quite big ears.
00:21:20,00:21:27,"Well, they reckon a single asteroid will be worth $60 trillion if they could mine it."
00:21:27,00:21:32,"It's a company called Planetary Resources, which is backed by James Cameron,"
00:21:32,00:21:35,"the film director, and they're going to try and do this."
00:21:35,00:21:40,"And I worked out that if they managed to get this asteroid, then he could remake Avatar every day"
00:21:40,00:21:44,"for the next 1,000 years. So fingers crossed, everyone."
00:21:44,00:21:48,A famous movie made in one day.
00:21:48,00:21:55,"So another thing about mines and miners, this is very cool."
00:21:56,00:22:02,"There are some miners who are called ghost miners in South Africa, in the mines there."
00:22:02,00:22:07,"They live underground and they're not official mine employees, but they sneak into the mines"
00:22:07,00:22:12,when security is distracted. And then they then live underground.
00:22:12,00:22:13,And they just look for ghosts.
00:22:13,00:22:18,"Ah, I've misexplained very poorly here."
00:22:18,00:22:23,"So yeah, they live underground and their skin goes gray because they don't ever see the sun again."
00:22:23,00:22:28,And there's this whole economy because they can mine sort of extra dangerous bits which have
00:22:28,00:22:33,been abandoned by the main body of the miners. And so where a loaf of bread might cost one dollar
00:22:33,00:22:38,"above ground to smuggle it into a mine, you'll pay $12 underground for it."
00:22:38,00:22:41,So this whole secret economy going on underground in these mines.
00:22:41,00:22:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:42,00:22:47,"Yeah, that's out. Well, I mean, just in terms of underground economy, we talked about this, I think,"
00:22:47,00:22:54,"on the podcast, ages ago, the large Hadron collider is actually used for smuggling fruit across"
00:22:54,00:22:58,from one country to another because apparently it's cheaper to buy fruit.
00:22:58,00:23:00,And they fire it through the ludge.
00:23:00,00:23:02,Never makes it through.
00:23:02,00:23:06,"That's how smooth these are made, just to put that as smashing into each other."
00:23:06,00:23:08,"It's amazing they're so cheap really, isn't it?"
00:23:08,00:23:12,How expensive is fruit in France?
00:23:13,00:23:19,"How many Higgs boson false positives did they get? Which turned out to just be a pair, do we know?"
00:23:19,00:23:22,Can I do something on jeans very quickly?
00:23:22,00:23:22,"Yeah, of course."
00:23:22,00:23:28,"Okay, a hipster's skinny jeans have filed a group of would-be thieves because they were"
00:23:28,00:23:32,unable to remove his belongings from his exceptionally tight pockets.
00:23:32,00:23:40,German cents 27 told the New York Post they couldn't even get a finger in.
00:23:40,00:23:42,Oh my god!
00:23:42,00:23:46,Even though they appeared to him and the guys of the Pope.
00:23:46,00:23:52,"And they, the squabbling thieves gave up after two minutes."
00:23:52,00:23:55,So they were two minutes trying to get in there.
00:23:55,00:23:55,Wow.
00:23:55,00:23:58,"The hips are just starting there going, yeah, I'll tell you the time, I know I'm safe."
00:23:58,00:24:04,"There was a thing like that in Cuba, in post-revolutionary Cuba, there was a thing called the lemon test"
00:24:04,00:24:09,"where you would be stopped on the street by gangs of revolutionaries and they would, to make sure"
00:24:09,00:24:14,"your trousers weren't too tight and cool and American looking, they would try and get a lemon"
00:24:14,00:24:18,"through your waistband and down through your trousers to the, to the, the hem of your trousers."
00:24:18,00:24:19,Really?
00:24:19,00:24:23,And if a lemon would pass through then you were okay and if a lemon wouldn't pass through then
00:24:23,00:24:25,you got some on the spot tailoring.
00:24:25,00:24:29,"Yeah, they were very popular in Cuba and you're not allowed to wear jeans in a North"
00:24:29,00:24:32,career at all because they're a sign of American capsules Monday.
00:24:32,00:24:37,But actually that being too tight thing defeats the original purpose of jeans because
00:24:37,00:24:44,so the word jeans is from a genoa where they were first designed and they were worn by fishermen
00:24:44,00:24:49,"and they were worn specifically, they were designed to be easy to remove if a fisherman fell"
00:24:49,00:24:54,overboard. So the point of jeans was meant to be that you could whip them off in the air in order
00:24:54,00:24:56,"that you didn't drown, yeah."
00:24:56,00:24:58,Why is he trying to take his jeans off?
00:24:58,00:25:01,I think they get waterlogged and weigh it down.
00:25:01,00:25:02,"Oh, okay, yeah, yeah."
00:25:02,00:25:04,"Yeah, but try to swim in jeans, it's very difficult."
00:25:05,00:25:06,I've never tried to swim in jeans.
00:25:06,00:25:09,"Actually I have, you did that survival test when you were at school."
00:25:09,00:25:10,When you took jeans.
00:25:10,00:25:15,I know that you have to go in pajamas but Andy was just wearing one sock.
00:25:15,00:25:19,I ace that test.
00:25:19,00:25:23,And then I went back a second time to get the sock.
00:25:23,00:25:33,"We're going to have to move on very soon to the final fact, anything before we do."
00:25:33,00:25:38,"This is the most bizarre case, the world's most expensive pair of jeans in a way."
00:25:38,00:25:41,Do you guys know about these? The Pearson versus Chung jeans?
00:25:41,00:25:49,"Right, so this is a lawsuit that was launched in 2005 when this judge called Roy Pearson,"
00:25:49,00:25:52,"who lived in the US, took his jeans to be cleaned for $10."
00:25:52,00:25:55,"And he took them to a dry clean as it was owned by South Koreans,"
00:25:55,00:26:02,"Key and Jin Mann, Chung, and they lost the jeans and he claimed that they owed him $67 million."
00:26:02,00:26:08,"That was for things like the emotional damage, the mental anguish,"
00:26:08,00:26:10,the legal fees he had to pay to launch this court case.
00:26:10,00:26:12,And the 66 million pounds he added his pocket.
00:26:12,00:26:16,And this went on for years.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"So it was only settled in about 2010, I think."
00:26:18,00:26:20,"At one point, so Mr. Pearson, because he was a judge,"
00:26:20,00:26:25,represented himself in court and at one point he broke down in tears
00:26:25,00:26:30,and had to take a break from testimony while questioning himself because he grew too emotional.
00:26:30,00:26:36,"Also, they said, so at one point, about a week after he launched the court case,"
00:26:36,00:26:39,they were in court and the Chung said that we found the jeans.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"Okay, they were just in the back of the dry cleaners and they brought the jeans into court."
00:26:41,00:26:44,"And they were like, these are your jeans, aren't they? These are your trousers, aren't they?"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"And he said, he insisted, these are not my pants."
00:26:48,00:26:53,"I have in my adult life with one exception, never worn pants with cuffs."
00:26:54,00:26:56,But we don't know what that exception was.
00:26:56,00:27:01,"All right, I'm going to move us on to our final fact."
00:27:01,00:27:04,Time for our final fact of the evening and that is my fact.
00:27:04,00:27:08,My fact this week is that Jesus had a monobrow.
00:27:08,00:27:09,No way.
00:27:09,00:27:10,"Well, okay, yeah, good point."
00:27:10,00:27:14,As a fair point.
00:27:14,00:27:19,"So basically, there's not many descriptions of Jesus out there."
00:27:19,00:27:21,We don't have any first-hand accounts.
00:27:21,00:27:25,We have one description which it turns out was written by someone who never existed.
00:27:25,00:27:28,"And that's quite a classic, quite a classic description."
00:27:28,00:27:31,"But there's a guy called Tom Schivers and he's on Twitter,"
00:27:31,00:27:35,so highly recommend checking out because he has an amazing blog and he writes a lot about this stuff.
00:27:35,00:27:38,And he was looking through a lot of descriptions of Jesus
00:27:38,00:27:42,and various different texts over the years and ancient texts.
00:27:42,00:27:46,And he found this constant line that came up which was with eyebrows meeting.
00:27:46,00:27:52,So it happened in at least three texts that there was the the Coptic Acts of Paul and Thachler.
00:27:52,00:27:56,"And Paul describes him as a man small and size, bold-headed with eyebrows meeting."
00:27:56,00:28:00,"And there's a monk who also put it, it's just counts accounts."
00:28:00,00:28:02,I say countless.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"Three accounts, that is round."
00:28:04,00:28:06,"But potentially, Jesus had a monobrow."
00:28:06,00:28:09,"And I think that's a cool thing, yeah."
00:28:09,00:28:14,"We don't, so the Bible doesn't really describe Jesus' appearance almost at all, does it?"
00:28:14,00:28:21,"There's one account in the book of revelations, I think, where it says that his feet were like"
00:28:21,00:28:23,"onto burnt brass, who knows what that means."
00:28:23,00:28:27,His head and his hairs were white like wool and white as snow.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"This vision is usually considered to refer to Jesus in heavenly form,"
00:28:30,00:28:34,not his appearance during his earthly life in that he had a completely white head.
00:28:34,00:28:38,"I guess, but that's the only description I think that comes straight from the New Testament."
00:28:38,00:28:42,"Yeah, there are a bunch of those descriptions where they say that his face"
00:28:42,00:28:45,was like the appearance of lightning and all these descriptions.
00:28:45,00:28:49,"And I did think at the time, you know, if you were trying to describe what someone"
00:28:49,00:28:52,"looked like to a police sketch artist, that was very unhelpful."
00:28:52,00:28:55,"Had hair like wool, face like lightning."
00:28:55,00:29:00,You were attacked by a collage of weird random things.
00:29:00,00:29:05,There was a first century historian called Josephus who wrote that Jesus
00:29:05,00:29:11,"stood three qubits high and a qubit at the time on average,"
00:29:11,00:29:15,"because it was a variable measurement, but it was about 18 inches."
00:29:15,00:29:18,"A three qubits is 56 inches, which is 4 foot 8."
00:29:18,00:29:22,So I think it might have been Yoda all along.
00:29:22,00:29:26,"The gospel of Luke, this is like a gospel."
00:29:26,00:29:28,It was written obviously a long time after Jesus died.
00:29:28,00:29:32,But there's someone called Zaccheus trying to see Jesus preaching.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"And he says, and he sought to see Jesus, who he was."
00:29:35,00:29:38,And he could not for the crowd because he was low of stature.
00:29:38,00:29:43,"So I think with Zaccheus, he was a small guy because he climbed up a tree to be able to see Jesus."
00:29:43,00:29:45,But he might have only had to climb up the tree because Jesus was so sure.
00:29:45,00:29:46,That is an excellent sign.
00:29:46,00:29:48,"I think it's not even specified, yeah."
00:29:48,00:29:49,"Yeah, that's a good pipe."
00:29:49,00:29:54,"Much more detailed descriptions of Jesus come from Islam, which obviously was much later."
00:29:54,00:29:59,"But in Quran and Hadith traditions, they have lots of physical descriptions of Jesus."
00:29:59,00:30:03,"Because Muhammad, I think, met him when he went up to heaven."
00:30:03,00:30:04,And there were various other descriptions.
00:30:04,00:30:06,They often they contradict each other.
00:30:06,00:30:11,"So at some point he's curly head and at some points he's straight head, although he might have had like crimpers or something."
00:30:11,00:30:19,"Also, he doesn't have a beard in the oldest portrait that we have of him, which is a Syrian one in 235 AD."
00:30:19,00:30:23,So he didn't have a beard until about the fourth century in depictions.
00:30:23,00:30:27,He was based on a sort of classical Roman gods for the first few hundred years.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"Wasn't he, and he has a curly blonde hair and completely well-shaved face."
00:30:31,00:30:36,I just think it's amazing how quickly we were told this is the image of someone from history
00:30:36,00:30:39,where it must be quite hard to have known exactly what they look like.
00:30:39,00:30:40,And we just accept it and we never question it.
00:30:40,00:30:46,"I mean, Shakespeare, by all accounts, mustn't have looked like he does."
00:30:46,00:30:48,"Because the people who drew that of him, they didn't meet him."
00:30:48,00:30:50,He'd been dead for a long time.
00:30:50,00:30:54,"Jane Austen, we only have one picture of her drawn by her sister,"
00:30:54,00:30:57,who everyone said throughout her life was a crap drawer.
00:30:57,00:31:00,So it's just obviously not going to look quite like that.
00:31:00,00:31:02,She's going on the bank notes pretty soon.
00:31:02,00:31:07,"The one that they, the picture that they've chosen is a very purified later Victorian"
00:31:07,00:31:09,representation of Jane Austen.
00:31:09,00:31:12,And it's not anywhere near like the picture that her sister drew of her.
00:31:12,00:31:15,"So yeah, it's very, very inaccurate."
00:31:15,00:31:18,Another person who you one necessarily think looked as they did.
00:31:18,00:31:21,"John Wilkes Booth, who shot Erlingon."
00:31:21,00:31:24,He was described as the handsomest man in all America.
00:31:24,00:31:27,"He wasn't that tall, but people said that it was made up for"
00:31:27,00:31:30,by his extraordinary presence and magnetism.
00:31:30,00:31:35,"Whereas English political activist John Wilkes, without the Booth,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,he was famously ugly.
00:31:37,00:31:42,"He had a sloping forehead, hanging jaw, bad teeth, bad breath, a severe squint."
00:31:42,00:31:46,And he was advised never to risk showing his face to a pregnant woman.
00:31:46,00:31:49,"Oh, my God."
00:31:49,00:31:51,But he didn't kill anyone.
00:31:51,00:31:52,That's true.
00:31:52,00:31:54,"Oh, my God."
00:31:54,00:31:55,Was he able to that sentence?
00:31:55,00:32:00,"But he's my son, and I love him, and who did say that about it?"
00:32:00,00:32:02,I think it was probably one of his detractors.
00:32:02,00:32:07,"His detractors, they've never got a good word to say about you."
00:32:07,00:32:08,Do you want to hear some cool stuff about eyebrows?
00:32:08,00:32:09,"Yes, please."
00:32:09,00:32:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:09,00:32:10,OK.
00:32:10,00:32:12,"Well, this is more about facial expressions than eyebrows."
00:32:12,00:32:14,"But there's an author called David Eagleman,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,who is a great writer about science and neuroscience.
00:32:17,00:32:20,"And there's a fact in his latest book, which is just out,"
00:32:20,00:32:24,"that when people have had Botox, they find it harder to recognize"
00:32:24,00:32:26,facial expressions in other people.
00:32:26,00:32:27,What?
00:32:27,00:32:28,Yeah.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"So they've tested people who've not had Botox treatments,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,and they've tested people who have had Botox treatments.
00:32:32,00:32:36,"And if you have, it's hard of you to mirror their facial expression."
00:32:36,00:32:37,And it's hard of you to--
00:32:37,00:32:41,"literally, if you recognize what you're looking at on someone else's face."
00:32:41,00:32:44,"So if Dan looks baffled like you do now,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,"I would kind of copy what you're doing,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,and then I would empathize in your baffled.
00:32:48,00:32:49,Exactly.
00:32:49,00:32:51,But this is the other cool thing is that married couples
00:32:51,00:32:54,"start to look like each other over time,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,"because they are constantly mirroring each other's facial expressions,"
00:32:56,00:32:58,and they get the same patterns of wrinkles.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"That is excellent news for me, but terrible news for my wife."
00:33:00,00:33:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:03,00:33:05,"Also, I was reading eyebrows."
00:33:05,00:33:08,Eyebrows are the most essential bit of your head generally.
00:33:08,00:33:13,"I mean, I'm going to go close second after brain."
00:33:13,00:33:15,"Eyes, mouth, ears."
00:33:15,00:33:18,Your eyebrows are the 19th most essential bit of your head.
00:33:18,00:33:19,This is why I read.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"And no, they were saying because for communication,"
00:33:21,00:33:25,"the eyebrows, actually, they do the talking when they're talking."
00:33:25,00:33:26,If you're talking to someone--
00:33:26,00:33:28,Not if you've kept your mouth on the tick-bolt sheet.
00:33:28,00:33:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:31,00:33:33,"If you were talking to me, and you said,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,"oh, can you believe this?"
00:33:34,00:33:36,"I, with my eyebrows, would go, whoa."
00:33:36,00:33:39,"So if I shaved my eyebrows, you wouldn't know what I was thinking."
00:33:39,00:33:43,"Yeah, I think that's similar to the Botox thing, I guess, right?"
00:33:43,00:33:46,I read somewhere that eyebrows evolved partly
00:33:46,00:33:51,because they aid in sex differentiation in humans.
00:33:51,00:33:53,So people kept on accidentally trying
00:33:53,00:33:54,to procreate with the same sex.
00:33:54,00:33:57,And so they gave men slightly thicker eyebrows.
00:33:57,00:33:58,That did seem to be what they were saying.
00:33:58,00:34:01,And you just look at one of those two things.
00:34:01,00:34:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:03,00:34:05,"But here's the weird thing about that,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,"which I thought that was weird, but apparently,"
00:34:07,00:34:11,"computers can determine someone's gender, 96% of the time,"
00:34:11,00:34:14,just by looking at the eyebrows and nothing else.
00:34:14,00:34:15,So why?
00:34:15,00:34:16,Kind of makes sense.
00:34:16,00:34:19,So we've kind of assumed that Mono-Brow is a negative aesthetic
00:34:19,00:34:20,feature on Jesus.
00:34:20,00:34:21,"Oh, you haven't."
00:34:21,00:34:22,"No, I think that's great."
00:34:22,00:34:24,I think people with Mono-Brow's
00:34:24,00:34:26,are the great heroes of planet Earth.
00:34:26,00:34:27,They constantly--
00:34:27,00:34:28,Wow.
00:34:28,00:34:29,"Again, a bold claim."
00:34:29,00:34:31,"Well, it is the most essential bit of the head,"
00:34:31,00:34:33,and don't forget that.
00:34:33,00:34:35,Who here has seen someone with the Mono-Brow
00:34:35,00:34:37,"and hasn't just stared at the Mono-Brow,"
00:34:37,00:34:40,the entire conversation that they've been having with them?
00:34:40,00:34:42,And that says more about the person with the Mono-Brow
00:34:42,00:34:43,"than it does you the person staring,"
00:34:43,00:34:45,"because it says to me that they're going,"
00:34:45,00:34:47,I know it's here.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"I know it's here, and I love it."
00:34:49,00:34:50,And that's what I really like that.
00:34:50,00:34:52,I think that the bravest humans alive.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"Well, so in--"
00:34:53,00:34:56,"I can't see fire, I can't see fire, I like it."
00:34:56,00:34:59,"I'm going to call point of information on fire,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,but it's weird.
00:35:01,00:35:03,My old list of best humans was one.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"People with Mono-Brow's, too, Jesus."
00:35:05,00:35:08,Now Jesus has made his way to the top of the list.
00:35:08,00:35:10,It's very amazing.
00:35:10,00:35:15,"So in Tajikistan, Mono-Brow's are attractive"
00:35:15,00:35:16,"and sought after, aren't they?"
00:35:16,00:35:21,"So in women, especially, and markets in Tajikistan,"
00:35:21,00:35:24,"you can buy this herb, uzma, which women will buy."
00:35:24,00:35:28,And you can rub it on your brow to make sure you turn those two
00:35:28,00:35:29,eyebrows into one.
00:35:29,00:35:31,And this is a desirable thing.
00:35:31,00:35:32,And I think there might be the only country in the world
00:35:32,00:35:35,where the Mono-Brow is genuinely desirable.
00:35:35,00:35:36,"Well, there may be a turning."
00:35:36,00:35:39,"So at the moment, in the NBA, one of the biggest stars."
00:35:39,00:35:40,And we're talking at someone who's
00:35:40,00:35:42,in the kind of level of Michael Jordan
00:35:42,00:35:43,and of modern day.
00:35:43,00:35:45,It's a guy called Anthony Davis.
00:35:45,00:35:47,And he has a monobrow.
00:35:47,00:35:48,And he has trademarked.
00:35:48,00:35:51,"Basically, he's turned his monobrow into a business."
00:35:51,00:35:53,His monobrow has catchphrases that you
00:35:53,00:35:55,would not allow to repeat on any product.
00:35:55,00:35:59,It's fear of the brow and raise the brow.
00:35:59,00:36:03,And he's turned his monobrow into an actual business now.
00:36:03,00:36:05,And I didn't know that you could trade mine.
00:36:05,00:36:08,"I mean, the quote from him is, I don't want anyone else"
00:36:08,00:36:10,to try and grow a uni-brow because of me
00:36:10,00:36:12,and then try to make money out of it.
00:36:12,00:36:16,What else is suspicious is this man of other humans?
00:36:16,00:36:19,What would Jesus have said if he had that?
00:36:19,00:36:22,But I kind of-- I slightly like the idea of trademarking.
00:36:22,00:36:24,Because when I realized you could trademark a simple thing
00:36:24,00:36:27,"like that towards a facial feature or something,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,"I thought, well, who else has done that?"
00:36:29,00:36:31,"And there's a guy, Michael Buffer."
00:36:31,00:36:32,He was a boxing announcer.
00:36:32,00:36:36,"He was the person to say, let's get ready to rumble."
00:36:36,00:36:38,That's his trademark.
00:36:38,00:36:40,"He has made, since he trademarked it--"
00:36:40,00:36:43,"since he first set in, trademarked it-- $400,000"
00:36:43,00:36:46,"American Dollars from movies using it, from TV shows"
00:36:46,00:36:47,using it songs.
00:36:47,00:36:47,Yeah.
00:36:47,00:36:48,There's a little more.
00:36:48,00:36:50,How hard is it to come up with a different phrase that
00:36:50,00:36:51,means basically the same thing?
00:36:51,00:36:54,"And then not have to pay this guy $400,000?"
00:36:54,00:36:56,"Just say, let's get ready to tumble."
00:36:56,00:36:58,And then--
00:36:58,00:36:59,It's washing machine noise.
00:36:59,00:37:02,"Thanks, Carl."
00:37:02,00:37:03,We're going to have to wrap up really soon.
00:37:03,00:37:04,We've got any final facts.
00:37:04,00:37:05,We want to throw in.
00:37:05,00:37:07,The tactical name for the monobrow
00:37:07,00:37:09,"is Sinophrous, just so you know."
00:37:09,00:37:13,"And the founder of criminology, Cesare Lombrazo,"
00:37:13,00:37:16,thought that Sinophrous was a sure sign.
00:37:16,00:37:17,You were a criminal.
00:37:17,00:37:19,And that's the founder of criminology.
00:37:19,00:37:20,One other thing as well.
00:37:20,00:37:23,"You can tell if dogs like you, because when they see you,"
00:37:23,00:37:27,they lift the left eyebrow upwards half a second
00:37:27,00:37:30,after they first see you.
00:37:30,00:37:33,And that was a study done using high-speed cameras.
00:37:33,00:37:35,So that's one way to speak.
00:37:35,00:37:36,They don't greyhounds.
00:37:36,00:37:38,"And as they pass the camera, they sort of give a little--"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"Hey, how you doing?"
00:37:40,00:37:42,Why high-speed cameras?
00:37:42,00:37:43,"Just so that, because actually, it's"
00:37:43,00:37:45,"a very, very microscopic little life."
00:37:45,00:37:48,You can either see if its eyebrow is very slightly raised
00:37:48,00:37:51,or you can work out if you are the person that provides
00:37:51,00:37:52,its food every day.
00:37:52,00:37:54,And one of those two things will tell you
00:37:54,00:37:55,if a dog likes you.
00:37:55,00:37:57,"If a dog doesn't like you, it bites your penis off."
00:37:57,00:38:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:01,00:38:03,No high-speed camera necessary for that one.
00:38:03,00:38:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:06,00:38:07,"OK, that's it."
00:38:07,00:38:08,That's all of our facts.
