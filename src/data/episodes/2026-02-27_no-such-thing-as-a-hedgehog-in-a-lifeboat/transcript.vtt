00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.600
 - Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Fish.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.440
 Dan here, hope you're doing well.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.200
 Just wanna let you know before we get into the show

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.040
 about our guest joining us today.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.280
 It's one of our favorites.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.960
 Someone who's joined us a number of times

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.000
 over the last few years, it is New Zealand comedian,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.440
 Melanie Bracewell.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.800
 So Mel, if you haven't heard her on the show before,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.720
 is someone whose work you may have seen in other places.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.200
 Her stand-up clips are always popping up online

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.960
 for any doom scrollers out there.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.440
 If you're an Aussie, you'll know her

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.360
 from the TV show She Co hosts called The Cheap Seats.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.280
 If you're a fan of Taskmaster

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.560
 and have consumed all the international formats,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.920
 you will have seen Mel on series four

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.680
 of the New Zealand Taskmaster.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.520
 And if you're a general connoisseur of comedy,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.640
 it's good to know that she has had a hand

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.320
 in the writing of such shows as the rebooted time bandits

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 and also the absolutely brilliant Wellington Paranormal

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.440
 of which she starred in two episodes as well.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.320
 But this is all stuff that's on the screen

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.080
 over on the other side of the planet.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.800
 What about us in the UK?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.960
 Well, good news.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.560
 Mel is in the country right now on a stand-up tour,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.520
 literally happening as I speak.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.120
 So the good news is you can see her in person

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.520
 doing the thing she does best,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.920
 which is stand-up with her new show called A Little Treat.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.880
 And if you wanna find all the details for that,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.160
 go to her Instagram.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.880
 It's @MelanieBracewell or just Google her name

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.880
 and A Little Treat UK tour.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.720
 It'll all come up,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.720
 but basically as of March 1st, she's gonna be in Dorwich,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.400
 then she's gonna be going to Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.440
 Edinburgh, Newcastle, Glasgow, Leeds and Cardiff.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.160
 So it's a limited run, but the tickets are selling fast,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.560
 so quickly get in now before she heads back over to Oz,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.840
 where just a heads up for the Aussies and New Zealanders,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.920
 she's gonna be on tour with this show from May.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.080
 All the details are online, but for now, enjoy her here,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.200
 dorking out with me, Andy and James,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.760
 on no such thing as a fish, on with the show.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.340
 (upbeat music)

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.680
 (bell ringing)

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.780
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.360
 (upbeat music)

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.040
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.960
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.600
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.440
 and Mel Bracewell, and once again,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.840
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.880
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.360
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Mel.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.880
 - My fact this week is that the New Zealand government

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.320
 is stopping invasive species by using

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.600
 Selina Gomez Oreos.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.980
 - That's huge.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.640
 - It's specifically possum.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.840
 So there's a huge possum problem in New Zealand.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.880
 There's no natural predators for possums.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.080
 Basically, they were trying to lure out

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.040
 the really persistent possums that weren't

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.400
 able to be trapped by other means.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.200
 They say what happens often is that they will go

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 and have a little bit of bait, get a bit sick,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.440
 and then go, "I'm never gonna eat that bait ever again,"

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.120
 or they get almost stuck in a trap,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.440
 and then they don't ever go towards traps again.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.680
 So they were trying to find something that would lure

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.360
 these possums that are very afraid of the traps in,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.720
 and what works specifically was Oreos,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.640
 but not as any, they had to be the Selina Gomez Oreos

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.440
 because they like them so much.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.680
 - So they have a combination of chocolate and cinnamon

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.840
 that possums just love.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.680
 - What a review.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.920
 What a review for the Oreos.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.960
 - I reckon I would be straight in those traps.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.800
 - Yeah, really.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.040
 - They do sound very, this is not an effort

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.000
 for Selina Gomez or for Oreos.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.960
 But she's put a lot of work into the flavour profile, I think.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.760
 - Oh yeah, it was like years.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 She really wanted to be in it.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.920
 - She was in the lab, wasn't she?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.760
 - She wanted to be in Oreos.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.040
 - It hasn't been a new album from her in quite some time.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.440
 - If you're a singer, that's another...

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.560
 - Sorry, who do you think Selina Gomez is?

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.840
 - I don't know, I was faster.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.840
 - A scientist?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.920
 - This was an article on the Spinoff,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.080
 which is a New Zealand website,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.040
 and that was one of my favourite parts of the article

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.800
 is that the scientist does not know who Selina Gomez is.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.360
 He said, "I don't know who she is,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.360
 I just know she makes a good Oreo."

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.760
 What was she saying?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.040
 - She has made no comment.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.080
 They have asked repeatedly,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.080
 "What do you think that your Oreos are being used

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.680
 to wipe out for us in New Zealand?"

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680
 - She's a busy woman.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.840
 - She's a busy woman.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.680
 - What's a tough gig as well?

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.280
 Because it is being used for what is getting rid of a pest.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.120
 - It's kind of...

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.120
 - It's being used to protect native New Zealand.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.960
 - Absolutely.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.120
 - But at a cost of killing an animal.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 If you're against that, that's a big issue.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.920
 - Like, if you sent her an email this week,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.000
 I don't know if you did or not,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.320
 but if you sent her an email,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.840
 say, "Dear Miss Gomez,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.360
 have you been killing gunnables in New Zealand?"

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.720
 She's not gonna respond to that.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.960
 - P.S., what do you do?

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.040
 What's your line of work?

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.840
 - The line she's used as the strap line

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.160
 is great for movie night

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.800
 and make wonderful birthday treats

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.840
 and music award-watch party snacks.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.160
 She didn't include an exterminating

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.400
 and invasive species.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.280
 - The initial experiment that they had toyed with,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.520
 what they would do is they'd leave these things outside of traps

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.120
 so that the possums would get a taste for them.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.360
 And what they were toying up was actually using drugs,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.120
 like addictive drugs, right?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.840
 And then they read a study about chocolate and cinnamon

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.240
 having similar properties in similar properties of addiction.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.200
 And so they would leave them out and not trap them

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.400
 and then get them addicted to these Oreos

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.920
 and then that's really interesting.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.520
 - Well, they're gonna stop making these things.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.480
 This is a limited edition Oreo.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.760
 - That's the issue, yeah.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760
 - They're gonna run out

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.800
 and they're gonna need something else to lure

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.760
 in the possums into the traps.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.600
 - Yeah.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.000
 - No, since it's a fish kit cut.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.840
 - Yes.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.680
 (laughing)

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.520
 - What do you think?

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 - I don't want to be part of them.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.920
 - It's nice for podcast listening parties.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.800
 - Fish, are we just saying fish flavored kit cut?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.960
 - No, cinnamon and chocolate.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.800
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.160
 The possums aren't gonna eat that.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.440
 - No, fish flavored kit cut.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.280
 - I think I would.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.120
 - Would you?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.800
 (laughing)

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.640
 - Fish ringer.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.960
 (laughing)

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.600
 - It's not legally protected term, is it?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.400
 - Right, very true.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.600
 - So these guys have come over to New Zealand

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.400
 from Australia, is that right?

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.240
 - That's right.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.000
 - Yeah, Australia.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.920
 And then there's some pieces that have been introduced

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.720
 from England as well.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.320
 And sorry guys, sorry to bring it up.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.240
 But look, we were bought for that song.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.080
 (laughing)

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.080
 We were asked to come.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.560
 (laughing)

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.560
 So the reason that they're not a problem

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.880
 as much in Australia is because they do have predators.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.480
 And one of them is the powerful owl.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.320
 - Oh.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.920
 - And the powerful owl is Australia's largest owl.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.120
 And it is able to disembowel a possum

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.120
 in less than 20 seconds.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.440
 - Wow.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.840
 - That's impressive when you say it like that.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.160
 But I've no metric of how long it should take me

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.080
 to disembowel a possum.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.760
 - You know what I mean, like, like we're--

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.600
 - Bring it in.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.880
 (laughing)

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.040
 - So I know what you mean, wow.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.960
 - The interesting thing, the reason they disembowel it

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.040
 is because they're meat eaters

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.920
 and they're not interested in eating vegetables,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.040
 but the possums eat vegetables.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.440
 And so they don't want to eat their insides

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.960
 because they're just full of useless green stuff.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.520
 They want to eat their meat.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.880
 - The equivalent of a kid picking the peas out

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.360
 of their food.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.200
 - Nice.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.720
 (laughing)

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.960
 - Do you know why possums were brought over

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.240
 to New Zealand in the first place?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.080
 - They were brought over for the fur trade.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.760
 - And it didn't work for a fur,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.160
 but then the numbers exploded.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.200
 And I think there are now 47 million give or take,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.280
 which ironically would be plenty for a thriving fur.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.440
 - That's a lot of fur.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.440
 - That's one of the fur trades then said,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.480
 like maybe about 15, 20 years ago.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.640
 - Hey, why don't we turn these guys into lovely pelts?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.240
 And that's a really good idea.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.080
 Wait a minute.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.080
 Why don't you the guys who brought them over

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.200
 to the first place?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.680
 - I'm not trying to say I'm on the side of big fur.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.520
 - Yeah.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.840
 - But then, as you say, you've got loads of invasions.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.880
 You've got weasels and stoats and rabbits.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.160
 The really annoying thing,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.440
 the stoats were brought in to control the rabbits,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.920
 which had been brought in.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.760
 - Yeah.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.600
 - I don't know.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.160
 - It's the old lady who's followed a fly.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.000
 - Yeah.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.160
 - Yes.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.000
 - It's mad.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 - The other thing they're doing with them is

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.360
 it's become a bit of a delicacy over in places

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.800
 like Hong Kong and Taiwan and China and so on.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.560
 And so they're sold over there.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.040
 And they're sold under the name Kiwi Bear.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.440
 - That's the meal that you have.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.280
 - Kiwi Bear.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.760
 - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.600
 Yeah.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.160
 - One pest that really ravages New Zealand

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.120
 and it's more difficult to get rid of are hedgehogs.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.640
 And what people think is because hedgehogs are quite cute.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.320
 Is that they're cuter and they're diabolical.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.120
 They'll eat, they'll eat birds, eggs, and things like that.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.200
 But because people think they're cute.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.560
 They're less likely to want to.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.760
 - Can I give you a 10?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.600
 - Yeah.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.440
 - They're a bit of them.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.280
 - Yeah.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.720
 - Because when we were a kid, we were told

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.800
 that if you build a bonfire, a hedgehog will always go inside it.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.920
 So you have to check it before you set it on fire.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.760
 That hedgehogs.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.600
 - That's true.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.040
 - So I think they're attracted to them or something?

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.360
 - They're hibernating them, don't they?

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.200
 - Today.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.040
 - They go and they think,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.040
 "Oh, lovely, nice pile of leaves."

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.720
 - I was wondering about this.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.560
 Is that working?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.120
 - That your responses make it look like an accident.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.440
 (laughing)

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.280
 - Yeah.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.400
 It's called the Beatrix Potter effect.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.880
 It's why, apparently there are more in New Zealand

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.840
 than in Britain.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.320
 Which is where they're obviously native to Britain

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.520
 than not native to New Zealand.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.680
 And it's been proposed that we put all the hedgehogs

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.200
 on a big chip and sail it over.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.040
 - Yeah.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.880
 - But I don't think it's a project.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.720
 - What did you do?

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.720
 - I was not being proposed by anyone.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.240
 - What they had said was that the reason they introduced it

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.440
 was to remind settlers of gardens in the UK,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.120
 is the reason that you put them on a big ship and send them back

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.760
 because if you put them on a small dinghy,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.160
 they're just gonna pop like...

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.000
 (laughing)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.840
 - Yep.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.680
 (laughing)

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.640
 - So I'm just thinking if it did hit something

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.720
 and they had to do an escape,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.640
 quick everyone into the emergence, oh shit.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.240
 (laughing)

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.360
 - Women and children first, hedgehogs definitely last.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.520
 (laughing)

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.520
 - Is it controversial with it?

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.560
 'Cause I know that you've got this whole

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.320
 and brilliant national scheme.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.160
 - Yeah.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.000
 - I love it. - Yeah.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.840
 - Predator-free New Zealand.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.680
 - Yes, yes.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.400
 - Like I'm a fan of all those individual elements, right?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.760
 - You guys are trying it here, very slowly though.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.600
 (laughing)

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.400
 - We're starting at the top, you know?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.240
 - That's a print sandwich, aren't we?

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.320
 - I was trying to get there, but I didn't want to say it.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.560
 (laughing)

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.440
 - We've just all had a buzz on our phones

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.280
 that he's been arrested to.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.800
 - Yeah, he's trying to arresting the possum, you know?

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.080
 Sorry, but it seemed like it's a very sort of big

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.520
 community effort, you know?

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.280
 People are setting up traps in their gardens.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.120
 - Yeah.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.880
 - There was this school in 2022

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.320
 on a place called, is it Rackiera or Stewart Island?

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.400
 - And they had a hundred day challenge for the children

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.280
 to kill as many rodents as possible.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.120
 - Yeah.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.280
 - And the 40 students who were taking part,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.440
 they caught 600 rats between them.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.120
 One five-year-old did in 60 rats over three months.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.480
 - That's the thing that they say

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.160
 if a kid is trying to harm animals,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.720
 that's like the sign of a psychopath,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.960
 but we're trying to sort of get them to get to that point.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.480
 - It's a controversial thing to an extent,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.560
 because about a decade before that in 2010,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.840
 a school got questioned because they did this,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.320
 they did this kind of hunt for possums and for rats,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.000
 but then they got the kids to play a game of possum tossing

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.480
 where who could throw the possum, the furthest,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.480
 and a lot of surveys to see how people felt about that.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.960
 - I gotta say, in 20 years' time,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.960
 you guys are gonna have an enormous prison population

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.680
 or some incredible sports teams

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.120
 with just a killer instinct.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.800
 (laughing)

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.640
 - Absolutely.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.560
 - The New Zealand Empire begins to spread across the world.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.040
 - I can go the other way, so New Zealand has bush ticks

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.960
 as do Australia, but they've recently been introduced

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.040
 to America with quite a lot of problems.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.120
 And so much so, the first one they found

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.480
 was a couple of years ago in New Jersey,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.720
 and a woman had been sharing her sheep

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.000
 and she came in with these ticks over her

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.600
 and said, I think there's a problem here

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.600
 and it turned out to be these invasive ones.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.600
 And she had so many on her,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.560
 she had over 1,000 on her pants alone.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.680
 - Wow, she was just head to toe in these ticks.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.520
 - In ticks.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.040
 - Wait, does the person know her sheep?

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.120
 - It was a person.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.120
 - Got it.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.960
 - And she survived.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.960
 - She survived, yeah.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.560
 So if you don't pull them out and leave the head in,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.560
 particularly Aussie ones, you get Lyme disease.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.000
 - Yeah, I assume they just sprayed her

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.560
 with something not very nice and the ticks fell off.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.400
 - Oh, what a pickle.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.240
 - That's a being.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.080
 (laughing)

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.760
 - And what it is, isn't it?

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.400
 What's the pickle?

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.680
 Like, as in...

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.080
 - It's covered in a thousand ticks.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.000
 - There's no good side.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.600
 - Oh, I thought a pickle means like,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.200
 what a pickle I've found myself in.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.240
 - Do you think that there's two sides to a pickle?

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.080
 - Yeah.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.920
 (laughing)

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.080
 - I think being in a pickle is bad overall.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.920
 - Is it?

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.920
 - That's saying, there's two sides to every pickle.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.040
 (laughing)

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.520
 - That's the name of my older brother.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.520
 (laughing)

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.280
 - Oh, I guess that in a pickle,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.400
 you think of someone who's trying to make a decision.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.240
 - Yeah.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.080
 - Right, I can't.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.920
 - What a pickle if I'm myself in.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.760
 - No, you're in trouble.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.360
 - It's like, but in a pickle,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.760
 it's kind of both sides are still bad, right?

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.760
 - No, you're on the homes of a dilemma.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.600
 You're in a pickle.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.440
 - Yeah, a nightmare.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.280
 - What about a pickle?

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.960
 (laughing)

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.800
 Unbelievable.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.240
 You can't rely on guests just to hoof you out of problems.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.680
 (laughing)

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.240
 Well, have you ever seen a peacock wild in New Zealand?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.680
 - I haven't seen them wild in New Zealand.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.720
 I think I may have seen them wild in Australia.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.560
 Is there a big problem in New Zealand as well?

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.400
 - Yeah, okay.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.240
 - Which I didn't know about.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.720
 And it's partly because the possums

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.280
 have been successfully trapped and hunted

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.600
 in various areas.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.440
 Well, no one's eating those delicious, delicious peacock eggs.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.040
 They're also invasive and they're feral

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.120
 and they're very hard to catch

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.160
 because they're very wary of humans.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.040
 They flee, they do lots of damage to crops

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.880
 and things like that.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.600
 But obviously, they're also very beautiful.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.440
 - Oh, yeah.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.600
 - They're kind of the best animals to get over there

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.440
 when you have them.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.280
 - Yeah, cute.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.360
 - But it is for the amazing birds of New Zealand,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.200
 which are beautiful.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.920
 And in the areas where they've managed to fence it off,

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.200
 they've done various islands.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.320
 The birds have all come back.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.160
 - Yeah.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.640
 - And it's now a cacophony of incredible birds

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.160
 nesting there and it is pretty amazing.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.000
 - It is beautiful.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.840
 - Yeah.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.760
 And if it takes a million possums skulls

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.840
 to crush under our heels, we'll do it.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.360
 (laughing)

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.560
 Fish kick cats are now available in your local stores.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.140
 (upbeat music)

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.280
 And that is my fact.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.560
 My fact this week is that one of the reasons

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.360
 married couples slept in twin beds in Victorian England

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.000
 is because doctors claimed that the weak sleepers

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.400
 stole their partner's vitality during the night.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.040
 - Mmm, I think that's true.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.880
 - Yeah.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.720
 (laughing)

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.560
 - Oh, you're sick.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.560
 - Would you say like if I'm snoring all night

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.400
 and my wife's just gonna wake up tired?

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.240
 - Yes.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.080
 - Absolutely.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.360
 I think though it could be the weak sleepers

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.880
 also the one who wakes easily.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.440
 So you would be, so it's a hell of a pickle.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.600
 - But this is a situation.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.640
 (laughing)

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.080
 - And what's the good part of it?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.920
 - Yeah.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.440
 - But this isn't about snoring waking up.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.920
 This is just about someone being an energy draze.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.760
 - Yeah.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.800
 - Yeah, it's sapping the vital.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.040
 - It went more to it, didn't it?

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.280
 It was like electromagnetic energy

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.280
 was being sucked from you.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.200
 - Okay, in that case, who the hell is saying this shit?

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.080
 - Well, this is Victorian England.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.920
 So, all right, okay.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.680
 - Yeah, all of it, all of it to England.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.280
 We're currently looking into getting twin beds

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.560
 in our house and as happens with you guys,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.720
 you start Googling stuff and you know,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.880
 what do I know about twin beds?

00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.920
 - Unfortunately.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920
 - But the thing is with you,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.400
 this is getting more into it

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.160
 because previously you're a bunk bed sweatshirt.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.000
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Yeah, I'm currently sleeping in a bottom bunk bed

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.040
 of my son's room while my wife's in bed

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.280
 with our three kids.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.120
 - All right.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.800
 - Looking into getting twin beds.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800
 - Yeah, but not for me and my wife

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.960
 for our two youngest kids.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.800
 - Okay, thank you.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.800
 - I'm just kidding.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.800
 (laughing)

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.680
 - Now you know that your vitality is being drained.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.440
 That may change, you may.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.080
 - Fortunately, someone had the same question

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.360
 about the history of twin beds

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.920
 and that was Lancaster University Professor Hillary Hines

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.600
 and she wrote a cultural history of twin beds.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.760
 As she was looking into it,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.080
 she discovered that it was believed in around 1860s

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.240
 that it would literally be taking away your energy.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.160
 - But the quotes are so extreme,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.360
 but this was one of my favorites.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.360
 Each sleeper should have a single bed

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.120
 in a large, clean, light room.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.000
 So it's to pass all the hours of sleep in a pure fresh air.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.040
 And those who fail in this,

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.960
 well in the end fail in health and strength of lemon brain

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.920
 and will die while their days are not all told.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.760
 - Oh, wow.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.360
 - It's like, they should, you should do this

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.760
 and then it's going, no, you'll die.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.600
 - You will die.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.960
 - It's very powerful, you know.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960
 It's quite persuasive.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.000
 - There's like quite a long standing history

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.440
 of people sleeping in separate rooms,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.240
 even in the British aristocracy.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.800
 And that is because, well, for lots of different reasons,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.600
 one reason because you're just going to have a better night's sleep

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.440
 quite often.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.240
 But secondly, because they thought that it was unhealthy

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.400
 to sleep in the same bed,

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.160
 because germ theory had just come out

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.840
 and they didn't really know how the germs would work.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.880
 And the other thing is like,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.240
 if you wanted a bit of romance,

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.360
 you could go to your partner's room

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.720
 rather than sort of like nudging them with a cold foot

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.480
 and saying, do you fancy a bit?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.400
 You actually have to knock on the door and say, you know,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.240
 let me in.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.560
 - You're an action-tik-nix.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.560
 (all laughing)

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.720
 - Interesting that you should,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.720
 that was my technique and that was my wife's technique.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.240
 - We seem to be in a pickle.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.240
 - There's also the other thing of this

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.360
 with, so the Edwardian, so early 20th century,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.920
 a big bit of the reason that they had separate rooms

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.280
 was to allow adultery.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.680
 - Oh.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.200
 - But, bum, bum, bum, because upper class Edwardian society

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.320
 was absolutely right with the adultery.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.800
 And it was kind of expected

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.240
 that the husband and wife would get married,

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.360
 they'd have some children,

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.400
 and then, what's the children are out?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.760
 It's free play.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.600
 - Right.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.320
 - And so, out of the house or the womb?

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.200
 - Out of the womb.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.040
 - Okay, so while the children are still living there.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.080
 - Ideally, they'll be at school

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.600
 or off on a trip or whatever.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.080
 - No, no, no, it's not when they've grown up and moved out.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.560
 It's literally in the family home.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.200
 - It's literally, it's especially,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.120
 not just in the family home,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.360
 but in grandhouses where you might go visiting,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.400
 you might go for a weekend party or something,

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.720
 so you'd have single rooms.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.160
 And some of these rooms have little brass brackets outside

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.000
 with a little name label saying exactly who's in where.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.520
 And supposedly, it was to help the butler identify who was who.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.880
 But it had a very useful second purpose

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.440
 of allowing a bit of hanky-panky,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.240
 so you're not knocking on the wrong door

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.440
 in the middle of the night

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.520
 and ending up in a real, you know, tangle.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.160
 - Even more than that, there was a house called

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.360
 Wentworth Woodhouse in South Yorkshire, which was the biggest house

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.920
 in England, basically, and today,

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.240
 when they had all the tops coming to visit,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.760
 they gave everyone a map to all the bedrooms.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.600
 - Brilliant.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.000
 - So you could kind of look at the map and go,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.600
 "Oh, I want to go to Mrs. Jones's room."

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.280
 So I need to go up here down there, around there.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.840
 This Wentworth Woodhouse was the biggest private house

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.120
 in the whole of England.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.960
 - Right.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.800
 - Victorian era.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.960
 How many bedrooms do you think it had?

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.680
 - Ooh.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.840
 - Riddle me this.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.520
 - I'll say, I mean, bedrooms, I'll say high,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.000
 jubble figures.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.120
 - Yeah.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.080
 - I mean, it can't have more than about 50 or 60 bedrooms

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.880
 I would have seen. - Oh, I was going way more.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.720
 - Oh, wow.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.560
 - Oh, wow, wow. - Oh, wow.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.400
 - The dead crusher.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.040
 - The fat, I mean, it's heavy.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.880
 - Oh, silly.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.960
 (laughing)

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.120
 - I feel like the other times I feel on this podcast,

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.920
 Dad, you always ruin the kissing game.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.000
 (laughing)

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.560
 You get so high.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.640
 (laughing)

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.520
 The real fact feels kind of lame and comparison.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.680
 - You want me backing me up?

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680
 - I listen to Andy.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.520
 - I'm sorry, sorry.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.760
 - Well, no, I think, 'cause I was thinking that,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.320
 I know George Harrison has a house,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.440
 which is absolutely monstrous, like it's huge,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.640
 and I thought that that had in the hundreds.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.400
 I thought that had close to like 400.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.320
 So I'm going to say, 400.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.320
 (laughing)

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.800
 - Okay, I'm going to say, well, maybe I'll lowball it.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.840
 I'll say 42.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840
 - Okay, okay.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.840
 - Well, I said 50 or 60.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.680
 - Yeah.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.520
 - 42, 400.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.320
 - George Harrison, well, on about 4.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.760
 - My sweet Lord, Dan is the closest.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.760
 - Oh, yes.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.960
 - Oh my gosh, I'm sorry for doubting you.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.840
 - There we go, 300 rooms.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.680
 - Wow.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.520
 - Really close to you.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.280
 - Basically, there would have big hunting parties,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.000
 wherever one would come and shoot guns and stuff.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.960
 - But interestingly,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.760
 - Interesting, it was only two bathrooms,

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.360
 'cause of the punting arrangements of the time.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.200
 - Yeah.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.040
 - And that was fine.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.880
 Yeah.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.720
 - Yeah.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.360
 - And these were quite modern.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.200
 This is the interesting thing.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.640
 Because of the association with greater hygiene

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.360
 and not having your energy sapped away from you,

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.640
 they were seen from the late 19th century and early 20th

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640
 to be the mom thing.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.600
 Now we think of them as being quite old fashioned,

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.600
 but they were really kind of modern and quite cool.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.240
 - They were, but again, it was for the richer people.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.080
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.440
 - And normal people, like forever,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.280
 normal people would share beds.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.480
 And then what happened was around the 50s.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.560
 There were a few different reasons,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.640
 but one of the reasons is television started to be more realistic

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.600
 and television shows would show married couple

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.360
 and also the haze code had finished.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.200
 So people were allowed to show men and women in bed together.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.520
 So people started showing men and women in bed together

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.240
 and everyone thought, well, now that's the modern thing.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.400
 That's the fashion thing.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.240
 - Oh, is that what changed?

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.440
 - That's a few different things.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.800
 - The haze code was fascinating.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.040
 'Cause in Hollywood, you had a guideline saying,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.720
 don'ts and be careful within movies.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.680
 So the don'ts were explicitly do not do this.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.200
 The be careful were, this is the guideline,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.000
 if you're gonna do this kind of scene,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.800
 and if someone who is watching it finds that offensive,

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.720
 they will not allow for that to be in the movie.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.720
 So one of the things, that's very useful in the bedroom too,

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.160
 to have don'ts and be careful.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.000
 - Yes.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.840
 - You know?

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.000
 - I've always got a side on the side of this bed.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.640
 No heavy petting, no bombing, no running.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.520
 - No cold foot nudging me.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.440
 (laughing)

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.040
 - Yeah, this was a big problem for Hollywood.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.600
 So there's a specific example of a movie

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.440
 where the Marital Bed was one mattress

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.280
 and it was a Lucille Ball movie,

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.720
 and they had to re-shoot the scenes.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.960
 So it cost $30,000 for them to go and re-shoot this.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.640
 And it was simply that they just had to have it

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.680
 something like 12 inches apart.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.560
 That was like the expected length

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.440
 of how far the beds needed to be far.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.280
 - Oh, it's sort of safe.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.120
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.960
 - In real distance for me.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.800
 Am I right?

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.560
 (laughing and laughing)

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.720
 Oh my God.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.760
 Okay, so some opinions about whether you prefer

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.720
 to sleep in bed with a partner or not.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.560
 - Yeah.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.400
 - Okay.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.040
 - This is a recent poll by you, Gov.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.640
 Five percent say their dream arrangement

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.560
 is different beds in the same room.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.160
 So that is twin beds, okay.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.520
 Ten percent say different beds in different rooms

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.360
 in the dream.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.200
 Seventy-six percent say same bed in same room.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200
 - Interesting.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.360
 - Nobody says same bed but different rooms.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.560
 (laughing)

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.400
 - That's it.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.560
 - Wow, what a challenge.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.400
 - Just my preference.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.560
 - Well, there was some studies that determine

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.600
 that often when people sleep with their partner,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.400
 their subjective view of how well they slept was higher.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.640
 But the truth is that they had a worse sleep.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.480
 - Oh, interesting.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.720
 - So I feel like is what sleep track is due to my brain.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.800
 Where I feel like I've had a great sleep

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.920
 and I wake up and I'll say you've had a horrendous sleep.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.960
 And then I'll be in a bad mood.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.240
 I'll go well, it told me I've had a bad sleep.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.400
 So I'll spend the rest of my day feeling bad.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.960
 But in the opposite, I'll have a,

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.360
 I feel like I've had a terrible sleep.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.000
 And then my phone will say it was a great one.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.840
 I'll go, you know what,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840
 let's really put a people in my step.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.520
 - Yeah, I think for a lot of people,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.560
 if you have a partner, there's a sense of safety.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.400
 - Yes.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.000
 - So you sort of turn around there there,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.840
 everything's okay.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.200
 So it doesn't matter that you woke up,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200
 you did it so you could check

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.280
 and you feel a lot more safe.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.200
 - Did you read the Murray Stopes line?

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.040
 - Yeah.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.080
 - So she, Murray Stopes, who was very, very famous

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.120
 for writing a book called "Married Love."

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.480
 And she was a campaigner for birth control?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.320
 - Yes.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.360
 - Yes, big campaigner for that, that kind of thing.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360
 She wrote that the twin bed set

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.120
 was an invention of the devil, jealous of married bliss.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.280
 - I see.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.440
 - And she proposed that you shouldn't have twin beds,

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.000
 instead the wife should have a room with a double bed

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.960
 and the husband should have a bedroom to himself

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.160
 for general use, keeping the wife's bedroom

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.960
 a romantic place.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.000
 I think, and then the husband can like have a bed

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.600
 that's in the shape of a race car.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.320
 (laughing)

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320
 - The heat man.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.160
 - Exactly.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.320
 - Yes.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.640
 - I would kill for that person

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.480
 about that right now.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.440
 (laughing)

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.440
 - On an unusual bed sharing story,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.520
 this John Adams and Benjamin Franklin shared a bed once.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.280
 It's an excerpt from his diary in 1775.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.480
 - John Adams of America, and okay.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.280
 - In 1776, he described the time he had to share

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.880
 a tiny bed with Benjamin Franklin,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.880
 and instead of sleeping, they had an argument

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.480
 that whether to keep the windows open or closed,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.160
 Franklin eventually won the argument

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.320
 when Adams got too tired and fell asleep.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.640
 - Nice.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.480
 - Who really wins?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.480
 Because Adams is falling asleep first.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.120
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, sure.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.560
 - And also, Adams became president of Franklin,

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.400
 never did.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.240
 - Yeah, double win.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.120
 - Double win for Adams, you two Franklin.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:39.960
 (laughing)

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.040
 - Nice.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.880
 - I mentioned before that snoring's a problem.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.240
 There's been a new study that gives you a way out

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.520
 of snoring, and that is, before you go to bed,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.760
 you have to blow on a cunt shell.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.680
 (laughing)

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.400
 - Oh, no way.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.480
 - You might have seen the study before

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.040
 that if you blow on did reduce, that's supposed to help

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.160
 because it helps your breathing.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.360
 You have to do circular breathings.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.760
 Well, apparently cunt shells are even better,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.320
 because if you learn properly how to blow a cunt shell,

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.440
 you have to do very deep breathing.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.440
 You have to do very strong exhalations,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.760
 and also the spiral shape of the shell

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.520
 gives a unique type of blow.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.520
 That means you won't snore.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.360
 - No way.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.200
 - I've got it.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.040
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.880
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.720
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.560
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.560
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.400
 - I've got it.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.240
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.080
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.920
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.760
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.600
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.440
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.280
 - I've got it.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.120
 - I've got it.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.960
 - Oh my gosh.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.400
 - Yeah, no, I've got a big blowable, it makes an incredible note when you blow it.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.600
 - It's really good you get it from. - Long way where it was.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.240
 Yeah, it was an island a holiday and I think someone like the Caribbean was many years ago.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:55.320
 But it makes a great noise. - Was it not when your school crashed on that desert island?

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.640
 - I'd rather not talk about that weekend.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.080
 - If you were the only survivor, how weak were the race?

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:14.280
 - I was king of that island, Joel.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:20.360
 Wow, wearing my possum skull armor.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:30.680
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.760
 My fact is, it's eight degrees warmer inside a daffodil than outside.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.360
 If you're feeling chilly and you're listening to this, there's a daffodil nearby.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.320
 Spring is coming. Get it in there.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.800
 - You could put most a little pink.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.800
 - Are you about to open up when I think you're about to open up?

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.760
 - No, no, okay.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:54.520
 Because when I saw the list of facts, I saw a daffodil out while I was going for a walk.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.680
 And so I put my finger in the daffodil.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.440
 And I sent the photo to Dan and he did not reply to the photo.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.200
 - I'm sorry, but it was such a ominous thing to see.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.840
 - It was uncomfortable when I was sitting next to my wife and mal slipped into my DMs

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.880
 with a picture of her fingering a daffodil.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.720
 - Is it doing some research from the shot?

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.080
 - Yeah, that's a photo there. Amazing.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.280
 - Was it what?

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.160
 - Yeah, I can't tell.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.480
 It was such a cold day that I don't know, like,

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.160
 because it's up to eight degrees, right?

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.400
 That requires probably a bit of sunshine.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.400
 - You probably also need to keep it in there for a certain amount of time.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.600
 And you can't just stand there with your finger in a daffodil.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.920
 - The part people will pop over.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.240
 But basically, the daffodils are really interesting.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.440
 They're not like a normal flower because they've got this trumpet thing,

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.200
 which most flowers don't have.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.960
 And they want to get bees in and pollinating insects in general.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.000
 And often, daffos are some of the first flowers of spring.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.840
 So it's quite cold still when they're up.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.960
 And the cone acts as a wind break.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.760
 And the petals are directing sunlight inwards.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.080
 And third thing, the stem is turning the trumpet away from cold breezes.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.840
 So basically, they're making it a lovely,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.440
 as warm as possible environment to lure in any pollinating insects

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.880
 that are up and about at this time of year.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.680
 - I love it. I love it.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.120
 - It's like a restaurant with a fireplace.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.680
 That's very nice.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.280
 - So it's very charming.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.000
 - So I think there aren't any bees around at this time of year.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.280
 Are they really?

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.480
 - No, probably not.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.480
 - I think they'll be pollinated by flies.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:27.800
 - Yes.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.360
 - And this is the thing, the flies that are around this time of year,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.720
 they tend to be colourblind.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.320
 And so that's why the flowers that you see this time of year,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.680
 like snow drops and daffodils are white and yellow,

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.840
 because they stand out against the greens.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.240
 - Oh, contrast is the main thing, yeah, yeah.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.880
 - And then later in the year, you get more colourful ones.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.360
 - It's so good.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.000
 - Does the heat in the daffodil sort of warm up the pollen?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.320
 So it's like, like a hot meal.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.720
 - Is it like, is there any?

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.560
 - Yeah, I like it.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.560
 Yes, I'm going to say yes, it absolutely does.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.160
 - Anyone have your daffs out already?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.800
 - Yes.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.960
 - We're recording this on the 19th of February.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.000
 - I've got a couple of my gardeners.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.160
 - I do, they started coming up a few days ago, yeah.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.960
 - How are they looking?

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.720
 - They're looking at yellow.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.960
 - Yeah, is the head like bent a little bit?

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.080
 - It is, it's bending down.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.960
 - Oh, dear.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.280
 Because according to English folklore,

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.880
 that means you're going to die this year.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.560
 - Oh, damn.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.400
 - Oh, man.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.320
 - Oh, man.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.720
 - No, no, that is a pickle.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.800
 (laughing)

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.120
 - Beautiful flowers or death.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.680
 - Oh, that's very funny.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.360
 - If you dream of them, any maiden who dreams of daffodils

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.080
 is warned not to go into a wood with her lover.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.960
 - Right.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.520
 - And if you see the first daffodil of the year

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.600
 out of all your friends and stuff,

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.320
 it means you'll have more gold than silver

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.000
 for the rest of the year.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.440
 Though silver's doing quite well, isn't it?

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.120
 - Yeah, both are overpriced at the moment.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.680
 - I'm just saying if you're about Bitcoin.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.960
 (laughing)

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.960
 - But even more gold in silver doesn't necessarily mean

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.560
 like more money.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.600
 If you had a million silver coins and two gold coins,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.800
 you still have more wealth or more.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.680
 - Well, also they're both good things.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.080
 It's like a reverse pickle.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:07.920
 - Yeah.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.720
 (laughing)

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.560
 - And the daffodil bending over though.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.400
 - Yeah.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.800
 - That's quite sort of daffodilish to do, I would say.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.360
 I would say it's a classic daffodil move.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.480
 In fact, the name daffodil, when it goes back to Narcissus,

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.400
 which is what the family it's from, is it?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.560
 - Yeah.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.400
 - That was obviously because when Narcissus was looking down

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.360
 into the water, he couldn't stop staring at his reflection

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.920
 in the mythology and they say that daffodils do the same.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.640
 They look down at the water and looking at themselves.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.080
 - But do you know that Narcissus is actually Narcissus poeticus?

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.760
 It seems, which is a different, it's not the daffodil that you know.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.480
 It's a related daffodil, which is white.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.760
 And so the, like, that's the one that Linnaeus called the Narcissus

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.560
 because he based it on that bit of mythology.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.400
 - Oh.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.240
 - And one of them.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240
 - And one of them is just a related flower.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.400
 - We just have a related flower.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.240
 - That's so interesting.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.080
 - This is the really weird thing.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.000
 There are 36 different species of daffodil, right?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.720
 But they became very popular for breeding and crossbreeding

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.440
 and making your own variety.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.800
 The different to species is varieties, right?

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.400
 So there are 36 species of daff,

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.480
 but there are 27,000 varieties.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.360
 - Yes. - It's crazy.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.880
 - And there's that lovely.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.600
 - And loads of them are not attractive to insects.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.440
 - Right.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.200
 - Because they've been bred by plant breeders for their looks.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.640
 They've not been breeding them for their, you know,

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.360
 their pollen qualities or anything,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.360
 or their attractiveness to insects.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.920
 So they've taken over the process.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.280
 So that selection process has meant that lots of daffodils

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.960
 that you get these days are not actually especially.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.320
 - So humans have to go in and propagate them, do they?

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.440
 If you look carefully, if you have a garden

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.280
 or some daffodil garden, just keep an eye out

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.360
 'cause you'll often find a creepy old man.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.920
 - With a finger in a daffodil.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.920
 - That's what I have.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.680
 (laughing)

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.160
 - I'll send the photo to all of you guys.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.000
 (laughing)

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.040
 - But there's lots of, if you go online,

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.440
 there's lots of missing daffodils in the UK now

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.960
 of these crossbreeds that they're really hoping

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.800
 are still out there.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.400
 So you can find a list of people saying,

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.520
 if you live in this area.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.440
 So for example, Lewis in the UK, in Sussex,

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.480
 there is a daffodil that's known as the Sussex bonfire.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.680
 So they have a big bonfire of night celebration there

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.520
 and a local...

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.760
 - It's so many did he in charge.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.000
 (laughing)

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.160
 - Yeah, there's a local plant-reader

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.040
 called Noel Burr, who created this thing.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.000
 And it hasn't been seen for the last 20 years,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.520
 but they think it must still be in someone's garden.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.080
 They just haven't identified it.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.520
 So they sort of say, please look around, see if you can find this.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.120
 - But they look so similar, it's like a Weasewolly.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.560
 'Cause it's like, do they look like a ordinary daffodil?

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.960
 - I think they do have different horses.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.960
 There's the Mrs. Auro Backhouse daffodil as well

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.320
 that's missing, they're desperately hoping to find.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.280
 The Mrs. William Copeland daffodil.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.200
 There's all these amazing little crossbreeds

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.040
 that become famous.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.440
 - There's hope that you show them daffodil hunters.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.280
 - Yes.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.280
 - I feel like going around looking

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.160
 for interesting daffodils.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.000
 - Yes, that's good.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.720
 - Like, you know, what's his name?

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.360
 Bob Martimer, like his show where he just fishes.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.840
 And, you know, people will love it

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.440
 because it's like nice and relaxing.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.760
 You see lots of countryside,

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.440
 and you also get a great comedian.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.280
 - Yeah.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.120
 - I think that's a really good thing.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.440
 - Just me crawling through people's gardens.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.280
 (laughing)

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.360
 - Just looking for a rare daffodil.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.440
 - But I'm doing it with rummage, so I love it, yeah.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.000
 - Have you guys heard of Peter Bar, the daffodil king?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.840
 - No.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.680
 - No.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.200
 - So, daffodils originally came from Spain and Portugal,

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.120
 and then they were brought here by the Romans.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.760
 And that means that in Spain and Portugal,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.960
 you have lots of different varieties of daffodils,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.320
 and in order to make the new ones,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.040
 you need to get some of the old ones and then cross them.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.120
 So he rode through Spain and Portugal,

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.280
 sleeping under rocks with only a single blanket for comfort.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.800
 And was once mistaken for a famous bandit by police

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.160
 as he went around looking for daffodils.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.000
 - Oh.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.800
 - And he made thousands and thousands of these.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.960
 - It sounds like something someone seems to say

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.800
 that they're tough.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.680
 Like, I just sleep on a rock, see who they are.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.520
 - And let's see.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.360
 - And let's see who they are.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.440
 (all laughing)

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.120
 - That looks like they're from the menosphere.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.920
 (all laughing)

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.200
 - My wife has her own bed, and of course I just sleep

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.040
 on the rocks.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.880
 (all laughing)

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.320
 - I read a newspaper clipping about this guy,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.840
 Peter Bar, the daffodil king.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.760
 And the clipping said that the only other man

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.840
 close to claiming the title was Dorian Smith,

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.640
 but that gentleman is too content with his ownership

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.280
 of the Cili Isles to enter in a vain rivalry.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.000
 - He owned the Cili Isles.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.480
 - These are the little islands off the coast of Cornwall,

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.280
 is it, they're really, yeah, yeah.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.640
 - Cornwall is king of daffodils.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.480
 - Is it?

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.320
 - Yeah.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.480
 - That's the biggest producer of daffodils in the world.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.200
 - Well, Britain is the biggest country.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.840
 It's like, this is where world leaders in daff production.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.680
 - Yes.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.520
 - It's not nothing.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.360
 (all laughing)

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.160
 - It's not anything, 30, 30 million tons of bulbs.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.120
 - Can I see a million tons of bulbs?

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:56.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.520
 - It doesn't sound plausible.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.640
 - That could be a number that's over 100 years.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.320
 I'm not sure if that's an annual produce,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.160
 but-- - Oh, right.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.000
 - No, of course it is.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.120
 (all laughing)

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.960
 - Interesting.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.120
 - Yeah, you're the biggest--

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.360
 - And as well, I just cut flowers,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.840
 people buy them 'cause they look nice.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.960
 - Yeah, exactly, but-- - It's awesome.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.880
 - We have mentioned this before,

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.320
 but I have forgot it.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.800
 They're very poisonous.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.520
 - I should have known-- - They get like cats or dogs

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.680
 and things can't eat it.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.680
 - Well, and humans.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.680
 - And humans, oh yes.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.520
 - Oh, okay.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.360
 (all laughing)

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.360
 - Which it's my way.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.200
 - I'll call up brunch.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.000
 (all laughing)

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.440
 - Well, no, but this is a problem,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.760
 'cause often when you go into a local supermarket,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.960
 the flowers will be positioned right next to the fruit

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.320
 and veg, right?

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.760
 And there's been people saying you've got to stop leaving

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.800
 the daffodils near the Chinese vegetables,

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.800
 near the onions, because they can be mistaken for them.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.640
 And people have been hospitalized quite a few times.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.240
 - If you have a daffodil,

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.000
 like-- - Me and that wake the mistaken for that.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.040
 - So they're often sold, we're not open yet, right?

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.880
 - Yeah, right.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.040
 - So they look a little bit like spring onions,

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.360
 and there are also some other like spring greens

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.560
 that you get in China that look quite a lot like them.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.400
 - Right.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.720
 - As written and article by John Robertson,

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.400
 who works at the Poison Garden in Annock.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.240
 - Oh, yeah. - To know that.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.120
 - It's like a garden with all poisonous plants in it.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.320
 And he's found lots of examples of people

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.760
 being poisoned by daffodils.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.360
 He said there was some parents who were not very well,

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.640
 and they had a couple of children

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.200
 who were just old enough to make a stew.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.920
 - No. - And they went and picked out

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.760
 what they thought were onions and put them in

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.480
 and they were daffodil bulbs.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.080
 - What is the right age to make a stew?

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.880
 (all laughing)

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.440
 - It's a really good question, is that?

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.200
 - No one of you have to get your license in the UK.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.560
 - I don't know if that's a thing in your ear.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.000
 - On bees and heat, a study from North Carolina State University

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.960
 found that bumblebees carrying pollen,

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.040
 their bodies heat up depending on how much pollen they have.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.240
 It's a workout.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.600
 So the weight of the pollen that they're carrying around

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.040
 makes their bodies warmer.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.120
 And so they're afraid that global warming,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.560
 the workout of carrying pollen will be too much for them.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.080
 - Oh no. - And they'll overheat.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:58.920
 - I know. - It's true.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.520
 - You know what happens if, sorry to interrupt,

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.120
 but you know what happens if a bee overheats.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.600
 We've mentioned this on our show before,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.520
 it ejaculates itself to death.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.800
 - That's really, yeah.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.480
 - Really, it just can't stop, it's just.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.280
 - It can't stop, yeah.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.640
 I can't remember the exact details,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.840
 but I remember that sentence very clearly.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.960
 - Yeah, yeah. - It's a reason.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.200
 - Wow. - Stick to the mind.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.360
 Just on the thing that Mel said,

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.320
 they are now flowering two or three weeks earlier

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.520
 than in the past.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.440
 This is a climatey thing.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.960
 This is a while getting warmer things.

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.960
 So, if Wordsworth went for his famous walk with his sister

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.440
 today, there might be nothing there at all.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.760
 'Cause all they do have already flowered

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.320
 a couple of weeks ago, he'd have had to

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.320
 have a ride about something else.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.160
 - Right.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.920
 - It doesn't seem like the biggest problem

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.640
 when it's going-- - The reclining door's open.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.560
 - Yeah, this is not the biggest effect

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.880
 of climate change that you can think of,

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.880
 but it is bad, you know.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.560
 - But that is the thing about it is he says,

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.440
 I wandered lonely as a cloud,

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.280
 but he wasn't lonely.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.680
 He was with his sister the whole time.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.200
 - But if he'd said I wandered out there

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.000
 with my sister, what's the rhyme?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.160
 Blister, I suppose, I've got a blister.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.920
 - I mean, I've spent a few days in here.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.480
 I don't think the clouds are there lonely.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.240
 There's quite a few hanging out together.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.080
 - That's yesterday.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.400
 (all laughing)

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.720
 - That's a thick mask across the countryside.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.560
 Yeah, you're right.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.560
 (all laughing)

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.760
 - So, maybe he went in an ironic way.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.360
 (upbeat music)

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:24.400
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.680
 and that is James.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.800
 - Okay, my fact this week is that you may be able

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.280
 to cure chronically blocked noses

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.560
 with a snot transplant.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.400
 (all laughing)

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.240
 - Lovely.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.080
 - It's future guys.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:36.920
 - Yeah.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.760
 - Incredible.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.600
 - It does sound good.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.440
 - Yeah.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.280
 - We do that, I thought.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.280
 - Yeah, so I'm here, I'll be.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.440
 - Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know if you suffer

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.000
 from this kind of thing I do.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.520
 Definitely, chronic rhinocytus.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.240
 In fact, I had surgery for it a few years ago,

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.240
 and that was kind of the best way to deal with it.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.680
 And it kind of still is.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.680
 I read about a new study in new scientists this week,

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.520
 and they've come up with this idea

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.480
 of basically siphoning snot out of someone

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.800
 and shoving it right up there.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.120
 It's as simple as that, really.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.880
 - But surely the people that don't have blocked noses

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.360
 don't have a lot of snot to offer.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.720
 So they could probably only be a donor for one person.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.520
 (all laughing)

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.440
 - There's a way to clear.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.160
 - Yeah, who you mean, well.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.960
 - Basically everyone has some kind of microbiome

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.280
 in their sinuses, and what you're trying to do

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.880
 is get those bacteria and viruses out of a healthy person's nose

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.560
 and put them into an unhealthy person's nose.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.720
 - It's really cool.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.240
 - I think it just sounds like a great idea.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.080
 So it was one of the pioneers of it.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.640
 A scientist called Amy Molls.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.160
 - Yes, Amy Molls from Vancouver,

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.600
 and another guy called Anders Mortensen from Helsingburg.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.600
 - Yes, and so she was inspired by fecal transplants.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.400
 Which we've talked about before as being very useful.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.960
 - You don't want to get those two mixed up.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.800
 - Absolutely not.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.320
 (all laughing)

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.640
 - You've just put snot up this person's bum.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.320
 - Wait a minute, that means.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.400
 (all laughing)

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.160
 - So yeah, it gets referred to as a sinus probiotic.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.680
 'Cause you've got, you know, this,

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.640
 you're fighting snot with snot basically.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.280
 'Cause this thing, chronic sinus condition

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.640
 or chronic rhino sinusitis, it sounds awful.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.480
 - It's a shocker.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480
 - So you've had it.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.760
 - I still kind of have it,

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.600
 but the surgery helped quite a lot.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.080
 - You've mentioned your sinuses in the past,

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.560
 but I've always thought, yeah, I've got a cold too.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.200
 And I'm so sorry James.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.920
 - Like basically, I got often can't breathe.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.560
 - Yes, yes, yes.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.600
 - Just kind of vital for living.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.480
 - Absolutely, that's probably one.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.480
 But it gets dismissed by lots of doctors as a minor inconvenience,

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.640
 but people living with it,

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.480
 which might be up to 10% I read approaching this number.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.000
 Your face hurts, you're always bunged up,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.040
 you lose your sense of smell, headaches, bad breath.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.520
 - Try again on an aeroplane.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.760
 - Oh yeah, of course.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.600
 - Wow.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.200
 - Soon as you, you know, when your ears sort of,

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.760
 when your ears pop, when that happens for you,

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.640
 I just get this incredible pain and my sinuses.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.680
 - I've had that, if you've got enough light

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680
 and you've got a bit of a cold,

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.000
 that can happen, god, it'll just suddenly.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.160
 - Oh, and that, well, allegedly,

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.640
 people with it seem to be 77% likely to have depression

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.160
 than those without.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.200
 'Cause it's just sort of chronically debilitating.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.600
 - Do you think there's a research team as a game?

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.440
 You guys guess what?

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.960
 The name of the research team trying to work out,

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.520
 they're using like AI to work out the cause of,

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.120
 this rhinocytus in people.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.960
 - Okay.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.520
 - What is the name of this research team?

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.360
 - The sort of game.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.200
 - Like the acronym, you mean?

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.040
 - It's not an acronym, it's just like a fun bit of wordplay.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.840
 And it's like, when you read it, you go, of course.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.600
 - Okay, blow, who knows how to fix this?

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.440
 - I mean, you've got the right pun.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.600
 It turns out, well, in terms of it is, it's got nose in it,

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.080
 but it's medical.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.520
 And it's about figuring out.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.680
 - Do you know Tom?

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.560
 - No, it's so much simpler than that.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.680
 It's literally just a word in the medical field

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.720
 that you would use a lot, a doctor.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.680
 What does a doctor do to you?

00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.520
 - Diet nose.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.360
 - Yes!

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.360
 (audience cheering)

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.200
 - Lovely.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.680
 - Yeah, yeah, too good, too good.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.520
 - That's pretty good.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.360
 - Because Dan, you talked about acronyms.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.440
 There is the way to measure,

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.480
 whether you have chronic sinusitis,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.920
 is the cyanone nasal outcome test or snot.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.640
 - Beautiful, lovely.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.840
 - And they basically give you 22 things.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.240
 Do you need to blow your nose?

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.160
 Do you sneeze a lot?

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.560
 Do you have a running nose and you put how often?

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.160
 Does it happen all the time or does it happen never?

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.080
 - What's interesting is how much mucous

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.160
 and snot we produce per day?

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.000
 - A bucket.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.240
 - It's buckets, it's 1.5 liters per day

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.120
 is what the body produces.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.280
 - Okay, that's like a large bottle of Coca-Cola, isn't it?

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.680
 - Yeah, and it's used for various different things.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.000
 I didn't realize it was used for.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.200
 It lubricates poo, so then it makes it easier to exit our body.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.840
 - Yeah, you're saying it with a slightly disgusted look

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.560
 on your face, but you try going without.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.920
 You'll be crying out for that mucous to come back.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.760
 - I know.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.760
 - I don't know how I try to do that.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.600
 - You try going down.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.360
 (laughing)

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.520
 - I don't know what things were of the like,

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.240
 "It's a mucous to you, how dare you."

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.360
 I don't know how bad it got for you

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.680
 on the Lord of the Flies island,

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.640
 but we keep our poo's lubricated.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.280
 - But that's the thing is that people obviously

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.960
 would find the idea of eating snot disgusting,

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.280
 but we are swallowing our snot all the time.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.920
 Most of those liters, we're just swallowing it.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.840
 - Yeah, 'cause it traps, you know, like,

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.640
 bacteria or tiny hairs or whatever

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.080
 that are all landing in your body,

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.320
 and it can be in the lining to your lungs and things like that.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.720
 Then you bring that up, you know,

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.640
 that sort of trap gets full of the pollutants,

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.200
 you bring it up, you swallow it out it goes.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.040
 - Easy.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.880
 - One interesting thing about picking your nose and eating it

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.040
 is that according to some scientists,

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.280
 they think that might be a good thing

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.360
 because the pathogens that get stuck in your nose

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.760
 are the weaker ones because they haven't managed

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.280
 to get all the way up, so if you take those ones out

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.320
 and eat them, then that's like a vaccine.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.320
 - Like a vaccine, exactly, I should say,

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.520
 not all scientists.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.400
 - Right, okay, no that's good to know.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.880
 Before this podcast, we're calling actually Mel,

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.840
 sent me a photo of her with her finger jammed up,

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.960
 and I was like, "I didn't understand it from now."

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.120
 - Yeah.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.520
 - It's so much warmer out of there.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.240
 (laughing)

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.120
 - You can get terrible sinusitis if you're a tortoise.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.120
 (laughing)

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.280
 There was a tortoise.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.920
 - It's already doing these tortoises, isn't it?

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.600
 (laughing)

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.400
 - There's a tortoise in Bristol Zoo in 2014,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.160
 called Helen, who had a terrible nasal infection,

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.640
 and they gave them a cross van to biotics

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.160
 and lots of sinus rinses and stuff.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.200
 And the reason is that tortoises can't cough,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.440
 and so if you get the infection,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.480
 they can't get it out of their body.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.040
 But the reason I mainly bring it up

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.600
 is that this tortoise, called Helen,

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.920
 has a underfloor heated sand pit.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.760
 - No way.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.920
 - And it's been a bizarre point on this show, Mel,

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.760
 that Andy hasn't got underfloor heating in his house.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.600
 - Oh my gosh.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.600
 - That makes me sound like an insane diva.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.760
 (laughing)

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.640
 I'm just saying that Romans had it 2,000 years ago.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.040
 Why don't we all have it?

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:57.880
 - It's not just me.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.040
 - It's like, why does Helen have it?

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.040
 - You don't want to know, right now.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:00.880
 (laughing)

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880
 - And again, that genuinely want the hell.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.960
 (laughing)

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.520
 There are humans out there who could do with underfloor heating.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.520
 (laughing)

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.840
 - Some of them around this table.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840
 (laughing)

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.000
 - Wow.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.560
 - Well, congratulations, Helen.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.080
 I'll be very happy.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.160
 - I hope your sign-in sign doesn't never get to be wrong.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.920
 (laughing)

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.480
 - Cold medicine in the UK is substantially worse

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.520
 than it used to be.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.360
 - It's not right.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.200
 - Yeah.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.120
 - Is this pseudo-effort drain or no?

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.800
 This is not to do with the actual--

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.640
 - Certainly is.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.640
 - Oh, it is, right.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.640
 Okay, is it because they outlawed pseudo-effort drain

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.280
 in New Zealand for a bit and they've brought it back?

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.120
 - Who did that?

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.880
 - Because it's very easy to turn that cold medication

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.960
 into drugs.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.800
 - Yes.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.640
 - It is.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.800
 - A key ingredient of crystal meth

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.640
 - Yeah.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.720
 - Is pseudo-effort drain.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.200
 And pseudo-effort drain is where pseudo-fed

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.040
 gets its name from.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.880
 - Okay.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.880
 - Do you hear it?

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.720
 - Yeah, pseudo-effort drain.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.800
 - And it was used with it, right?

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.160
 - It was used with it's in the name.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.760
 It was used for decades.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.160
 And in 2008, I'm replaced with something

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:07.200
 much less effective, called phenelephrine.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.320
 And I mean, it's good news if you don't like crystal meth

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.680
 being a big part of your community.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.680
 - Bad news, if you have chronic sinusitis.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.520
 - Yeah.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.480
 - Can't you get it?

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.320
 - Like.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.320
 - Can I get it under the cancer somewhere?

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.640
 - I think there are very specific--

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.240
 - The problem is I can't get my head under the cancer

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.200
 because it all goes into my eyes.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.240
 (laughing)

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.720
 - There are very specific circumstances,

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.280
 I think under which a doctor will give it to you,

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.720
 but it's not just ladled out now

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.920
 because it's too easy to use it to make crystal meth.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.160
 - I've written a new script called "Bloing Bed"

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.920
 and I think it's going to be really exciting.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.080
 I'm really excited, very nice.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.080
 - Yes.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.160
 - A doctor, German doctor called Wilhelm Fleiss

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.480
 was a friend of Freud.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.800
 And he thought that your nose got more swollen once a month

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.480
 and it kind of had its own menstrual cycle.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480
 - Oh.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.040
 - And he thought that the swelling of the nose

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.200
 caused some kind of like sexual disorders.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.040
 - Yes.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.320
 (laughing)

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.400
 - Yes.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.760
 - That's way far to thought.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.600
 - Pritch.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.600
 - Okay.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.440
 And now I sit back and allow Dan to explain

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.880
 what the hell he was thinking with that insurrection.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.960
 - Well, I just know that--

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.040
 - Take the tempo out, you know,

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.320
 before you talk to his Dan.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.120
 (laughing)

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.600
 - I've always thought that the nose was very similar

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.440
 to a vagina.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.520
 - You've always thought that.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520
 (laughing)

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.360
 - Yeah.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.680
 - As a young boy.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.360
 - As a young boy, I just always thought,

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.040
 no, because we share a very similar week.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.800
 My nose and vagina share very similar tissues

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.640
 on the inside, right?

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640
 - They have erectile tissues.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.480
 - Yeah.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.320
 - Exactly.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.160
 - Yeah.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.440
 - And it is true that if you get excited down there,

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.640
 it can give you a block nose.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.120
 Sometimes that's called honeymoon rhinitis.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.600
 And it's because the blood rushes

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.520
 to the erectile tissue in both places.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.840
 - Whoa.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.160
 - But this guy, Wilhelm Fleiss,

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.200
 he thought that the best way to deal with it

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.560
 is to take a cane.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.280
 - Wow.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.160
 - And he thought that if you took a cane,

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.240
 then it would stop your nose from going through

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.880
 this menstrual cycle and that it would stop

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.520
 your sexual disorders.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.520
 And surprise, surprise, Sigmund Freud, absolutely agreed.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.360
 - Yeah.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.280
 (laughing)

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.600
 - And was the one who would prescribe him this cocaine

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.240
 so that his patients would feel better.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.320
 - Oh, give it a go.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.000
 (laughing)

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.840
 - It was a big cold and flu remedy, wasn't it?

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.680
 - Yeah.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.840
 - Cocaine was just a standard thing.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.920
 Again, cocaine, crystal meth, all these drugs,

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.080
 before we really understood.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.040
 - And heroin was good for cuffs, wasn't it?

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.880
 - I was trying to think of a pun that whole time

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.440
 and the only thing I could think of,

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.680
 you've got a stiffie and a stuffy.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.520
 (laughing)

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.360
 - Yeah.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.640
 - It's all like a gear, it's all like a gear.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.480
 - Can I tell you one more weird transplant?

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.320
 - Yes, please.

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.160
 - That's not transplants.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.000
 So there is a belief among some doctors

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.840
 that we might within the next 10 years

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.240
 get the first ever head transplant.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.400
 - Oh.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.240
 - Yeah.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.080
 - Wow.

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:53.920
 - It's pretty interesting.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.160
 So this is a surgeon called Bruce Matthew,

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.960
 who's a former NHS Neurosurgeon.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.240
 He's also qualified.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.320
 And basically, it's really a body transplant, actually.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.160
 - Yeah.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.160
 - Because it's the same.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.000
 - Yeah, it's the same.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.840
 - It's taking--

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.680
 - Yeah, true.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.520
 The head is the person.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.520
 - The head is the person.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520
 No, it's not the same person.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.760
 Because if they say we're giving you a head transplant,

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.000
 that means they're going to take off your head

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.320
 and put someone else's head on.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.120
 But what happens to your head?

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.760
 - Your head, but the key thing apparently

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.080
 is that your head and your spinal column

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.440
 have to be kept together.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.000
 There's no way of just taking off a head

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.040
 and putting it on another body.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.000
 It has to be head and spinal column, okay?

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:23.840
 - Okay.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.480
 - And then I found myself looking into

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.040
 what other transplants we can do.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.200
 So shoulder replacement surgery, absolutely handy.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.040
 That's fine.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.640
 Knee surgery, again, very calm by now, knee replacement.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.080
 But we don't seem, as far as I know, to do toe transplants.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.640
 - Toes onto your fingers, I've seen that.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.240
 - Toe becomes thumb.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.880
 That is the gold standard for letting you pinch things again.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:45.720
 - Okay.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.680
 - But I don't think they ever say we're going to take a toll.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.040
 - Is it because you can manage without one of your toes?

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.440
 - I have a broken toe and the doctors go,

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.120
 we don't really, we're not going to put your toe in a car.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.480
 So I just have a toe that just doesn't bend.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.320
 - Oh, okay.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.400
 - You can't live your life without working kidneys, right?

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.240
 - Yeah.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.440
 - But if you lose one of your toes, it's not great

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.760
 or you can live your life.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.720
 - But if you don't want to get many people to sign up

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.920
 to donating their body, if they find out,

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.520
 they're just donating their toes.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.280
 - I think your toe could save someone's awkward conversation

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.120
 at the pool.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.320
 It's not top of the list of things to solve, for sure.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.160
 - That's the absolute.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.360
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.520
 - Wait, so okay, so we're doing heads, shoulders.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.360
 - Yeah.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.360
 - Is that what's going on here?

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.480
 - Oh my god, I can't believe that.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.880
 - No, I knew the second you said it.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.720
 I could see in your face.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.040
 You didn't just mention toes for no reason.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.880
 There's no waste with Andy, he's not.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.880
 - Wow.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.460
 (upbeat music)

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.360
 - Okay, that's it.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.440
 That is all of our facts.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.800
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.840
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.720
 about the things that we've said

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.960
 over the course of this podcast,

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.000
 we can all be found online.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.560
 I'm on @tribaland on Instagram, James.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.400
 - Instagram is no such thing as James Harkin.

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.600
 - Andy, Andrew Hunter M and Mel.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.800
 - @melonybracewell.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.760
 - Nice, and you are in the UK right now.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760
 - In the UK, touring.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.960
 - Touring around, so come and see my shirt, if you'd like.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.040
 - Yeah, all the dates are on your Instagram, right?

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.440
 So you can, it's a pin of post.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.120
 - Yes, you can check it out.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.000
 And also, if you can't come, I'll be releasing it

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.840
 as a special sometime during the year, so.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.680
 - Amazing.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.040
 - Yeah, you can check it on it.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.040
 - Great, okay, cool.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.920
 Well, also, if you want to get to us as a group,

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.240
 podcast at qi.com is the place to send your emails.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.320
 If you've got any amazing facts that you want to let us know

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.200
 about, we do our show, Little Fish, where we gather together

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.360
 all the best of those facts, and we read them out.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.520
 That's every Monday, or if you want to give us some feedback

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.960
 about things that we've talked about in main episodes

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.520
 that you think we need to know about, we have another show,

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.840
 which is part of our Secret Members Club Club Fish,

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.560
 which you can get by going to patreon.com/nosuchthingasafish.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.520
 And Andy goes through all those emails.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.600
 He picks the best of them out, and we do that show,

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.600
 drop us a line, where we discuss them all.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.080
 So check that out.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.000
 Otherwise, why not just come back next week,

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.760
 'cause we're gonna have another episode,

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.280
 thanks as ever, to Lee and Lee, and Ethan Ruperelia,

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.400
 as well as the larger Fish Buster team here

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.640
 at the Officers in Hobern, and we'll see you next week.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.480
 Good bye.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.060
 (upbeat music)

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.640
 (upbeat music)

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:47.640
