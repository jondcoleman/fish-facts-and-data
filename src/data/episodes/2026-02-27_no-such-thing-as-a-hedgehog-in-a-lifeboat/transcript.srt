00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,600
 - Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Fish.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,440
 Dan here, hope you're doing well.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,200
 Just wanna let you know before we get into the show

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,040
 about our guest joining us today.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,280
 It's one of our favorites.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,960
 Someone who's joined us a number of times

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
 over the last few years, it is New Zealand comedian,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,440
 Melanie Bracewell.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,800
 So Mel, if you haven't heard her on the show before,

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,720
 is someone whose work you may have seen in other places.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,200
 Her stand-up clips are always popping up online

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,960
 for any doom scrollers out there.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,440
 If you're an Aussie, you'll know her

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,360
 from the TV show She Co hosts called The Cheap Seats.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,280
 If you're a fan of Taskmaster

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,560
 and have consumed all the international formats,

18
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,920
 you will have seen Mel on series four

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,680
 of the New Zealand Taskmaster.

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
 And if you're a general connoisseur of comedy,

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,640
 it's good to know that she has had a hand

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,320
 in the writing of such shows as the rebooted time bandits

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,960
 and also the absolutely brilliant Wellington Paranormal

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
 of which she starred in two episodes as well.

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,320
 But this is all stuff that's on the screen

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,080
 over on the other side of the planet.

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,800
 What about us in the UK?

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,960
 Well, good news.

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,560
 Mel is in the country right now on a stand-up tour,

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,520
 literally happening as I speak.

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,120
 So the good news is you can see her in person

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,520
 doing the thing she does best,

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,920
 which is stand-up with her new show called A Little Treat.

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,880
 And if you wanna find all the details for that,

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,160
 go to her Instagram.

36
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,880
 It's @MelanieBracewell or just Google her name

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
 and A Little Treat UK tour.

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,720
 It'll all come up,

39
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720
 but basically as of March 1st, she's gonna be in Dorwich,

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,400
 then she's gonna be going to Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester,

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,440
 Edinburgh, Newcastle, Glasgow, Leeds and Cardiff.

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,160
 So it's a limited run, but the tickets are selling fast,

43
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,560
 so quickly get in now before she heads back over to Oz,

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,840
 where just a heads up for the Aussies and New Zealanders,

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,920
 she's gonna be on tour with this show from May.

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,080
 All the details are online, but for now, enjoy her here,

47
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,200
 dorking out with me, Andy and James,

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,760
 on no such thing as a fish, on with the show.

49
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,340
 (upbeat music)

50
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,680
 (bell ringing)

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,780
 (speaking in foreign language)

52
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,780
 (speaking in foreign language)

53
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,360
 (upbeat music)

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,040
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,960
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

57
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,600
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,440
 and Mel Bracewell, and once again,

60
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,840
 we have gathered around the microphones

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,880
 and in a particular order, here we go.

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,360
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Mel.

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,880
 - My fact this week is that the New Zealand government

65
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,320
 is stopping invasive species by using

66
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,600
 Selina Gomez Oreos.

67
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,980
 - That's huge.

68
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,640
 - It's specifically possum.

69
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,840
 So there's a huge possum problem in New Zealand.

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,880
 There's no natural predators for possums.

71
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,080
 Basically, they were trying to lure out

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
 the really persistent possums that weren't

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
 able to be trapped by other means.

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,200
 They say what happens often is that they will go

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
 and have a little bit of bait, get a bit sick,

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,440
 and then go, "I'm never gonna eat that bait ever again,"

77
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,120
 or they get almost stuck in a trap,

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,440
 and then they don't ever go towards traps again.

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,680
 So they were trying to find something that would lure

80
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,360
 these possums that are very afraid of the traps in,

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,720
 and what works specifically was Oreos,

82
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,640
 but not as any, they had to be the Selina Gomez Oreos

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,440
 because they like them so much.

84
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,680
 - So they have a combination of chocolate and cinnamon

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,840
 that possums just love.

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
 - What a review.

87
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,920
 What a review for the Oreos.

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,960
 - I reckon I would be straight in those traps.

89
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,800
 - Yeah, really.

90
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,040
 - They do sound very, this is not an effort

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,000
 for Selina Gomez or for Oreos.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,960
 But she's put a lot of work into the flavour profile, I think.

93
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,760
 - Oh yeah, it was like years.

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,920
 She really wanted to be in it.

95
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
 - She was in the lab, wasn't she?

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,760
 - She wanted to be in Oreos.

97
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,040
 - It hasn't been a new album from her in quite some time.

98
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,440
 - If you're a singer, that's another...

99
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,560
 - Sorry, who do you think Selina Gomez is?

100
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,840
 - I don't know, I was faster.

101
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
 - A scientist?

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,920
 - This was an article on the Spinoff,

103
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,080
 which is a New Zealand website,

104
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,040
 and that was one of my favourite parts of the article

105
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,800
 is that the scientist does not know who Selina Gomez is.

106
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,360
 He said, "I don't know who she is,

107
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
 I just know she makes a good Oreo."

108
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,760
 What was she saying?

109
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,040
 - She has made no comment.

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,080
 They have asked repeatedly,

111
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 "What do you think that your Oreos are being used

112
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680
 to wipe out for us in New Zealand?"

113
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
 - She's a busy woman.

114
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
 - She's a busy woman.

115
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,680
 - What's a tough gig as well?

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,280
 Because it is being used for what is getting rid of a pest.

117
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,120
 - It's kind of...

118
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
 - It's being used to protect native New Zealand.

119
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
 - Absolutely.

120
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
 - But at a cost of killing an animal.

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
 If you're against that, that's a big issue.

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,920
 - Like, if you sent her an email this week,

123
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
 I don't know if you did or not,

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,320
 but if you sent her an email,

125
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,840
 say, "Dear Miss Gomez,

126
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,360
 have you been killing gunnables in New Zealand?"

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
 She's not gonna respond to that.

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,960
 - P.S., what do you do?

129
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,040
 What's your line of work?

130
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
 - The line she's used as the strap line

131
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,160
 is great for movie night

132
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,800
 and make wonderful birthday treats

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,840
 and music award-watch party snacks.

134
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,160
 She didn't include an exterminating

135
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,400
 and invasive species.

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,280
 - The initial experiment that they had toyed with,

137
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,520
 what they would do is they'd leave these things outside of traps

138
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,120
 so that the possums would get a taste for them.

139
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,360
 And what they were toying up was actually using drugs,

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,120
 like addictive drugs, right?

141
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,840
 And then they read a study about chocolate and cinnamon

142
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,240
 having similar properties in similar properties of addiction.

143
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,200
 And so they would leave them out and not trap them

144
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,400
 and then get them addicted to these Oreos

145
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,920
 and then that's really interesting.

146
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,520
 - Well, they're gonna stop making these things.

147
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,480
 This is a limited edition Oreo.

148
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,760
 - That's the issue, yeah.

149
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
 - They're gonna run out

150
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
 and they're gonna need something else to lure

151
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,760
 in the possums into the traps.

152
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,600
 - Yeah.

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
 - No, since it's a fish kit cut.

154
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,840
 - Yes.

155
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680
 (laughing)

156
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
 - What do you think?

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,360
 - I don't want to be part of them.

158
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,920
 - It's nice for podcast listening parties.

159
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,800
 - Fish, are we just saying fish flavored kit cut?

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,960
 - No, cinnamon and chocolate.

161
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,800
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
 The possums aren't gonna eat that.

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,440
 - No, fish flavored kit cut.

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,280
 - I think I would.

165
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,120
 - Would you?

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,800
 (laughing)

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,640
 - Fish ringer.

169
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,960
 (laughing)

170
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,600
 - It's not legally protected term, is it?

171
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,400
 - Right, very true.

172
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,600
 - So these guys have come over to New Zealand

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,400
 from Australia, is that right?

174
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
 - That's right.

175
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
 - Yeah, Australia.

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,920
 And then there's some pieces that have been introduced

177
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
 from England as well.

178
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,320
 And sorry guys, sorry to bring it up.

179
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,240
 But look, we were bought for that song.

180
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
 (laughing)

181
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 We were asked to come.

182
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,560
 (laughing)

183
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
 So the reason that they're not a problem

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,880
 as much in Australia is because they do have predators.

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,480
 And one of them is the powerful owl.

186
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
 - Oh.

187
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,920
 - And the powerful owl is Australia's largest owl.

188
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,120
 And it is able to disembowel a possum

189
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
 in less than 20 seconds.

190
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,440
 - Wow.

191
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,840
 - That's impressive when you say it like that.

192
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,160
 But I've no metric of how long it should take me

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,080
 to disembowel a possum.

194
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,760
 - You know what I mean, like, like we're--

195
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,600
 - Bring it in.

196
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,880
 (laughing)

197
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,040
 - So I know what you mean, wow.

198
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,960
 - The interesting thing, the reason they disembowel it

199
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,040
 is because they're meat eaters

200
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,920
 and they're not interested in eating vegetables,

201
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,040
 but the possums eat vegetables.

202
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,440
 And so they don't want to eat their insides

203
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,960
 because they're just full of useless green stuff.

204
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,520
 They want to eat their meat.

205
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,880
 - The equivalent of a kid picking the peas out

206
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,360
 of their food.

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,200
 - Nice.

208
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,720
 (laughing)

209
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
 - Do you know why possums were brought over

210
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,240
 to New Zealand in the first place?

211
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
 - They were brought over for the fur trade.

212
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
 - Oh yeah.

213
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,760
 - And it didn't work for a fur,

214
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,160
 but then the numbers exploded.

215
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,200
 And I think there are now 47 million give or take,

216
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,280
 which ironically would be plenty for a thriving fur.

217
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,440
 - That's a lot of fur.

218
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 - That's one of the fur trades then said,

219
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,480
 like maybe about 15, 20 years ago.

220
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,640
 - Hey, why don't we turn these guys into lovely pelts?

221
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,240
 And that's a really good idea.

222
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
 Wait a minute.

223
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
 Why don't you the guys who brought them over

224
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,200
 to the first place?

225
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,680
 - I'm not trying to say I'm on the side of big fur.

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,520
 - Yeah.

227
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,840
 - But then, as you say, you've got loads of invasions.

228
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,880
 You've got weasels and stoats and rabbits.

229
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,160
 The really annoying thing,

230
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,440
 the stoats were brought in to control the rabbits,

231
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,920
 which had been brought in.

232
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
 - Yeah.

233
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,600
 - I don't know.

234
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,160
 - It's the old lady who's followed a fly.

235
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
 - Yeah.

236
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,160
 - Yes.

237
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
 - It's mad.

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 - The other thing they're doing with them is

239
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,360
 it's become a bit of a delicacy over in places

240
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,800
 like Hong Kong and Taiwan and China and so on.

241
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,560
 And so they're sold over there.

242
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,040
 And they're sold under the name Kiwi Bear.

243
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,440
 - That's the meal that you have.

244
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,280
 - Kiwi Bear.

245
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,760
 - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

246
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
 Yeah.

247
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,160
 - One pest that really ravages New Zealand

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
 and it's more difficult to get rid of are hedgehogs.

249
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,640
 And what people think is because hedgehogs are quite cute.

250
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,320
 Is that they're cuter and they're diabolical.

251
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,120
 They'll eat, they'll eat birds, eggs, and things like that.

252
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,200
 But because people think they're cute.

253
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,560
 They're less likely to want to.

254
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,760
 - Can I give you a 10?

255
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,600
 - Yeah.

256
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,440
 - They're a bit of them.

257
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,280
 - Yeah.

258
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,720
 - Because when we were a kid, we were told

259
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,800
 that if you build a bonfire, a hedgehog will always go inside it.

260
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,920
 So you have to check it before you set it on fire.

261
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,760
 That hedgehogs.

262
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,600
 - That's true.

263
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
 - So I think they're attracted to them or something?

264
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,360
 - They're hibernating them, don't they?

265
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
 - Today.

266
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,040
 - They go and they think,

267
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
 "Oh, lovely, nice pile of leaves."

268
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

269
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
 - I was wondering about this.

270
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,560
 Is that working?

271
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,120
 - That your responses make it look like an accident.

272
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,440
 (laughing)

273
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
 - Yeah.

274
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,400
 It's called the Beatrix Potter effect.

275
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,880
 It's why, apparently there are more in New Zealand

276
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,840
 than in Britain.

277
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,320
 Which is where they're obviously native to Britain

278
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,520
 than not native to New Zealand.

279
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,680
 And it's been proposed that we put all the hedgehogs

280
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,200
 on a big chip and sail it over.

281
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,040
 - Yeah.

282
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,880
 - But I don't think it's a project.

283
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,720
 - What did you do?

284
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
 - I was not being proposed by anyone.

285
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,240
 - What they had said was that the reason they introduced it

286
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,440
 was to remind settlers of gardens in the UK,

287
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,120
 is the reason that you put them on a big ship and send them back

288
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,760
 because if you put them on a small dinghy,

289
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
 they're just gonna pop like...

290
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
 (laughing)

291
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
 - Yep.

292
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
 (laughing)

293
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,640
 - So I'm just thinking if it did hit something

294
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,720
 and they had to do an escape,

295
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,640
 quick everyone into the emergence, oh shit.

296
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,240
 (laughing)

297
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,360
 - Women and children first, hedgehogs definitely last.

298
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,520
 (laughing)

299
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
 - Is it controversial with it?

300
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,560
 'Cause I know that you've got this whole

301
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,320
 and brilliant national scheme.

302
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,160
 - Yeah.

303
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,000
 - I love it. - Yeah.

304
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,840
 - Predator-free New Zealand.

305
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
 - Yes, yes.

306
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,400
 - Like I'm a fan of all those individual elements, right?

307
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,760
 - You guys are trying it here, very slowly though.

308
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,600
 (laughing)

309
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,400
 - We're starting at the top, you know?

310
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,240
 - That's a print sandwich, aren't we?

311
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,320
 - I was trying to get there, but I didn't want to say it.

312
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,560
 (laughing)

313
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,440
 - We've just all had a buzz on our phones

314
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
 that he's been arrested to.

315
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

316
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,800
 - Yeah, he's trying to arresting the possum, you know?

317
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,080
 Sorry, but it seemed like it's a very sort of big

318
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,520
 community effort, you know?

319
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,280
 People are setting up traps in their gardens.

320
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,120
 - Yeah.

321
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,880
 - There was this school in 2022

322
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,320
 on a place called, is it Rackiera or Stewart Island?

323
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
 - Oh, yeah.

324
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,400
 - And they had a hundred day challenge for the children

325
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,280
 to kill as many rodents as possible.

326
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,120
 - Yeah.

327
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,280
 - And the 40 students who were taking part,

328
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,440
 they caught 600 rats between them.

329
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,120
 One five-year-old did in 60 rats over three months.

330
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,480
 - That's the thing that they say

331
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,160
 if a kid is trying to harm animals,

332
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,720
 that's like the sign of a psychopath,

333
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,960
 but we're trying to sort of get them to get to that point.

334
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,480
 - It's a controversial thing to an extent,

335
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,560
 because about a decade before that in 2010,

336
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,840
 a school got questioned because they did this,

337
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,320
 they did this kind of hunt for possums and for rats,

338
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
 but then they got the kids to play a game of possum tossing

339
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,480
 where who could throw the possum, the furthest,

340
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,480
 and a lot of surveys to see how people felt about that.

341
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,960
 - I gotta say, in 20 years' time,

342
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,960
 you guys are gonna have an enormous prison population

343
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,680
 or some incredible sports teams

344
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,120
 with just a killer instinct.

345
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,800
 (laughing)

346
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,640
 - Absolutely.

347
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,560
 - The New Zealand Empire begins to spread across the world.

348
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,040
 - I can go the other way, so New Zealand has bush ticks

349
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,960
 as do Australia, but they've recently been introduced

350
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,040
 to America with quite a lot of problems.

351
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,120
 And so much so, the first one they found

352
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,480
 was a couple of years ago in New Jersey,

353
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,720
 and a woman had been sharing her sheep

354
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,000
 and she came in with these ticks over her

355
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
 and said, I think there's a problem here

356
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
 and it turned out to be these invasive ones.

357
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
 And she had so many on her,

358
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,560
 she had over 1,000 on her pants alone.

359
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,680
 - Wow, she was just head to toe in these ticks.

360
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,520
 - In ticks.

361
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,040
 - Wait, does the person know her sheep?

362
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,120
 - It was a person.

363
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
 - Got it.

364
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,960
 - And she survived.

365
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
 - She survived, yeah.

366
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,560
 So if you don't pull them out and leave the head in,

367
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
 particularly Aussie ones, you get Lyme disease.

368
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,000
 - Yeah, I assume they just sprayed her

369
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,560
 with something not very nice and the ticks fell off.

370
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,400
 - Oh, what a pickle.

371
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,240
 - That's a being.

372
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,080
 (laughing)

373
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,760
 - And what it is, isn't it?

374
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,400
 What's the pickle?

375
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,680
 Like, as in...

376
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,080
 - It's covered in a thousand ticks.

377
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,000
 - There's no good side.

378
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
 - Oh, I thought a pickle means like,

379
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,200
 what a pickle I've found myself in.

380
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,240
 - Do you think that there's two sides to a pickle?

381
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,080
 - Yeah.

382
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
 (laughing)

383
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,080
 - I think being in a pickle is bad overall.

384
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,920
 - Is it?

385
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
 - That's saying, there's two sides to every pickle.

386
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,040
 (laughing)

387
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,520
 - That's the name of my older brother.

388
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
 (laughing)

389
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,280
 - Oh, I guess that in a pickle,

390
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,400
 you think of someone who's trying to make a decision.

391
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,240
 - Yeah.

392
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,080
 - Right, I can't.

393
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
 - What a pickle if I'm myself in.

394
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,760
 - No, you're in trouble.

395
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,360
 - It's like, but in a pickle,

396
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,760
 it's kind of both sides are still bad, right?

397
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
 - No, you're on the homes of a dilemma.

398
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,600
 You're in a pickle.

399
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,440
 - Yeah, a nightmare.

400
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
 - What about a pickle?

401
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,960
 (laughing)

402
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,800
 Unbelievable.

403
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,240
 You can't rely on guests just to hoof you out of problems.

404
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,680
 (laughing)

405
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,240
 Well, have you ever seen a peacock wild in New Zealand?

406
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,680
 - I haven't seen them wild in New Zealand.

407
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,720
 I think I may have seen them wild in Australia.

408
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,560
 - Oh, okay.

409
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
 Is there a big problem in New Zealand as well?

410
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,400
 - Yeah, okay.

411
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,240
 - Which I didn't know about.

412
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,720
 And it's partly because the possums

413
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,280
 have been successfully trapped and hunted

414
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,600
 in various areas.

415
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,440
 Well, no one's eating those delicious, delicious peacock eggs.

416
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,040
 They're also invasive and they're feral

417
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,120
 and they're very hard to catch

418
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,160
 because they're very wary of humans.

419
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,040
 They flee, they do lots of damage to crops

420
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,880
 and things like that.

421
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,600
 But obviously, they're also very beautiful.

422
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,440
 - Oh, yeah.

423
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,600
 - They're kind of the best animals to get over there

424
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
 when you have them.

425
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,280
 - Yeah, cute.

426
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,360
 - But it is for the amazing birds of New Zealand,

427
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
 which are beautiful.

428
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,920
 And in the areas where they've managed to fence it off,

429
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,200
 they've done various islands.

430
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,320
 The birds have all come back.

431
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,160
 - Yeah.

432
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
 - And it's now a cacophony of incredible birds

433
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,160
 nesting there and it is pretty amazing.

434
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,000
 - It is beautiful.

435
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,840
 - Yeah.

436
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,760
 And if it takes a million possums skulls

437
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,840
 to crush under our heels, we'll do it.

438
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,360
 (laughing)

439
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
 Fish kick cats are now available in your local stores.

440
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,140
 (upbeat music)

441
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

442
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,280
 And that is my fact.

443
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,560
 My fact this week is that one of the reasons

444
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,360
 married couples slept in twin beds in Victorian England

445
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,000
 is because doctors claimed that the weak sleepers

446
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,400
 stole their partner's vitality during the night.

447
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,040
 - Mmm, I think that's true.

448
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,880
 - Yeah.

449
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,720
 (laughing)

450
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,560
 - Oh, you're sick.

451
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
 - Would you say like if I'm snoring all night

452
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,400
 and my wife's just gonna wake up tired?

453
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,240
 - Yes.

454
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,080
 - Absolutely.

455
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,360
 I think though it could be the weak sleepers

456
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
 also the one who wakes easily.

457
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
 So you would be, so it's a hell of a pickle.

458
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,600
 - But this is a situation.

459
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,640
 (laughing)

460
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,080
 - And what's the good part of it?

461
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,920
 - Yeah.

462
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,440
 - But this isn't about snoring waking up.

463
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,920
 This is just about someone being an energy draze.

464
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,760
 - Yeah.

465
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,800
 - Yeah, it's sapping the vital.

466
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,040
 - It went more to it, didn't it?

467
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,280
 It was like electromagnetic energy

468
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
 was being sucked from you.

469
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,200
 - Okay, in that case, who the hell is saying this shit?

470
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,080
 - Well, this is Victorian England.

471
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,920
 So, all right, okay.

472
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,680
 - Yeah, all of it, all of it to England.

473
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,280
 We're currently looking into getting twin beds

474
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,560
 in our house and as happens with you guys,

475
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,720
 you start Googling stuff and you know,

476
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,880
 what do I know about twin beds?

477
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,920
 - Unfortunately.

478
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
 - But the thing is with you,

479
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,400
 this is getting more into it

480
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,160
 because previously you're a bunk bed sweatshirt.

481
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,000
 - Yeah, exactly.

482
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Yeah, I'm currently sleeping in a bottom bunk bed

483
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,040
 of my son's room while my wife's in bed

484
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,280
 with our three kids.

485
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,120
 - All right.

486
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

487
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,800
 - Looking into getting twin beds.

488
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 - Yeah, but not for me and my wife

489
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,960
 for our two youngest kids.

490
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,800
 - Okay, thank you.

491
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
 - I'm just kidding.

492
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 (laughing)

493
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,680
 - Now you know that your vitality is being drained.

494
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,440
 That may change, you may.

495
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,080
 - Fortunately, someone had the same question

496
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,360
 about the history of twin beds

497
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,920
 and that was Lancaster University Professor Hillary Hines

498
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,600
 and she wrote a cultural history of twin beds.

499
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,760
 As she was looking into it,

500
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,080
 she discovered that it was believed in around 1860s

501
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,240
 that it would literally be taking away your energy.

502
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
 - But the quotes are so extreme,

503
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,360
 but this was one of my favorites.

504
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
 Each sleeper should have a single bed

505
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,120
 in a large, clean, light room.

506
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,000
 So it's to pass all the hours of sleep in a pure fresh air.

507
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,040
 And those who fail in this,

508
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,960
 well in the end fail in health and strength of lemon brain

509
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,920
 and will die while their days are not all told.

510
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,760
 - Oh, wow.

511
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,360
 - It's like, they should, you should do this

512
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,760
 and then it's going, no, you'll die.

513
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,600
 - You will die.

514
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,960
 - It's very powerful, you know.

515
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
 It's quite persuasive.

516
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,000
 - There's like quite a long standing history

517
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,440
 of people sleeping in separate rooms,

518
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,240
 even in the British aristocracy.

519
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,800
 And that is because, well, for lots of different reasons,

520
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,600
 one reason because you're just going to have a better night's sleep

521
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,440
 quite often.

522
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,240
 But secondly, because they thought that it was unhealthy

523
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,400
 to sleep in the same bed,

524
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,160
 because germ theory had just come out

525
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,840
 and they didn't really know how the germs would work.

526
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,880
 And the other thing is like,

527
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,240
 if you wanted a bit of romance,

528
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,360
 you could go to your partner's room

529
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,720
 rather than sort of like nudging them with a cold foot

530
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,480
 and saying, do you fancy a bit?

531
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,400
 You actually have to knock on the door and say, you know,

532
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,240
 let me in.

533
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,560
 - You're an action-tik-nix.

534
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
 (all laughing)

535
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,720
 - Interesting that you should,

536
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
 that was my technique and that was my wife's technique.

537
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,240
 - We seem to be in a pickle.

538
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
 - There's also the other thing of this

539
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,360
 with, so the Edwardian, so early 20th century,

540
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,920
 a big bit of the reason that they had separate rooms

541
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,280
 was to allow adultery.

542
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,680
 - Oh.

543
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,200
 - But, bum, bum, bum, because upper class Edwardian society

544
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,320
 was absolutely right with the adultery.

545
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,800
 And it was kind of expected

546
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,240
 that the husband and wife would get married,

547
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,360
 they'd have some children,

548
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,400
 and then, what's the children are out?

549
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,760
 It's free play.

550
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,600
 - Right.

551
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,320
 - And so, out of the house or the womb?

552
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,200
 - Out of the womb.

553
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,040
 - Okay, so while the children are still living there.

554
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,080
 - Ideally, they'll be at school

555
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,600
 or off on a trip or whatever.

556
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,080
 - No, no, no, it's not when they've grown up and moved out.

557
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,560
 It's literally in the family home.

558
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,200
 - It's literally, it's especially,

559
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,120
 not just in the family home,

560
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,360
 but in grandhouses where you might go visiting,

561
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,400
 you might go for a weekend party or something,

562
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,720
 so you'd have single rooms.

563
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,160
 And some of these rooms have little brass brackets outside

564
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,000
 with a little name label saying exactly who's in where.

565
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,520
 And supposedly, it was to help the butler identify who was who.

566
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,880
 But it had a very useful second purpose

567
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,440
 of allowing a bit of hanky-panky,

568
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,240
 so you're not knocking on the wrong door

569
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
 in the middle of the night

570
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,520
 and ending up in a real, you know, tangle.

571
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,160
 - Even more than that, there was a house called

572
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,360
 Wentworth Woodhouse in South Yorkshire, which was the biggest house

573
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,920
 in England, basically, and today,

574
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,240
 when they had all the tops coming to visit,

575
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,760
 they gave everyone a map to all the bedrooms.

576
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,600
 - Brilliant.

577
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
 - So you could kind of look at the map and go,

578
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,600
 "Oh, I want to go to Mrs. Jones's room."

579
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,280
 So I need to go up here down there, around there.

580
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,840
 This Wentworth Woodhouse was the biggest private house

581
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,120
 in the whole of England.

582
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,960
 - Right.

583
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,800
 - Victorian era.

584
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,960
 How many bedrooms do you think it had?

585
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,680
 - Ooh.

586
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,840
 - Riddle me this.

587
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,520
 - I'll say, I mean, bedrooms, I'll say high,

588
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
 jubble figures.

589
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
 - Yeah.

590
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,080
 - I mean, it can't have more than about 50 or 60 bedrooms

591
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,880
 I would have seen. - Oh, I was going way more.

592
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,720
 - Oh, wow.

593
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,560
 - Oh, wow, wow. - Oh, wow.

594
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,400
 - The dead crusher.

595
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,040
 - The fat, I mean, it's heavy.

596
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,880
 - Oh, silly.

597
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
 (laughing)

598
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,120
 - I feel like the other times I feel on this podcast,

599
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,920
 Dad, you always ruin the kissing game.

600
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,000
 (laughing)

601
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,560
 You get so high.

602
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,640
 (laughing)

603
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,520
 The real fact feels kind of lame and comparison.

604
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,680
 - You want me backing me up?

605
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

606
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
 - I listen to Andy.

607
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,520
 - I'm sorry, sorry.

608
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,760
 - Well, no, I think, 'cause I was thinking that,

609
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,320
 I know George Harrison has a house,

610
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,440
 which is absolutely monstrous, like it's huge,

611
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,640
 and I thought that that had in the hundreds.

612
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,400
 I thought that had close to like 400.

613
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,320
 So I'm going to say, 400.

614
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
 (laughing)

615
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,800
 - Okay, I'm going to say, well, maybe I'll lowball it.

616
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,840
 I'll say 42.

617
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
 - Okay, okay.

618
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 - Well, I said 50 or 60.

619
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,680
 - Yeah.

620
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,520
 - 42, 400.

621
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,320
 - George Harrison, well, on about 4.

622
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,760
 - My sweet Lord, Dan is the closest.

623
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
 - Oh, yes.

624
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,960
 - Oh my gosh, I'm sorry for doubting you.

625
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,840
 - There we go, 300 rooms.

626
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,680
 - Wow.

627
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,520
 - Really close to you.

628
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,280
 - Basically, there would have big hunting parties,

629
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,000
 wherever one would come and shoot guns and stuff.

630
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,960
 - But interestingly,

631
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,760
 - Interesting, it was only two bathrooms,

632
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,360
 'cause of the punting arrangements of the time.

633
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,200
 - Yeah.

634
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,040
 - And that was fine.

635
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,880
 Yeah.

636
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,720
 - Yeah.

637
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,360
 - And these were quite modern.

638
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,200
 This is the interesting thing.

639
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,640
 Because of the association with greater hygiene

640
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,360
 and not having your energy sapped away from you,

641
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,640
 they were seen from the late 19th century and early 20th

642
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
 to be the mom thing.

643
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,600
 Now we think of them as being quite old fashioned,

644
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 but they were really kind of modern and quite cool.

645
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,240
 - They were, but again, it was for the richer people.

646
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,080
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

647
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,440
 - And normal people, like forever,

648
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
 normal people would share beds.

649
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,480
 And then what happened was around the 50s.

650
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,560
 There were a few different reasons,

651
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,640
 but one of the reasons is television started to be more realistic

652
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,600
 and television shows would show married couple

653
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
 and also the haze code had finished.

654
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,200
 So people were allowed to show men and women in bed together.

655
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,520
 So people started showing men and women in bed together

656
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,240
 and everyone thought, well, now that's the modern thing.

657
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,400
 That's the fashion thing.

658
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,240
 - Oh, is that what changed?

659
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,440
 - That's a few different things.

660
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,800
 - The haze code was fascinating.

661
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,040
 'Cause in Hollywood, you had a guideline saying,

662
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,720
 don'ts and be careful within movies.

663
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,680
 So the don'ts were explicitly do not do this.

664
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,200
 The be careful were, this is the guideline,

665
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,000
 if you're gonna do this kind of scene,

666
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,800
 and if someone who is watching it finds that offensive,

667
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,720
 they will not allow for that to be in the movie.

668
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
 So one of the things, that's very useful in the bedroom too,

669
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,160
 to have don'ts and be careful.

670
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
 - Yes.

671
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,840
 - You know?

672
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,000
 - I've always got a side on the side of this bed.

673
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
 No heavy petting, no bombing, no running.

674
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,520
 - No cold foot nudging me.

675
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,440
 (laughing)

676
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,040
 - Yeah, this was a big problem for Hollywood.

677
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,600
 So there's a specific example of a movie

678
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,440
 where the Marital Bed was one mattress

679
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,280
 and it was a Lucille Ball movie,

680
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,720
 and they had to re-shoot the scenes.

681
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,960
 So it cost $30,000 for them to go and re-shoot this.

682
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,640
 And it was simply that they just had to have it

683
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,680
 something like 12 inches apart.

684
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,560
 That was like the expected length

685
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,440
 of how far the beds needed to be far.

686
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,280
 - Oh, it's sort of safe.

687
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,120
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

688
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,960
 - In real distance for me.

689
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,800
 Am I right?

690
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,560
 (laughing and laughing)

691
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,720
 Oh my God.

692
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,760
 Okay, so some opinions about whether you prefer

693
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,720
 to sleep in bed with a partner or not.

694
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,560
 - Yeah.

695
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,400
 - Okay.

696
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,040
 - This is a recent poll by you, Gov.

697
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,640
 Five percent say their dream arrangement

698
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,560
 is different beds in the same room.

699
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,160
 So that is twin beds, okay.

700
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,520
 Ten percent say different beds in different rooms

701
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,360
 in the dream.

702
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,200
 Seventy-six percent say same bed in same room.

703
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 - Interesting.

704
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,360
 - Nobody says same bed but different rooms.

705
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,560
 (laughing)

706
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,400
 - That's it.

707
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,560
 - Wow, what a challenge.

708
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,400
 - Just my preference.

709
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,560
 - Well, there was some studies that determine

710
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,600
 that often when people sleep with their partner,

711
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,400
 their subjective view of how well they slept was higher.

712
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,640
 But the truth is that they had a worse sleep.

713
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,480
 - Oh, interesting.

714
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,720
 - So I feel like is what sleep track is due to my brain.

715
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,800
 Where I feel like I've had a great sleep

716
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,920
 and I wake up and I'll say you've had a horrendous sleep.

717
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,960
 And then I'll be in a bad mood.

718
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,240
 I'll go well, it told me I've had a bad sleep.

719
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,400
 So I'll spend the rest of my day feeling bad.

720
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
 But in the opposite, I'll have a,

721
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,360
 I feel like I've had a terrible sleep.

722
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,000
 And then my phone will say it was a great one.

723
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,840
 I'll go, you know what,

724
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
 let's really put a people in my step.

725
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
 - Yeah, I think for a lot of people,

726
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,560
 if you have a partner, there's a sense of safety.

727
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,400
 - Yes.

728
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
 - So you sort of turn around there there,

729
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,840
 everything's okay.

730
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,200
 So it doesn't matter that you woke up,

731
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
 you did it so you could check

732
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,280
 and you feel a lot more safe.

733
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,200
 - Did you read the Murray Stopes line?

734
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,040
 - Yeah.

735
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,080
 - So she, Murray Stopes, who was very, very famous

736
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
 for writing a book called "Married Love."

737
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,480
 And she was a campaigner for birth control?

738
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,320
 - Yes.

739
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,360
 - Yes, big campaigner for that, that kind of thing.

740
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
 She wrote that the twin bed set

741
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,120
 was an invention of the devil, jealous of married bliss.

742
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,280
 - I see.

743
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,440
 - And she proposed that you shouldn't have twin beds,

744
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,000
 instead the wife should have a room with a double bed

745
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,960
 and the husband should have a bedroom to himself

746
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,160
 for general use, keeping the wife's bedroom

747
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,960
 a romantic place.

748
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
 I think, and then the husband can like have a bed

749
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
 that's in the shape of a race car.

750
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,320
 (laughing)

751
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
 - The heat man.

752
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,160
 - Exactly.

753
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,320
 - Yes.

754
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,640
 - I would kill for that person

755
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,480
 about that right now.

756
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,440
 (laughing)

757
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,440
 - On an unusual bed sharing story,

758
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,520
 this John Adams and Benjamin Franklin shared a bed once.

759
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,280
 It's an excerpt from his diary in 1775.

760
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,480
 - John Adams of America, and okay.

761
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,280
 - In 1776, he described the time he had to share

762
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,880
 a tiny bed with Benjamin Franklin,

763
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
 and instead of sleeping, they had an argument

764
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,480
 that whether to keep the windows open or closed,

765
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,160
 Franklin eventually won the argument

766
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,320
 when Adams got too tired and fell asleep.

767
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,640
 - Nice.

768
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,480
 - Who really wins?

769
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
 Because Adams is falling asleep first.

770
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,120
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, sure.

771
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,560
 - And also, Adams became president of Franklin,

772
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,400
 never did.

773
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,240
 - Yeah, double win.

774
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,120
 - Double win for Adams, you two Franklin.

775
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,960
 (laughing)

776
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,040
 - Nice.

777
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,880
 - I mentioned before that snoring's a problem.

778
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,240
 There's been a new study that gives you a way out

779
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,520
 of snoring, and that is, before you go to bed,

780
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
 you have to blow on a cunt shell.

781
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,680
 (laughing)

782
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,400
 - Oh, no way.

783
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,480
 - You might have seen the study before

784
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,040
 that if you blow on did reduce, that's supposed to help

785
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,160
 because it helps your breathing.

786
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,360
 You have to do circular breathings.

787
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
 Well, apparently cunt shells are even better,

788
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,320
 because if you learn properly how to blow a cunt shell,

789
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,440
 you have to do very deep breathing.

790
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
 You have to do very strong exhalations,

791
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,760
 and also the spiral shape of the shell

792
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,520
 gives a unique type of blow.

793
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
 That means you won't snore.

794
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,360
 - No way.

795
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,200
 - I've got it.

796
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,040
 - I've got it, I've got it.

797
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
 - I've got it, I've got it.

798
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
 - I've got it, I've got it.

799
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,560
 - I've got it, I've got it.

800
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
 - I've got it, I've got it.

801
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,400
 - I've got it.

802
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,240
 - I've got it, I've got it.

803
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,080
 - I've got it, I've got it.

804
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,920
 - I've got it, I've got it.

805
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,760
 - I've got it, I've got it.

806
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,600
 - I've got it, I've got it.

807
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,440
 - I've got it, I've got it.

808
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,280
 - I've got it.

809
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,120
 - I've got it.

810
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
 - Oh my gosh.

811
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,400
 - Yeah, no, I've got a big blowable, it makes an incredible note when you blow it.

812
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,600
 - It's really good you get it from. - Long way where it was.

813
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,240
 Yeah, it was an island a holiday and I think someone like the Caribbean was many years ago.

814
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,320
 But it makes a great noise. - Was it not when your school crashed on that desert island?

815
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,640
 - I'd rather not talk about that weekend.

816
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,080
 - If you were the only survivor, how weak were the race?

817
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:14,280
 - I was king of that island, Joel.

818
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,360
 Wow, wearing my possum skull armor.

819
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:30,680
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

820
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,760
 My fact is, it's eight degrees warmer inside a daffodil than outside.

821
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,360
 If you're feeling chilly and you're listening to this, there's a daffodil nearby.

822
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,320
 Spring is coming. Get it in there.

823
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,800
 - You could put most a little pink.

824
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
 - Are you about to open up when I think you're about to open up?

825
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,760
 - No, no, okay.

826
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,520
 Because when I saw the list of facts, I saw a daffodil out while I was going for a walk.

827
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,680
 And so I put my finger in the daffodil.

828
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,440
 And I sent the photo to Dan and he did not reply to the photo.

829
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,200
 - I'm sorry, but it was such a ominous thing to see.

830
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,840
 - It was uncomfortable when I was sitting next to my wife and mal slipped into my DMs

831
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,880
 with a picture of her fingering a daffodil.

832
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,720
 - Is it doing some research from the shot?

833
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,080
 - Yeah, that's a photo there. Amazing.

834
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,280
 - Was it what?

835
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,160
 - Yeah, I can't tell.

836
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,480
 It was such a cold day that I don't know, like,

837
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,160
 because it's up to eight degrees, right?

838
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,400
 That requires probably a bit of sunshine.

839
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,400
 - You probably also need to keep it in there for a certain amount of time.

840
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,600
 And you can't just stand there with your finger in a daffodil.

841
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,920
 - The part people will pop over.

842
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,240
 But basically, the daffodils are really interesting.

843
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,440
 They're not like a normal flower because they've got this trumpet thing,

844
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,200
 which most flowers don't have.

845
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,960
 And they want to get bees in and pollinating insects in general.

846
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,000
 And often, daffos are some of the first flowers of spring.

847
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,840
 So it's quite cold still when they're up.

848
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,960
 And the cone acts as a wind break.

849
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,760
 And the petals are directing sunlight inwards.

850
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,080
 And third thing, the stem is turning the trumpet away from cold breezes.

851
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,840
 So basically, they're making it a lovely,

852
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,440
 as warm as possible environment to lure in any pollinating insects

853
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,880
 that are up and about at this time of year.

854
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,680
 - I love it. I love it.

855
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,120
 - It's like a restaurant with a fireplace.

856
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
 That's very nice.

858
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,280
 - So it's very charming.

859
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,000
 - So I think there aren't any bees around at this time of year.

860
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,280
 Are they really?

861
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,480
 - No, probably not.

862
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
 - I think they'll be pollinated by flies.

863
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,800
 - Yes.

864
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,360
 - And this is the thing, the flies that are around this time of year,

865
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,720
 they tend to be colourblind.

866
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,320
 And so that's why the flowers that you see this time of year,

867
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,680
 like snow drops and daffodils are white and yellow,

868
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,840
 because they stand out against the greens.

869
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,240
 - Oh, contrast is the main thing, yeah, yeah.

870
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,880
 - And then later in the year, you get more colourful ones.

871
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,360
 - It's so good.

872
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,000
 - Does the heat in the daffodil sort of warm up the pollen?

873
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,320
 So it's like, like a hot meal.

874
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,720
 - Is it like, is there any?

875
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,560
 - Yeah, I like it.

876
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
 Yes, I'm going to say yes, it absolutely does.

877
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,160
 - Anyone have your daffs out already?

878
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,800
 - Yes.

879
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,960
 - We're recording this on the 19th of February.

880
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,000
 - I've got a couple of my gardeners.

881
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,160
 - I do, they started coming up a few days ago, yeah.

882
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,960
 - How are they looking?

883
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,720
 - They're looking at yellow.

884
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,960
 - Yeah, is the head like bent a little bit?

885
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,080
 - It is, it's bending down.

886
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,960
 - Oh, dear.

887
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,280
 Because according to English folklore,

888
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,880
 that means you're going to die this year.

889
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,560
 - Oh, damn.

890
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,400
 - Oh, man.

891
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,320
 - Oh, man.

892
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,720
 - No, no, that is a pickle.

893
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,800
 (laughing)

894
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,120
 - Beautiful flowers or death.

895
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,680
 - Oh, that's very funny.

896
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,360
 - If you dream of them, any maiden who dreams of daffodils

897
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,080
 is warned not to go into a wood with her lover.

898
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,960
 - Right.

899
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,520
 - And if you see the first daffodil of the year

900
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,600
 out of all your friends and stuff,

901
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,320
 it means you'll have more gold than silver

902
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,000
 for the rest of the year.

903
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,440
 Though silver's doing quite well, isn't it?

904
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,120
 - Yeah, both are overpriced at the moment.

905
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

906
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,680
 - I'm just saying if you're about Bitcoin.

907
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,960
 (laughing)

908
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,960
 - But even more gold in silver doesn't necessarily mean

909
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,560
 like more money.

910
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,600
 If you had a million silver coins and two gold coins,

911
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,800
 you still have more wealth or more.

912
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,680
 - Well, also they're both good things.

913
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,080
 It's like a reverse pickle.

914
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,920
 - Yeah.

915
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,720
 (laughing)

916
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,560
 - And the daffodil bending over though.

917
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,400
 - Yeah.

918
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,800
 - That's quite sort of daffodilish to do, I would say.

919
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,360
 I would say it's a classic daffodil move.

920
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,480
 In fact, the name daffodil, when it goes back to Narcissus,

921
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,400
 which is what the family it's from, is it?

922
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,560
 - Yeah.

923
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,400
 - That was obviously because when Narcissus was looking down

924
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,360
 into the water, he couldn't stop staring at his reflection

925
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,920
 in the mythology and they say that daffodils do the same.

926
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,640
 They look down at the water and looking at themselves.

927
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,080
 - But do you know that Narcissus is actually Narcissus poeticus?

928
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,760
 It seems, which is a different, it's not the daffodil that you know.

929
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,480
 It's a related daffodil, which is white.

930
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,760
 And so the, like, that's the one that Linnaeus called the Narcissus

931
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,560
 because he based it on that bit of mythology.

932
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,400
 - Oh.

933
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,240
 - And one of them.

934
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
 - And one of them is just a related flower.

935
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,400
 - We just have a related flower.

936
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,240
 - That's so interesting.

937
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,080
 - This is the really weird thing.

938
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,000
 There are 36 different species of daffodil, right?

939
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,720
 But they became very popular for breeding and crossbreeding

940
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,440
 and making your own variety.

941
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,800
 The different to species is varieties, right?

942
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,400
 So there are 36 species of daff,

943
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,480
 but there are 27,000 varieties.

944
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,360
 - Yes. - It's crazy.

945
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,880
 - And there's that lovely.

946
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,600
 - And loads of them are not attractive to insects.

947
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,440
 - Right.

948
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,200
 - Because they've been bred by plant breeders for their looks.

949
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,640
 They've not been breeding them for their, you know,

950
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,360
 their pollen qualities or anything,

951
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
 or their attractiveness to insects.

952
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,920
 So they've taken over the process.

953
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,280
 So that selection process has meant that lots of daffodils

954
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,960
 that you get these days are not actually especially.

955
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,320
 - So humans have to go in and propagate them, do they?

956
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

957
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,440
 If you look carefully, if you have a garden

958
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,280
 or some daffodil garden, just keep an eye out

959
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,360
 'cause you'll often find a creepy old man.

960
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,920
 - With a finger in a daffodil.

961
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
 - That's what I have.

962
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,680
 (laughing)

963
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,160
 - I'll send the photo to all of you guys.

964
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,000
 (laughing)

965
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,040
 - But there's lots of, if you go online,

966
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,440
 there's lots of missing daffodils in the UK now

967
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,960
 of these crossbreeds that they're really hoping

968
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,800
 are still out there.

969
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
 So you can find a list of people saying,

970
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,520
 if you live in this area.

971
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,440
 So for example, Lewis in the UK, in Sussex,

972
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,480
 there is a daffodil that's known as the Sussex bonfire.

973
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,680
 So they have a big bonfire of night celebration there

974
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,520
 and a local...

975
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,760
 - It's so many did he in charge.

976
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,000
 (laughing)

977
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,160
 - Yeah, there's a local plant-reader

978
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,040
 called Noel Burr, who created this thing.

979
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,000
 And it hasn't been seen for the last 20 years,

980
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,520
 but they think it must still be in someone's garden.

981
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,080
 They just haven't identified it.

982
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,520
 So they sort of say, please look around, see if you can find this.

983
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,120
 - But they look so similar, it's like a Weasewolly.

984
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,560
 'Cause it's like, do they look like a ordinary daffodil?

985
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,960
 - I think they do have different horses.

986
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

987
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,960
 There's the Mrs. Auro Backhouse daffodil as well

988
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,320
 that's missing, they're desperately hoping to find.

989
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,280
 The Mrs. William Copeland daffodil.

990
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,200
 There's all these amazing little crossbreeds

991
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,040
 that become famous.

992
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,440
 - There's hope that you show them daffodil hunters.

993
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,280
 - Yes.

994
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
 - I feel like going around looking

995
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,160
 for interesting daffodils.

996
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,000
 - Yes, that's good.

997
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,720
 - Like, you know, what's his name?

998
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,360
 Bob Martimer, like his show where he just fishes.

999
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,840
 And, you know, people will love it

1000
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,440
 because it's like nice and relaxing.

1001
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,760
 You see lots of countryside,

1002
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,440
 and you also get a great comedian.

1003
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,280
 - Yeah.

1004
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,120
 - I think that's a really good thing.

1005
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
 - Just me crawling through people's gardens.

1006
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,280
 (laughing)

1007
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,360
 - Just looking for a rare daffodil.

1008
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,440
 - But I'm doing it with rummage, so I love it, yeah.

1009
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,000
 - Have you guys heard of Peter Bar, the daffodil king?

1010
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,840
 - No.

1011
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,680
 - No.

1012
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,200
 - So, daffodils originally came from Spain and Portugal,

1013
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,120
 and then they were brought here by the Romans.

1014
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,760
 And that means that in Spain and Portugal,

1015
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,960
 you have lots of different varieties of daffodils,

1016
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,320
 and in order to make the new ones,

1017
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,040
 you need to get some of the old ones and then cross them.

1018
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,120
 So he rode through Spain and Portugal,

1019
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,280
 sleeping under rocks with only a single blanket for comfort.

1020
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,800
 And was once mistaken for a famous bandit by police

1021
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,160
 as he went around looking for daffodils.

1022
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,000
 - Oh.

1023
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,800
 - And he made thousands and thousands of these.

1024
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,960
 - It sounds like something someone seems to say

1025
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,800
 that they're tough.

1026
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,680
 Like, I just sleep on a rock, see who they are.

1027
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,520
 - And let's see.

1028
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,360
 - And let's see who they are.

1029
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,440
 (all laughing)

1030
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,120
 - That looks like they're from the menosphere.

1031
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,920
 (all laughing)

1032
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,200
 - My wife has her own bed, and of course I just sleep

1033
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,040
 on the rocks.

1034
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,880
 (all laughing)

1035
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,320
 - I read a newspaper clipping about this guy,

1036
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,840
 Peter Bar, the daffodil king.

1037
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,760
 And the clipping said that the only other man

1038
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,840
 close to claiming the title was Dorian Smith,

1039
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,640
 but that gentleman is too content with his ownership

1040
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,280
 of the Cili Isles to enter in a vain rivalry.

1041
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,000
 - He owned the Cili Isles.

1042
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,480
 - These are the little islands off the coast of Cornwall,

1043
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,280
 is it, they're really, yeah, yeah.

1044
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,640
 - Cornwall is king of daffodils.

1045
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,480
 - Is it?

1046
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,320
 - Yeah.

1047
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,480
 - That's the biggest producer of daffodils in the world.

1048
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,200
 - Well, Britain is the biggest country.

1049
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,840
 It's like, this is where world leaders in daff production.

1050
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,680
 - Yes.

1051
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,520
 - It's not nothing.

1052
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,360
 (all laughing)

1053
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,160
 - It's not anything, 30, 30 million tons of bulbs.

1054
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,120
 - Can I see a million tons of bulbs?

1055
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

1056
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,520
 - It doesn't sound plausible.

1057
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,640
 - That could be a number that's over 100 years.

1058
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,320
 I'm not sure if that's an annual produce,

1059
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,160
 but-- - Oh, right.

1060
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,000
 - No, of course it is.

1061
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,120
 (all laughing)

1062
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,960
 - Interesting.

1063
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,120
 - Yeah, you're the biggest--

1064
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,360
 - And as well, I just cut flowers,

1065
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,840
 people buy them 'cause they look nice.

1066
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,960
 - Yeah, exactly, but-- - It's awesome.

1067
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,880
 - We have mentioned this before,

1068
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,320
 but I have forgot it.

1069
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,800
 They're very poisonous.

1070
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,520
 - I should have known-- - They get like cats or dogs

1071
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,680
 and things can't eat it.

1072
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
 - Well, and humans.

1073
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
 - And humans, oh yes.

1074
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,520
 - Oh, okay.

1075
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,360
 (all laughing)

1076
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
 - Which it's my way.

1077
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,200
 - I'll call up brunch.

1078
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
 (all laughing)

1079
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,440
 - Well, no, but this is a problem,

1080
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,760
 'cause often when you go into a local supermarket,

1081
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,960
 the flowers will be positioned right next to the fruit

1082
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,320
 and veg, right?

1083
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,760
 And there's been people saying you've got to stop leaving

1084
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,800
 the daffodils near the Chinese vegetables,

1085
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
 near the onions, because they can be mistaken for them.

1086
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,640
 And people have been hospitalized quite a few times.

1087
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,240
 - If you have a daffodil,

1088
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,000
 like-- - Me and that wake the mistaken for that.

1089
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,040
 - So they're often sold, we're not open yet, right?

1090
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,880
 - Yeah, right.

1091
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,040
 - So they look a little bit like spring onions,

1092
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,360
 and there are also some other like spring greens

1093
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,560
 that you get in China that look quite a lot like them.

1094
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,400
 - Right.

1095
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,720
 - As written and article by John Robertson,

1096
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,400
 who works at the Poison Garden in Annock.

1097
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,240
 - Oh, yeah. - To know that.

1098
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,120
 - It's like a garden with all poisonous plants in it.

1099
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,320
 And he's found lots of examples of people

1100
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,760
 being poisoned by daffodils.

1101
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,360
 He said there was some parents who were not very well,

1102
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,640
 and they had a couple of children

1103
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,200
 who were just old enough to make a stew.

1104
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,920
 - No. - And they went and picked out

1105
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,760
 what they thought were onions and put them in

1106
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,480
 and they were daffodil bulbs.

1107
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,080
 - What is the right age to make a stew?

1108
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,880
 (all laughing)

1109
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,440
 - It's a really good question, is that?

1110
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,200
 - No one of you have to get your license in the UK.

1111
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,560
 - I don't know if that's a thing in your ear.

1112
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,000
 - On bees and heat, a study from North Carolina State University

1113
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,960
 found that bumblebees carrying pollen,

1114
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,040
 their bodies heat up depending on how much pollen they have.

1115
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,240
 It's a workout.

1116
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,600
 So the weight of the pollen that they're carrying around

1117
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,040
 makes their bodies warmer.

1118
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,120
 And so they're afraid that global warming,

1119
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,560
 the workout of carrying pollen will be too much for them.

1120
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,080
 - Oh no. - And they'll overheat.

1121
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,920
 - I know. - It's true.

1122
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,520
 - You know what happens if, sorry to interrupt,

1123
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,120
 but you know what happens if a bee overheats.

1124
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,600
 We've mentioned this on our show before,

1125
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,520
 it ejaculates itself to death.

1126
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,800
 - That's really, yeah.

1127
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,480
 - Really, it just can't stop, it's just.

1128
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,280
 - It can't stop, yeah.

1129
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,640
 I can't remember the exact details,

1130
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,840
 but I remember that sentence very clearly.

1131
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,960
 - Yeah, yeah. - It's a reason.

1132
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,200
 - Wow. - Stick to the mind.

1133
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,360
 Just on the thing that Mel said,

1134
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,320
 they are now flowering two or three weeks earlier

1135
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,520
 than in the past.

1136
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,440
 This is a climatey thing.

1137
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,960
 This is a while getting warmer things.

1138
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,960
 So, if Wordsworth went for his famous walk with his sister

1139
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,440
 today, there might be nothing there at all.

1140
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,760
 'Cause all they do have already flowered

1141
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,320
 a couple of weeks ago, he'd have had to

1142
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
 have a ride about something else.

1143
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,160
 - Right.

1144
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,920
 - It doesn't seem like the biggest problem

1145
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,640
 when it's going-- - The reclining door's open.

1146
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,560
 - Yeah, this is not the biggest effect

1147
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,880
 of climate change that you can think of,

1148
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
 but it is bad, you know.

1149
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,560
 - But that is the thing about it is he says,

1150
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,440
 I wandered lonely as a cloud,

1151
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,280
 but he wasn't lonely.

1152
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,680
 He was with his sister the whole time.

1153
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,200
 - But if he'd said I wandered out there

1154
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
 with my sister, what's the rhyme?

1155
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,160
 Blister, I suppose, I've got a blister.

1156
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

1157
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,920
 - I mean, I've spent a few days in here.

1158
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,480
 I don't think the clouds are there lonely.

1159
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,240
 There's quite a few hanging out together.

1160
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,080
 - That's yesterday.

1161
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,400
 (all laughing)

1162
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,720
 - That's a thick mask across the countryside.

1163
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,560
 Yeah, you're right.

1164
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
 (all laughing)

1165
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,760
 - So, maybe he went in an ironic way.

1166
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,360
 (upbeat music)

1167
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,400
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show

1168
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,680
 and that is James.

1169
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,800
 - Okay, my fact this week is that you may be able

1170
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,280
 to cure chronically blocked noses

1171
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,560
 with a snot transplant.

1172
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,400
 (all laughing)

1173
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,240
 - Lovely.

1174
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,080
 - It's future guys.

1175
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,920
 - Yeah.

1176
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,760
 - Incredible.

1177
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,600
 - It does sound good.

1178
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,440
 - Yeah.

1179
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,280
 - We do that, I thought.

1180
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
 - Yeah, so I'm here, I'll be.

1181
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,440
 - Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know if you suffer

1182
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,000
 from this kind of thing I do.

1183
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,520
 Definitely, chronic rhinocytus.

1184
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,240
 In fact, I had surgery for it a few years ago,

1185
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
 and that was kind of the best way to deal with it.

1186
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,680
 And it kind of still is.

1187
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,680
 I read about a new study in new scientists this week,

1188
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,520
 and they've come up with this idea

1189
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,480
 of basically siphoning snot out of someone

1190
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,800
 and shoving it right up there.

1191
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,120
 It's as simple as that, really.

1192
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,880
 - But surely the people that don't have blocked noses

1193
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,360
 don't have a lot of snot to offer.

1194
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,720
 So they could probably only be a donor for one person.

1195
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,520
 (all laughing)

1196
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,440
 - There's a way to clear.

1197
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,160
 - Yeah, who you mean, well.

1198
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,960
 - Basically everyone has some kind of microbiome

1199
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,280
 in their sinuses, and what you're trying to do

1200
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,880
 is get those bacteria and viruses out of a healthy person's nose

1201
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,560
 and put them into an unhealthy person's nose.

1202
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,720
 - It's really cool.

1203
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,240
 - I think it just sounds like a great idea.

1204
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,080
 So it was one of the pioneers of it.

1205
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,640
 A scientist called Amy Molls.

1206
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,160
 - Yes, Amy Molls from Vancouver,

1207
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,600
 and another guy called Anders Mortensen from Helsingburg.

1208
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,600
 - Yes, and so she was inspired by fecal transplants.

1209
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,400
 Which we've talked about before as being very useful.

1210
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,960
 - You don't want to get those two mixed up.

1211
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,800
 - Absolutely not.

1212
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,320
 (all laughing)

1213
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,640
 - You've just put snot up this person's bum.

1214
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,320
 - Wait a minute, that means.

1215
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,400
 (all laughing)

1216
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,160
 - So yeah, it gets referred to as a sinus probiotic.

1217
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,680
 'Cause you've got, you know, this,

1218
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,640
 you're fighting snot with snot basically.

1219
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,280
 'Cause this thing, chronic sinus condition

1220
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,640
 or chronic rhino sinusitis, it sounds awful.

1221
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,480
 - It's a shocker.

1222
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
 - So you've had it.

1223
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,760
 - I still kind of have it,

1224
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,600
 but the surgery helped quite a lot.

1225
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,080
 - You've mentioned your sinuses in the past,

1226
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,560
 but I've always thought, yeah, I've got a cold too.

1227
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,200
 And I'm so sorry James.

1228
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,920
 - Like basically, I got often can't breathe.

1229
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,560
 - Yes, yes, yes.

1230
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,600
 - Just kind of vital for living.

1231
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,480
 - Absolutely, that's probably one.

1232
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,480
 But it gets dismissed by lots of doctors as a minor inconvenience,

1233
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,640
 but people living with it,

1234
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,480
 which might be up to 10% I read approaching this number.

1235
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,000
 Your face hurts, you're always bunged up,

1236
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,040
 you lose your sense of smell, headaches, bad breath.

1237
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,520
 - Try again on an aeroplane.

1238
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,760
 - Oh yeah, of course.

1239
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,600
 - Wow.

1240
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,200
 - Soon as you, you know, when your ears sort of,

1241
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,760
 when your ears pop, when that happens for you,

1242
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,640
 I just get this incredible pain and my sinuses.

1243
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,680
 - I've had that, if you've got enough light

1244
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
 and you've got a bit of a cold,

1245
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,000
 that can happen, god, it'll just suddenly.

1246
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,160
 - Oh, and that, well, allegedly,

1247
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,640
 people with it seem to be 77% likely to have depression

1248
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,160
 than those without.

1249
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,200
 'Cause it's just sort of chronically debilitating.

1250
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,600
 - Do you think there's a research team as a game?

1251
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,440
 You guys guess what?

1252
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,960
 The name of the research team trying to work out,

1253
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,520
 they're using like AI to work out the cause of,

1254
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,120
 this rhinocytus in people.

1255
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,960
 - Okay.

1256
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
 - What is the name of this research team?

1257
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,360
 - The sort of game.

1258
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,200
 - Like the acronym, you mean?

1259
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,040
 - It's not an acronym, it's just like a fun bit of wordplay.

1260
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,840
 And it's like, when you read it, you go, of course.

1261
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,600
 - Okay, blow, who knows how to fix this?

1262
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,440
 - I mean, you've got the right pun.

1263
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,600
 It turns out, well, in terms of it is, it's got nose in it,

1264
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,080
 but it's medical.

1265
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,520
 And it's about figuring out.

1266
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,680
 - Do you know Tom?

1267
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,560
 - No, it's so much simpler than that.

1268
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,680
 It's literally just a word in the medical field

1269
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,720
 that you would use a lot, a doctor.

1270
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,680
 What does a doctor do to you?

1271
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,520
 - Diet nose.

1272
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,360
 - Yes!

1273
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,360
 (audience cheering)

1274
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,200
 - Lovely.

1275
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,680
 - Yeah, yeah, too good, too good.

1276
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,520
 - That's pretty good.

1277
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,360
 - Because Dan, you talked about acronyms.

1278
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,440
 There is the way to measure,

1279
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,480
 whether you have chronic sinusitis,

1280
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,920
 is the cyanone nasal outcome test or snot.

1281
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,640
 - Beautiful, lovely.

1282
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,840
 - And they basically give you 22 things.

1283
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,240
 Do you need to blow your nose?

1284
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,160
 Do you sneeze a lot?

1285
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,560
 Do you have a running nose and you put how often?

1286
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,160
 Does it happen all the time or does it happen never?

1287
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,080
 - What's interesting is how much mucous

1288
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,160
 and snot we produce per day?

1289
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,000
 - A bucket.

1290
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,240
 - It's buckets, it's 1.5 liters per day

1291
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,120
 is what the body produces.

1292
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,280
 - Okay, that's like a large bottle of Coca-Cola, isn't it?

1293
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,680
 - Yeah, and it's used for various different things.

1294
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,000
 I didn't realize it was used for.

1295
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,200
 It lubricates poo, so then it makes it easier to exit our body.

1296
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,840
 - Yeah, you're saying it with a slightly disgusted look

1297
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,560
 on your face, but you try going without.

1298
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,920
 You'll be crying out for that mucous to come back.

1299
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,760
 - I know.

1300
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
 - I don't know how I try to do that.

1301
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,600
 - You try going down.

1302
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,360
 (laughing)

1303
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,520
 - I don't know what things were of the like,

1304
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,240
 "It's a mucous to you, how dare you."

1305
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,360
 I don't know how bad it got for you

1306
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,680
 on the Lord of the Flies island,

1307
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,640
 but we keep our poo's lubricated.

1308
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,280
 - But that's the thing is that people obviously

1309
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,960
 would find the idea of eating snot disgusting,

1310
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,280
 but we are swallowing our snot all the time.

1311
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,920
 Most of those liters, we're just swallowing it.

1312
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,840
 - Yeah, 'cause it traps, you know, like,

1313
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,640
 bacteria or tiny hairs or whatever

1314
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,080
 that are all landing in your body,

1315
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,320
 and it can be in the lining to your lungs and things like that.

1316
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,720
 Then you bring that up, you know,

1317
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,640
 that sort of trap gets full of the pollutants,

1318
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,200
 you bring it up, you swallow it out it goes.

1319
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,040
 - Easy.

1320
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,880
 - One interesting thing about picking your nose and eating it

1321
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,040
 is that according to some scientists,

1322
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,280
 they think that might be a good thing

1323
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,360
 because the pathogens that get stuck in your nose

1324
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,760
 are the weaker ones because they haven't managed

1325
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,280
 to get all the way up, so if you take those ones out

1326
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,320
 and eat them, then that's like a vaccine.

1327
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,320
 - Like a vaccine, exactly, I should say,

1328
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,520
 not all scientists.

1329
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,400
 - Right, okay, no that's good to know.

1330
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,880
 Before this podcast, we're calling actually Mel,

1331
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,840
 sent me a photo of her with her finger jammed up,

1332
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,960
 and I was like, "I didn't understand it from now."

1333
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,120
 - Yeah.

1334
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,520
 - It's so much warmer out of there.

1335
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,240
 (laughing)

1336
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,120
 - You can get terrible sinusitis if you're a tortoise.

1337
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,120
 (laughing)

1338
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,280
 There was a tortoise.

1339
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,920
 - It's already doing these tortoises, isn't it?

1340
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,600
 (laughing)

1341
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,400
 - There's a tortoise in Bristol Zoo in 2014,

1342
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,160
 called Helen, who had a terrible nasal infection,

1343
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,640
 and they gave them a cross van to biotics

1344
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,160
 and lots of sinus rinses and stuff.

1345
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,200
 And the reason is that tortoises can't cough,

1346
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,440
 and so if you get the infection,

1347
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,480
 they can't get it out of their body.

1348
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,040
 But the reason I mainly bring it up

1349
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,600
 is that this tortoise, called Helen,

1350
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,920
 has a underfloor heated sand pit.

1351
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,760
 - No way.

1352
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,920
 - And it's been a bizarre point on this show, Mel,

1353
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,760
 that Andy hasn't got underfloor heating in his house.

1354
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,600
 - Oh my gosh.

1355
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
 - That makes me sound like an insane diva.

1356
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,760
 (laughing)

1357
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,640
 I'm just saying that Romans had it 2,000 years ago.

1358
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,040
 Why don't we all have it?

1359
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,880
 - It's not just me.

1360
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,040
 - It's like, why does Helen have it?

1361
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,040
 - You don't want to know, right now.

1362
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,880
 (laughing)

1363
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
 - And again, that genuinely want the hell.

1364
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,960
 (laughing)

1365
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,520
 There are humans out there who could do with underfloor heating.

1366
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
 (laughing)

1367
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,840
 - Some of them around this table.

1368
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
 (laughing)

1369
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,000
 - Wow.

1370
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,560
 - Well, congratulations, Helen.

1371
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,080
 I'll be very happy.

1372
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,160
 - I hope your sign-in sign doesn't never get to be wrong.

1373
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,920
 (laughing)

1374
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,480
 - Cold medicine in the UK is substantially worse

1375
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,520
 than it used to be.

1376
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,360
 - It's not right.

1377
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,200
 - Yeah.

1378
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,120
 - Is this pseudo-effort drain or no?

1379
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,800
 This is not to do with the actual--

1380
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,640
 - Certainly is.

1381
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
 - Oh, it is, right.

1382
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,640
 Okay, is it because they outlawed pseudo-effort drain

1383
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,280
 in New Zealand for a bit and they've brought it back?

1384
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,120
 - Who did that?

1385
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,880
 - Because it's very easy to turn that cold medication

1386
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,960
 into drugs.

1387
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,800
 - Yes.

1388
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,640
 - It is.

1389
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,800
 - A key ingredient of crystal meth

1390
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,640
 - Yeah.

1391
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,720
 - Is pseudo-effort drain.

1392
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,200
 And pseudo-effort drain is where pseudo-fed

1393
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,040
 gets its name from.

1394
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,880
 - Okay.

1395
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,880
 - Do you hear it?

1396
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,720
 - Yeah, pseudo-effort drain.

1397
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,800
 - And it was used with it, right?

1398
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,160
 - It was used with it's in the name.

1399
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,760
 It was used for decades.

1400
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,160
 And in 2008, I'm replaced with something

1401
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,200
 much less effective, called phenelephrine.

1402
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,320
 And I mean, it's good news if you don't like crystal meth

1403
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,680
 being a big part of your community.

1404
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,680
 - Bad news, if you have chronic sinusitis.

1405
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,520
 - Yeah.

1406
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,480
 - Can't you get it?

1407
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,320
 - Like.

1408
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,320
 - Can I get it under the cancer somewhere?

1409
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,640
 - I think there are very specific--

1410
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,240
 - The problem is I can't get my head under the cancer

1411
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,200
 because it all goes into my eyes.

1412
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,240
 (laughing)

1413
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,720
 - There are very specific circumstances,

1414
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,280
 I think under which a doctor will give it to you,

1415
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,720
 but it's not just ladled out now

1416
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,920
 because it's too easy to use it to make crystal meth.

1417
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,160
 - I've written a new script called "Bloing Bed"

1418
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,920
 and I think it's going to be really exciting.

1419
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,080
 I'm really excited, very nice.

1420
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,080
 - Yes.

1421
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,160
 - A doctor, German doctor called Wilhelm Fleiss

1422
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,480
 was a friend of Freud.

1423
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,800
 And he thought that your nose got more swollen once a month

1424
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,480
 and it kind of had its own menstrual cycle.

1425
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,480
 - Oh.

1426
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,040
 - And he thought that the swelling of the nose

1427
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,200
 caused some kind of like sexual disorders.

1428
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,040
 - Yes.

1429
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,320
 (laughing)

1430
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,400
 - Yes.

1431
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,760
 - That's way far to thought.

1432
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,600
 - Pritch.

1433
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,600
 - Okay.

1434
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,440
 And now I sit back and allow Dan to explain

1435
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,880
 what the hell he was thinking with that insurrection.

1436
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,960
 - Well, I just know that--

1437
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,040
 - Take the tempo out, you know,

1438
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,320
 before you talk to his Dan.

1439
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,120
 (laughing)

1440
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,600
 - I've always thought that the nose was very similar

1441
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,440
 to a vagina.

1442
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,520
 - You've always thought that.

1443
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,520
 (laughing)

1444
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,360
 - Yeah.

1445
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,680
 - As a young boy.

1446
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,360
 - As a young boy, I just always thought,

1447
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,040
 no, because we share a very similar week.

1448
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,800
 My nose and vagina share very similar tissues

1449
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,640
 on the inside, right?

1450
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
 - They have erectile tissues.

1451
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,480
 - Yeah.

1452
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,320
 - Exactly.

1453
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,160
 - Yeah.

1454
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,440
 - And it is true that if you get excited down there,

1455
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,640
 it can give you a block nose.

1456
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,120
 Sometimes that's called honeymoon rhinitis.

1457
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,600
 And it's because the blood rushes

1458
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,520
 to the erectile tissue in both places.

1459
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,840
 - Whoa.

1460
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,160
 - But this guy, Wilhelm Fleiss,

1461
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,200
 he thought that the best way to deal with it

1462
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,560
 is to take a cane.

1463
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,280
 - Wow.

1464
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,160
 - And he thought that if you took a cane,

1465
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,240
 then it would stop your nose from going through

1466
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,880
 this menstrual cycle and that it would stop

1467
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,520
 your sexual disorders.

1468
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,520
 And surprise, surprise, Sigmund Freud, absolutely agreed.

1469
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,360
 - Yeah.

1470
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,280
 (laughing)

1471
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,600
 - And was the one who would prescribe him this cocaine

1472
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,240
 so that his patients would feel better.

1473
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,320
 - Oh, give it a go.

1474
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,000
 (laughing)

1475
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,840
 - It was a big cold and flu remedy, wasn't it?

1476
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,680
 - Yeah.

1477
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,840
 - Cocaine was just a standard thing.

1478
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,920
 Again, cocaine, crystal meth, all these drugs,

1479
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,080
 before we really understood.

1480
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,040
 - And heroin was good for cuffs, wasn't it?

1481
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,880
 - I was trying to think of a pun that whole time

1482
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,440
 and the only thing I could think of,

1483
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,680
 you've got a stiffie and a stuffy.

1484
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,520
 (laughing)

1485
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,360
 - Yeah.

1486
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,640
 - It's all like a gear, it's all like a gear.

1487
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,480
 - Can I tell you one more weird transplant?

1488
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,320
 - Yes, please.

1489
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,160
 - That's not transplants.

1490
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,000
 So there is a belief among some doctors

1491
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,840
 that we might within the next 10 years

1492
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,240
 get the first ever head transplant.

1493
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,400
 - Oh.

1494
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,240
 - Yeah.

1495
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,080
 - Wow.

1496
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,920
 - It's pretty interesting.

1497
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,160
 So this is a surgeon called Bruce Matthew,

1498
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,960
 who's a former NHS Neurosurgeon.

1499
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,240
 He's also qualified.

1500
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,320
 And basically, it's really a body transplant, actually.

1501
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,160
 - Yeah.

1502
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
 - Because it's the same.

1503
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,000
 - Yeah, it's the same.

1504
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,840
 - It's taking--

1505
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,680
 - Yeah, true.

1506
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,520
 The head is the person.

1507
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,520
 - The head is the person.

1508
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,520
 No, it's not the same person.

1509
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,760
 Because if they say we're giving you a head transplant,

1510
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,000
 that means they're going to take off your head

1511
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,320
 and put someone else's head on.

1512
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,120
 But what happens to your head?

1513
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,760
 - Your head, but the key thing apparently

1514
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,080
 is that your head and your spinal column

1515
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,440
 have to be kept together.

1516
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,000
 There's no way of just taking off a head

1517
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,040
 and putting it on another body.

1518
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,000
 It has to be head and spinal column, okay?

1519
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,840
 - Okay.

1520
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,480
 - And then I found myself looking into

1521
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,040
 what other transplants we can do.

1522
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,200
 So shoulder replacement surgery, absolutely handy.

1523
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,040
 That's fine.

1524
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,640
 Knee surgery, again, very calm by now, knee replacement.

1525
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,080
 But we don't seem, as far as I know, to do toe transplants.

1526
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,640
 - Toes onto your fingers, I've seen that.

1527
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,240
 - Toe becomes thumb.

1528
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,880
 That is the gold standard for letting you pinch things again.

1529
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,720
 - Okay.

1530
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,680
 - But I don't think they ever say we're going to take a toll.

1531
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,040
 - Is it because you can manage without one of your toes?

1532
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,440
 - I have a broken toe and the doctors go,

1533
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,120
 we don't really, we're not going to put your toe in a car.

1534
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,480
 So I just have a toe that just doesn't bend.

1535
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,320
 - Oh, okay.

1536
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,400
 - You can't live your life without working kidneys, right?

1537
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,240
 - Yeah.

1538
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,440
 - But if you lose one of your toes, it's not great

1539
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,760
 or you can live your life.

1540
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,720
 - But if you don't want to get many people to sign up

1541
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,920
 to donating their body, if they find out,

1542
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,520
 they're just donating their toes.

1543
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,280
 - I think your toe could save someone's awkward conversation

1544
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,120
 at the pool.

1545
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

1546
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,320
 It's not top of the list of things to solve, for sure.

1547
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,160
 - That's the absolute.

1548
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,360
 - Yeah, that's true.

1549
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,520
 - Wait, so okay, so we're doing heads, shoulders.

1550
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,360
 - Yeah.

1551
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
 - Is that what's going on here?

1552
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,480
 - Oh my god, I can't believe that.

1553
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,880
 - No, I knew the second you said it.

1554
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,720
 I could see in your face.

1555
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,040
 You didn't just mention toes for no reason.

1556
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,880
 There's no waste with Andy, he's not.

1557
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,880
 - Wow.

1558
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,460
 (upbeat music)

1559
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,360
 - Okay, that's it.

1560
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,440
 That is all of our facts.

1561
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,800

1570
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,760
 - Nice, and you are in the UK right now.

1571
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,760
 - In the UK, touring.

1572
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,960
 - Touring around, so come and see my shirt, if you'd like.

1573
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,040
 - Yeah, all the dates are on your Instagram, right?

1574
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,440

1577
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,840
 as a special sometime during the year, so.

1578
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,680
 - Amazing.

1579
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,040
 - Yeah, you can check it on it.

1580
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,040

1584
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,200
 about, we do our show, Little Fish, where we gather together

1585
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,360
 all the best of those facts, and we read them out.

1586
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,520
 That's every Monday, or if you want to give us some feedback

1587
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,960
 about things that we've talked about in main episodes

1588
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,520
 that you think we need to know about, we have another show,

1589
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,840
 which is part of our Secret Members Club Club Fish,

1590
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,560
 which you can get by going to patreon.com/nosuchthingasafish.

1591
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,520
 And Andy goes through all those emails.

1592
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,600
 He picks the best of them out, and we do that show,

1593
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,600
 drop us a line, where we discuss them all.

1594
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,080
 So check that out.

1595
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,000
 Otherwise, why not just come back next week,

1596
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,760
 'cause we're gonna have another episode,

1597
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,280
 thanks as ever, to Lee and Lee, and Ethan Ruperelia,

1598
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,400
