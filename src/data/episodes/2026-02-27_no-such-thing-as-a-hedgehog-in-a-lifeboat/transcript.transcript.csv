00:00:02,00:00:08,"- Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Fish."
00:00:08,00:00:10,"Dan here, hope you're doing well."
00:00:10,00:00:12,Just wanna let you know before we get into the show
00:00:12,00:00:14,about our guest joining us today.
00:00:14,00:00:15,It's one of our favorites.
00:00:15,00:00:16,Someone who's joined us a number of times
00:00:16,00:00:20,"over the last few years, it is New Zealand comedian,"
00:00:20,00:00:21,Melanie Bracewell.
00:00:21,00:00:23,"So Mel, if you haven't heard her on the show before,"
00:00:23,00:00:26,is someone whose work you may have seen in other places.
00:00:26,00:00:29,Her stand-up clips are always popping up online
00:00:29,00:00:30,for any doom scrollers out there.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"If you're an Aussie, you'll know her"
00:00:32,00:00:35,from the TV show She Co hosts called The Cheap Seats.
00:00:35,00:00:37,If you're a fan of Taskmaster
00:00:37,00:00:39,"and have consumed all the international formats,"
00:00:39,00:00:41,you will have seen Mel on series four
00:00:41,00:00:43,of the New Zealand Taskmaster.
00:00:43,00:00:45,"And if you're a general connoisseur of comedy,"
00:00:45,00:00:47,it's good to know that she has had a hand
00:00:47,00:00:51,in the writing of such shows as the rebooted time bandits
00:00:51,00:00:54,and also the absolutely brilliant Wellington Paranormal
00:00:54,00:00:57,of which she starred in two episodes as well.
00:00:57,00:00:59,But this is all stuff that's on the screen
00:00:59,00:01:01,over on the other side of the planet.
00:01:01,00:01:02,What about us in the UK?
00:01:02,00:01:03,"Well, good news."
00:01:03,00:01:07,"Mel is in the country right now on a stand-up tour,"
00:01:07,00:01:09,literally happening as I speak.
00:01:09,00:01:12,So the good news is you can see her in person
00:01:12,00:01:13,"doing the thing she does best,"
00:01:13,00:01:16,which is stand-up with her new show called A Little Treat.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"And if you wanna find all the details for that,"
00:01:18,00:01:20,go to her Instagram.
00:01:20,00:01:22,It's @MelanieBracewell or just Google her name
00:01:22,00:01:24,and A Little Treat UK tour.
00:01:24,00:01:25,"It'll all come up,"
00:01:25,00:01:28,"but basically as of March 1st, she's gonna be in Dorwich,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,"then she's gonna be going to Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,"Edinburgh, Newcastle, Glasgow, Leeds and Cardiff."
00:01:34,00:01:37,"So it's a limited run, but the tickets are selling fast,"
00:01:37,00:01:40,"so quickly get in now before she heads back over to Oz,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,"where just a heads up for the Aussies and New Zealanders,"
00:01:42,00:01:45,she's gonna be on tour with this show from May.
00:01:45,00:01:50,"All the details are online, but for now, enjoy her here,"
00:01:50,00:01:52,"dorking out with me, Andy and James,"
00:01:52,00:01:54,"on no such thing as a fish, on with the show."
00:01:54,00:01:57,(upbeat music)
00:01:57,00:02:02,(bell ringing)
00:02:02,00:02:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:02:05,00:02:08,(speaking in foreign language)
00:02:08,00:02:11,(upbeat music)
00:02:11,00:02:15,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:02:15,00:02:17,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:17,00:02:20,coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:02:20,00:02:21,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:21,00:02:24,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,"and Mel Bracewell, and once again,"
00:02:26,00:02:27,we have gathered around the microphones
00:02:27,00:02:30,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:02:30,00:02:33,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:33,00:02:37,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Mel."
00:02:37,00:02:40,- My fact this week is that the New Zealand government
00:02:40,00:02:44,is stopping invasive species by using
00:02:44,00:02:47,Selina Gomez Oreos.
00:02:47,00:02:48,- That's huge.
00:02:48,00:02:51,- It's specifically possum.
00:02:51,00:02:53,So there's a huge possum problem in New Zealand.
00:02:53,00:02:55,There's no natural predators for possums.
00:02:55,00:02:58,"Basically, they were trying to lure out"
00:02:58,00:03:01,the really persistent possums that weren't
00:03:01,00:03:02,able to be trapped by other means.
00:03:02,00:03:05,They say what happens often is that they will go
00:03:05,00:03:07,"and have a little bit of bait, get a bit sick,"
00:03:07,00:03:09,"and then go, ""I'm never gonna eat that bait ever again,"""
00:03:09,00:03:11,"or they get almost stuck in a trap,"
00:03:11,00:03:14,and then they don't ever go towards traps again.
00:03:14,00:03:16,So they were trying to find something that would lure
00:03:16,00:03:21,"these possums that are very afraid of the traps in,"
00:03:21,00:03:25,"and what works specifically was Oreos,"
00:03:25,00:03:28,"but not as any, they had to be the Selina Gomez Oreos"
00:03:28,00:03:30,because they like them so much.
00:03:30,00:03:33,- So they have a combination of chocolate and cinnamon
00:03:33,00:03:35,that possums just love.
00:03:35,00:03:36,- What a review.
00:03:36,00:03:37,What a review for the Oreos.
00:03:37,00:03:39,- I reckon I would be straight in those traps.
00:03:39,00:03:40,"- Yeah, really."
00:03:40,00:03:43,"- They do sound very, this is not an effort"
00:03:43,00:03:45,for Selina Gomez or for Oreos.
00:03:45,00:03:49,"But she's put a lot of work into the flavour profile, I think."
00:03:49,00:03:51,"- Oh yeah, it was like years."
00:03:51,00:03:52,She really wanted to be in it.
00:03:52,00:03:53,"- She was in the lab, wasn't she?"
00:03:53,00:03:54,- She wanted to be in Oreos.
00:03:54,00:03:57,- It hasn't been a new album from her in quite some time.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"- If you're a singer, that's another..."
00:03:59,00:04:01,"- Sorry, who do you think Selina Gomez is?"
00:04:01,00:04:02,"- I don't know, I was faster."
00:04:02,00:04:03,- A scientist?
00:04:03,00:04:06,"- This was an article on the Spinoff,"
00:04:06,00:04:08,"which is a New Zealand website,"
00:04:08,00:04:10,and that was one of my favourite parts of the article
00:04:10,00:04:12,is that the scientist does not know who Selina Gomez is.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"He said, ""I don't know who she is,"
00:04:14,00:04:16,"I just know she makes a good Oreo."""
00:04:16,00:04:17,What was she saying?
00:04:18,00:04:20,- She has made no comment.
00:04:20,00:04:21,"They have asked repeatedly,"
00:04:21,00:04:23,"""What do you think that your Oreos are being used"
00:04:23,00:04:24,"to wipe out for us in New Zealand?"""
00:04:24,00:04:25,- She's a busy woman.
00:04:25,00:04:26,- She's a busy woman.
00:04:26,00:04:27,- What's a tough gig as well?
00:04:27,00:04:31,Because it is being used for what is getting rid of a pest.
00:04:31,00:04:32,- It's kind of...
00:04:32,00:04:34,- It's being used to protect native New Zealand.
00:04:34,00:04:34,- Absolutely.
00:04:34,00:04:37,- But at a cost of killing an animal.
00:04:37,00:04:39,"If you're against that, that's a big issue."
00:04:39,00:04:40,"- Like, if you sent her an email this week,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,"I don't know if you did or not,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,"but if you sent her an email,"
00:04:43,00:04:44,"say, ""Dear Miss Gomez,"
00:04:44,00:04:47,"have you been killing gunnables in New Zealand?"""
00:04:47,00:04:48,She's not gonna respond to that.
00:04:48,00:04:49,"- P.S., what do you do?"
00:04:49,00:04:52,What's your line of work?
00:04:52,00:04:53,- The line she's used as the strap line
00:04:53,00:04:55,is great for movie night
00:04:55,00:04:56,and make wonderful birthday treats
00:04:56,00:04:58,and music award-watch party snacks.
00:04:58,00:05:01,She didn't include an exterminating
00:05:01,00:05:02,and invasive species.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"- The initial experiment that they had toyed with,"
00:05:04,00:05:07,what they would do is they'd leave these things outside of traps
00:05:07,00:05:10,so that the possums would get a taste for them.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"And what they were toying up was actually using drugs,"
00:05:13,00:05:16,"like addictive drugs, right?"
00:05:16,00:05:19,And then they read a study about chocolate and cinnamon
00:05:19,00:05:23,having similar properties in similar properties of addiction.
00:05:23,00:05:26,And so they would leave them out and not trap them
00:05:26,00:05:28,and then get them addicted to these Oreos
00:05:28,00:05:29,and then that's really interesting.
00:05:29,00:05:31,"- Well, they're gonna stop making these things."
00:05:31,00:05:33,This is a limited edition Oreo.
00:05:33,00:05:34,"- That's the issue, yeah."
00:05:34,00:05:35,- They're gonna run out
00:05:35,00:05:36,and they're gonna need something else to lure
00:05:36,00:05:38,in the possums into the traps.
00:05:38,00:05:39,- Yeah.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"- No, since it's a fish kit cut."
00:05:41,00:05:41,- Yes.
00:05:41,00:05:42,(laughing)
00:05:42,00:05:43,- What do you think?
00:05:43,00:05:44,- I don't want to be part of them.
00:05:44,00:05:46,- It's nice for podcast listening parties.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"- Fish, are we just saying fish flavored kit cut?"
00:05:48,00:05:49,"- No, cinnamon and chocolate."
00:05:49,00:05:50,"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:50,00:05:52,The possums aren't gonna eat that.
00:05:52,00:05:53,"- No, fish flavored kit cut."
00:05:53,00:05:54,- I think I would.
00:05:54,00:05:55,- Would you?
00:05:55,00:05:55,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:55,00:05:56,(laughing)
00:05:56,00:05:57,- Fish ringer.
00:05:57,00:05:58,(laughing)
00:05:58,00:06:00,"- It's not legally protected term, is it?"
00:06:00,00:06:01,"- Right, very true."
00:06:01,00:06:03,- So these guys have come over to New Zealand
00:06:03,00:06:05,"from Australia, is that right?"
00:06:05,00:06:06,- That's right.
00:06:06,00:06:08,"- Yeah, Australia."
00:06:08,00:06:09,And then there's some pieces that have been introduced
00:06:09,00:06:11,from England as well.
00:06:11,00:06:14,"And sorry guys, sorry to bring it up."
00:06:14,00:06:17,"But look, we were bought for that song."
00:06:17,00:06:18,(laughing)
00:06:18,00:06:19,We were asked to come.
00:06:19,00:06:20,(laughing)
00:06:20,00:06:22,So the reason that they're not a problem
00:06:22,00:06:26,as much in Australia is because they do have predators.
00:06:26,00:06:29,And one of them is the powerful owl.
00:06:29,00:06:30,- Oh.
00:06:30,00:06:32,- And the powerful owl is Australia's largest owl.
00:06:32,00:06:35,And it is able to disembowel a possum
00:06:35,00:06:37,in less than 20 seconds.
00:06:37,00:06:38,- Wow.
00:06:38,00:06:39,- That's impressive when you say it like that.
00:06:39,00:06:42,But I've no metric of how long it should take me
00:06:42,00:06:43,to disembowel a possum.
00:06:43,00:06:44,"- You know what I mean, like, like we're--"
00:06:44,00:06:45,- Bring it in.
00:06:45,00:06:47,(laughing)
00:06:47,00:06:52,"- So I know what you mean, wow."
00:06:52,00:06:53,"- The interesting thing, the reason they disembowel it"
00:06:53,00:06:56,is because they're meat eaters
00:06:56,00:06:57,"and they're not interested in eating vegetables,"
00:06:57,00:07:00,but the possums eat vegetables.
00:07:00,00:07:02,And so they don't want to eat their insides
00:07:02,00:07:04,because they're just full of useless green stuff.
00:07:04,00:07:06,They want to eat their meat.
00:07:06,00:07:09,- The equivalent of a kid picking the peas out
00:07:09,00:07:11,of their food.
00:07:11,00:07:12,- Nice.
00:07:12,00:07:13,(laughing)
00:07:13,00:07:14,- Do you know why possums were brought over
00:07:14,00:07:16,to New Zealand in the first place?
00:07:16,00:07:18,- They were brought over for the fur trade.
00:07:18,00:07:19,- Oh yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"- And it didn't work for a fur,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,but then the numbers exploded.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"And I think there are now 47 million give or take,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,which ironically would be plenty for a thriving fur.
00:07:28,00:07:29,- That's a lot of fur.
00:07:29,00:07:32,"- That's one of the fur trades then said,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,"like maybe about 15, 20 years ago."
00:07:34,00:07:37,"- Hey, why don't we turn these guys into lovely pelts?"
00:07:37,00:07:39,And that's a really good idea.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Wait a minute.
00:07:40,00:07:41,Why don't you the guys who brought them over
00:07:41,00:07:42,to the first place?
00:07:42,00:07:43,- I'm not trying to say I'm on the side of big fur.
00:07:43,00:07:44,- Yeah.
00:07:44,00:07:47,"- But then, as you say, you've got loads of invasions."
00:07:47,00:07:50,You've got weasels and stoats and rabbits.
00:07:50,00:07:52,"The really annoying thing,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,"the stoats were brought in to control the rabbits,"
00:07:54,00:07:55,which had been brought in.
00:07:55,00:07:56,- Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:57,- I don't know.
00:07:57,00:07:59,- It's the old lady who's followed a fly.
00:07:59,00:08:00,- Yeah.
00:08:00,00:08:01,- Yes.
00:08:01,00:08:02,- It's mad.
00:08:02,00:08:03,- The other thing they're doing with them is
00:08:03,00:08:05,it's become a bit of a delicacy over in places
00:08:05,00:08:07,like Hong Kong and Taiwan and China and so on.
00:08:07,00:08:09,And so they're sold over there.
00:08:09,00:08:12,And they're sold under the name Kiwi Bear.
00:08:12,00:08:14,- That's the meal that you have.
00:08:14,00:08:15,- Kiwi Bear.
00:08:15,00:08:16,"- Yeah, it does, doesn't it?"
00:08:16,00:08:17,Yeah.
00:08:17,00:08:20,- One pest that really ravages New Zealand
00:08:20,00:08:23,and it's more difficult to get rid of are hedgehogs.
00:08:23,00:08:26,And what people think is because hedgehogs are quite cute.
00:08:26,00:08:29,Is that they're cuter and they're diabolical.
00:08:29,00:08:32,"They'll eat, they'll eat birds, eggs, and things like that."
00:08:32,00:08:34,But because people think they're cute.
00:08:34,00:08:35,They're less likely to want to.
00:08:35,00:08:36,- Can I give you a 10?
00:08:36,00:08:37,- Yeah.
00:08:37,00:08:38,- They're a bit of them.
00:08:38,00:08:39,- Yeah.
00:08:39,00:08:40,"- Because when we were a kid, we were told"
00:08:40,00:08:43,"that if you build a bonfire, a hedgehog will always go inside it."
00:08:43,00:08:45,So you have to check it before you set it on fire.
00:08:45,00:08:46,That hedgehogs.
00:08:46,00:08:47,- That's true.
00:08:47,00:08:49,- So I think they're attracted to them or something?
00:08:49,00:08:50,"- They're hibernating them, don't they?"
00:08:50,00:08:51,- Today.
00:08:51,00:08:52,"- They go and they think,"
00:08:52,00:08:53,"""Oh, lovely, nice pile of leaves."""
00:08:53,00:08:53,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:53,00:08:54,- I was wondering about this.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Is that working?
00:08:55,00:08:57,- That your responses make it look like an accident.
00:08:57,00:08:58,(laughing)
00:08:58,00:08:59,- Yeah.
00:08:59,00:09:01,It's called the Beatrix Potter effect.
00:09:01,00:09:03,"It's why, apparently there are more in New Zealand"
00:09:03,00:09:04,than in Britain.
00:09:04,00:09:06,Which is where they're obviously native to Britain
00:09:06,00:09:07,than not native to New Zealand.
00:09:07,00:09:09,And it's been proposed that we put all the hedgehogs
00:09:09,00:09:12,on a big chip and sail it over.
00:09:12,00:09:13,- Yeah.
00:09:13,00:09:13,- But I don't think it's a project.
00:09:13,00:09:14,- What did you do?
00:09:14,00:09:15,- I was not being proposed by anyone.
00:09:15,00:09:18,- What they had said was that the reason they introduced it
00:09:18,00:09:22,"was to remind settlers of gardens in the UK,"
00:09:22,00:09:25,is the reason that you put them on a big ship and send them back
00:09:25,00:09:26,"because if you put them on a small dinghy,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,they're just gonna pop like...
00:09:28,00:09:29,(laughing)
00:09:29,00:09:29,- Yep.
00:09:29,00:09:30,(laughing)
00:09:30,00:09:32,- So I'm just thinking if it did hit something
00:09:32,00:09:33,"and they had to do an escape,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,"quick everyone into the emergence, oh shit."
00:09:35,00:09:38,(laughing)
00:09:38,00:09:42,"- Women and children first, hedgehogs definitely last."
00:09:42,00:09:43,(laughing)
00:09:43,00:09:44,- Is it controversial with it?
00:09:44,00:09:45,'Cause I know that you've got this whole
00:09:45,00:09:47,and brilliant national scheme.
00:09:47,00:09:48,- Yeah.
00:09:48,00:09:49,- I love it. - Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:49,- Predator-free New Zealand.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"- Yes, yes."
00:09:50,00:09:52,"- Like I'm a fan of all those individual elements, right?"
00:09:52,00:09:54,"- You guys are trying it here, very slowly though."
00:09:54,00:09:55,(laughing)
00:09:55,00:09:57,"- We're starting at the top, you know?"
00:09:57,00:09:59,"- That's a print sandwich, aren't we?"
00:09:59,00:10:02,"- I was trying to get there, but I didn't want to say it."
00:10:02,00:10:03,(laughing)
00:10:03,00:10:05,- We've just all had a buzz on our phones
00:10:05,00:10:06,that he's been arrested to.
00:10:06,00:10:08,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:08,00:10:09,"- Yeah, he's trying to arresting the possum, you know?"
00:10:09,00:10:13,"Sorry, but it seemed like it's a very sort of big"
00:10:13,00:10:14,"community effort, you know?"
00:10:14,00:10:16,People are setting up traps in their gardens.
00:10:16,00:10:17,- Yeah.
00:10:17,00:10:19,- There was this school in 2022
00:10:19,00:10:23,"on a place called, is it Rackiera or Stewart Island?"
00:10:23,00:10:24,"- Oh, yeah."
00:10:24,00:10:26,- And they had a hundred day challenge for the children
00:10:26,00:10:28,to kill as many rodents as possible.
00:10:28,00:10:29,- Yeah.
00:10:29,00:10:30,"- And the 40 students who were taking part,"
00:10:30,00:10:33,they caught 600 rats between them.
00:10:33,00:10:37,One five-year-old did in 60 rats over three months.
00:10:37,00:10:38,- That's the thing that they say
00:10:38,00:10:40,"if a kid is trying to harm animals,"
00:10:40,00:10:41,"that's like the sign of a psychopath,"
00:10:41,00:10:44,but we're trying to sort of get them to get to that point.
00:10:44,00:10:46,"- It's a controversial thing to an extent,"
00:10:46,00:10:49,"because about a decade before that in 2010,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,"a school got questioned because they did this,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,"they did this kind of hunt for possums and for rats,"
00:10:54,00:10:58,but then they got the kids to play a game of possum tossing
00:10:58,00:11:01,"where who could throw the possum, the furthest,"
00:11:01,00:11:06,and a lot of surveys to see how people felt about that.
00:11:06,00:11:07,"- I gotta say, in 20 years' time,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,you guys are gonna have an enormous prison population
00:11:10,00:11:12,or some incredible sports teams
00:11:12,00:11:14,with just a killer instinct.
00:11:14,00:11:15,(laughing)
00:11:15,00:11:16,- Absolutely.
00:11:16,00:11:19,- The New Zealand Empire begins to spread across the world.
00:11:19,00:11:24,"- I can go the other way, so New Zealand has bush ticks"
00:11:24,00:11:27,"as do Australia, but they've recently been introduced"
00:11:27,00:11:31,to America with quite a lot of problems.
00:11:31,00:11:34,"And so much so, the first one they found"
00:11:34,00:11:36,"was a couple of years ago in New Jersey,"
00:11:36,00:11:38,and a woman had been sharing her sheep
00:11:38,00:11:41,and she came in with these ticks over her
00:11:41,00:11:42,"and said, I think there's a problem here"
00:11:42,00:11:44,and it turned out to be these invasive ones.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"And she had so many on her,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"she had over 1,000 on her pants alone."
00:11:49,00:11:52,"- Wow, she was just head to toe in these ticks."
00:11:52,00:11:53,- In ticks.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"- Wait, does the person know her sheep?"
00:11:55,00:11:56,- It was a person.
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Got it.
00:11:57,00:11:57,- And she survived.
00:11:57,00:11:58,"- She survived, yeah."
00:11:58,00:12:01,"So if you don't pull them out and leave the head in,"
00:12:01,00:12:03,"particularly Aussie ones, you get Lyme disease."
00:12:03,00:12:05,"- Yeah, I assume they just sprayed her"
00:12:05,00:12:07,with something not very nice and the ticks fell off.
00:12:07,00:12:08,"- Oh, what a pickle."
00:12:08,00:12:09,- That's a being.
00:12:09,00:12:10,(laughing)
00:12:10,00:12:11,"- And what it is, isn't it?"
00:12:11,00:12:13,What's the pickle?
00:12:13,00:12:14,"Like, as in..."
00:12:14,00:12:16,- It's covered in a thousand ticks.
00:12:16,00:12:17,- There's no good side.
00:12:17,00:12:18,"- Oh, I thought a pickle means like,"
00:12:18,00:12:20,what a pickle I've found myself in.
00:12:20,00:12:22,- Do you think that there's two sides to a pickle?
00:12:22,00:12:23,- Yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:23,(laughing)
00:12:23,00:12:26,- I think being in a pickle is bad overall.
00:12:26,00:12:26,- Is it?
00:12:26,00:12:28,"- That's saying, there's two sides to every pickle."
00:12:28,00:12:31,(laughing)
00:12:31,00:12:32,- That's the name of my older brother.
00:12:32,00:12:33,(laughing)
00:12:33,00:12:35,"- Oh, I guess that in a pickle,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,you think of someone who's trying to make a decision.
00:12:37,00:12:38,- Yeah.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"- Right, I can't."
00:12:39,00:12:39,- What a pickle if I'm myself in.
00:12:39,00:12:40,"- No, you're in trouble."
00:12:40,00:12:42,"- It's like, but in a pickle,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,"it's kind of both sides are still bad, right?"
00:12:44,00:12:46,"- No, you're on the homes of a dilemma."
00:12:46,00:12:47,You're in a pickle.
00:12:47,00:12:48,"- Yeah, a nightmare."
00:12:48,00:12:49,- What about a pickle?
00:12:49,00:12:50,(laughing)
00:12:50,00:12:51,Unbelievable.
00:12:51,00:12:54,You can't rely on guests just to hoof you out of problems.
00:12:54,00:12:56,(laughing)
00:12:56,00:12:59,"Well, have you ever seen a peacock wild in New Zealand?"
00:12:59,00:13:00,- I haven't seen them wild in New Zealand.
00:13:00,00:13:02,I think I may have seen them wild in Australia.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"- Oh, okay."
00:13:03,00:13:04,Is there a big problem in New Zealand as well?
00:13:04,00:13:05,"- Yeah, okay."
00:13:05,00:13:06,- Which I didn't know about.
00:13:06,00:13:07,And it's partly because the possums
00:13:07,00:13:09,have been successfully trapped and hunted
00:13:09,00:13:10,in various areas.
00:13:10,00:13:13,"Well, no one's eating those delicious, delicious peacock eggs."
00:13:13,00:13:16,They're also invasive and they're feral
00:13:16,00:13:17,and they're very hard to catch
00:13:17,00:13:19,because they're very wary of humans.
00:13:19,00:13:21,"They flee, they do lots of damage to crops"
00:13:21,00:13:21,and things like that.
00:13:21,00:13:23,"But obviously, they're also very beautiful."
00:13:23,00:13:24,"- Oh, yeah."
00:13:24,00:13:26,- They're kind of the best animals to get over there
00:13:26,00:13:27,when you have them.
00:13:27,00:13:28,"- Yeah, cute."
00:13:28,00:13:30,"- But it is for the amazing birds of New Zealand,"
00:13:30,00:13:31,which are beautiful.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"And in the areas where they've managed to fence it off,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,they've done various islands.
00:13:34,00:13:35,The birds have all come back.
00:13:35,00:13:36,- Yeah.
00:13:36,00:13:37,- And it's now a cacophony of incredible birds
00:13:37,00:13:40,nesting there and it is pretty amazing.
00:13:40,00:13:41,- It is beautiful.
00:13:41,00:13:41,- Yeah.
00:13:41,00:13:43,And if it takes a million possums skulls
00:13:43,00:13:45,"to crush under our heels, we'll do it."
00:13:45,00:13:47,(laughing)
00:13:47,00:13:50,Fish kick cats are now available in your local stores.
00:13:50,00:13:53,(upbeat music)
00:13:53,00:13:57,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:13:57,00:13:58,And that is my fact.
00:13:58,00:14:00,My fact this week is that one of the reasons
00:14:00,00:14:04,married couples slept in twin beds in Victorian England
00:14:04,00:14:07,is because doctors claimed that the weak sleepers
00:14:07,00:14:10,stole their partner's vitality during the night.
00:14:10,00:14:13,"- Mmm, I think that's true."
00:14:13,00:14:13,- Yeah.
00:14:13,00:14:14,(laughing)
00:14:14,00:14:15,"- Oh, you're sick."
00:14:15,00:14:17,- Would you say like if I'm snoring all night
00:14:17,00:14:19,and my wife's just gonna wake up tired?
00:14:19,00:14:20,- Yes.
00:14:20,00:14:21,- Absolutely.
00:14:21,00:14:23,I think though it could be the weak sleepers
00:14:23,00:14:24,also the one who wakes easily.
00:14:24,00:14:27,"So you would be, so it's a hell of a pickle."
00:14:27,00:14:28,- But this is a situation.
00:14:28,00:14:30,(laughing)
00:14:30,00:14:32,- And what's the good part of it?
00:14:32,00:14:32,- Yeah.
00:14:32,00:14:34,- But this isn't about snoring waking up.
00:14:34,00:14:36,This is just about someone being an energy draze.
00:14:36,00:14:37,- Yeah.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- Yeah, it's sapping the vital."
00:14:39,00:14:41,"- It went more to it, didn't it?"
00:14:41,00:14:43,It was like electromagnetic energy
00:14:43,00:14:44,was being sucked from you.
00:14:44,00:14:47,"- Okay, in that case, who the hell is saying this shit?"
00:14:47,00:14:49,"- Well, this is Victorian England."
00:14:49,00:14:50,"So, all right, okay."
00:14:50,00:14:52,"- Yeah, all of it, all of it to England."
00:14:52,00:14:54,We're currently looking into getting twin beds
00:14:54,00:14:56,"in our house and as happens with you guys,"
00:14:56,00:14:57,"you start Googling stuff and you know,"
00:14:57,00:14:58,what do I know about twin beds?
00:14:58,00:14:59,- Unfortunately.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"- But the thing is with you,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,this is getting more into it
00:15:02,00:15:04,because previously you're a bunk bed sweatshirt.
00:15:04,00:15:05,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:15:05,00:15:09,"Yeah, I'm currently sleeping in a bottom bunk bed"
00:15:09,00:15:11,of my son's room while my wife's in bed
00:15:11,00:15:12,with our three kids.
00:15:12,00:15:13,- All right.
00:15:13,00:15:13,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:15:13,00:15:14,- Looking into getting twin beds.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"- Yeah, but not for me and my wife"
00:15:15,00:15:16,for our two youngest kids.
00:15:16,00:15:17,"- Okay, thank you."
00:15:17,00:15:18,- I'm just kidding.
00:15:18,00:15:20,(laughing)
00:15:20,00:15:23,- Now you know that your vitality is being drained.
00:15:23,00:15:25,"That may change, you may."
00:15:25,00:15:27,"- Fortunately, someone had the same question"
00:15:27,00:15:28,about the history of twin beds
00:15:28,00:15:30,and that was Lancaster University Professor Hillary Hines
00:15:30,00:15:33,and she wrote a cultural history of twin beds.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"As she was looking into it,"
00:15:34,00:15:39,she discovered that it was believed in around 1860s
00:15:39,00:15:42,that it would literally be taking away your energy.
00:15:42,00:15:44,"- But the quotes are so extreme,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,but this was one of my favorites.
00:15:46,00:15:48,Each sleeper should have a single bed
00:15:48,00:15:50,"in a large, clean, light room."
00:15:50,00:15:54,So it's to pass all the hours of sleep in a pure fresh air.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"And those who fail in this,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,well in the end fail in health and strength of lemon brain
00:15:58,00:16:01,and will die while their days are not all told.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"- Oh, wow."
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- It's like, they should, you should do this"
00:16:04,00:16:06,"and then it's going, no, you'll die."
00:16:06,00:16:07,- You will die.
00:16:07,00:16:08,"- It's very powerful, you know."
00:16:08,00:16:09,It's quite persuasive.
00:16:09,00:16:12,- There's like quite a long standing history
00:16:12,00:16:14,"of people sleeping in separate rooms,"
00:16:14,00:16:17,even in the British aristocracy.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"And that is because, well, for lots of different reasons,"
00:16:19,00:16:22,one reason because you're just going to have a better night's sleep
00:16:22,00:16:23,quite often.
00:16:23,00:16:26,"But secondly, because they thought that it was unhealthy"
00:16:26,00:16:27,"to sleep in the same bed,"
00:16:27,00:16:29,because germ theory had just come out
00:16:29,00:16:31,and they didn't really know how the germs would work.
00:16:31,00:16:33,"And the other thing is like,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,"if you wanted a bit of romance,"
00:16:35,00:16:38,you could go to your partner's room
00:16:38,00:16:40,rather than sort of like nudging them with a cold foot
00:16:40,00:16:43,"and saying, do you fancy a bit?"
00:16:43,00:16:46,"You actually have to knock on the door and say, you know,"
00:16:46,00:16:47,let me in.
00:16:47,00:16:48,- You're an action-tik-nix.
00:16:48,00:16:50,(all laughing)
00:16:50,00:16:51,"- Interesting that you should,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,that was my technique and that was my wife's technique.
00:16:53,00:16:57,- We seem to be in a pickle.
00:16:57,00:17:00,- There's also the other thing of this
00:17:00,00:17:03,"with, so the Edwardian, so early 20th century,"
00:17:03,00:17:07,a big bit of the reason that they had separate rooms
00:17:07,00:17:10,was to allow adultery.
00:17:10,00:17:11,- Oh.
00:17:11,00:17:15,"- But, bum, bum, bum, because upper class Edwardian society"
00:17:15,00:17:17,was absolutely right with the adultery.
00:17:17,00:17:18,And it was kind of expected
00:17:18,00:17:20,"that the husband and wife would get married,"
00:17:20,00:17:21,"they'd have some children,"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"and then, what's the children are out?"
00:17:23,00:17:24,It's free play.
00:17:24,00:17:25,- Right.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"- And so, out of the house or the womb?"
00:17:27,00:17:28,- Out of the womb.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"- Okay, so while the children are still living there."
00:17:30,00:17:31,"- Ideally, they'll be at school"
00:17:31,00:17:32,or off on a trip or whatever.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"- No, no, no, it's not when they've grown up and moved out."
00:17:34,00:17:36,It's literally in the family home.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"- It's literally, it's especially,"
00:17:39,00:17:40,"not just in the family home,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,"but in grandhouses where you might go visiting,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"you might go for a weekend party or something,"
00:17:44,00:17:45,so you'd have single rooms.
00:17:45,00:17:50,And some of these rooms have little brass brackets outside
00:17:50,00:17:53,with a little name label saying exactly who's in where.
00:17:53,00:17:56,"And supposedly, it was to help the butler identify who was who."
00:17:56,00:17:58,But it had a very useful second purpose
00:17:58,00:18:00,"of allowing a bit of hanky-panky,"
00:18:00,00:18:02,so you're not knocking on the wrong door
00:18:02,00:18:03,in the middle of the night
00:18:03,00:18:05,"and ending up in a real, you know, tangle."
00:18:05,00:18:07,"- Even more than that, there was a house called"
00:18:07,00:18:10,"Wentworth Woodhouse in South Yorkshire, which was the biggest house"
00:18:10,00:18:12,"in England, basically, and today,"
00:18:12,00:18:15,"when they had all the tops coming to visit,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,they gave everyone a map to all the bedrooms.
00:18:17,00:18:18,- Brilliant.
00:18:18,00:18:20,"- So you could kind of look at the map and go,"
00:18:20,00:18:22,"""Oh, I want to go to Mrs. Jones's room."""
00:18:22,00:18:25,"So I need to go up here down there, around there."
00:18:25,00:18:28,This Wentworth Woodhouse was the biggest private house
00:18:28,00:18:30,in the whole of England.
00:18:30,00:18:30,- Right.
00:18:30,00:18:31,- Victorian era.
00:18:31,00:18:33,How many bedrooms do you think it had?
00:18:33,00:18:35,- Ooh.
00:18:35,00:18:36,- Riddle me this.
00:18:36,00:18:41,"- I'll say, I mean, bedrooms, I'll say high,"
00:18:41,00:18:44,jubble figures.
00:18:44,00:18:45,- Yeah.
00:18:45,00:18:48,"- I mean, it can't have more than about 50 or 60 bedrooms"
00:18:48,00:18:49,"I would have seen. - Oh, I was going way more."
00:18:49,00:18:50,"- Oh, wow."
00:18:50,00:18:51,"- Oh, wow, wow. - Oh, wow."
00:18:51,00:18:52,- The dead crusher.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"- The fat, I mean, it's heavy."
00:18:54,00:18:54,"- Oh, silly."
00:18:54,00:18:56,(laughing)
00:18:56,00:18:59,"- I feel like the other times I feel on this podcast,"
00:18:59,00:19:00,"Dad, you always ruin the kissing game."
00:19:00,00:19:02,(laughing)
00:19:02,00:19:03,You get so high.
00:19:03,00:19:04,(laughing)
00:19:04,00:19:07,The real fact feels kind of lame and comparison.
00:19:07,00:19:08,- You want me backing me up?
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:09,00:19:10,- I listen to Andy.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"- I'm sorry, sorry."
00:19:11,00:19:13,"- Well, no, I think, 'cause I was thinking that,"
00:19:13,00:19:16,"I know George Harrison has a house,"
00:19:16,00:19:19,"which is absolutely monstrous, like it's huge,"
00:19:19,00:19:21,and I thought that that had in the hundreds.
00:19:21,00:19:23,I thought that had close to like 400.
00:19:23,00:19:25,"So I'm going to say, 400."
00:19:25,00:19:26,(laughing)
00:19:26,00:19:29,"- Okay, I'm going to say, well, maybe I'll lowball it."
00:19:29,00:19:31,I'll say 42.
00:19:31,00:19:32,"- Okay, okay."
00:19:32,00:19:35,"- Well, I said 50 or 60."
00:19:35,00:19:36,- Yeah.
00:19:36,00:19:37,"- 42, 400."
00:19:37,00:19:39,"- George Harrison, well, on about 4."
00:19:39,00:19:41,"- My sweet Lord, Dan is the closest."
00:19:41,00:19:42,"- Oh, yes."
00:19:42,00:19:44,"- Oh my gosh, I'm sorry for doubting you."
00:19:44,00:19:46,"- There we go, 300 rooms."
00:19:46,00:19:47,- Wow.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- Really close to you.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"- Basically, there would have big hunting parties,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,wherever one would come and shoot guns and stuff.
00:19:53,00:19:53,"- But interestingly,"
00:19:53,00:19:55,"- Interesting, it was only two bathrooms,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,'cause of the punting arrangements of the time.
00:19:57,00:19:58,- Yeah.
00:19:58,00:19:59,- And that was fine.
00:19:59,00:19:59,Yeah.
00:19:59,00:20:00,- Yeah.
00:20:00,00:20:03,- And these were quite modern.
00:20:03,00:20:04,This is the interesting thing.
00:20:04,00:20:06,Because of the association with greater hygiene
00:20:06,00:20:09,"and not having your energy sapped away from you,"
00:20:09,00:20:11,they were seen from the late 19th century and early 20th
00:20:11,00:20:12,to be the mom thing.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"Now we think of them as being quite old fashioned,"
00:20:14,00:20:18,but they were really kind of modern and quite cool.
00:20:18,00:20:21,"- They were, but again, it was for the richer people."
00:20:21,00:20:22,"- Oh yeah, yeah."
00:20:22,00:20:23,"- And normal people, like forever,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,normal people would share beds.
00:20:25,00:20:27,And then what happened was around the 50s.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"There were a few different reasons,"
00:20:28,00:20:32,but one of the reasons is television started to be more realistic
00:20:32,00:20:35,and television shows would show married couple
00:20:35,00:20:37,and also the haze code had finished.
00:20:37,00:20:41,So people were allowed to show men and women in bed together.
00:20:41,00:20:45,So people started showing men and women in bed together
00:20:45,00:20:48,"and everyone thought, well, now that's the modern thing."
00:20:48,00:20:49,That's the fashion thing.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"- Oh, is that what changed?"
00:20:50,00:20:51,- That's a few different things.
00:20:51,00:20:52,- The haze code was fascinating.
00:20:52,00:20:56,"'Cause in Hollywood, you had a guideline saying,"
00:20:56,00:20:59,don'ts and be careful within movies.
00:20:59,00:21:01,So the don'ts were explicitly do not do this.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"The be careful were, this is the guideline,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,"if you're gonna do this kind of scene,"
00:21:06,00:21:08,"and if someone who is watching it finds that offensive,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,they will not allow for that to be in the movie.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"So one of the things, that's very useful in the bedroom too,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,to have don'ts and be careful.
00:21:14,00:21:15,- Yes.
00:21:15,00:21:15,- You know?
00:21:15,00:21:18,- I've always got a side on the side of this bed.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"No heavy petting, no bombing, no running."
00:21:20,00:21:22,- No cold foot nudging me.
00:21:22,00:21:25,(laughing)
00:21:25,00:21:29,"- Yeah, this was a big problem for Hollywood."
00:21:29,00:21:31,So there's a specific example of a movie
00:21:31,00:21:34,where the Marital Bed was one mattress
00:21:34,00:21:36,"and it was a Lucille Ball movie,"
00:21:36,00:21:38,and they had to re-shoot the scenes.
00:21:38,00:21:41,"So it cost $30,000 for them to go and re-shoot this."
00:21:41,00:21:43,And it was simply that they just had to have it
00:21:43,00:21:46,something like 12 inches apart.
00:21:46,00:21:48,That was like the expected length
00:21:48,00:21:50,of how far the beds needed to be far.
00:21:50,00:21:51,"- Oh, it's sort of safe."
00:21:51,00:21:52,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:21:52,00:21:52,- In real distance for me.
00:21:52,00:21:53,Am I right?
00:21:53,00:21:57,(laughing and laughing)
00:21:57,00:21:58,Oh my God.
00:21:58,00:22:01,"Okay, so some opinions about whether you prefer"
00:22:01,00:22:03,to sleep in bed with a partner or not.
00:22:03,00:22:04,- Yeah.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- Okay.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"- This is a recent poll by you, Gov."
00:22:07,00:22:09,Five percent say their dream arrangement
00:22:09,00:22:11,is different beds in the same room.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"So that is twin beds, okay."
00:22:13,00:22:15,Ten percent say different beds in different rooms
00:22:15,00:22:16,in the dream.
00:22:16,00:22:20,Seventy-six percent say same bed in same room.
00:22:20,00:22:21,- Interesting.
00:22:21,00:22:24,- Nobody says same bed but different rooms.
00:22:24,00:22:26,(laughing)
00:22:26,00:22:27,- That's it.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"- Wow, what a challenge."
00:22:28,00:22:29,- Just my preference.
00:22:29,00:22:33,"- Well, there was some studies that determine"
00:22:33,00:22:36,"that often when people sleep with their partner,"
00:22:36,00:22:40,their subjective view of how well they slept was higher.
00:22:40,00:22:42,But the truth is that they had a worse sleep.
00:22:42,00:22:43,"- Oh, interesting."
00:22:43,00:22:46,- So I feel like is what sleep track is due to my brain.
00:22:46,00:22:48,Where I feel like I've had a great sleep
00:22:48,00:22:50,and I wake up and I'll say you've had a horrendous sleep.
00:22:50,00:22:51,And then I'll be in a bad mood.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"I'll go well, it told me I've had a bad sleep."
00:22:54,00:22:56,So I'll spend the rest of my day feeling bad.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"But in the opposite, I'll have a,"
00:22:58,00:23:00,I feel like I've had a terrible sleep.
00:23:00,00:23:02,And then my phone will say it was a great one.
00:23:02,00:23:02,"I'll go, you know what,"
00:23:02,00:23:03,let's really put a people in my step.
00:23:03,00:23:05,"- Yeah, I think for a lot of people,"
00:23:05,00:23:07,"if you have a partner, there's a sense of safety."
00:23:07,00:23:08,- Yes.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"- So you sort of turn around there there,"
00:23:10,00:23:10,everything's okay.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"So it doesn't matter that you woke up,"
00:23:12,00:23:13,you did it so you could check
00:23:13,00:23:14,and you feel a lot more safe.
00:23:14,00:23:16,- Did you read the Murray Stopes line?
00:23:16,00:23:17,- Yeah.
00:23:17,00:23:20,"- So she, Murray Stopes, who was very, very famous"
00:23:20,00:23:23,"for writing a book called ""Married Love."""
00:23:23,00:23:26,And she was a campaigner for birth control?
00:23:26,00:23:27,- Yes.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"- Yes, big campaigner for that, that kind of thing."
00:23:29,00:23:31,She wrote that the twin bed set
00:23:31,00:23:35,"was an invention of the devil, jealous of married bliss."
00:23:35,00:23:36,- I see.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"- And she proposed that you shouldn't have twin beds,"
00:23:38,00:23:41,instead the wife should have a room with a double bed
00:23:41,00:23:42,and the husband should have a bedroom to himself
00:23:42,00:23:45,"for general use, keeping the wife's bedroom"
00:23:45,00:23:46,a romantic place.
00:23:46,00:23:50,"I think, and then the husband can like have a bed"
00:23:50,00:23:51,that's in the shape of a race car.
00:23:51,00:23:53,(laughing)
00:23:53,00:23:54,- The heat man.
00:23:54,00:23:55,- Exactly.
00:23:55,00:23:56,- Yes.
00:23:56,00:23:57,- I would kill for that person
00:23:57,00:23:58,about that right now.
00:23:58,00:24:00,(laughing)
00:24:00,00:24:05,"- On an unusual bed sharing story,"
00:24:05,00:24:10,this John Adams and Benjamin Franklin shared a bed once.
00:24:10,00:24:13,It's an excerpt from his diary in 1775.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"- John Adams of America, and okay."
00:24:15,00:24:18,"- In 1776, he described the time he had to share"
00:24:18,00:24:19,"a tiny bed with Benjamin Franklin,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,"and instead of sleeping, they had an argument"
00:24:21,00:24:24,"that whether to keep the windows open or closed,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,Franklin eventually won the argument
00:24:26,00:24:28,when Adams got too tired and fell asleep.
00:24:28,00:24:29,- Nice.
00:24:29,00:24:30,- Who really wins?
00:24:30,00:24:31,Because Adams is falling asleep first.
00:24:31,00:24:33,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah, sure."
00:24:33,00:24:35,"- And also, Adams became president of Franklin,"
00:24:35,00:24:36,never did.
00:24:36,00:24:37,"- Yeah, double win."
00:24:37,00:24:39,"- Double win for Adams, you two Franklin."
00:24:39,00:24:39,(laughing)
00:24:39,00:24:41,- Nice.
00:24:41,00:24:42,- I mentioned before that snoring's a problem.
00:24:42,00:24:46,There's been a new study that gives you a way out
00:24:46,00:24:49,"of snoring, and that is, before you go to bed,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,you have to blow on a cunt shell.
00:24:51,00:24:53,(laughing)
00:24:53,00:24:55,"- Oh, no way."
00:24:55,00:24:57,- You might have seen the study before
00:24:57,00:25:00,"that if you blow on did reduce, that's supposed to help"
00:25:00,00:25:01,because it helps your breathing.
00:25:01,00:25:03,You have to do circular breathings.
00:25:03,00:25:05,"Well, apparently cunt shells are even better,"
00:25:05,00:25:08,"because if you learn properly how to blow a cunt shell,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,you have to do very deep breathing.
00:25:10,00:25:12,"You have to do very strong exhalations,"
00:25:12,00:25:14,and also the spiral shape of the shell
00:25:14,00:25:18,gives a unique type of blow.
00:25:18,00:25:19,That means you won't snore.
00:25:19,00:25:20,- No way.
00:25:20,00:25:21,- I've got it.
00:25:21,00:25:22,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:22,00:25:22,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:22,00:25:23,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:23,00:25:24,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:24,00:25:25,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:25,00:25:26,- I've got it.
00:25:26,00:25:27,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:27,00:25:28,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:28,00:25:28,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:28,00:25:29,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:29,00:25:30,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:30,00:25:31,"- I've got it, I've got it."
00:25:31,00:25:32,- I've got it.
00:25:32,00:25:33,- I've got it.
00:25:33,00:25:33,- Oh my gosh.
00:25:33,00:25:39,"- Yeah, no, I've got a big blowable, it makes an incredible note when you blow it."
00:25:39,00:25:44,- It's really good you get it from. - Long way where it was.
00:25:44,00:25:49,"Yeah, it was an island a holiday and I think someone like the Caribbean was many years ago."
00:25:49,00:25:55,But it makes a great noise. - Was it not when your school crashed on that desert island?
00:25:55,00:25:59,- I'd rather not talk about that weekend.
00:26:02,00:26:05,"- If you were the only survivor, how weak were the race?"
00:26:05,00:26:14,"- I was king of that island, Joel."
00:26:14,00:26:20,"Wow, wearing my possum skull armor."
00:26:20,00:26:30,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy."
00:26:30,00:26:34,"My fact is, it's eight degrees warmer inside a daffodil than outside."
00:26:34,00:26:40,"If you're feeling chilly and you're listening to this, there's a daffodil nearby."
00:26:40,00:26:43,Spring is coming. Get it in there.
00:26:43,00:26:45,- You could put most a little pink.
00:26:45,00:26:47,- Are you about to open up when I think you're about to open up?
00:26:47,00:26:48,"- No, no, okay."
00:26:48,00:26:54,"Because when I saw the list of facts, I saw a daffodil out while I was going for a walk."
00:26:54,00:26:56,And so I put my finger in the daffodil.
00:26:56,00:27:00,And I sent the photo to Dan and he did not reply to the photo.
00:27:00,00:27:04,"- I'm sorry, but it was such a ominous thing to see."
00:27:04,00:27:08,- It was uncomfortable when I was sitting next to my wife and mal slipped into my DMs
00:27:08,00:27:11,with a picture of her fingering a daffodil.
00:27:11,00:27:15,- Is it doing some research from the shot?
00:27:15,00:27:19,"- Yeah, that's a photo there. Amazing."
00:27:19,00:27:20,- Was it what?
00:27:20,00:27:23,"- Yeah, I can't tell."
00:27:23,00:27:25,"It was such a cold day that I don't know, like,"
00:27:25,00:27:27,"because it's up to eight degrees, right?"
00:27:27,00:27:29,That requires probably a bit of sunshine.
00:27:29,00:27:33,- You probably also need to keep it in there for a certain amount of time.
00:27:33,00:27:36,And you can't just stand there with your finger in a daffodil.
00:27:36,00:27:38,- The part people will pop over.
00:27:38,00:27:41,"But basically, the daffodils are really interesting."
00:27:41,00:27:44,"They're not like a normal flower because they've got this trumpet thing,"
00:27:44,00:27:46,which most flowers don't have.
00:27:46,00:27:51,And they want to get bees in and pollinating insects in general.
00:27:51,00:27:55,"And often, daffos are some of the first flowers of spring."
00:27:55,00:27:56,So it's quite cold still when they're up.
00:27:56,00:27:59,And the cone acts as a wind break.
00:27:59,00:28:02,And the petals are directing sunlight inwards.
00:28:02,00:28:07,"And third thing, the stem is turning the trumpet away from cold breezes."
00:28:07,00:28:08,"So basically, they're making it a lovely,"
00:28:08,00:28:12,as warm as possible environment to lure in any pollinating insects
00:28:12,00:28:13,that are up and about at this time of year.
00:28:13,00:28:14,- I love it. I love it.
00:28:14,00:28:16,- It's like a restaurant with a fireplace.
00:28:16,00:28:17,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:17,00:28:18,That's very nice.
00:28:18,00:28:20,- So it's very charming.
00:28:20,00:28:23,- So I think there aren't any bees around at this time of year.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Are they really?
00:28:24,00:28:25,"- No, probably not."
00:28:25,00:28:27,- I think they'll be pollinated by flies.
00:28:27,00:28:27,- Yes.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"- And this is the thing, the flies that are around this time of year,"
00:28:30,00:28:31,they tend to be colourblind.
00:28:31,00:28:35,"And so that's why the flowers that you see this time of year,"
00:28:35,00:28:38,"like snow drops and daffodils are white and yellow,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,because they stand out against the greens.
00:28:40,00:28:43,"- Oh, contrast is the main thing, yeah, yeah."
00:28:43,00:28:45,"- And then later in the year, you get more colourful ones."
00:28:45,00:28:46,- It's so good.
00:28:46,00:28:49,- Does the heat in the daffodil sort of warm up the pollen?
00:28:49,00:28:51,"So it's like, like a hot meal."
00:28:51,00:28:53,"- Is it like, is there any?"
00:28:53,00:28:55,"- Yeah, I like it."
00:28:55,00:28:57,"Yes, I'm going to say yes, it absolutely does."
00:28:57,00:28:59,- Anyone have your daffs out already?
00:28:59,00:28:59,- Yes.
00:28:59,00:29:01,- We're recording this on the 19th of February.
00:29:01,00:29:03,- I've got a couple of my gardeners.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"- I do, they started coming up a few days ago, yeah."
00:29:05,00:29:05,- How are they looking?
00:29:05,00:29:07,- They're looking at yellow.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"- Yeah, is the head like bent a little bit?"
00:29:09,00:29:11,"- It is, it's bending down."
00:29:11,00:29:11,"- Oh, dear."
00:29:11,00:29:14,"Because according to English folklore,"
00:29:14,00:29:15,that means you're going to die this year.
00:29:15,00:29:17,"- Oh, damn."
00:29:17,00:29:18,"- Oh, man."
00:29:18,00:29:19,"- Oh, man."
00:29:19,00:29:21,"- No, no, that is a pickle."
00:29:21,00:29:23,(laughing)
00:29:23,00:29:26,- Beautiful flowers or death.
00:29:26,00:29:28,"- Oh, that's very funny."
00:29:28,00:29:32,"- If you dream of them, any maiden who dreams of daffodils"
00:29:32,00:29:35,is warned not to go into a wood with her lover.
00:29:35,00:29:35,- Right.
00:29:35,00:29:38,- And if you see the first daffodil of the year
00:29:38,00:29:40,"out of all your friends and stuff,"
00:29:40,00:29:43,it means you'll have more gold than silver
00:29:43,00:29:45,for the rest of the year.
00:29:45,00:29:46,"Though silver's doing quite well, isn't it?"
00:29:46,00:29:48,"- Yeah, both are overpriced at the moment."
00:29:48,00:29:49,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:29:49,00:29:50,- I'm just saying if you're about Bitcoin.
00:29:50,00:29:51,(laughing)
00:29:51,00:29:55,- But even more gold in silver doesn't necessarily mean
00:29:55,00:29:57,like more money.
00:29:57,00:30:01,"If you had a million silver coins and two gold coins,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,you still have more wealth or more.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"- Well, also they're both good things."
00:30:05,00:30:07,It's like a reverse pickle.
00:30:07,00:30:07,- Yeah.
00:30:07,00:30:10,(laughing)
00:30:10,00:30:13,- And the daffodil bending over though.
00:30:13,00:30:14,- Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:18,"- That's quite sort of daffodilish to do, I would say."
00:30:18,00:30:21,I would say it's a classic daffodil move.
00:30:21,00:30:25,"In fact, the name daffodil, when it goes back to Narcissus,"
00:30:25,00:30:27,"which is what the family it's from, is it?"
00:30:27,00:30:28,- Yeah.
00:30:28,00:30:31,- That was obviously because when Narcissus was looking down
00:30:31,00:30:34,"into the water, he couldn't stop staring at his reflection"
00:30:34,00:30:36,in the mythology and they say that daffodils do the same.
00:30:36,00:30:38,They look down at the water and looking at themselves.
00:30:38,00:30:43,- But do you know that Narcissus is actually Narcissus poeticus?
00:30:43,00:30:46,"It seems, which is a different, it's not the daffodil that you know."
00:30:46,00:30:49,"It's a related daffodil, which is white."
00:30:49,00:30:53,"And so the, like, that's the one that Linnaeus called the Narcissus"
00:30:53,00:30:57,because he based it on that bit of mythology.
00:30:57,00:30:58,- Oh.
00:30:58,00:30:59,- And one of them.
00:30:59,00:31:00,- And one of them is just a related flower.
00:31:00,00:31:01,- We just have a related flower.
00:31:01,00:31:02,- That's so interesting.
00:31:02,00:31:03,- This is the really weird thing.
00:31:03,00:31:06,"There are 36 different species of daffodil, right?"
00:31:06,00:31:09,But they became very popular for breeding and crossbreeding
00:31:09,00:31:11,and making your own variety.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"The different to species is varieties, right?"
00:31:13,00:31:16,"So there are 36 species of daff,"
00:31:16,00:31:19,"but there are 27,000 varieties."
00:31:19,00:31:21,- Yes. - It's crazy.
00:31:21,00:31:22,- And there's that lovely.
00:31:22,00:31:25,- And loads of them are not attractive to insects.
00:31:25,00:31:26,- Right.
00:31:26,00:31:29,- Because they've been bred by plant breeders for their looks.
00:31:29,00:31:31,"They've not been breeding them for their, you know,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"their pollen qualities or anything,"
00:31:33,00:31:35,or their attractiveness to insects.
00:31:35,00:31:36,So they've taken over the process.
00:31:36,00:31:40,So that selection process has meant that lots of daffodils
00:31:40,00:31:41,that you get these days are not actually especially.
00:31:41,00:31:44,"- So humans have to go in and propagate them, do they?"
00:31:44,00:31:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:31:45,00:31:47,"If you look carefully, if you have a garden"
00:31:47,00:31:49,"or some daffodil garden, just keep an eye out"
00:31:49,00:31:51,'cause you'll often find a creepy old man.
00:31:51,00:31:52,- With a finger in a daffodil.
00:31:52,00:31:53,- That's what I have.
00:31:53,00:31:56,(laughing)
00:31:56,00:31:58,- I'll send the photo to all of you guys.
00:31:58,00:32:00,(laughing)
00:32:00,00:32:02,"- But there's lots of, if you go online,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,there's lots of missing daffodils in the UK now
00:32:04,00:32:06,of these crossbreeds that they're really hoping
00:32:06,00:32:07,are still out there.
00:32:07,00:32:09,"So you can find a list of people saying,"
00:32:09,00:32:10,if you live in this area.
00:32:10,00:32:14,"So for example, Lewis in the UK, in Sussex,"
00:32:14,00:32:18,there is a daffodil that's known as the Sussex bonfire.
00:32:18,00:32:20,So they have a big bonfire of night celebration there
00:32:20,00:32:21,and a local...
00:32:21,00:32:22,- It's so many did he in charge.
00:32:22,00:32:25,(laughing)
00:32:25,00:32:26,"- Yeah, there's a local plant-reader"
00:32:26,00:32:28,"called Noel Burr, who created this thing."
00:32:28,00:32:30,"And it hasn't been seen for the last 20 years,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,but they think it must still be in someone's garden.
00:32:32,00:32:34,They just haven't identified it.
00:32:34,00:32:36,"So they sort of say, please look around, see if you can find this."
00:32:36,00:32:38,"- But they look so similar, it's like a Weasewolly."
00:32:38,00:32:41,"'Cause it's like, do they look like a ordinary daffodil?"
00:32:41,00:32:43,- I think they do have different horses.
00:32:43,00:32:44,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:44,00:32:47,There's the Mrs. Auro Backhouse daffodil as well
00:32:47,00:32:50,"that's missing, they're desperately hoping to find."
00:32:50,00:32:52,The Mrs. William Copeland daffodil.
00:32:52,00:32:54,There's all these amazing little crossbreeds
00:32:54,00:32:55,that become famous.
00:32:55,00:32:57,- There's hope that you show them daffodil hunters.
00:32:57,00:32:58,- Yes.
00:32:58,00:32:59,- I feel like going around looking
00:32:59,00:33:01,for interesting daffodils.
00:33:01,00:33:02,"- Yes, that's good."
00:33:02,00:33:03,"- Like, you know, what's his name?"
00:33:03,00:33:07,"Bob Martimer, like his show where he just fishes."
00:33:07,00:33:08,"And, you know, people will love it"
00:33:08,00:33:10,because it's like nice and relaxing.
00:33:10,00:33:11,"You see lots of countryside,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,and you also get a great comedian.
00:33:13,00:33:14,- Yeah.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- I think that's a really good thing.
00:33:15,00:33:17,- Just me crawling through people's gardens.
00:33:17,00:33:18,(laughing)
00:33:18,00:33:21,- Just looking for a rare daffodil.
00:33:21,00:33:24,"- But I'm doing it with rummage, so I love it, yeah."
00:33:24,00:33:28,"- Have you guys heard of Peter Bar, the daffodil king?"
00:33:28,00:33:28,- No.
00:33:28,00:33:29,- No.
00:33:29,00:33:33,"- So, daffodils originally came from Spain and Portugal,"
00:33:33,00:33:35,and then they were brought here by the Romans.
00:33:35,00:33:36,"And that means that in Spain and Portugal,"
00:33:36,00:33:38,"you have lots of different varieties of daffodils,"
00:33:38,00:33:41,"and in order to make the new ones,"
00:33:41,00:33:44,you need to get some of the old ones and then cross them.
00:33:44,00:33:46,"So he rode through Spain and Portugal,"
00:33:46,00:33:50,sleeping under rocks with only a single blanket for comfort.
00:33:50,00:33:53,And was once mistaken for a famous bandit by police
00:33:53,00:33:56,as he went around looking for daffodils.
00:33:56,00:33:57,- Oh.
00:33:57,00:33:58,- And he made thousands and thousands of these.
00:33:58,00:34:00,- It sounds like something someone seems to say
00:34:00,00:34:01,that they're tough.
00:34:01,00:34:03,"Like, I just sleep on a rock, see who they are."
00:34:03,00:34:04,- And let's see.
00:34:04,00:34:05,- And let's see who they are.
00:34:05,00:34:06,(all laughing)
00:34:06,00:34:08,- That looks like they're from the menosphere.
00:34:08,00:34:09,(all laughing)
00:34:09,00:34:12,"- My wife has her own bed, and of course I just sleep"
00:34:12,00:34:13,on the rocks.
00:34:13,00:34:15,(all laughing)
00:34:15,00:34:18,"- I read a newspaper clipping about this guy,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,"Peter Bar, the daffodil king."
00:34:20,00:34:22,And the clipping said that the only other man
00:34:22,00:34:25,"close to claiming the title was Dorian Smith,"
00:34:25,00:34:28,but that gentleman is too content with his ownership
00:34:28,00:34:32,of the Cili Isles to enter in a vain rivalry.
00:34:32,00:34:34,- He owned the Cili Isles.
00:34:34,00:34:36,"- These are the little islands off the coast of Cornwall,"
00:34:36,00:34:39,"is it, they're really, yeah, yeah."
00:34:39,00:34:40,- Cornwall is king of daffodils.
00:34:40,00:34:41,- Is it?
00:34:41,00:34:42,- Yeah.
00:34:42,00:34:43,- That's the biggest producer of daffodils in the world.
00:34:43,00:34:45,"- Well, Britain is the biggest country."
00:34:45,00:34:47,"It's like, this is where world leaders in daff production."
00:34:47,00:34:48,- Yes.
00:34:48,00:34:49,- It's not nothing.
00:34:49,00:34:50,(all laughing)
00:34:50,00:34:54,"- It's not anything, 30, 30 million tons of bulbs."
00:34:54,00:34:56,- Can I see a million tons of bulbs?
00:34:56,00:34:56,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:34:56,00:34:58,- It doesn't sound plausible.
00:34:58,00:35:00,- That could be a number that's over 100 years.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"I'm not sure if that's an annual produce,"
00:35:02,00:35:03,"but-- - Oh, right."
00:35:03,00:35:04,"- No, of course it is."
00:35:04,00:35:05,(all laughing)
00:35:05,00:35:05,- Interesting.
00:35:05,00:35:07,"- Yeah, you're the biggest--"
00:35:07,00:35:08,"- And as well, I just cut flowers,"
00:35:08,00:35:09,people buy them 'cause they look nice.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"- Yeah, exactly, but-- - It's awesome."
00:35:11,00:35:13,"- We have mentioned this before,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,but I have forgot it.
00:35:15,00:35:16,They're very poisonous.
00:35:16,00:35:18,- I should have known-- - They get like cats or dogs
00:35:18,00:35:19,and things can't eat it.
00:35:19,00:35:20,"- Well, and humans."
00:35:20,00:35:21,"- And humans, oh yes."
00:35:21,00:35:22,"- Oh, okay."
00:35:22,00:35:23,(all laughing)
00:35:23,00:35:24,- Which it's my way.
00:35:24,00:35:25,- I'll call up brunch.
00:35:25,00:35:27,(all laughing)
00:35:27,00:35:28,"- Well, no, but this is a problem,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,"'cause often when you go into a local supermarket,"
00:35:30,00:35:32,the flowers will be positioned right next to the fruit
00:35:32,00:35:34,"and veg, right?"
00:35:34,00:35:36,And there's been people saying you've got to stop leaving
00:35:36,00:35:39,"the daffodils near the Chinese vegetables,"
00:35:39,00:35:42,"near the onions, because they can be mistaken for them."
00:35:42,00:35:45,And people have been hospitalized quite a few times.
00:35:45,00:35:47,"- If you have a daffodil,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,like-- - Me and that wake the mistaken for that.
00:35:49,00:35:51,"- So they're often sold, we're not open yet, right?"
00:35:51,00:35:51,"- Yeah, right."
00:35:51,00:35:54,"- So they look a little bit like spring onions,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,and there are also some other like spring greens
00:35:56,00:35:58,that you get in China that look quite a lot like them.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- Right.
00:35:59,00:36:01,"- As written and article by John Robertson,"
00:36:01,00:36:04,who works at the Poison Garden in Annock.
00:36:04,00:36:05,"- Oh, yeah. - To know that."
00:36:05,00:36:08,- It's like a garden with all poisonous plants in it.
00:36:08,00:36:10,And he's found lots of examples of people
00:36:10,00:36:11,being poisoned by daffodils.
00:36:11,00:36:14,"He said there was some parents who were not very well,"
00:36:14,00:36:15,and they had a couple of children
00:36:15,00:36:18,who were just old enough to make a stew.
00:36:18,00:36:19,- No. - And they went and picked out
00:36:19,00:36:21,what they thought were onions and put them in
00:36:21,00:36:23,and they were daffodil bulbs.
00:36:23,00:36:26,- What is the right age to make a stew?
00:36:26,00:36:27,(all laughing)
00:36:27,00:36:29,"- It's a really good question, is that?"
00:36:29,00:36:31,- No one of you have to get your license in the UK.
00:36:31,00:36:32,- I don't know if that's a thing in your ear.
00:36:32,00:36:38,"- On bees and heat, a study from North Carolina State University"
00:36:38,00:36:40,"found that bumblebees carrying pollen,"
00:36:40,00:36:44,their bodies heat up depending on how much pollen they have.
00:36:44,00:36:45,It's a workout.
00:36:45,00:36:48,So the weight of the pollen that they're carrying around
00:36:48,00:36:51,makes their bodies warmer.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"And so they're afraid that global warming,"
00:36:53,00:36:56,the workout of carrying pollen will be too much for them.
00:36:56,00:36:58,- Oh no. - And they'll overheat.
00:36:58,00:36:58,- I know. - It's true.
00:36:58,00:37:01,"- You know what happens if, sorry to interrupt,"
00:37:01,00:37:04,but you know what happens if a bee overheats.
00:37:04,00:37:05,"We've mentioned this on our show before,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,it ejaculates itself to death.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"- That's really, yeah."
00:37:10,00:37:12,"- Really, it just can't stop, it's just."
00:37:12,00:37:14,"- It can't stop, yeah."
00:37:14,00:37:15,"I can't remember the exact details,"
00:37:15,00:37:17,but I remember that sentence very clearly.
00:37:17,00:37:18,"- Yeah, yeah. - It's a reason."
00:37:18,00:37:21,- Wow. - Stick to the mind.
00:37:21,00:37:22,"Just on the thing that Mel said,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,they are now flowering two or three weeks earlier
00:37:24,00:37:25,than in the past.
00:37:25,00:37:26,This is a climatey thing.
00:37:26,00:37:27,This is a while getting warmer things.
00:37:27,00:37:32,"So, if Wordsworth went for his famous walk with his sister"
00:37:32,00:37:36,"today, there might be nothing there at all."
00:37:36,00:37:37,'Cause all they do have already flowered
00:37:37,00:37:39,"a couple of weeks ago, he'd have had to"
00:37:39,00:37:40,have a ride about something else.
00:37:40,00:37:41,- Right.
00:37:41,00:37:42,- It doesn't seem like the biggest problem
00:37:42,00:37:44,when it's going-- - The reclining door's open.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"- Yeah, this is not the biggest effect"
00:37:46,00:37:47,"of climate change that you can think of,"
00:37:47,00:37:48,"but it is bad, you know."
00:37:48,00:37:50,"- But that is the thing about it is he says,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"I wandered lonely as a cloud,"
00:37:52,00:37:53,but he wasn't lonely.
00:37:53,00:37:54,He was with his sister the whole time.
00:37:54,00:37:56,- But if he'd said I wandered out there
00:37:56,00:37:58,"with my sister, what's the rhyme?"
00:37:58,00:37:59,"Blister, I suppose, I've got a blister."
00:37:59,00:38:00,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:38:00,00:38:03,"- I mean, I've spent a few days in here."
00:38:03,00:38:05,I don't think the clouds are there lonely.
00:38:05,00:38:07,There's quite a few hanging out together.
00:38:07,00:38:08,- That's yesterday.
00:38:08,00:38:09,(all laughing)
00:38:09,00:38:12,- That's a thick mask across the countryside.
00:38:12,00:38:13,"Yeah, you're right."
00:38:13,00:38:14,(all laughing)
00:38:14,00:38:16,"- So, maybe he went in an ironic way."
00:38:16,00:38:19,(upbeat music)
00:38:19,00:38:24,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show"
00:38:24,00:38:25,and that is James.
00:38:25,00:38:27,"- Okay, my fact this week is that you may be able"
00:38:27,00:38:30,to cure chronically blocked noses
00:38:30,00:38:32,with a snot transplant.
00:38:32,00:38:34,(all laughing)
00:38:34,00:38:35,- Lovely.
00:38:35,00:38:36,- It's future guys.
00:38:36,00:38:36,- Yeah.
00:38:36,00:38:37,- Incredible.
00:38:37,00:38:38,- It does sound good.
00:38:38,00:38:39,- Yeah.
00:38:39,00:38:40,"- We do that, I thought."
00:38:40,00:38:41,"- Yeah, so I'm here, I'll be."
00:38:41,00:38:43,"- Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know if you suffer"
00:38:43,00:38:45,from this kind of thing I do.
00:38:45,00:38:47,"Definitely, chronic rhinocytus."
00:38:47,00:38:50,"In fact, I had surgery for it a few years ago,"
00:38:50,00:38:52,and that was kind of the best way to deal with it.
00:38:52,00:38:53,And it kind of still is.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"I read about a new study in new scientists this week,"
00:38:56,00:38:58,and they've come up with this idea
00:38:58,00:39:01,of basically siphoning snot out of someone
00:39:01,00:39:02,and shoving it right up there.
00:39:02,00:39:04,"It's as simple as that, really."
00:39:04,00:39:06,- But surely the people that don't have blocked noses
00:39:06,00:39:09,don't have a lot of snot to offer.
00:39:09,00:39:12,So they could probably only be a donor for one person.
00:39:12,00:39:14,(all laughing)
00:39:14,00:39:16,- There's a way to clear.
00:39:16,00:39:18,"- Yeah, who you mean, well."
00:39:18,00:39:20,- Basically everyone has some kind of microbiome
00:39:20,00:39:23,"in their sinuses, and what you're trying to do"
00:39:23,00:39:26,is get those bacteria and viruses out of a healthy person's nose
00:39:26,00:39:29,and put them into an unhealthy person's nose.
00:39:29,00:39:30,- It's really cool.
00:39:30,00:39:32,- I think it just sounds like a great idea.
00:39:32,00:39:35,So it was one of the pioneers of it.
00:39:35,00:39:36,A scientist called Amy Molls.
00:39:36,00:39:39,"- Yes, Amy Molls from Vancouver,"
00:39:39,00:39:42,and another guy called Anders Mortensen from Helsingburg.
00:39:42,00:39:46,"- Yes, and so she was inspired by fecal transplants."
00:39:46,00:39:49,Which we've talked about before as being very useful.
00:39:49,00:39:50,- You don't want to get those two mixed up.
00:39:50,00:39:51,- Absolutely not.
00:39:51,00:39:54,(all laughing)
00:39:54,00:39:56,- You've just put snot up this person's bum.
00:39:56,00:39:58,"- Wait a minute, that means."
00:39:58,00:40:00,(all laughing)
00:40:00,00:40:04,"- So yeah, it gets referred to as a sinus probiotic."
00:40:04,00:40:06,"'Cause you've got, you know, this,"
00:40:06,00:40:08,you're fighting snot with snot basically.
00:40:08,00:40:11,"'Cause this thing, chronic sinus condition"
00:40:11,00:40:14,"or chronic rhino sinusitis, it sounds awful."
00:40:14,00:40:15,- It's a shocker.
00:40:15,00:40:16,- So you've had it.
00:40:16,00:40:17,"- I still kind of have it,"
00:40:17,00:40:19,but the surgery helped quite a lot.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"- You've mentioned your sinuses in the past,"
00:40:21,00:40:23,"but I've always thought, yeah, I've got a cold too."
00:40:23,00:40:25,And I'm so sorry James.
00:40:25,00:40:27,"- Like basically, I got often can't breathe."
00:40:27,00:40:29,"- Yes, yes, yes."
00:40:29,00:40:31,- Just kind of vital for living.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"- Absolutely, that's probably one."
00:40:33,00:40:36,"But it gets dismissed by lots of doctors as a minor inconvenience,"
00:40:36,00:40:37,"but people living with it,"
00:40:37,00:40:41,which might be up to 10% I read approaching this number.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"Your face hurts, you're always bunged up,"
00:40:43,00:40:47,"you lose your sense of smell, headaches, bad breath."
00:40:47,00:40:48,- Try again on an aeroplane.
00:40:48,00:40:49,"- Oh yeah, of course."
00:40:49,00:40:50,- Wow.
00:40:50,00:40:52,"- Soon as you, you know, when your ears sort of,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,"when your ears pop, when that happens for you,"
00:40:54,00:40:57,I just get this incredible pain and my sinuses.
00:40:57,00:40:58,"- I've had that, if you've got enough light"
00:40:58,00:40:59,"and you've got a bit of a cold,"
00:40:59,00:41:01,"that can happen, god, it'll just suddenly."
00:41:01,00:41:03,"- Oh, and that, well, allegedly,"
00:41:03,00:41:06,people with it seem to be 77% likely to have depression
00:41:06,00:41:08,than those without.
00:41:08,00:41:11,'Cause it's just sort of chronically debilitating.
00:41:11,00:41:14,- Do you think there's a research team as a game?
00:41:14,00:41:15,You guys guess what?
00:41:15,00:41:18,"The name of the research team trying to work out,"
00:41:18,00:41:22,"they're using like AI to work out the cause of,"
00:41:22,00:41:24,this rhinocytus in people.
00:41:24,00:41:24,- Okay.
00:41:24,00:41:27,- What is the name of this research team?
00:41:27,00:41:28,- The sort of game.
00:41:28,00:41:29,"- Like the acronym, you mean?"
00:41:29,00:41:32,"- It's not an acronym, it's just like a fun bit of wordplay."
00:41:32,00:41:35,"And it's like, when you read it, you go, of course."
00:41:35,00:41:40,"- Okay, blow, who knows how to fix this?"
00:41:40,00:41:42,"- I mean, you've got the right pun."
00:41:42,00:41:45,"It turns out, well, in terms of it is, it's got nose in it,"
00:41:45,00:41:47,but it's medical.
00:41:47,00:41:48,And it's about figuring out.
00:41:48,00:41:49,- Do you know Tom?
00:41:49,00:41:52,"- No, it's so much simpler than that."
00:41:52,00:41:55,It's literally just a word in the medical field
00:41:55,00:41:57,"that you would use a lot, a doctor."
00:41:57,00:41:58,What does a doctor do to you?
00:41:58,00:41:59,- Diet nose.
00:41:59,00:42:00,- Yes!
00:42:00,00:42:02,(audience cheering)
00:42:02,00:42:03,- Lovely.
00:42:03,00:42:05,"- Yeah, yeah, too good, too good."
00:42:05,00:42:06,- That's pretty good.
00:42:06,00:42:08,"- Because Dan, you talked about acronyms."
00:42:08,00:42:10,"There is the way to measure,"
00:42:10,00:42:12,"whether you have chronic sinusitis,"
00:42:12,00:42:15,is the cyanone nasal outcome test or snot.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"- Beautiful, lovely."
00:42:17,00:42:20,- And they basically give you 22 things.
00:42:20,00:42:22,Do you need to blow your nose?
00:42:22,00:42:23,Do you sneeze a lot?
00:42:23,00:42:25,Do you have a running nose and you put how often?
00:42:25,00:42:28,Does it happen all the time or does it happen never?
00:42:28,00:42:30,- What's interesting is how much mucous
00:42:30,00:42:32,and snot we produce per day?
00:42:32,00:42:33,- A bucket.
00:42:33,00:42:35,"- It's buckets, it's 1.5 liters per day"
00:42:35,00:42:37,is what the body produces.
00:42:37,00:42:40,"- Okay, that's like a large bottle of Coca-Cola, isn't it?"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"- Yeah, and it's used for various different things."
00:42:42,00:42:45,I didn't realize it was used for.
00:42:45,00:42:49,"It lubricates poo, so then it makes it easier to exit our body."
00:42:49,00:42:50,"- Yeah, you're saying it with a slightly disgusted look"
00:42:50,00:42:52,"on your face, but you try going without."
00:42:52,00:42:54,You'll be crying out for that mucous to come back.
00:42:54,00:42:55,- I know.
00:42:55,00:42:56,- I don't know how I try to do that.
00:42:56,00:42:57,- You try going down.
00:42:57,00:42:59,(laughing)
00:42:59,00:43:00,"- I don't know what things were of the like,"
00:43:00,00:43:03,"""It's a mucous to you, how dare you."""
00:43:03,00:43:04,I don't know how bad it got for you
00:43:04,00:43:05,"on the Lord of the Flies island,"
00:43:05,00:43:07,but we keep our poo's lubricated.
00:43:07,00:43:09,- But that's the thing is that people obviously
00:43:09,00:43:12,"would find the idea of eating snot disgusting,"
00:43:12,00:43:16,but we are swallowing our snot all the time.
00:43:16,00:43:18,"Most of those liters, we're just swallowing it."
00:43:18,00:43:20,"- Yeah, 'cause it traps, you know, like,"
00:43:20,00:43:22,bacteria or tiny hairs or whatever
00:43:22,00:43:25,"that are all landing in your body,"
00:43:25,00:43:28,and it can be in the lining to your lungs and things like that.
00:43:28,00:43:29,"Then you bring that up, you know,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,"that sort of trap gets full of the pollutants,"
00:43:31,00:43:33,"you bring it up, you swallow it out it goes."
00:43:33,00:43:34,- Easy.
00:43:34,00:43:36,- One interesting thing about picking your nose and eating it
00:43:36,00:43:39,"is that according to some scientists,"
00:43:39,00:43:40,they think that might be a good thing
00:43:40,00:43:43,because the pathogens that get stuck in your nose
00:43:43,00:43:45,are the weaker ones because they haven't managed
00:43:45,00:43:48,"to get all the way up, so if you take those ones out"
00:43:48,00:43:51,"and eat them, then that's like a vaccine."
00:43:51,00:43:54,"- Like a vaccine, exactly, I should say,"
00:43:54,00:43:55,not all scientists.
00:43:55,00:43:57,"- Right, okay, no that's good to know."
00:43:57,00:43:58,"Before this podcast, we're calling actually Mel,"
00:43:58,00:44:00,"sent me a photo of her with her finger jammed up,"
00:44:00,00:44:03,"and I was like, ""I didn't understand it from now."""
00:44:03,00:44:05,- Yeah.
00:44:05,00:44:06,- It's so much warmer out of there.
00:44:06,00:44:09,(laughing)
00:44:09,00:44:13,- You can get terrible sinusitis if you're a tortoise.
00:44:13,00:44:14,(laughing)
00:44:14,00:44:15,There was a tortoise.
00:44:15,00:44:16,"- It's already doing these tortoises, isn't it?"
00:44:16,00:44:18,(laughing)
00:44:18,00:44:22,"- There's a tortoise in Bristol Zoo in 2014,"
00:44:22,00:44:26,"called Helen, who had a terrible nasal infection,"
00:44:26,00:44:28,and they gave them a cross van to biotics
00:44:28,00:44:31,and lots of sinus rinses and stuff.
00:44:31,00:44:34,"And the reason is that tortoises can't cough,"
00:44:34,00:44:35,"and so if you get the infection,"
00:44:35,00:44:37,they can't get it out of their body.
00:44:37,00:44:39,But the reason I mainly bring it up
00:44:39,00:44:41,"is that this tortoise, called Helen,"
00:44:41,00:44:44,has a underfloor heated sand pit.
00:44:44,00:44:45,- No way.
00:44:45,00:44:47,"- And it's been a bizarre point on this show, Mel,"
00:44:47,00:44:50,that Andy hasn't got underfloor heating in his house.
00:44:50,00:44:51,- Oh my gosh.
00:44:51,00:44:52,- That makes me sound like an insane diva.
00:44:52,00:44:53,(laughing)
00:44:53,00:44:55,"I'm just saying that Romans had it 2,000 years ago."
00:44:55,00:44:57,Why don't we all have it?
00:44:57,00:44:57,- It's not just me.
00:44:57,00:44:59,"- It's like, why does Helen have it?"
00:44:59,00:45:00,"- You don't want to know, right now."
00:45:00,00:45:00,(laughing)
00:45:00,00:45:01,"- And again, that genuinely want the hell."
00:45:01,00:45:03,(laughing)
00:45:03,00:45:06,There are humans out there who could do with underfloor heating.
00:45:06,00:45:07,(laughing)
00:45:07,00:45:08,- Some of them around this table.
00:45:08,00:45:09,(laughing)
00:45:09,00:45:11,- Wow.
00:45:11,00:45:12,"- Well, congratulations, Helen."
00:45:12,00:45:14,I'll be very happy.
00:45:14,00:45:16,- I hope your sign-in sign doesn't never get to be wrong.
00:45:16,00:45:18,(laughing)
00:45:18,00:45:22,- Cold medicine in the UK is substantially worse
00:45:22,00:45:23,than it used to be.
00:45:23,00:45:24,- It's not right.
00:45:24,00:45:25,- Yeah.
00:45:25,00:45:27,- Is this pseudo-effort drain or no?
00:45:27,00:45:28,This is not to do with the actual--
00:45:28,00:45:29,- Certainly is.
00:45:29,00:45:30,"- Oh, it is, right."
00:45:30,00:45:33,"Okay, is it because they outlawed pseudo-effort drain"
00:45:33,00:45:36,in New Zealand for a bit and they've brought it back?
00:45:36,00:45:37,- Who did that?
00:45:37,00:45:39,- Because it's very easy to turn that cold medication
00:45:39,00:45:40,into drugs.
00:45:40,00:45:41,- Yes.
00:45:41,00:45:42,- It is.
00:45:42,00:45:45,- A key ingredient of crystal meth
00:45:45,00:45:46,- Yeah.
00:45:46,00:45:48,- Is pseudo-effort drain.
00:45:48,00:45:52,And pseudo-effort drain is where pseudo-fed
00:45:52,00:45:53,gets its name from.
00:45:53,00:45:53,- Okay.
00:45:53,00:45:54,- Do you hear it?
00:45:54,00:45:55,"- Yeah, pseudo-effort drain."
00:45:55,00:45:56,"- And it was used with it, right?"
00:45:56,00:45:58,- It was used with it's in the name.
00:45:58,00:46:00,It was used for decades.
00:46:00,00:46:03,"And in 2008, I'm replaced with something"
00:46:03,00:46:07,"much less effective, called phenelephrine."
00:46:07,00:46:10,"And I mean, it's good news if you don't like crystal meth"
00:46:10,00:46:11,being a big part of your community.
00:46:11,00:46:13,"- Bad news, if you have chronic sinusitis."
00:46:13,00:46:14,- Yeah.
00:46:14,00:46:16,- Can't you get it?
00:46:16,00:46:17,- Like.
00:46:17,00:46:18,- Can I get it under the cancer somewhere?
00:46:18,00:46:19,- I think there are very specific--
00:46:19,00:46:21,- The problem is I can't get my head under the cancer
00:46:21,00:46:23,because it all goes into my eyes.
00:46:23,00:46:24,(laughing)
00:46:24,00:46:25,"- There are very specific circumstances,"
00:46:25,00:46:27,"I think under which a doctor will give it to you,"
00:46:27,00:46:29,but it's not just ladled out now
00:46:29,00:46:31,because it's too easy to use it to make crystal meth.
00:46:31,00:46:34,"- I've written a new script called ""Bloing Bed"""
00:46:34,00:46:36,and I think it's going to be really exciting.
00:46:36,00:46:38,"I'm really excited, very nice."
00:46:38,00:46:39,- Yes.
00:46:39,00:46:42,"- A doctor, German doctor called Wilhelm Fleiss"
00:46:42,00:46:44,was a friend of Freud.
00:46:44,00:46:49,And he thought that your nose got more swollen once a month
00:46:49,00:46:52,and it kind of had its own menstrual cycle.
00:46:52,00:46:53,- Oh.
00:46:53,00:46:56,- And he thought that the swelling of the nose
00:46:56,00:46:59,caused some kind of like sexual disorders.
00:46:59,00:47:00,- Yes.
00:47:00,00:47:02,(laughing)
00:47:02,00:47:03,- Yes.
00:47:03,00:47:04,- That's way far to thought.
00:47:04,00:47:05,- Pritch.
00:47:05,00:47:06,- Okay.
00:47:06,00:47:09,And now I sit back and allow Dan to explain
00:47:09,00:47:12,what the hell he was thinking with that insurrection.
00:47:12,00:47:13,"- Well, I just know that--"
00:47:13,00:47:15,"- Take the tempo out, you know,"
00:47:15,00:47:16,before you talk to his Dan.
00:47:16,00:47:19,(laughing)
00:47:19,00:47:22,- I've always thought that the nose was very similar
00:47:22,00:47:23,to a vagina.
00:47:23,00:47:24,- You've always thought that.
00:47:24,00:47:25,(laughing)
00:47:25,00:47:26,- Yeah.
00:47:26,00:47:27,- As a young boy.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"- As a young boy, I just always thought,"
00:47:29,00:47:32,"no, because we share a very similar week."
00:47:32,00:47:34,My nose and vagina share very similar tissues
00:47:34,00:47:35,"on the inside, right?"
00:47:35,00:47:36,- They have erectile tissues.
00:47:36,00:47:37,- Yeah.
00:47:37,00:47:38,- Exactly.
00:47:38,00:47:39,- Yeah.
00:47:39,00:47:43,"- And it is true that if you get excited down there,"
00:47:43,00:47:44,it can give you a block nose.
00:47:44,00:47:47,Sometimes that's called honeymoon rhinitis.
00:47:47,00:47:48,And it's because the blood rushes
00:47:48,00:47:50,to the erectile tissue in both places.
00:47:50,00:47:51,- Whoa.
00:47:51,00:47:54,"- But this guy, Wilhelm Fleiss,"
00:47:54,00:47:56,he thought that the best way to deal with it
00:47:56,00:47:57,is to take a cane.
00:47:58,00:47:59,- Wow.
00:47:59,00:48:01,"- And he thought that if you took a cane,"
00:48:01,00:48:03,then it would stop your nose from going through
00:48:03,00:48:05,this menstrual cycle and that it would stop
00:48:05,00:48:07,your sexual disorders.
00:48:07,00:48:10,"And surprise, surprise, Sigmund Freud, absolutely agreed."
00:48:10,00:48:11,- Yeah.
00:48:11,00:48:12,(laughing)
00:48:12,00:48:14,- And was the one who would prescribe him this cocaine
00:48:14,00:48:17,so that his patients would feel better.
00:48:17,00:48:18,"- Oh, give it a go."
00:48:18,00:48:20,(laughing)
00:48:20,00:48:21,"- It was a big cold and flu remedy, wasn't it?"
00:48:21,00:48:22,- Yeah.
00:48:22,00:48:23,- Cocaine was just a standard thing.
00:48:23,00:48:25,"Again, cocaine, crystal meth, all these drugs,"
00:48:25,00:48:27,before we really understood.
00:48:27,00:48:29,"- And heroin was good for cuffs, wasn't it?"
00:48:29,00:48:30,- I was trying to think of a pun that whole time
00:48:30,00:48:32,"and the only thing I could think of,"
00:48:32,00:48:34,you've got a stiffie and a stuffy.
00:48:34,00:48:35,(laughing)
00:48:35,00:48:36,- Yeah.
00:48:36,00:48:38,"- It's all like a gear, it's all like a gear."
00:48:38,00:48:40,- Can I tell you one more weird transplant?
00:48:40,00:48:41,"- Yes, please."
00:48:41,00:48:43,- That's not transplants.
00:48:43,00:48:46,So there is a belief among some doctors
00:48:46,00:48:47,that we might within the next 10 years
00:48:47,00:48:50,get the first ever head transplant.
00:48:50,00:48:51,- Oh.
00:48:51,00:48:52,- Yeah.
00:48:52,00:48:53,- Wow.
00:48:53,00:48:53,- It's pretty interesting.
00:48:53,00:48:55,"So this is a surgeon called Bruce Matthew,"
00:48:55,00:48:56,who's a former NHS Neurosurgeon.
00:48:56,00:48:58,He's also qualified.
00:48:58,00:49:01,"And basically, it's really a body transplant, actually."
00:49:01,00:49:02,- Yeah.
00:49:02,00:49:03,- Because it's the same.
00:49:03,00:49:04,"- Yeah, it's the same."
00:49:04,00:49:04,- It's taking--
00:49:04,00:49:05,"- Yeah, true."
00:49:05,00:49:06,The head is the person.
00:49:06,00:49:07,- The head is the person.
00:49:07,00:49:08,"No, it's not the same person."
00:49:08,00:49:09,"Because if they say we're giving you a head transplant,"
00:49:09,00:49:11,that means they're going to take off your head
00:49:11,00:49:12,and put someone else's head on.
00:49:12,00:49:14,But what happens to your head?
00:49:14,00:49:15,"- Your head, but the key thing apparently"
00:49:15,00:49:17,is that your head and your spinal column
00:49:17,00:49:18,have to be kept together.
00:49:18,00:49:20,There's no way of just taking off a head
00:49:20,00:49:21,and putting it on another body.
00:49:21,00:49:23,"It has to be head and spinal column, okay?"
00:49:23,00:49:23,- Okay.
00:49:23,00:49:25,- And then I found myself looking into
00:49:25,00:49:28,what other transplants we can do.
00:49:28,00:49:31,"So shoulder replacement surgery, absolutely handy."
00:49:31,00:49:32,That's fine.
00:49:32,00:49:34,"Knee surgery, again, very calm by now, knee replacement."
00:49:34,00:49:38,"But we don't seem, as far as I know, to do toe transplants."
00:49:38,00:49:40,"- Toes onto your fingers, I've seen that."
00:49:40,00:49:42,- Toe becomes thumb.
00:49:42,00:49:44,That is the gold standard for letting you pinch things again.
00:49:44,00:49:45,- Okay.
00:49:45,00:49:47,- But I don't think they ever say we're going to take a toll.
00:49:47,00:49:52,- Is it because you can manage without one of your toes?
00:49:52,00:49:54,"- I have a broken toe and the doctors go,"
00:49:54,00:49:57,"we don't really, we're not going to put your toe in a car."
00:49:57,00:49:59,So I just have a toe that just doesn't bend.
00:49:59,00:50:00,"- Oh, okay."
00:50:00,00:50:03,"- You can't live your life without working kidneys, right?"
00:50:03,00:50:04,- Yeah.
00:50:04,00:50:06,"- But if you lose one of your toes, it's not great"
00:50:06,00:50:07,or you can live your life.
00:50:07,00:50:09,- But if you don't want to get many people to sign up
00:50:09,00:50:12,"to donating their body, if they find out,"
00:50:12,00:50:14,they're just donating their toes.
00:50:14,00:50:18,- I think your toe could save someone's awkward conversation
00:50:18,00:50:19,at the pool.
00:50:19,00:50:21,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:50:21,00:50:23,"It's not top of the list of things to solve, for sure."
00:50:23,00:50:24,- That's the absolute.
00:50:24,00:50:25,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:50:25,00:50:28,"- Wait, so okay, so we're doing heads, shoulders."
00:50:28,00:50:29,- Yeah.
00:50:29,00:50:30,- Is that what's going on here?
00:50:30,00:50:32,"- Oh my god, I can't believe that."
00:50:32,00:50:33,"- No, I knew the second you said it."
00:50:33,00:50:35,I could see in your face.
00:50:35,00:50:38,You didn't just mention toes for no reason.
00:50:38,00:50:39,"There's no waste with Andy, he's not."
00:50:39,00:50:41,- Wow.
00:50:41,00:50:44,(upbeat music)
00:50:44,00:50:47,"- Okay, that's it."
00:50:47,00:50:48,That is all of our facts.
