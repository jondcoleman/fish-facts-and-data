00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680
 [Music]

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.600
 Hi!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.360
 Hi Andy!

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.160
 Hey Andy!

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.400
 Hi everybody, welcome to Drop As A Line.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.240
 You club fishers out there.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.960
 Hope you're all having a lovely time.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.920
 Welcome to this bit of club fish, which is our...

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.080
 It's our correspondence section.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.840
 It's the Traveling Post Office, you know?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.880
 It's just the correspondence bit.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.440
 I can't think of a metaphor today.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.520
 I went to the world's smallest, not the world's,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.520
 America's smallest post office when I was in America.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.280
 Oh yeah?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.720
 It was closed.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.000
 Oh.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.680
 How tiny is it?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.400
 It was really small, but it was really next to,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.120
 it was right next to the place where I bought you that yeti mug.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.120
 Oh!

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.960
 Yeah, yeah, I love that skunk ape.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.200
 That's a skunk ape bug.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.160
 And it's the one that we used as a basis for our

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 'No Such Things as a Fish' mugs, which are very different

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.400
 and certainly not a rip-off of whatever they were.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.040
 I mean, so different they are.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.440
 It's a different jurisdiction.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.440
 It's a different jurisdiction.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 There's no...

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.400
 I don't think we have an extradition treaty with America, do we?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 I don't know.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 Probably not.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 But that's good.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.640
 I genuinely paused on saying that because I was worried about

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.760
 the skunk ape's lawyers listening to this.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.400
 I want to see that lawsuit.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.080
 Skunk ape versus No Such Things as a Fish.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.040
 Anyway, are we supposed to be doing the people's emails and stuff?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.680
 I think that's not this week.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.920
 Let's just do...

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.360
 Let's drop each other a line, you know?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.760
 Let's just get back in touch with each other.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.600
 All right, let's do some emails.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 Okay.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.880
 Ethan Klopfenstein writes, "Yes, what an opening name."

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.320
 Just the best names we get.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 Yeah.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 Thank you, Ethan.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280
 "Your guest on the last episode, No Such Things as a Short Dalek, made a comment

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 about American cheese being different kinds of cheeses."

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.040
 Okay.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.040
 Yeah.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.400
 Ethan, Ethan has a point here.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.200
 Ethan says, "American cheese isn't even cheese."

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 What?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 "It contains less than 51% cheese curds per slice and does not meet the FDA standards

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.640
 for cheese.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.760
 This is obviously an American administration and a classification maybe different in different

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 parts of the world."

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.800
 I feel like we've done this on Fish.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 I feel like...

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.480
 Yeah, I feel like we've said that American cheese is mostly not cheese.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.520
 It doesn't pass the test of cheese.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.520
 Is that right?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.760
 I remember that we said that Pringles aren't potato chips because they don't contain enough

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 potato.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760
 They're starch.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.760
 Starch products.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.240
 Because I remember what this discussion was about, Andy, was that in Japan they have European

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.200
 cheese-flavored Kit Kats and you were quite stringent in your opinion that there's no

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.040
 such thing as European cheese.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 Yeah.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.440
 I think that is an insane classification.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.240
 You can't even say French cheese and there are many other countries other than France

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240
 in Europe.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.240
 Yeah.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.240
 Oh, my goodness.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.120
 No, it's a crazy thing to say.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120
 Yeah.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.320
 Here's a thing and I don't know who of us is being picked up on this because I actually

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.320
 can't remember who said it, but Hamza Alfarane writes, "Love the podcast, thrilled that you're

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.680
 talking about Jordan, Jordan the country.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.960
 Just wanted to bring you to your attention that Mansaf is not actually made from camel's

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.120
 milk but goat yoghurt."

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120
 Oh.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.960
 And then he says, "In fact it is made out of something called Jameed, which looks like

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.120
 a smooth white rock, but Jameed is dehydrated goat's milk yoghurt."

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.920
 How interesting because I think it was Sophie Duker who just been to Jordan and she tried

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.320
 it and so she has obviously been miss-sold whatever it was.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.320
 Yeah.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.480
 So, thank you Hamza and we'll never have Sophie on the show again.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.480
 That's a lifetime.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 Oh, no.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480
 Yeah, sorry.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.480
 There's...

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.480
 Wait a minute.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.480
 Wait a minute.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.480
 Wait a minute.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.000
 How come Sophie makes one possible mistake?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.040
 I mean, we're taking Hamza's word for it here and she is immediately black-balled and yet

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.840
 some people on this call because we're doing this on Zoom by the way may have made more

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.480
 than one mistake and are still in the show.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.320
 Who could he be talking about?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320
 Yeah.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.320
 Inaccurate Andy.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.320
 That's fair.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.360
 It's Anna who's here but not talking.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:28.200
 Well, here's something I got an actual lead on from Sarah Sidgwick, not a great name.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.320
 A quick, I'm actually for you, a cockpit normally refers to a hole where the pilot is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.480
 strapped into the aircraft with a full flight like in a small plane or a jet plane.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.200
 A large passenger plane like the ones you were talking about in episode 486 would tend

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.680
 to have a flight deck instead where the pilot can get up and walk around.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.560
 Oh my days.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.720
 Sarah is very self-aware because she finishes the email by saying, "Not interesting, but

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.720
 true."

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.720
 That's so funny.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.920
 That's great.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920
 Yeah.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.360
 That is, yeah, but I rather think if I am on an easy jet flight and I say, "Where is

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.360
 the cockpit?"

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.160
 Everyone's going to know what I'm referring to.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
 I don't know.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160
 Where's the nearest cockpit?

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.840
 I don't know.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.960
 Probably back at Gatwick.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.280
 It's a brilliant, brilliant piece of pedantry.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280
 It is.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280
 It is.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.920
 That feels like a good final question in a quiz that would absolutely, if you had someone

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.480
 like her, we would win or lose because the actual person wouldn't know it themselves.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.480
 Yeah.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.480
 Probably.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.360
 Oh, here's a ... What's the bit where we talk about ... It's not get yourself off the

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360
 hook.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.520
 It's just a kind of inside baseball question about the nature of the show.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.520
 Okay.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.760
 So it's from Tyler Younger, gentleman, and Anna, who is sorely missed.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.760
 Thank you, Tyler.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.640
 I'm listening to your back catalog.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.720
 I've resisted asking this question for months, but the June 16th episode finally pushed me

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.160
 over the edge.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.320
 Here's the question.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.120
 Do you use different versions of wasps, your theme tune, from week to week?

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.120
 I swear, some weeks it's faster, some weeks the drum's more clear, some weeks the pleasant

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.440
 Japanese lady speaks a little more sweetly.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.220
 Is this a user error or do you actually make adjustments that mean the opening sounds different

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.220
 from week to week?

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.320
 Cheers from Wisconsin.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320
 Tyler.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.200
 Well, Tyler, this is something that no one's actually noticed before.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.080
 We have a full band in the office with us every single week.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.160
 And obviously, if you're a musician, this damn knows because he knows a lot about musicians

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.080
 and orchestras and stuff like that.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.760
 It's not always going to be exactly the same every single time.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.080
 And there's been a few episodes where we haven't had the theme tune, and that's because the

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.560
 band have left their sheet music at home and have been completely lost as to what to do.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.580
 We don't know what notes could possibly appear in this.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580
 It's so expensive.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.580
 Yeah.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.580
 It's the reason we're still making this.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.680
 We'd all have retired to the Kamen Islands years ago, but for the expense of having a

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.680
 full house.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.920
 And what you don't see is all the non-- because they're unionized, so they won't play without

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.920
 a triangle.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.520
 There's no triangle, as you know, in the theme tune.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.600
 But every week, we pay for a-- it's about 300 quid.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.840
 We pay the guy with the triangle to just come and go home.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.280
 Absolute nightmare.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.280
 So what was the name of the guy from Wisconsin who asked this question?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280
 Tyler.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280
 Tyler.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280
 No, Tyler.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280
 It's exactly the same every week.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.600
 It's the same recording.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.960
 We only have one recording.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.940
 If Tyler's talking about the interstitials, that's a possibility, right?

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.940
 No, it's the theme tune.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.940
 Yeah, it's the theme tune.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.940
 It's the speaking voice.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.820
 I mean, the theme tune just always starts where it starts.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.740
 We don't dig in halfway through the song.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.020
 Yeah, you need to start at the beginning.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.220
 So that's your ears, Tyler.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.540
 You're hearing something.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.780
 And you've been living a lie.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.060
 Is he listening to the theme tune as it is moving past him at a large speed?

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.620
 And it's the Doppler effect that's causing it.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.620
 Oh, sorry.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.620
 I forgot to read out the PS in Tyler's email.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.680
 He says, "P.S., I only listen to fish when I'm playing it on a flatbed truck moving

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.120
 slowly past my home."

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.120
 That explains it.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120
 Yeah.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.380
 So let's have another email.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.380
 This is one.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.560
 I've got a really interesting one for you now.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560
 Okay.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.480
 So this is Tommy, Tommy Heitkamp.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.480
 Brilliant name.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480
 Andy.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.480
 Yeah.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.820
 Do you even read the emails?

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.660
 I've lost the password to get into the inbox.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.300
 Every week I come up with a few great names and then I come up with some grievances from

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.140
 previous episodes against you guys.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.140
 Oh, dear.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.460
 They're such great names.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.000
 It's incredible, isn't it?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Tommy writes.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Yeah.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Now, this is a great one.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.840
 And Tommy, in fact, this is a time travel episode because Tommy wrote this in November

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840
 2021.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840
 Oh.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.380
 And he never got a reply because whoever was previously in charge of the inbox, I can't

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.300
 remember, her name escapes me for the moment, didn't get back to him.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:58.500
 But maybe she was waiting because it's such a good email and then you'd like, "Okay.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.500
 Hi, Anna."

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.320
 It's what Tommy writes two years ago.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.300
 I was doing a deep dive through the inbox and I found this one.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.460
 Congratulations on your 400th episode.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.380
 It has been an absolute pleasure listening and scratching my curiosity itches with you

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.380
 all over the years.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.900
 Like James, I love a good spreadsheet.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.580
 I think it's me who loves spreadsheets, isn't it?

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.580
 I think you're more of the spreadsheet guy.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.660
 I mean, I don't mind the spreadsheet, but it's not my thing.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.900
 You like big lists of data, though.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.900
 That's to be fair.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.900
 That's for sure.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.900
 Yeah.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.420
 And whereas I don't know how good this one is, I have been tracking each episode to

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.700
 figure out which member of fish delivers the title punchline assigned to each episode

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.380
 to the best of my interpretation.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.380
 How interesting.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.380
 I know.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.700
 I'm going to try and share screen with you.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.220
 I'm a bit worried about this because I pretty much choose that title every week on my own.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.220
 It's one of the few bits where really no one else has any other input.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.620
 So I hope it's not just my joke every week.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.480
 I'm going to share it so you should be able to see that now.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.340
 It has a column for the episode, the year, the title, the punchline.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.340
 Who's present on the show and who delivers that punchline.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.340
 Okay.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.340
 I love that.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.340
 Okay.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.340
 So I'm scrolling down.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.340
 I'm scrolling down.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.340
 Shall I read?

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.340
 Now I've shown you that.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.340
 Shall I read you the rest of his email?

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.340
 Yes, please.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.340
 That's really interesting.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.340
 Okay.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:28.220
 He says, "So I guess my fact is that Andrew Hunter Murray is the funniest member of fish,

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.300
 not because I say so, but because statistics say so."

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.300
 Right.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.300
 Okay.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.300
 If we scroll to the end of this 400 document here, just the first 400 episodes.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.660
 So it's very close.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.900
 It's interesting because what I always think makes a good title is something that's quite

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:53.580
 mundane, something that's not going to scare people away because it's too funny.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:59.860
 It has to be just the right level of boringness.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:05.140
 This is great because I obviously only read this out because the email said I was funny.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.140
 That's good.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.140
 I'm back in my box now.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:13.580
 So for the 400 episodes, I think 140 is Andy, 104 is James, pretty close, Anna 89, Dan 78,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.940
 and then the rest will be guests or sometimes there's no clear, you know, there's no clear

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.260
 person delivering the silly joke.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.300
 I'm actually quite, sorry, Glenda.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.900
 Well, it's just interesting, up until 400, me and Andy are on exactly the same number

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.900
 of episodes.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.900
 That's quite cool.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.900
 It's a cool stat.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.220
 But James has done the most episodes until 400.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.380
 Anyway, so I wrote back to Tommy, and Tommy, by the way, lives in Spearfish, South Dakota.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.380
 Brilliant.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.420
 It's just great.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.380
 He adds a little extra detail to my knowledge.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.500
 No one delivers the punchline about a mean butterfly in episode 204.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.140
 I have listened through it at least five times, so I've left it blank.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.780
 Such a hero.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:57.100
 I'm quite glad, actually, that within kind of an error bar or two, we're quite even.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.180
 I think that's quite nice.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.180
 It's very even.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.740
 And so I wrote back to Tommy, saying, look, this is great, and apologizing for writing

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.740
 back 18 months late in response to this magnificent piece of statistical work.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.620
 And Tommy wrote back, saying, you'll be happy to know I've continued on with the project

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.260
 and we'll have an update for you circa episode 500.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.260
 Oh, amazing.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.260
 Great.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.260
 So it might all change.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260
 That's exciting.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.260
 I know.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.260
 Thank you so much.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.260
 Some of these titles.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.580
 Notice this thing goes, Larry Grayson shut that cock.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.580
 That's right.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.580
 What a name.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.660
 I still remember the moment.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.060
 You know, sometimes you hear the title in the episode, someone says it, and you just

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.220
 know that that's going to be it.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.860
 My favorite one was Stephen Fry's.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:43.580
 If you bring Stevens up here on a search, his was in response to something extremely

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.620
 stupid that I asked him.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.620
 That one?

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.620
 Yeah.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.620
 I think it's a fishman.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.620
 Yeah.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.180
 We were talking about, I think, the ancient Sumerians, and I said, wasn't Stephen, isn't

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.420
 there a myth that a fish man, like half a fish, half a man came out of the ocean and

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.340
 delivered them the whole writing system and like new intelligence and stuff, and he just

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.820
 said to me, there is no such thing as a fish man.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.300
 That's so funny.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.300
 Anyway.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.900
 Oh, Stephen with a V. That's a nice cool spelling for him.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.900
 Okay.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.020
 Let's not pick up Tommy, the magnificent stats guy on one great point.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.020
 No, it's great.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.020
 I mean, that's super cool.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.020
 It's so cool.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.020
 Tommy, thank you so much.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.020
 That's great.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:31.140
 Oh, there is one thing which we got, which I got wrong, and which I think at the time

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.860
 we sort of worried might be picked up on.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.860
 It has been.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.380
 Are we getting towards the end of the show, Andy, by the way?

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.260
 Not even through the opening fifth.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.260
 Okay, good.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.260
 Sorry.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.380
 It's just that you haven't mentioned your books yet, so I was just wondering.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:53.980
 No, what a good point, James, because actually, Pete, no, I don't know, we should try.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.260
 I didn't think we'd have, I thought we maybe could have a non-plug corner today.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.260
 Non-plug corner.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.260
 Okay.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.260
 Yeah.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.380
 So, Peter Munro, who is an unofficial engineering correspondent, you might remember he wrote

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.660
 in about putting the sausage in the exhaust pipe.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:15.380
 He wrote in say, "Dear fishfolk, oh, Andy, oh, Andy, oh, Andy, rivets are not screws."

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.620
 You came, and you just cut them.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.580
 He says, "Rivets are not screws."

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.580
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.580
 Nice.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.320
 I think when Ella was on, we were talking about specifiers.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.860
 I said rivets are a bit like screws, and so, it's quite a long email.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:36.340
 But he points out, rivets are a permanent mechanical fastener, a single-body comprising

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.780
 a domed head and tail, and there are two types.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.740
 They're a hot-formed and cold-formed ...

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.940
 You know what, Andy?

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.140
 I know what a rivet is, and I'm sure you do as well.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.020
 Well, no, I've read this whole email, and I don't.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.100
 I still ... I think I get it.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.220
 I think I do get it.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:59.620
 I just thought that when we were explaining what a rivet is, a screw is a decent analogy.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.740
 You know, they both hold things together.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:08.140
 Well, as Peter says, a screw is a semi-permanent mechanical fastener that can drill its own

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:14.540
 hole and be removed and reused unless you mess up the head, whereas a rivet is a permanent

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.540
 fastener.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.580
 Oh, so it's a bit like a nail.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.580
 Okay, great.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.100
 So, rivets are just nails.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.100
 That's fine.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.860
 That's all we need to know.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.180
 It says, "I didn't actually know this big thing about ... Apparently, with hot-formed

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.660
 rivets, you heat it up loads, and then you put the head of the rivet through the hole,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.660
 right?"

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.340
 It's because you're joining these two sheets of metal or whatever permanently.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.660
 You put the head in through the hole, or the tail in through the hole, and the head's

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.100
 on this side, and then you smash the other side repeatedly with a hammer, so the whole

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.260
 thing ends up like a dumbbell, which I didn't know.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.260
 Okay, right.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.860
 Anyway, he ends with the absolutely sick burn.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:54.460
 You may as well have compared rivets to sewing, which I also think is a good analogy.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.940
 You're joining things.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:04.340
 I do know that after the episode went out, someone edited Ella's Wikipedia page to add

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:10.060
 that she was a rivet expert or something like that, which she then got pointed out to.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.060
 Brilliant.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.060
 So funny.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.060
 We've had a medical one.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.140
 I've put a bit of personal medical information delivered to the inbox, but I haven't yet

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.580
 heard back from the person whether it's okay to say their name, so I'll just say it's

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.580
 a correspondent.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.340
 So it's not about one of us?

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.340
 No.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.340
 No, no.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.340
 Okay, cool.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.340
 Can't that be terrifying?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.340
 Yeah.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.340
 I'm right somewhere.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.780
 And our next email comes from James's doctor.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.780
 Hi, James.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.500
 We're trying to get through to you for weeks through your email.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:45.380
 I thought I'd try this avenue.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.780
 And we've never seen anything like it before, so good news, it's going to be named after

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.780
 you.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:59.620
 No, this is from, I'll say someone in mainland Europe, which I think doesn't narrow it down

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.740
 enough to be specifically identifiable, right?

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.740
 Okay.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.740
 A correspondent says, "In episode 486, you asked the question, is any amount of bleeding

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.740
 good?"

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.820
 Because we're talking about bleeding, I think it was Keats and Byron and byron with black

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.100
 eyes probably died and all this.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:19.140
 Our correspondent writes, "I suffer from a medical condition called hereditary hemochromatosis,

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.580
 the only known treatment is regular bleedings."

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.580
 Interesting.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.860
 Oh, is that right?

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.860
 You're sincere.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.860
 Okay.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.860
 Blah.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.860
 From Blah.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.860
 Yeah.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.260
 Does Scandinavia count as mainland Europe?

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.260
 Yes.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.260
 Does it?

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.260
 Okay.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.260
 Doesn't it?

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.260
 You can't get there.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.260
 You have to go around a bit, don't you?

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.580
 I'm just trying to trick you into giving us some more details about this person.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.580
 That was great.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.580
 Does Gibraltar?

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.580
 Oh.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.580
 Yeah.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.580
 I would say so.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.540
 It's joined on, isn't it?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.540
 It's joined.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.540
 Yeah.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.540
 Anyway.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.340
 Join us for next week's What is Mainland Europe exactly?

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.460
 That's really interesting.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:09.780
 I hope it's not too bad a condition, but I'm glad to have heard about it.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.740
 Clearly, it's at least, I suppose, treatable or it can be slightly managed in that sense,

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.740
 but I don't know anything more about it.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.740
 Yeah.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.580
 And then there's another medical one, which is from our episode with Leven from someone

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:26.020
 called Heather, Heather Carlin from Melbourne, about when Leven had this magnetic stimulation

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.020
 on his brain, which triggered his body to move.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.020
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.820
 It made his fingers move, right?

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.820
 Yeah.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.180
 So Heather studied this as an undergraduate because she was doing neuroscientific stuff

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.020
 and she writes there's something even cooler, right, which is if you, instead of sending

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.020
 that short week signal, which just kind of blasts your arm out or whatever, it just causes

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.580
 a neuron to fire in a cosy erection, neuroscientists have tried using a longer and a stronger

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.300
 signal, which is more like the type of signal your brain actually sends.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.700
 And when they did this, it triggered an entire pattern of behavior.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.940
 So for example, rather than causing a muscle to twitch, it caused the person to reach out

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:03.740
 their arm, grab imaginary food, bring it to their mouth, then close their mouth.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.740
 What?

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740
 Oh my God.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.740
 Isn't that insane?

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.740
 Oh my God.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.740
 That's incredible.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740
 Yeah.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.740
 That might be really useful one day for lazy days when you're like, can we just use that

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.220
 shock to do the movement of getting me out of the house down to the corner store, getting

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.580
 some milk and coming back again.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.500
 You're like, oh, I can't be bothered going to.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.500
 Okay.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.500
 Bye.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.060
 I'll see you, I guess.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.060
 Bye.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.060
 Wow.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.900
 That is really quite something.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.900
 So, oh wow.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.860
 And apparently it's changing the whole, she goes on, it's kind of like created a debate

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:41.540
 about how the brain is mapped because previously it was thought that moving the right hand

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.460
 caused a particular bit of the motor cortex to activate every time, but actually we have

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.700
 mapped patterns of behavior and sensation.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.180
 Can you override it?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.180
 No idea.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.660
 Because I mean, that feels like, you know, there's sinister options there for torture,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.660
 isn't there?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.940
 If you just sort of like feed someone to death and they just literally can't stop doing

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.940
 the movement of a.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.180
 Why are you hitting yourself?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.180
 Why are you hitting yourself?

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.180
 Yeah.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.180
 Why are you hitting yourself?

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.180
 Exactly.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.180
 Yeah.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.180
 James is right.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.180
 That's a weird torture method that you've picked for someone.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.660
 You're picking the only one that you'd mentioned.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.660
 Yeah.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.060
 It's not like I just created a new one and it was that.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.180
 I was just thinking of all the wonderful ways it could be used, you know, like people

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.940
 who are unable to move their own arms, maybe we can, you know, stimulate their brain to

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.540
 help them to do things that they were unable to do before.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.820
 But Dan, you went straight for torture.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.980
 So sinister.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.980
 So telling.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.980
 It's not.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.980
 I'm looking out.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.340
 I'm looking out for the people of the world who might, you know, be finding themselves

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.220
 just punching themselves in the cock for 24 hours because there's a spy outside with

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.420
 a brainwave machine.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.420
 Yeah.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.100
 That's a good James Bond plot.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.940
 The Malawian ambassador mysteriously died yesterday after punching himself in the cock

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.940
 for a day.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.260
 Bond, we need you on the case.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.260
 Wow.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.260
 Oh my God.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.260
 I know.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.500
 Anyway, Heather, thank you so much.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.780
 What an amazing, amazing bit of bonus info.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.860
 That's incredible.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.860
 Yeah.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.660
 That's the, that's the extra soup song of the week.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.660
 Nice.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.660
 Lovely.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.940
 I've just got one last tiny bit of bonus info.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.580
 There's really a nice email from a guy called Ben Harding because we talked about official

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.580
 secrets, didn't we?

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.620
 And we talked about, was it all these people working on Spitfires and who kept it secret

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.620
 from each other?

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.620
 Yeah.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.620
 Like a married couple.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.620
 I think that was the headline fact.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.620
 That's right.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:38.460
 And Ben writes, "We were visiting Hughenden Manor in Oxford in 2005 and the basement

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.780
 we used for photographic reconnaissance interpretation in the war and it's now recreated

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.980
 as an exhibit.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.420
 We were being shown round by the guide along with a couple we didn't know.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:53.340
 There was a photo of a wren, you know, the sort of, what's it called, a stand for, sort

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.740
 of women's, yeah, women's military service, I can't remember exactly what it stands for.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.460
 There was a photo of a wren looking up from a stereoscopic viewer and the woman I was on

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.580
 the tour with suddenly said, "That's my mum."

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.580
 No.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.080
 And the guide asked if she was still alive and asked if she would speak to the museum

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.380
 to get her story.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:14.580
 So they rang this woman's mum and the woman there said, "Mum, there's a photo of you

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.140
 here using a wild spectroscope.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.460
 You said you were a typist and the mum said, "I can't talk about that" and put the phone

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.460
 down.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.460
 And that was in 2005.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.460
 Wow.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.460
 Oh my goodness.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.460
 Is that great?

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.180
 It's incredible.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.320
 It's so cool that she's still keeping the secrets.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.740
 I think that just shows real dedication to the cause, doesn't it?

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.740
 It's just brilliant.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.740
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.260
 Anyway, it's a nice little bonus thing.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.900
 I was just thinking, I wonder what secret, you know, how big is her secret as the typist

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.420
 that she could, what, is it, would it bring down a government or is it just like, no,

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.420
 just out of principle?

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.420
 It's not seen that way, does it?

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.420
 Yeah.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:58.220
 I went to KGB Museum a few weeks ago, a month ago, and they still had loads of the stuff

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.220
 there.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.260
 And it's a guided tour, so you're only supposed to go in certain parts, but I had my one-year-old

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.300
 with me and she was just running around everywhere.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.420
 So I was just going into places that I probably wasn't supposed to go.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.620
 But it still didn't feel like there was going to be anything there that I'd be able to use

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.860
 to bring down the Soviet Union.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.860
 No.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.980
 And that's only like 30 years ago or 40 years ago.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.380
 And it just feels like those kind of secrets can't still be useful.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.020
 Where's the KGB Museum?

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:31.340
 The one that I went to was in Tallinn, in Estonia.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.340
 Estonia.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.340
 Nice.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:39.100
 Yeah, it feels like the Soviet Union has sort of stopped existing, hasn't it?

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.340
 Yeah, but also, so has World War II is kind of my point.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.340
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.340
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.340
 Yeah.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:50.060
 I guess the big question everyone's asking is Estonia, mainland Europe?

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:56.420
 Tune in next time to drop us a line to find out if Estonia is in mainland Europe.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:06.180
 Despite the fact that it blatantly is, it's just Baltic, it's a slightly further up.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:11.100
 Is there anywhere that is borderline, whether it's mainland Europe or not?

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.620
 The middle of Istanbul, isn't that built on the literally on the divide between Europe

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.620
 and Asia?

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.620
 So yeah.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.380
 There's a bridge over the Bosphorus maybe.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.420
 So that bridge, mainland Europe, unclear.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.420
 Brilliant.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.420
 Nice.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.100
 Shall I say bye?

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.100
 Yeah.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.660
 Bye, everybody.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.660
 Bye.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.660
 I thought I'd just do it like slower.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.500
 That's how we used to wrap up the city show.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500
 Bye-bye, everybody.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.500
 Bye-bye.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.500
 It was very comforting.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.500
 That's very nice.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.500
 Yeah.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.500
 Well, thank you for listening, everybody.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:52.180

 You wrote to us a year and a half ago, maybe longer ago, and you think we never replied.

 We're getting around to you.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.980
 So keep on sending in the emails we love hearing from you.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.300

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.300
