2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,600
 Hi!

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,360
 Hi Andy!

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,160
 Hey Andy!

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,400
 Hi everybody, welcome to Drop As A Line.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,240
 You club fishers out there.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,960
 Hope you're all having a lovely time.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,920
 Welcome to this bit of club fish, which is our...

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,080
 It's our correspondence section.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,840
 It's the Traveling Post Office, you know?

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,880
 It's just the correspondence bit.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,440
 I can't think of a metaphor today.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,520
 I went to the world's smallest, not the world's,

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,520
 America's smallest post office when I was in America.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,280
 Oh yeah?

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,720
 It was closed.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,000
 Oh.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,680
 How tiny is it?

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,400
 It was really small, but it was really next to,

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,120
 it was right next to the place where I bought you that yeti mug.

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
 Oh!

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,960
 Yeah, yeah, I love that skunk ape.

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,200
 That's a skunk ape bug.

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,160
 And it's the one that we used as a basis for our

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,440
 'No Such Things as a Fish' mugs, which are very different

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,400
 and certainly not a rip-off of whatever they were.

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,040
 I mean, so different they are.

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,440
 It's a different jurisdiction.

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
 It's a different jurisdiction.

30
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
 There's no...

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
 I don't think we have an extradition treaty with America, do we?

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
 I don't know.

33
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
 Probably not.

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
 But that's good.

35
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,640
 I genuinely paused on saying that because I was worried about

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,760
 the skunk ape's lawyers listening to this.

37
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,400
 I want to see that lawsuit.

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,080
 Skunk ape versus No Such Things as a Fish.

39
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,040
 Anyway, are we supposed to be doing the people's emails and stuff?

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,680
 I think that's not this week.

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
 Let's just do...

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,360
 Let's drop each other a line, you know?

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,760
 Let's just get back in touch with each other.

44
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,600
 All right, let's do some emails.

45
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
 Okay.

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,880
 Ethan Klopfenstein writes, "Yes, what an opening name."

47
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,320
 Just the best names we get.

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
 Yeah.

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
 Thank you, Ethan.

50
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,280
 "Your guest on the last episode, No Such Things as a Short Dalek, made a comment

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,040
 about American cheese being different kinds of cheeses."

52
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
 Okay.

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
 Yeah.

54
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,400
 Ethan, Ethan has a point here.

55
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,200
 Ethan says, "American cheese isn't even cheese."

56
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
 What?

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 "It contains less than 51% cheese curds per slice and does not meet the FDA standards

58
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
 for cheese.

59
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,760
 This is obviously an American administration and a classification maybe different in different

60
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
 parts of the world."

61
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,800
 I feel like we've done this on Fish.

62
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
 I feel like...

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
 Yeah, I feel like we've said that American cheese is mostly not cheese.

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,520
 It doesn't pass the test of cheese.

65
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
 Is that right?

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,760
 I remember that we said that Pringles aren't potato chips because they don't contain enough

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
 potato.

68
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
 They're starch.

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
 Starch products.

70
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,240
 Because I remember what this discussion was about, Andy, was that in Japan they have European

71
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:40,200
 cheese-flavored Kit Kats and you were quite stringent in your opinion that there's no

72
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,040
 such thing as European cheese.

73
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
 Yeah.

74
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,440
 I think that is an insane classification.

75
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,240
 You can't even say French cheese and there are many other countries other than France

76
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
 in Europe.

77
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
 Yeah.

78
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
 Oh, my goodness.

79
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,120
 No, it's a crazy thing to say.

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
 Yeah.

81
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,320
 Here's a thing and I don't know who of us is being picked up on this because I actually

82
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,320
 can't remember who said it, but Hamza Alfarane writes, "Love the podcast, thrilled that you're

83
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,680
 talking about Jordan, Jordan the country.

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,960
 Just wanted to bring you to your attention that Mansaf is not actually made from camel's

85
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,120
 milk but goat yoghurt."

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
 Oh.

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,960
 And then he says, "In fact it is made out of something called Jameed, which looks like

88
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,120
 a smooth white rock, but Jameed is dehydrated goat's milk yoghurt."

89
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,920
 How interesting because I think it was Sophie Duker who just been to Jordan and she tried

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,320
 it and so she has obviously been miss-sold whatever it was.

91
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
 Yeah.

92
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,480
 So, thank you Hamza and we'll never have Sophie on the show again.

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
 That's a lifetime.

94
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
 Oh, no.

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
 Yeah, sorry.

96
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
 There's...

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
 Wait a minute.

98
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
 Wait a minute.

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 Wait a minute.

100
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,000
 How come Sophie makes one possible mistake?

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,040
 I mean, we're taking Hamza's word for it here and she is immediately black-balled and yet

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,840
 some people on this call because we're doing this on Zoom by the way may have made more

103
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,480
 than one mistake and are still in the show.

104
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,320
 Who could he be talking about?

105
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
 Yeah.

106
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
 Inaccurate Andy.

107
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
 That's fair.

108
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,360
 It's Anna who's here but not talking.

109
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:28,200
 Well, here's something I got an actual lead on from Sarah Sidgwick, not a great name.

110
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,320
 A quick, I'm actually for you, a cockpit normally refers to a hole where the pilot is

111
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,480
 strapped into the aircraft with a full flight like in a small plane or a jet plane.

112
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,200
 A large passenger plane like the ones you were talking about in episode 486 would tend

113
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,680
 to have a flight deck instead where the pilot can get up and walk around.

114
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,560
 Oh my days.

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,720
 Sarah is very self-aware because she finishes the email by saying, "Not interesting, but

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
 true."

117
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
 That's so funny.

118
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,920
 That's great.

119
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
 Yeah.

120
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:05,360
 That is, yeah, but I rather think if I am on an easy jet flight and I say, "Where is

121
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
 the cockpit?"

122
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,160
 Everyone's going to know what I'm referring to.

123
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
 I don't know.

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
 Where's the nearest cockpit?

125
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,840
 I don't know.

126
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,960
 Probably back at Gatwick.

127
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,280
 It's a brilliant, brilliant piece of pedantry.

128
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
 It is.

129
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
 It is.

130
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,920
 That feels like a good final question in a quiz that would absolutely, if you had someone

131
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,480
 like her, we would win or lose because the actual person wouldn't know it themselves.

132
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
 Yeah.

133
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 Probably.

134
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,360
 Oh, here's a ... What's the bit where we talk about ... It's not get yourself off the

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
 hook.

136
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,520
 It's just a kind of inside baseball question about the nature of the show.

137
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
 Okay.

138
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,760
 So it's from Tyler Younger, gentleman, and Anna, who is sorely missed.

139
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
 Thank you, Tyler.

140
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,640
 I'm listening to your back catalog.

141
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,720
 I've resisted asking this question for months, but the June 16th episode finally pushed me

142
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
 over the edge.

143
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,320
 Here's the question.

144
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,120
 Do you use different versions of wasps, your theme tune, from week to week?

145
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,120
 I swear, some weeks it's faster, some weeks the drum's more clear, some weeks the pleasant

146
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,440
 Japanese lady speaks a little more sweetly.

147
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,220
 Is this a user error or do you actually make adjustments that mean the opening sounds different

148
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,220
 from week to week?

149
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,320
 Cheers from Wisconsin.

150
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
 Tyler.

151
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,200
 Well, Tyler, this is something that no one's actually noticed before.

152
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,080
 We have a full band in the office with us every single week.

153
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,160
 And obviously, if you're a musician, this damn knows because he knows a lot about musicians

154
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
 and orchestras and stuff like that.

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,760
 It's not always going to be exactly the same every single time.

156
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,080
 And there's been a few episodes where we haven't had the theme tune, and that's because the

157
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,560
 band have left their sheet music at home and have been completely lost as to what to do.

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,580
 We don't know what notes could possibly appear in this.

159
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
 It's so expensive.

160
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,580
 Yeah.

161
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,580
 It's the reason we're still making this.

162
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,680
 We'd all have retired to the Kamen Islands years ago, but for the expense of having a

163
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
 full house.

164
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,920
 And what you don't see is all the non-- because they're unionized, so they won't play without

165
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
 a triangle.

166
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,520
 There's no triangle, as you know, in the theme tune.

167
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,600
 But every week, we pay for a-- it's about 300 quid.

168
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,840
 We pay the guy with the triangle to just come and go home.

169
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
 Absolute nightmare.

170
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,280
 So what was the name of the guy from Wisconsin who asked this question?

171
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
 Tyler.

172
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
 Tyler.

173
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
 No, Tyler.

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
 It's exactly the same every week.

175
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,600
 It's the same recording.

176
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,960
 We only have one recording.

177
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,940
 If Tyler's talking about the interstitials, that's a possibility, right?

178
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
 No, it's the theme tune.

179
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,940
 Yeah, it's the theme tune.

180
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
 It's the speaking voice.

181
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,820
 I mean, the theme tune just always starts where it starts.

182
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,740
 We don't dig in halfway through the song.

183
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,020
 Yeah, you need to start at the beginning.

184
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,220
 So that's your ears, Tyler.

185
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,540
 You're hearing something.

186
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,780
 And you've been living a lie.

187
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,060
 Is he listening to the theme tune as it is moving past him at a large speed?

188
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,620
 And it's the Doppler effect that's causing it.

189
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
 Oh, sorry.

190
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
 I forgot to read out the PS in Tyler's email.

191
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,680
 He says, "P.S., I only listen to fish when I'm playing it on a flatbed truck moving

192
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,120
 slowly past my home."

193
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
 That explains it.

194
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
 Yeah.

195
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,380
 So let's have another email.

196
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,380
 This is one.

197
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,560
 I've got a really interesting one for you now.

198
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
 Okay.

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,480
 So this is Tommy, Tommy Heitkamp.

200
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
 Brilliant name.

201
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
 Andy.

202
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
 Yeah.

203
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,820
 Do you even read the emails?

204
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,660
 I've lost the password to get into the inbox.

205
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,300
 Every week I come up with a few great names and then I come up with some grievances from

206
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,140
 previous episodes against you guys.

207
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,140
 Oh, dear.

208
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,460
 They're such great names.

209
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,000
 It's incredible, isn't it?

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Tommy writes.

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Yeah.

212
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Now, this is a great one.

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,840
 And Tommy, in fact, this is a time travel episode because Tommy wrote this in November

214
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
 2021.

215
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
 Oh.

216
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,380
 And he never got a reply because whoever was previously in charge of the inbox, I can't

217
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,300
 remember, her name escapes me for the moment, didn't get back to him.

218
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,500
 But maybe she was waiting because it's such a good email and then you'd like, "Okay.

219
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
 Hi, Anna."

220
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,320
 It's what Tommy writes two years ago.

221
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,300
 I was doing a deep dive through the inbox and I found this one.

222
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,460
 Congratulations on your 400th episode.

223
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,380
 It has been an absolute pleasure listening and scratching my curiosity itches with you

224
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,380
 all over the years.

225
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,900
 Like James, I love a good spreadsheet.

226
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,580
 I think it's me who loves spreadsheets, isn't it?

227
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,580
 I think you're more of the spreadsheet guy.

228
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,660
 I mean, I don't mind the spreadsheet, but it's not my thing.

229
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,900
 You like big lists of data, though.

230
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
 That's to be fair.

231
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
 That's for sure.

232
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
 Yeah.

233
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,420
 And whereas I don't know how good this one is, I have been tracking each episode to

234
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,700
 figure out which member of fish delivers the title punchline assigned to each episode

235
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,380
 to the best of my interpretation.

236
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
 How interesting.

237
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,380
 I know.

238
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,700
 I'm going to try and share screen with you.

239
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,220
 I'm a bit worried about this because I pretty much choose that title every week on my own.

240
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,220
 It's one of the few bits where really no one else has any other input.

241
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,620
 So I hope it's not just my joke every week.

242
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,480
 I'm going to share it so you should be able to see that now.

243
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,340
 It has a column for the episode, the year, the title, the punchline.

244
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,340
 Who's present on the show and who delivers that punchline.

245
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
 Okay.

246
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,340
 I love that.

247
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
 Okay.

248
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
 So I'm scrolling down.

249
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
 I'm scrolling down.

250
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
 Shall I read?

251
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,340
 Now I've shown you that.

252
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,340
 Shall I read you the rest of his email?

253
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
 Yes, please.

254
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,340
 That's really interesting.

255
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,340
 Okay.

256
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:28,220
 He says, "So I guess my fact is that Andrew Hunter Murray is the funniest member of fish,

257
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,300
 not because I say so, but because statistics say so."

258
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
 Right.

259
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
 Okay.

260
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,300
 If we scroll to the end of this 400 document here, just the first 400 episodes.

261
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,660
 So it's very close.

262
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,900
 It's interesting because what I always think makes a good title is something that's quite

263
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:53,580
 mundane, something that's not going to scare people away because it's too funny.

264
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,860
 It has to be just the right level of boringness.

265
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,140
 This is great because I obviously only read this out because the email said I was funny.

266
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
 That's good.

267
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
 I'm back in my box now.

268
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:13,580
 So for the 400 episodes, I think 140 is Andy, 104 is James, pretty close, Anna 89, Dan 78,

269
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,940
 and then the rest will be guests or sometimes there's no clear, you know, there's no clear

270
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,260
 person delivering the silly joke.

271
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,300
 I'm actually quite, sorry, Glenda.

272
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,900
 Well, it's just interesting, up until 400, me and Andy are on exactly the same number

273
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
 of episodes.

274
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
 That's quite cool.

275
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
 It's a cool stat.

276
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
 Oh, yeah.

277
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,220
 But James has done the most episodes until 400.

278
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,380
 Anyway, so I wrote back to Tommy, and Tommy, by the way, lives in Spearfish, South Dakota.

279
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,380
 Brilliant.

280
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,420
 It's just great.

281
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,380
 He adds a little extra detail to my knowledge.

282
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,500
 No one delivers the punchline about a mean butterfly in episode 204.

283
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,140
 I have listened through it at least five times, so I've left it blank.

284
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,780
 Such a hero.

285
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:57,100
 I'm quite glad, actually, that within kind of an error bar or two, we're quite even.

286
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,180
 I think that's quite nice.

287
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
 It's very even.

288
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,740
 And so I wrote back to Tommy, saying, look, this is great, and apologizing for writing

289
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,740
 back 18 months late in response to this magnificent piece of statistical work.

290
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,620
 And Tommy wrote back, saying, you'll be happy to know I've continued on with the project

291
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,260
 and we'll have an update for you circa episode 500.

292
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
 Oh, amazing.

293
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
 Great.

294
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
 So it might all change.

295
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
 That's exciting.

296
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
 I know.

297
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
 Thank you so much.

298
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,260
 Some of these titles.

299
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,580
 Notice this thing goes, Larry Grayson shut that cock.

300
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,580
 That's right.

301
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,580
 What a name.

302
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,660
 I still remember the moment.

303
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,060
 You know, sometimes you hear the title in the episode, someone says it, and you just

304
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,220
 know that that's going to be it.

305
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,860
 My favorite one was Stephen Fry's.

306
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:43,580
 If you bring Stevens up here on a search, his was in response to something extremely

307
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,620
 stupid that I asked him.

308
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
 That one?

309
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
 Yeah.

310
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620
 I think it's a fishman.

311
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
 Yeah.

312
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,180
 We were talking about, I think, the ancient Sumerians, and I said, wasn't Stephen, isn't

313
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,420
 there a myth that a fish man, like half a fish, half a man came out of the ocean and

314
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,340
 delivered them the whole writing system and like new intelligence and stuff, and he just

315
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,820
 said to me, there is no such thing as a fish man.

316
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,300
 That's so funny.

317
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,300
 Anyway.

318
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,900
 Oh, Stephen with a V. That's a nice cool spelling for him.

319
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
 Okay.

320
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,020
 Let's not pick up Tommy, the magnificent stats guy on one great point.

321
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
 No, it's great.

322
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020
 I mean, that's super cool.

323
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
 It's so cool.

324
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
 Tommy, thank you so much.

325
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
 That's great.

326
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:31,140
 Oh, there is one thing which we got, which I got wrong, and which I think at the time

327
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,860
 we sort of worried might be picked up on.

328
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
 It has been.

329
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,380
 Are we getting towards the end of the show, Andy, by the way?

330
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,260
 Not even through the opening fifth.

331
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
 Okay, good.

332
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,260
 Sorry.

333
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,380
 It's just that you haven't mentioned your books yet, so I was just wondering.

334
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:53,980
 No, what a good point, James, because actually, Pete, no, I don't know, we should try.

335
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,260
 I didn't think we'd have, I thought we maybe could have a non-plug corner today.

336
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
 Non-plug corner.

337
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
 Okay.

338
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
 Yeah.

339
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,380
 So, Peter Munro, who is an unofficial engineering correspondent, you might remember he wrote

340
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,660
 in about putting the sausage in the exhaust pipe.

341
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:15,380
 He wrote in say, "Dear fishfolk, oh, Andy, oh, Andy, oh, Andy, rivets are not screws."

342
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,620
 You came, and you just cut them.

343
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,580
 He says, "Rivets are not screws."

344
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
 Oh, yeah.

345
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
 Nice.

346
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,320
 I think when Ella was on, we were talking about specifiers.

347
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,860
 I said rivets are a bit like screws, and so, it's quite a long email.

348
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,340
 But he points out, rivets are a permanent mechanical fastener, a single-body comprising

349
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,780
 a domed head and tail, and there are two types.

350
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,740
 They're a hot-formed and cold-formed ...

351
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,940
 You know what, Andy?

352
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,140
 I know what a rivet is, and I'm sure you do as well.

353
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,020
 Well, no, I've read this whole email, and I don't.

354
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,100
 I still ... I think I get it.

355
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,220
 I think I do get it.

356
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:59,620
 I just thought that when we were explaining what a rivet is, a screw is a decent analogy.

357
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,740
 You know, they both hold things together.

358
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,140
 Well, as Peter says, a screw is a semi-permanent mechanical fastener that can drill its own

359
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,540
 hole and be removed and reused unless you mess up the head, whereas a rivet is a permanent

360
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
 fastener.

361
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,580
 Oh, so it's a bit like a nail.

362
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
 Okay, great.

363
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,100
 So, rivets are just nails.

364
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
 That's fine.

365
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,860
 That's all we need to know.

366
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,180
 It says, "I didn't actually know this big thing about ... Apparently, with hot-formed

367
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,660
 rivets, you heat it up loads, and then you put the head of the rivet through the hole,

368
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
 right?"

369
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,340
 It's because you're joining these two sheets of metal or whatever permanently.

370
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,660
 You put the head in through the hole, or the tail in through the hole, and the head's

371
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,100
 on this side, and then you smash the other side repeatedly with a hammer, so the whole

372
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,260
 thing ends up like a dumbbell, which I didn't know.

373
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,260
 Okay, right.

374
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,860
 Anyway, he ends with the absolutely sick burn.

375
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,460
 You may as well have compared rivets to sewing, which I also think is a good analogy.

376
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,940
 You're joining things.

377
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:04,340
 I do know that after the episode went out, someone edited Ella's Wikipedia page to add

378
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,060
 that she was a rivet expert or something like that, which she then got pointed out to.

379
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
 Brilliant.

380
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
 So funny.

381
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,060
 We've had a medical one.

382
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,140
 I've put a bit of personal medical information delivered to the inbox, but I haven't yet

383
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,580
 heard back from the person whether it's okay to say their name, so I'll just say it's

384
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
 a correspondent.

385
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,340
 So it's not about one of us?

386
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
 No.

387
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
 No, no.

388
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,340
 Okay, cool.

389
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
 Can't that be terrifying?

390
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
 Yeah.

391
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
 I'm right somewhere.

392
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,780
 And our next email comes from James's doctor.

393
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,780
 Hi, James.

394
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,500
 We're trying to get through to you for weeks through your email.

395
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,380
 I thought I'd try this avenue.

396
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,780
 And we've never seen anything like it before, so good news, it's going to be named after

397
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,780
 you.

398
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:59,620
 No, this is from, I'll say someone in mainland Europe, which I think doesn't narrow it down

399
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,740
 enough to be specifically identifiable, right?

400
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
 Okay.

401
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,740
 A correspondent says, "In episode 486, you asked the question, is any amount of bleeding

402
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
 good?"

403
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,820
 Because we're talking about bleeding, I think it was Keats and Byron and byron with black

404
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,100
 eyes probably died and all this.

405
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,140
 Our correspondent writes, "I suffer from a medical condition called hereditary hemochromatosis,

406
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,580
 the only known treatment is regular bleedings."

407
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,580
 Interesting.

408
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,860
 Oh, is that right?

409
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
 You're sincere.

410
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
 Okay.

411
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
 Blah.

412
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
 From Blah.

413
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
 Yeah.

414
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,260
 Does Scandinavia count as mainland Europe?

415
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,260
 Yes.

416
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,260
 Does it?

417
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,260
 Okay.

418
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,260
 Doesn't it?

419
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
 You can't get there.

420
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
 You have to go around a bit, don't you?

421
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,580
 I'm just trying to trick you into giving us some more details about this person.

422
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
 That was great.

423
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,580
 Does Gibraltar?

424
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,580
 Oh.

425
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
 Yeah.

426
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,580
 I would say so.

427
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,540
 It's joined on, isn't it?

428
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
 It's joined.

429
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
 Yeah.

430
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
 Anyway.

431
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,340
 Join us for next week's What is Mainland Europe exactly?

432
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,460
 That's really interesting.

433
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,780
 I hope it's not too bad a condition, but I'm glad to have heard about it.

434
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,740
 Clearly, it's at least, I suppose, treatable or it can be slightly managed in that sense,

435
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
 but I don't know anything more about it.

436
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
 Yeah.

437
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,580
 And then there's another medical one, which is from our episode with Leven from someone

438
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,020
 called Heather, Heather Carlin from Melbourne, about when Leven had this magnetic stimulation

439
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
 on his brain, which triggered his body to move.

440
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
 Oh, yeah.

441
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,820
 It made his fingers move, right?

442
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
 Yeah.

443
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,180
 So Heather studied this as an undergraduate because she was doing neuroscientific stuff

444
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,020
 and she writes there's something even cooler, right, which is if you, instead of sending

445
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,020
 that short week signal, which just kind of blasts your arm out or whatever, it just causes

446
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,580
 a neuron to fire in a cosy erection, neuroscientists have tried using a longer and a stronger

447
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,300
 signal, which is more like the type of signal your brain actually sends.

448
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,700
 And when they did this, it triggered an entire pattern of behavior.

449
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,940
 So for example, rather than causing a muscle to twitch, it caused the person to reach out

450
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,740
 their arm, grab imaginary food, bring it to their mouth, then close their mouth.

451
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
 What?

452
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
 Oh my God.

453
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
 Isn't that insane?

454
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
 Oh my God.

455
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
 That's incredible.

456
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
 Yeah.

457
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,740
 That might be really useful one day for lazy days when you're like, can we just use that

458
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,220
 shock to do the movement of getting me out of the house down to the corner store, getting

459
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,580
 some milk and coming back again.

460
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,500
 You're like, oh, I can't be bothered going to.

461
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 Okay.

462
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 Bye.

463
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,060
 I'll see you, I guess.

464
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
 Bye.

465
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
 Wow.

466
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,900
 That is really quite something.

467
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
 So, oh wow.

468
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,860
 And apparently it's changing the whole, she goes on, it's kind of like created a debate

469
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,540
 about how the brain is mapped because previously it was thought that moving the right hand

470
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:46,460
 caused a particular bit of the motor cortex to activate every time, but actually we have

471
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,700
 mapped patterns of behavior and sensation.

472
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,180
 Can you override it?

473
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
 No idea.

474
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,660
 Because I mean, that feels like, you know, there's sinister options there for torture,

475
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
 isn't there?

476
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,940
 If you just sort of like feed someone to death and they just literally can't stop doing

477
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
 the movement of a.

478
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,180
 Why are you hitting yourself?

479
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,180
 Why are you hitting yourself?

480
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
 Yeah.

481
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
 Why are you hitting yourself?

482
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,180
 Exactly.

483
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,180
 Yeah.

484
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,180
 James is right.

485
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,180
 That's a weird torture method that you've picked for someone.

486
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,660
 You're picking the only one that you'd mentioned.

487
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
 Yeah.

488
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,060
 It's not like I just created a new one and it was that.

489
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,180
 I was just thinking of all the wonderful ways it could be used, you know, like people

490
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,940
 who are unable to move their own arms, maybe we can, you know, stimulate their brain to

491
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,540
 help them to do things that they were unable to do before.

492
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,820
 But Dan, you went straight for torture.

493
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,980
 So sinister.

494
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
 So telling.

495
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
 It's not.

496
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
 I'm looking out.

497
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,340
 I'm looking out for the people of the world who might, you know, be finding themselves

498
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,220
 just punching themselves in the cock for 24 hours because there's a spy outside with

499
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,420
 a brainwave machine.

500
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
 Yeah.

501
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,100
 That's a good James Bond plot.

502
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,940
 The Malawian ambassador mysteriously died yesterday after punching himself in the cock

503
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
 for a day.

504
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,260
 Bond, we need you on the case.

505
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,260
 Wow.

506
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
 Oh my God.

507
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
 I know.

508
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,500
 Anyway, Heather, thank you so much.

509
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,780
 What an amazing, amazing bit of bonus info.

510
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,860
 That's incredible.

511
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,860
 Yeah.

512
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,660
 That's the, that's the extra soup song of the week.

513
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,660
 Nice.

514
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,660
 Lovely.

515
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,940
 I've just got one last tiny bit of bonus info.

516
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,580
 There's really a nice email from a guy called Ben Harding because we talked about official

517
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,580
 secrets, didn't we?

518
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,620
 And we talked about, was it all these people working on Spitfires and who kept it secret

519
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,620
 from each other?

520
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
 Yeah.

521
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,620
 Like a married couple.

522
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
 I think that was the headline fact.

523
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
 That's right.

524
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,460
 And Ben writes, "We were visiting Hughenden Manor in Oxford in 2005 and the basement

525
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,780
 we used for photographic reconnaissance interpretation in the war and it's now recreated

526
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,980
 as an exhibit.

527
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,420
 We were being shown round by the guide along with a couple we didn't know.

528
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,340
 There was a photo of a wren, you know, the sort of, what's it called, a stand for, sort

529
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,740
 of women's, yeah, women's military service, I can't remember exactly what it stands for.

530
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,460
 There was a photo of a wren looking up from a stereoscopic viewer and the woman I was on

531
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,580
 the tour with suddenly said, "That's my mum."

532
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
 No.

533
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,080
 And the guide asked if she was still alive and asked if she would speak to the museum

534
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,380
 to get her story.

535
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,580
 So they rang this woman's mum and the woman there said, "Mum, there's a photo of you

536
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,140
 here using a wild spectroscope.

537
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,460
 You said you were a typist and the mum said, "I can't talk about that" and put the phone

538
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
 down.

539
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
 And that was in 2005.

540
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
 Wow.

541
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
 Oh my goodness.

542
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,460
 Is that great?

543
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,180
 It's incredible.

544
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,320
 It's so cool that she's still keeping the secrets.

545
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,740
 I think that just shows real dedication to the cause, doesn't it?

546
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
 It's just brilliant.

547
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
 Oh, yeah.

548
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,260
 Anyway, it's a nice little bonus thing.

549
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,900
 I was just thinking, I wonder what secret, you know, how big is her secret as the typist

551
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,420
 that she could, what, is it, would it bring down a government or is it just like, no,

552
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
 just out of principle?

553
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
 It's not seen that way, does it?

554
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
 Yeah.

555
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:58,220
 I went to KGB Museum a few weeks ago, a month ago, and they still had loads of the stuff

556
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,220
 there.

557
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,260
 And it's a guided tour, so you're only supposed to go in certain parts, but I had my one-year-old

558
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,300
 with me and she was just running around everywhere.

559
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,420
 So I was just going into places that I probably wasn't supposed to go.

560
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,620
 But it still didn't feel like there was going to be anything there that I'd be able to use

561
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,860
 to bring down the Soviet Union.

562
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
 No.

563
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,980
 And that's only like 30 years ago or 40 years ago.

564
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,380
 And it just feels like those kind of secrets can't still be useful.

565
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,020
 Where's the KGB Museum?

566
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,340
 The one that I went to was in Tallinn, in Estonia.

567
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,340
 Estonia.

568
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
 Nice.

569
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:39,100
 Yeah, it feels like the Soviet Union has sort of stopped existing, hasn't it?

570
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,340
 Yeah, but also, so has World War II is kind of my point.

571
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
 Yeah, absolutely.

572
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
 Yeah, yeah.

573
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
 Yeah.

574
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,060
 I guess the big question everyone's asking is Estonia, mainland Europe?

575
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:56,420
 Tune in next time to drop us a line to find out if Estonia is in mainland Europe.

576
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:06,180
 Despite the fact that it blatantly is, it's just Baltic, it's a slightly further up.

577
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,100
 Is there anywhere that is borderline, whether it's mainland Europe or not?

578
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,620
 The middle of Istanbul, isn't that built on the literally on the divide between Europe

579
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
 and Asia?

580
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,620
 So yeah.

581
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,380
 There's a bridge over the Bosphorus maybe.

582
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,420
 So that bridge, mainland Europe, unclear.

583
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
 Brilliant.

584
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
 Nice.

585
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,100
 Shall I say bye?

586
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
 Yeah.

587
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,660
 Bye, everybody.

588
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
 Bye.

589
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,660
 I thought I'd just do it like slower.

590
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,500
 That's how we used to wrap up the city show.

591
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
 Bye-bye, everybody.

592
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 Bye-bye.

593
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
 It was very comforting.

594
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
 That's very nice.

595
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 Yeah.

596
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 Well, thank you for listening, everybody.

 Bye.

614
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,880
 (upbeat music)
