 [music]

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hey everybody, Dan and Andy here.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.520
 Just wanted to let you know our special guest on this week's fish

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.960
 is none other than old friend of the podcast,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.000
 your friend of mine, Alex Bell.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 That's right, Alex has returned.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.880
 I mean he hasn't been on for ages,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.080
 but he has been there in the background the whole time.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.680
 Anytime you hear a song or a noise.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.480
 Shadowy, the spider master.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.440
 But now he's back, he's funnier than ever.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.960
 We can't wait for you to hear it.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.080
 He's brilliant, it's gonna be great.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.520
 So now I guess with no further ado,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.360
 let's get on with the only podcast

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.480
 any of us has ever made or will ever make.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.840
 Right Dan?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.640
 Ah, actually I've got a bit of news.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.000
 What?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.520
 Yeah, I don't want this to be a shock,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.000
 but I've actually launched a new podcast.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.800
 Alright, what's it called?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.440
 It's called We Can Be Weirdos.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 Oh, I see, and I guess it's just about solid facts though, right?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.320
 It's about stuff with a strong, evidential base.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.240
 Well, let's ignore that question quickly

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.880
 and focus on what the show is about.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.160
 So it's a weekly show where I sit down with someone remarkable

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.280
 and I try and find out all the weird stuff

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.080
 that they believe in and all the weird stuff

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.520
 they do in their life.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.440
 So it features everyone from British museum curators

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 like Irving Finkel who told me stuff about how he sits on buses

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.400
 and stares at the back of people's head

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.160
 trying to make them turn around.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.720
 It's got a Betsy Cameron who used to be a part

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 of the Children of God cult but who escaped

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.880
 and wrote a fascinating memoir about it.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.280
 There's Steve Feltham who is the Guinness World Record

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 for the longest continuous search for the Loch Ness Monster.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.040
 Dan Aykroyd is coming on.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.920
 There's so many amazing guests

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.040
 and it's a weekly show where I ask them to tell me

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.760
 about every single weird belief that they have.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.600
 - That's right.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.280
 And guys, the rest of us know

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.440
 how hard Dan's been working on this.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.480
 It sounds absolutely great.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.720
 It's called We Can Be Weirdos.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.000
 Give it a go wherever you get your podcasts now.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.840
 And we should say it's all based on Dan's book,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.240
 The Theory of Everything Else,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.480
 which is out now in the UK in paperback

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.280
 and it's out in North America on the 27th of June.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.080
 Louis Theroux himself has called it

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.760
 totally compelling and utterly bizarre.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.600
 - That's right.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.040
 - So it would mean the world to me

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.280
 if you all fish listeners would subscribe to it,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.680
 follow it, give it a listen

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.640
 and also pick up a copy of my book

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.560
 and okay, okay, okay, back to the actual good podcast.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.400
 Here we go.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.240
 On with the show.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.400
 On with the podcast.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.000
 (upbeat music)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:26.440
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.880
 of Know Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.640
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.720
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.320
 James Harkin and Alex Bell.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.560
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.720
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.680
 Starting with fact number one and that is Alex.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.160
 - My fact this week is that when the founder

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.320
 of the budget supermarket chain Aldi

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.200
 was kidnapped in the 1970s,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.600
 he successfully negotiated a discount off his own ransom.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.640
 - Brilliant.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.280
 Did he claim that he was going off?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.680
 And that result, he had a yellow sticker on him, brilliant.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.240
 - Oh, he's such a good idea.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.320
 So this guy is called Theo Albrecht.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.360
 He founded Aldi with his brother Carl.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.120
 And they've got quite an interesting story

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.200
 in how they founded the supermarket.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.160
 But in the 1970s, when he was one of the richest people

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.360
 in the world, he was kidnapped at gunpoint

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.520
 by a convicted burglar called Paul Cron.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.720
 - Diamond Paul. - Nick was Diamond, yeah.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.280
 And his crooked lawyer, apparently,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.240
 who had gambling debts called Heinz Joachim Ollenberg.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.160
 - Joachim. - Joachim Diamond Paul.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.840
 - Home alone, wet bandits, kind of duo.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.680
 - And yeah.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.360
 - They kidnapped him for 17 days and held him in an office.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.800
 - What, cupboard, wasn't he?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.160
 - Yeah, he was in a cupboard, he was in a cupboard.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.400
 And apparently his appearance was so nondescript

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.360
 and he sort of wore quite kind of cheap suits

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.920
 because he was as money pinching

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.640
 as his discount supermarket reputation suggests.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.640
 They had to ask him for ID to check

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.600
 that they definitely kidnapped a billionaire.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.440
 - The thing was that he didn't do any interviews,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.960
 did he, or anything like that, right?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.520
 He was really not very well known at the time.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.720
 I read a US newspaper article from the week

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.000
 when he got kidnapped and they described him

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.640
 as West Germany's least known millionaire.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.400
 - Yeah, wow. - So no one knew

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.120
 what he looked like, he was just a name.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.680
 - So he was kept for 17 days.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.800
 He negotiates a cheaper ransom and they agreed to it.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.920
 A bishop comes and delivers it.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.280
 - The Bishop of Essen. - Yeah.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.760
 - Which is the city that they were from.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.600
 - Yeah. - I guess it's where

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.440
 they lived at the time.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.440
 - But I didn't realize that was a bishop's responsibility

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.000
 to do it. - He mediated.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.240
 Yeah, I mean, what a call to get as the bishop.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.400
 You must never get that.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.240
 - No.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.160
 - But then he was, isn't he the one who left the money?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.040
 - Yes. - The actual--

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.880
 - Yeah, he did the handover.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.480
 He pays the cash. - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.840
 - But then, and I think Albrecht stayed with him

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.720
 for 24 hours afterwards, stayed with the bishop.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.560
 - Why?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.840
 - Because the police were kept out of it completely

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.880
 because the family didn't want the police involved

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.680
 'cause they thought he might be in danger.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.040
 And the kidnappers said they wanted

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.160
 the 24 hour period to get away.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.440
 And so they said, okay, well he'll stay with the bishop

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.960
 for 24 hours and then after that time, we'll let him go

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.120
 and he'll tell the police who he's seen and stuff.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.480
 - Okay, so he gets out, the bishop,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.000
 they get these 24 hours and--

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.240
 - They catch them as well.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.880
 - And they catch them, yeah, that's right.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.600
 - And they only get half the money back.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.880
 - And to the dying day of the two guys,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.640
 they never recovered the missing 3.5 million.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.600
 - And they died within a month of each other.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.440
 - How weird is that?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.120
 'Cause they were about 20 years different in age.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.960
 - That's so romantic.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.360
 - No, it was within six years, I think.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.560
 - Within a decade, six, yeah.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560
 - Oh, yep.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.800
 - Almost 87, the other was 93.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.120
 - But no, so after he gets let out,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.200
 Theo goes even more recluse.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.600
 He goes into total lockdown.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.960
 No photographs are gonna be taken of him evermore.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.120
 He is, every time he gets into a car,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.280
 it's an armored car.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.200
 A different route every single day

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.960
 when he's going into his office.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.120
 If he's staying somewhere,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.480
 he goes and he finds the exits immediately.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.680
 So it's obviously a huge trauma on this experience.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.520
 - But he also--

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.600
 - Sorry, I know one thing

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.200
 that will make you interested in him, especially Dan,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.420
 which is that Forbes described the brothers,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.320
 the Old Brecht brothers, Theo and Carl,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.240
 who co-founded Aldi,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.040
 described them as more elusive than the Yeti.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.460
 - Ooh.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.480
 - I'm pretty sure like the Yeti doesn't have like a--

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.320
 - An armored car.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.760
 - A business trail, like a paper trail.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.780
 He's not registered with the company's house.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.960
 (all laughing)

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.760
 - Also, that doesn't make me more interested.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.720
 If he was a Yeti hunter, that's interesting.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.640
 Just saying the word Yeti in a sentence

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.960
 doesn't immediately mean--

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.680
 - You've got a higher threshold for interesting--

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.760
 - I do. - Okay, okay.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.200
 - I think my favorite bit of this whole story

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.120
 was that after the whole ordeal,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.280
 Alde Brecht went to court to try and claim the money

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.520
 that was paid as the ransom

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.480
 as a tax-aductible business expense,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.320
 which is brilliant.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.200
 I don't think he was successful,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.880
 but like, that's so cool.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.800
 - I think you can still do that, certainly in some places.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.200
 - If you have a good accountant,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.000
 'cause I think it's in America, it's been done.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.920
 - In America for sure, yeah, famously Yeti.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.760
 - I guess it's-- - John Paul Yeti.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.600
 - It is a business expense, isn't it?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.960
 - Yeah. - Well, or is it?

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.000
 - If the person who is abducted

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 is the CEO of the company,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.480
 then it's to do with the company.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.240
 I think that's the argument.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.280
 - His brother Carl stumped up a lot of money

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.640
 for that as well, the ransom.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.240
 He was part of it.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.880
 But yeah, I love how much the Alde Brecht brothers

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.880
 were really sort of stingy with their cash.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.720
 - They're brilliant.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.320
 I think Theo was the one who,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.240
 they used to approve all the designs for all the shops,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.680
 and there was one where he was given the plans,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.720
 and he said, "The plans are fine,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.600
 "but the paper you printed on is too thick.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.760
 "Print it on thinner, cheaper paper."

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.120
 - He used to famously use pencils right down to the end.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.560
 Like, when you see people with the pencil meets the rubber,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.960
 he would be using pencils like that,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.320
 and if he walked into the office of the Alde officers

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.840
 and he saw that the lights were on,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.240
 but he could see that you could see

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.320
 in a room without the lights,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.840
 he'd go around turning off all the lights.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.920
 - It's so screechy, isn't it?

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.760
 - Yeah.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.520
 - I did read one article that said,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.280
 "He and his brother were the first people

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.080
 "to ever turn off the lights in the room

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.120
 "because they were worried that they were wasting electricity."

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.800
 What a thing to invent.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.640
 - That's great.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.160
 - I thought I was thinking about the timing.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.000
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.280
 - He invented being a dad.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.120
 - Yeah.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.960
 - The timing almost works.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.800
 - That's really funny.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.240
 I think the story is very interesting

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.600
 'cause they founded it together, didn't they?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.600
 They founded Alde together.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.320
 - Yeah, their mother ran a shop, like, I mean,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.600
 like, so they took over the shop as part of their journey,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.680
 but she was the one who really started there.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.800
 I think she does a little bit of credit.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.080
 - Yeah, you're right, that's a good point.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.320
 And then actually they were dragoon into helping their mum

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.400
 because their father, he's been a coal miner

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.200
 and he got emphysema, so he couldn't really work,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.920
 so they had to support the family.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.840
 But anyway, they fell out

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.680
 over whether or not they should sell cigarettes

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.960
 in their shops, and I think Theo said we should

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.800
 and Kyle said we shouldn't.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.120
 - And I think it was for shoplifting reasons.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.960
 - Yeah.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.760
 - I think, yeah, one thought that--

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.440
 - They didn't care about the health reasons.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.760
 - It was its dinginess as well.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.480
 - Despite their father having emphysema,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.480
 they were, it was more about the deal.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.320
 - Is that so interesting?

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.440
 Okay, and then they had this thing, the Alde Equator.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.520
 - Yeah, that's incredible.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.120
 - Where they divided Germany top to bottom

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.160
 and north was Theo's territory.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.040
 - Not with any kind of wall, we should say, like--

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.440
 - So many people died crossing the Alde Equator.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.680
 (all laughing)

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.200
 - People were desperately trying to get to those.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.360
 - 'Cause they did, so this was 1961,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.240
 and they had about 300 Aldes all over the country,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.160
 and that's what got split up between them.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.080
 And if you look at the logos,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.560
 they are different colors across the Alde Equator,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.200
 and so they are definitely two different operations

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.040
 that are going on.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.480
 - Ironically, if you were kidnapped in Germany,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.680
 you could use that to work out

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.920
 which half of the country you were in.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.760
 - Yes!

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.600
 - Oh my God, yeah.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.160
 - What a brilliant idea.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.360
 - What a brilliant idea.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.040
 - There's still different companies now, aren't they?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.880
 - Mm-hmm.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.680
 - Alde Nord and Alde Sud.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.600
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.920
 - And I think, which ones do we have?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.120
 We have Alde Nord.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.960
 - No, British Alde Sud.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.800
 - No, we have Alde Sud.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.640
 - British Alde Sud, yeah, yeah.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.680
 - And in America, they have them both,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.240
 but one of them's called Trader Joe's.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.080
 - Wow.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.320
 - Yeah, that's what Trader Joe is, I never realized, yeah.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.600
 And Alde itself is the name Alde that we said,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.520
 it's a poor mancher of Albrecht discount.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.360
 - Discount.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.600
 (all laughing)

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.720
 - I was trying to remember what the German version was.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.560
 - His brother came up with that, didn't he?

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.280
 (all laughing)

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.400
 - Distingy cunt.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.120
 (all laughing)

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.200
 - The two of us is a real-called discount adaptor, right?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.780
 (all laughing)

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.600
 - Imagine, like, big billboards with them kind of.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.240
 (all laughing)

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240
 Over the border.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.200
 (all laughing)

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.360
 - I'm with discount, I'm with discount, yeah.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.160
 (all laughing)

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.200
 - I think they liked each other.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.520
 I think they got on perfectly well.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.880
 They just disagreed over this.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.960
 - I think it was amicable, yeah, I think it was amicable, yeah.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.640
 - But I've never read into Alde before.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.280
 I've been to Alde many times.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.360
 God damn it, I love it so much.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.240
 I don't want to treat this as an advert,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.120
 but what an operation.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.520
 Well, okay, so for example,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.480
 they don't stock as many items as a regular supermarket will,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.120
 and they've never compromised on that.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.520
 It's grown ever so slightly,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.360
 but an average supermarket might have something

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.200
 like 200,000 different items,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.240
 whereas they might have 2,000 items.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.960
 It has grown since the earlier days

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.080
 when it came to Britain.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.960
 But one of the things was everyone who was working there

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.720
 was required to memorize the price

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.680
 of every single item in the shop, so every 2,000 item,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.120
 which meant that there was a thing that's known as Alde panic,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.000
 which is when you get to the checkout,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.920
 the panic is I can't pack my bags as quickly

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.040
 as they're running the stuff through the till.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.880
 So you get a bit worried.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.800
 - And that's really common now,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.000
 'cause they're so fast at scanning.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.840
 - Well, here's the thing.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.640
 The reason they're so fast at scanning these days,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.480
 'cause this is another Alde innovation,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.840
 is if you buy a product from any supermarket,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.920
 you got a barcode, you get there,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.680
 the person's looking around for the barcode.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.120
 If you look on Alde products that are specifically Alde,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.040
 they print the barcode all over it,

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.160
 so no matter where you turn the product,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.200
 it scans exactly, boop, and it's right through.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.200
 - Yeah, 'cause they also open, I think in the '50s,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.800
 the first self-service grocery store in Germany.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.720
 But in those days, self-service meant you go in

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.720
 and get stuff off the shelves and bring it to the checkout,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.440
 as opposed to giving your list to a clerk

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.560
 who were going to get it for you.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.440
 So that must have been a huge efficiency.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.760
 - And they brought in shopping trolleys.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.280
 And I think they were the first company

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.080
 to bring in the shopping trolleys

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.720
 where you had to put a coin in.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.280
 - That's what they say, yeah.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.240
 - I read an article with the communications director at Alde,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.040
 and he said, "We're always amazed

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.520
 by the pay it forward spirit

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.760
 that happens in our parking lots."

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.240
 And apparently they reckon that in Germany, at least,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.840
 people will pay for the next person's trolley.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.560
 And I just, I've never seen that happen

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.280
 in my entire life in the UK.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.840
 - I'd go around checking to see if anyone's left a quid.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.240
 I could lose an hour or two sometimes

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.240
 if you've got a single, you know.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.080
 - I literally only have one quid that I keep in my car

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.960
 for that thing,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.800
 as I don't really use cash these days, right?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.640
 - Yeah, right.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.680
 - Do you keep it on a string?

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.040
 (all laughing)

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.280
 'Cause you're sounding a bit like Theodore Albrecht.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.800
 (all laughing)

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.880
 - A bit like, I can't say.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.720
 - They got big in Germany

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.560
 because they started looking at the models

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.120
 of what was happening in America with grocery stores.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.680
 And so there was a Memphis grocer

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.840
 that was called Pigley Wiggly.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.000
 So it was Pigley Wiggly, Hogley Wogley,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.640
 and Handy Andy was the last one.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.480
 These were all of the things going on

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.560
 in America at the time.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.840
 And yeah, so they became Germany's--

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.040
 - So Pigley Wiggly was famously the first place

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.680
 that would let you take things off the shelves

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.680
 and put them in your trolley

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.080
 and then pay for them afterwards.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.920
 - Exactly.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.200
 - And I'm not sure if we said it here,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.040
 we might not have done,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.520
 but basically people didn't want to do it

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.720
 'cause they felt like they were shoplifting.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.800
 - Well, I feel like that with the new Amazon fresh tools

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.880
 when you walk in and you scan.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.800
 - Yeah, but you go and wear a motorbike helmet, don't you?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.720
 - You don't scan anything and you're shouting

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.080
 and all of the baseball bat.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.400
 - I actually was gonna kidnap Jeff Bezos,

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.000
 but he just walked into my house, into my cupboard.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 Two weeks later, they put loads of money in my cupboard.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.840
 It was perfect.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.600
 - So when you go to Audi, there's always,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.000
 and I didn't realize this was a big thing,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.200
 but in the middle of Audi,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.240
 there's always this weird aisle

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.080
 where it's just random stuff.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.840
 - The room of requirement is sort of like,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.680
 every time it's different.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.200
 It's huge. - It's so bizarre.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.520
 So the middle aisle and it's sort of famous

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.120
 amongst online people.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.560
 There's Twitter accounts where what random thing

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.040
 have you found in the middle aisle?

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.560
 Yeah, it's massive.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.400
 Yeah, so everything from motion activated,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.000
 toilet bowl, night lights, you know,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.320
 it's just randomly to traffic cones.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.520
 - It feels like it fell off the back of the lorry,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.360
 kind of vibe.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.240
 - Which definitely is not the case.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.600
 - Sorry, they definitely did do that, obviously.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.040
 - No, 'cause I remember like,

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.240
 you would always get like a flyer through the post

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.600
 and it would tell you what was gonna be

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.560
 in the middle aisle in the next month or so.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.400
 - Oh, really?

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.120
 - You know that there was gonna be a canoe there

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.760
 and you'd be like, oh, shit, we gotta get there

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.520
 on the second Tuesday.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.320
 Well, they only have a certain amount.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.120
 And so if it was something really cool,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.840
 everyone in the town would want to get there

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.680
 as quickly as possible together.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.720
 - And they never restock ever, so it's just that.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.720
 It's like a one flash sale.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.080
 - It gets called the Isle of Shite.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.920
 - That's it.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.760
 (laughing)

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.600
 - It's very good.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.440
 - Yeah, it's very good.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.760
 - One other thing on German kidnapping.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.560
 - I think German.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.440
 Do you know about the Pied Piper of Hamlin?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.280
 - Yeah.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.560
 - He famously kidnapped all the children of Hamlin.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.200
 - I never thought of it that way.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200
 - Ah.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.320
 - I thought he got rid of the rats.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.360
 - And the parents didn't pay him?

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.620
 - Yeah, so then he did the same thing.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.880
 He played his pipe and led them.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.400
 He basically hypnotized children to come with him.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.240
 - Oh, yeah.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.480
 - So there's a question of like consent, really.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.640
 - Yeah, it does sound like there is.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.480
 - There's no question.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.320
 There was no consent.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.080
 Like, basically he took all the children out of the town

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.000
 'cause they didn't pay his bills.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.120
 - So he was fictional.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.960
 - Well, there was an entry in Hamlin town records

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.400
 dating to 1384 that says that it is 100 years

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.240
 since our children left.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.720
 And that fits in with the date of when people said

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.960
 this happened which was in 1284.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.480
 And it supposedly happened on the 26th of June,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.080
 the day of St. John and St. Paul.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.800
 And 130 children in Hamlin disappeared.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.120
 And that's what the story is based on.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.360
 - Was there a day of St. George and St. Ringo as well?

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.600
 (laughing)

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.440
 - But we now have theories as to what the Pied Piper was.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.600
 So we think that possibly the Pied Piper story

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.080
 is a fictional account of something that actually happened.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.440
 And the children did go missing

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.760
 and did get taken by someone.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.320
 Can you guess what the actual job

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.200
 of the real life Pied Piper probably was?

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200
 - Oh, okay.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.320
 - Are we gonna, is this guessable from?

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.640
 - School bus driver.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.560
 - School bus, that's really good.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.000
 I mean, the dates don't quite work for school buses.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.840
 1284.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.680
 - I've got it, I've got it.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.520
 - It's called cart driver.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.360
 - Swine herd.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.200
 - Swine herd.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.280
 - Dresses the children up as pigs, really.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280
 - No, that's not what the theory says.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.920
 - Okay, how was he one of the wiggles then?

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.200
 (laughing)

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.260
 - Aldi trolley manager at the Minwood Free Trollies.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.960
 - Well, according to most theories at the moment,

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.560
 he could have been a recruitment consultant.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.400
 - Okay.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.720
 (laughing)

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720
 - I followed that in the street.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.040
 I find it so beguiling.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.880
 - These children were now working like Deloitte.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.440
 (laughing)

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.800
 - There was an economic depression around that time

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.440
 and a lot of the youth of various towns

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.280
 were taken out of German sort of villages

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.200
 and taken to the bigger areas of Western Europe.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.920
 And they had locators or recruiters

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.360
 that would go around these towns

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.720
 and try and bring the youth out there

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.480
 to work in different places.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.800
 And so there's one possibility

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.000
 that the Piper story is based on a recruitment consultant.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.840
 - Wow.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.000
 - Well, they all got sort of free mugs.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.880
 (laughing)

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.160
 - Came back later with those cool wireless phone headsets.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.000
 - Pages.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.580
 (upbeat music)

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.660
 (upbeat music)

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.780
 - It is time for fact number two, that is Andy.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.940
 - My fact is that the world's largest collection

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.700
 of model trains doesn't fit on standard model train tracks.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.540
 (laughing)

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.220
 - I'm really pleased you added the word standard in there

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.340
 'cause it's a big discussion.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.700
 - Yeah, we had a big email chat about this.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.780
 No, but I just got to say,

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.620
 Alex has got in front of him actual like,

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.220
 this is the weirdest bit of research I've seen ever said.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.300
 - I'm not going to go into it, don't worry.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.900
 - I'm going to say the basic fact

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.740
 and then we'll have the argument.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.580
 - Yeah.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.760
 - By the way, thank you to Neil Gibson

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.560
 who sent in this fact,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.620
 who didn't realize the chaos he was unleashing

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.480
 in our previously happy team.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.420
 This is something that's from the National Rail Museum

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.260
 in York.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.820
 They have a collection of 610 model railway vehicles

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.020
 all made by the same man

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.180
 who was called James Peale Richards, 1902 to '99.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.780
 And he was incredibly devoted to detail and accuracy

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.940
 and he thought he could get his models more accurate

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.300
 if you made them to a 33 millimeter gauge.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.860
 So the gauge is the distance between the two train tracks

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.820
 and the normal gauge for model trains is 32 millimeters

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.040
 and they're not compatible

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.020
 with the vast majority of model railway lines

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.600
 and even the National Rail Museum don't have a layout

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.480
 where they can put these trains on a train track.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.320
 - Yeah.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.140
 - So I just think it's very sweet fact, I think.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.260
 - I don't want to make this fact even more contentious

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.340
 but I have a feeling it was 612, not 610.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.500
 What did you guys read?

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.100
 Did you maybe forgive me for a fractional rounding?

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.420
 - The idea is a lot of these model trains,

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.780
 you take anything that's one foot long

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.620
 and you make it seven millimeters long

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.260
 and you do the same for everything else

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.660
 in all the trains, right?

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.080
 Now, if you do that, then you get your gauge

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.860
 to be exactly 33 millimeters to a 0.01 of a millimeter.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.020
 So it's pretty much 33 millimeters

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.460
 but historically they've always had 32 millimeter gauges.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.380
 And so all the other trains that you would have

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.580
 are slightly not exact.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.420
 - That's like the Hornby standard for example.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.260
 - The Hornby standard, yeah.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.580
 - The track you'll find is that width.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.740
 - A lot of them, it's called the O gauge.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.260
 But basically he decided,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.180
 well, I want mine to be exactly right

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.100
 so I'm gonna get this one millimeter difference

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.260
 even though I won't be able to go on hardly any tracks.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.100
 I'm gonna make it because I want it to be perfect.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.220
 - Yeah, he's a hero.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.140
 Did he make his own tracks?

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.100
 He must have, right?

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:31.220
 - I think as I went there and I had an amazing two days,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.380
 I stayed up at night.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.220
 (laughing)

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.340
 - Did you, seriously?

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.660
 - Was there a sleeper train in the...

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.500
 (laughing)

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.460
 - That was so great.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.020
 - Alex Krammick, one finger into the sleeper train.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.420
 (laughing)

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.940
 - No, because they have actual other stuff,

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.780
 they don't just have model,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.740
 they have actual trains there and all sorts of that.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.620
 No, it's an amazing, and I remember seeing them,

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.660
 they've got this fantastic,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.780
 I think it's called an open archive

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.060
 where they've got all this stuff that they can't,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.660
 they don't really have room to sort of display

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.140
 in proper museum, just like thrown on the shelves

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.460
 and sort of displays, you can see it.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.340
 And I remember also seeing they've got scale models

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.500
 of the Queen Victoria's Royal train,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.260
 which is all sort of entirely plush inside

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.220
 with a velvet upholstered toilet and things like that.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.140
 - In miniature?

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.380
 - Yeah, yeah, this is all miniature.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.220
 When they were designing and building the train,

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.580
 the actual full-on steam trains,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.260
 they used to make scale models of the steam trains

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.540
 that are about, I'd say like a foot wide

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.460
 and several feet long,

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.780
 that were full-on working models to check that they worked

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.740
 and they were all kind of the right size.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.100
 So they have these really stonking great models

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.420
 of like working steam trains.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.060
 They've also got, you've mentioned it before on the podcast,

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.060
 there's a massive train set

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.340
 that was used to train signal operators.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.180
 So was the train set,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.020
 but the fun of the train set

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.500
 was like all about the signals and not the trains.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.540
 - So can I ask, Alex,

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.500
 did you see the entire collection

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.060
 of J.P. Richards' trains when you were there?

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.340
 - Well, I don't know because there's loads on the wall.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.780
 I remember them, they're all stacked up on the wall.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.180
 - You've seen them, 'cause they're all there.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.700
 - But I don't know if I saw 610.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.980
 - What's really interesting is that J.P. Richards

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.180
 never saw the entire collection himself, we think.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.840
 And that's because he always kept them in his home

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.660
 where most of them were in boxes.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.060
 So they were never all out at the same time.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.260
 And when he donated them to the museum,

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.340
 he was really, really sick.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.420
 It was just before he died.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.780
 He was too ill to travel.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.100
 So when it was on display, he never got to see it.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.900
 So he actually never saw his entire collection on display.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.260
 - I'm really sad about that, 'cause what a hero,

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.980
 what a great guy, I love it.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.300
 - The collection is still growing,

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.820
 but actually I should quickly say thank you

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.340
 to my friend Chris Valkoinen who is the associate archivist

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.420
 at the National Rail Museum,

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.680
 who sent me loads of stuff for this, absolutely brilliant.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.480
 But yeah, the collection is still growing

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.880
 'cause a lot of his wagons weren't quite finished

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.960
 when he got there.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.480
 So he left them to other people to finish them.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.880
 'Cause he wanted the entirety of the train system

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.680
 of the London and Northwestern trains.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.800
 - Well, that's what we all wanna see, really, isn't it?

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.080
 - Between 1902 and 1944.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.240
 So he wanted everything.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.640
 And they weren't all exactly done at that time.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.160
 So some people are still doing them now.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.920
 They're still kind of making them better and better.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.280
 - It is the most impressive thing

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.540
 when you see the detail that someone goes into

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.940
 to recreating an area, 'cause you make,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.780
 it's not, these aren't things you buy from the shop.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.780
 You create the buildings and you create,

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.780
 and this is like when you're making a whole landscape,

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.620
 so the tracks, the trees, the buildings around it.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.660
 I've only ever played with two model train sets before.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.500
 - Oh yeah.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.580
 - And they belonged to Eddie Izzard.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.660
 So.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.500
 - Plank.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.340
 - Plank drop.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.180
 - No, no, no.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.340
 - Trust you, you'd have a celebrity train set anecdote.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.220
 - This is not, it's not what it sounds like.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.060
 So every time we go to Bexhill on C,

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.600
 which is, my family goes there a lot.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.440
 I always take my boys to the Bexhill Museum

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.000
 and inside is Eddie Izzard's childhood model train set

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.960
 that her father had built when Eddie's brother was born,

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.200
 started building it then.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.120
 And then Eddie's mother got a bit ill

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.120
 and eventually she passed away.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.960
 And part of the project of keeping themselves busy

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.480
 from the sort of, you know, the horrible depression of it all

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.440
 was to continue building this train set.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.360
 So you can go and press buttons

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.720
 and it sends two trains around

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.720
 and it's where Eddie's dad worked.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.380
 You can see the train he used to get into London

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.940
 and it shows all the buildings around

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.540
 and they've commissioned all of Bexhill on C

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.620
 as a train set as well.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.220
 Eddie's kind of put money into that

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.660
 and you press buttons and it goes around.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.500
 It snows.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.340
 - I love that.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.180
 - It's incredible.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.540
 Did you guys read about Simon George?

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.860
 - No, no, no.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.300
 - Simon George is a model railway fan.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.240
 Currently, currently modeling and making huge sets.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.420
 So in 2021, he had just made a model railway

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.540
 which was really big, was 61 meters.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.900
 And it was a model of a specific line

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.200
 from where he'd grown up in the 80s.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.880
 It was the Calder Valley, lots of coal fired trains.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.200
 And it's one of Britain's biggest,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.240
 if not the biggest model trains set.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.320
 Really impressive.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.600
 Spent eight years working on it.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.160
 And he met someone.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.760
 He met his girlfriend while he was making it.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.600
 - Wow.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.440
 - Yeah.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.400
 - That is amazing.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.240
 - This is the thing.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.080
 - Well, wait a minute.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.920
 Okay, fun.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.760
 - So he was interviewed about it.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.000
 And he said, when I first met her,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.800
 she didn't know I was building this.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.720
 And what had happened was

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.480
 it wasn't in his home, this train that he was building.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.640
 He'd leased a mill

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.900
 'cause it had this enormous basement, right?

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.980
 - So, and he said, okay,

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.340
 she knew I leased a mill with a huge basement, Simon said.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.540
 But I kind of led her to believe I was a wine merchant

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.340
 because that sounded cooler than building a model railway.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.820
 - I'm just imagining the discussion that he had

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.820
 when he said, now we've been getting on very well.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.180
 I think there could be something here.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.140
 I need to tell you that the basement in the mill,

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.940
 I've not let you go in.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.220
 It's not a wine collection.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.680
 - What was she a thought?

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.280
 - She turned up unannounced at his work one day.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.680
 She wanted to surprise him.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.660
 And she turned up to his wine merchant.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.000
 - Oh my God.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.080
 - What did he do?

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.580
 - Don't come in, I'm whanking.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.680
 (all laughing)

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.080
 There are loads of bodies down here, don't worry.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.060
 - This is where I keep a family locked up, come on.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.760
 (all laughing)

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.280
 - He said, she wondered where all the wine was,

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.120
 but actually she really appreciated the detail

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.160
 and the artistic element.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.840
 - Very, very cool.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.340
 - Herman Göring, the Nazi, is also enthusiastic.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.940
 - Who's Herman Göring, not the Nazi?

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.780
 (all laughing)

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.260
 - I don't think there's any others out there.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.540
 He was an enthusiastic--

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.380
 - No.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.620
 - Yeah, Nazis love trains.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.500
 They love models, obviously.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.340
 You know that famous big third Reich one.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.180
 But--

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.260
 - No, sorry.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.600
 Again, Alex, you spent two days in the National Royal Museum.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.440
 - There's nothing to do with train models.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.280
 No, no, sorry.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.700
 That's a totally, totally off topic.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.540
 But--

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.380
 - Did they have a big model?

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.300
 - The Hitler commissioned a huge model

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.500
 of what the center of Berlin was going to look like.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.020
 And it's a really horrible, scary model that still exists.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.860
 You can go see it there.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.700
 - Okay, right.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.100
 - And it's really bizarre and interesting.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.320
 But I think that whole element of control from afar,

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.160
 you know the kind of--

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.000
 - You're saying Göring did the trains.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.160
 - Göring had two train sets, just like Eddie is odd.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.920
 One in the, no, just like, you've seen trains.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.300
 Wait, you said you've seen two train sets in your life.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.140
 - No, played with it twice.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.980
 - Played with it twice.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.820
 - You played with it twice.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.660
 - Both of them were Eddie's, yeah.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.680
 - Right, so okay, so Herman Göring had one train set

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.640
 in his attic and one in his basement.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.320
 - Okay.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.400
 - And there are pictures of it.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.920
 And they're really, it's pretty extensive,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.960
 is that he lived, he lives in a big old Nazi house

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.480
 and had a huge attic and a massive basement.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.220
 And there's a rumor that you can sort of maybe

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.360
 see evidence for in the pictures that there was,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.120
 there were wires that went over the one in the attic

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.520
 that planes went across and you could drop little bombs

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.360
 out of the planes.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.200
 - Okay, right.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.960
 - Which is good fun.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.160
 - Wow, they originated in Germany,

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.400
 didn't they, model railways, basically.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.120
 There was a company called Marklin

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.600
 and they'd be making toys and stuff.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.920
 But they mostly made dolls houses.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.720
 The idea is you make a doll's house

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.400
 and you sell them the house.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.640
 And then they have to buy the dolls to go inside

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.280
 and they have to buy the cookers and they have to buy

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.920
 the chairs and they have to buy all the bits and pieces.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.320
 And they wanted something that boys would like.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.560
 - How are the dolls gonna get to work?

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.400
 - Yeah.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.120
 (all laughing)

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.300
 - And they just thought, well, by doing the railways,

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.640
 then we can sell the railway tracks,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.080
 but then we can sell the stock

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.480
 and we can sell the little bushes that go,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.320
 I don't know, I've never played with them.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320
 - There's another German connection,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.360
 which is maybe the earliest ever model train

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.240
 belonged to the poet Goethe.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.400
 - Did it? - Wow.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.960
 - Clang yourself, mate.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.400
 (all laughing)

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.620
 - This is from 1829, it's six years before Germany

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.880
 had even a railway, a steam railway of its own.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.720
 - Wow.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.720
 - Some English well-wishers gave him a tiny, tiny model

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.040
 of Stevenson's rocket, the earliest steam railway engine.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.920
 I think the earliest steam railway engine.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.940
 And it came with a set of wagons and rails

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.240
 and Goethe put it on his desk.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.880
 I think he might have given it to his grandchildren

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.000
 at the time, 'cause he was an old man by that point.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.440
 - Yeah, cool. - Wow.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.960
 Do you wanna hear an incredibly, well, so, okay.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.240
 Here's a fact about Moloroas.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.400
 I'm just gonna tell you what. - Right.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.800
 - Okay. - That's what we're all here for.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.000
 (both laughing)

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.180
 - What a change of topic.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.040
 (both laughing)

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.320
 - I know what's about to happen.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.400
 - So, you know how you use different things to represent.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.400
 So you might use a coffee stirrer as a piece of fencing.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.240
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.560
 - Like things from our world.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.600
 - Oh, okay, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.000
 - I see, yeah. - Okay.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.320
 - You could use a marble as a boulder, for instance.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.640
 - Yeah, you paint it or whatever, yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.900
 Okay, so do you know what they use to make coal?

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.640
 - Okay, so it's gotta be something that looks like coal,

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.280
 but is much smaller. - Yeah, mm.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.320
 But maybe it's not the same color,

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.840
 but you could paint it black, right?

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.000
 - Is it not just small bits of coal?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.600
 - They use coal. (both laughing)

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.920
 - Oh my God.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.040
 - I hit it with a hammer and grinded it up small.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.200
 - What? (both laughing)

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.360
 - Well, it's definitely a fact.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.720
 - Is this by any chance the fact

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.840
 that you messaged us saying,

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.080
 "I just told my wife a fact,"

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.640
 and she said, "That's the dullest thing

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.560
 "you've ever said in your life?"

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.440
 - That's the fact.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.280
 She just said, "Stop talking."

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.760
 (both laughing)

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.840
 - We found it so interesting, and it's so boring.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.200
 - She took off her eye with this condition.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.760
 (both laughing)

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.280
 - Amazing, Andy, great fact.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.600
 - Great fact. - Thank you.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.880
 Do you know the really tragic thing?

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.320
 - We last talked about "Model Railways" four years ago.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.640
 I looked through my notes for that show.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.480
 It was in there. (both laughing)

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.480
 - So, probably the most famous model railways in the world

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.000
 have to be the ones that we see in "Thomas the Tank Engine."

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.240
 "Thomas the Tank Engine."

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.760
 I mean, that's globally the biggest, most famous,

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.880
 and just a cool connection.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.000
 So, there is famously the Fat Controller,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.800
 who's now been renamed Sir Topham Hatt.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.960
 - He was always called. - He was always his real name.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.240
 - Yeah, but they kind of phased out the Fat Controller.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.200
 He's in the cartoons.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.440
 He's back to Sir Topham Hatt.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.440
 And we know someone who was the real-life Sir Topham Hatt.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.280
 - Sir Topham Hatt. - Yeah.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.880
 - What do you mean that's in the vice?

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.560
 - No, so they used to have offices for "Thomas the Tank Engine."

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.160
 When children wrote in,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.160
 they had an official Sir Topham Hatt,

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.520
 who would write letters back to the children.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.840
 And we know that person.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.080
 They've been on "Fish," they've been on "Fish."

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.560
 - Is it Craig Glenday? - Yes, Craig Glenday,

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.400
 Editor-in-Chief for the Guinness World Records.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.160
 - Wow. - Okay, that's bizarre.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.040
 When I was tiny, I wrote to Sir Topham Hatt.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.640
 - No. - And I got a letter back.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.760
 - Did you? - Oh, him.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.960
 - It's just small coal.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.960
 You're a really annoying child.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:05.960
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.160
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1760,

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.040
 a book was publicly burned in Switzerland

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.080
 because it claimed that William Tell did not exist.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.720
 - Is that a game? - Yeah.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.800
 - Ah. - 'Cause I sort of think he did.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.000
 I sort of think he did. - Oh, you're wrong.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.360
 - Well, yeah, yeah. - Is it?

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.720
 - Well, publicly burned me then. - Is it like the Pied Piper,

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.240
 and he was just like a management consultant?

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.800
 - No, he's less historical than the Pied Piper, I would say.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.320
 He was part of the foundation myth

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.920
 of the country of Switzerland, basically.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.840
 - Yeah, he's kind of Robin Hood-esque, right?

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.320
 - Yeah, he is. - But in arrows to Dr. Power.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.360
 - You're spot on, you know, shot an apple off his son's head.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.480
 - That's the only thing I know.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.320
 It's the only thing, like, shot an apple off his son's head.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.920
 I didn't know any of the context.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.920
 I just knew I never questioned it.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.760
 - It was quite contrived, like, for some reason,

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.440
 he ended up in a situation where they were like,

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.440
 "Shoot it, or we'll kill you and your son,"

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.200
 and then he did it, and then they were like,

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.760
 "Well, how come you've got two arrows then?"

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.360
 And he was like, "Well, if I accidentally killed my son,

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.400
 "I was gonna shoot you."

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.600
 - It was quite cool, wasn't it?

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.600
 Because the reason this whole thing started

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.960
 was he was going through this town,

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.440
 which was called Altdorf, and he was...

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.520
 There's a guy there who was a bailiff called Gessler,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.120
 and Gessler had this thing where he put a hat on a pole,

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.640
 and it was in the center of the town,

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.960
 and if you walked past the pole and you had a hat on,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.640
 you had to sort of take your hat off and be like,

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.680
 "Hello, pole."

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.040
 - And so we...

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.400
 - I think we should say the pole represented

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.080
 the immensely powerful Hapsburg Empire.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.280
 (all laughing)

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.960
 - It's still weird, it's still weird.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.440
 So he goes past, doesn't take his hat off.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.680
 I guess Gessler, who's just happens to be monitoring

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.960
 every passing by, sees that, says, "Hey, take your hat off."

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.680
 He says, "No."

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.600
 And then that's where this thing happens,

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.600
 where he says, "You need to now shoot your son,"

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.720
 or rather-- - Shoot the apple.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.360
 - "Shoot the apple."

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.080
 (all laughing)

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.520
 He says, "You gotta put your son,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.800
 "you gotta put an apple on his head,

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.000
 "and you gotta shoot through it,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.560
 "and if you get it, then you guys can go free.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.880
 "If you miss, then I'm gonna kill you as well."

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.000
 So it was a kind of big challenge.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.720
 - Perfectly fair challenge punishment.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.680
 - Fits the crime.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.040
 - It doesn't make any sense.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.280
 - It makes sense for someone who's put a hat on a pole

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.560
 and made it so he had it up to it.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.600
 - Could he choose the apple, though?

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.440
 Could he choose a very large apple, like a pink lady?

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.160
 - Like the one I saw in "Me by any car dot com" that time.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.280
 (all laughing)

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.760
 Honestly, I could have hit that for 200 yards.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.800
 - I know you've stopped listening, Alex,

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.840
 but James has an anecdote

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.240
 about this very, very big apple he once saw.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.840
 - It's actually, it's really weird to get bored

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.120
 on a podcast that you're on.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.240
 You're not even listening to.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.040
 (all laughing)

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.480
 - But if it had been that apple, yeah, you're right.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.440
 - Yeah, it'd be easy.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.400
 Anyway, look, like Dan said and Alex said,

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.440
 "This is the story."

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.200
 And then because he did the apple thing,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.760
 they said, "Okay, fine, Switzerland can exist."

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.880
 And he became like the foundation myth of this country.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.080
 So everyone believed it and thought

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.200
 that he was a real character.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.040
 And then there was a historian called Egidius Tudy,

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.920
 and he found out that actually the earliest writing

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.800
 of it was 250 years after the events.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.320
 And then they found the original Oath of Rutli,

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.040
 which was for the foundation of Switzerland

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.360
 for the early cantons all getting together.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.280
 And it named the three representatives

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.880
 and none of them was called Tell.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.480
 None of them was called William Tell.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.960
 And so, and actually they got the date wrong as well

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.160
 in the original, sort of the original story.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.800
 And so this guy called De Halle wrote a book

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.120
 called William Tell at Danish Fable

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.240
 and everyone in Switzerland thought this was outrageous

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.160
 that he could put this in writing.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.440
 And the book was publicly burned in Altdorf Svær.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.800
 - Was he a Swiss author?

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.320
 - He was a Swiss, yeah.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.800
 - And I, 'cause I sort of vaguely thought

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.320
 of William Tell as a bit Robin Hoodish

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.640
 as in somebody might have existed, but not really.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.560
 I didn't really think, oh, that doesn't seem

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.680
 like a very significant thing to me.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.920
 But I read a piece about, it's from the Atlantic,

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.360
 but it's from 1890.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.480
 And it said, just this line,

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.560
 "To understand the commotion produced in Switzerland

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.880
 "by cops exposé, we must try to imagine

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.560
 "what would be the result in the United States

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.400
 "if George Washington was suddenly declared

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.920
 "to be a legendary character."

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.040
 - Yeah, it's a bit of that.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.920
 - It was a huge, huge moment to find out.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.720
 - It was a bit of that.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.280
 And then what happened was, everyone was like,

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.000
 "Dahalla, what are you doing, this ridiculous?"

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.120
 And so he said, "No, no, no, no, this was a literary exercise.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.760
 "I was just, it was just an essay I was writing

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.840
 "to see if I could, it was like, you know,

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.360
 "it's like coming up with two reasons,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.680
 "whether we should leave the EU or not leave the EU.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.280
 "And this was the one I decided to go with.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.640
 "It wasn't supposed to be taken seriously."

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.640
 - This is the first, like, "Dude, it's a social experiment,

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.080
 "like, no, you should."

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.360
 - It sounds like he was petrified.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.680
 Like, it sounds like had he not renounced that,

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.920
 it could have been like a Salman Rushdie kind of situation

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.280
 where he might have gone into a, you know,

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.160
 hiding in a cupboard kind of thing.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.840
 - They were absolutely furious.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.920
 But then obviously he'd opened the floodgates

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.080
 and suddenly all the skeptics came in,

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.520
 like skeptics do and said,

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.960
 "Well, actually there was no organized uprising after all.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.440
 "And there's no evidence that anyone called William Tell

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.200
 "had lived, let alone shot and pull off anyone's head."

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.840
 And they concluded that he was probably a fictional character,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.880
 possibly based on a little bit of, you know, real life stuff.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.880
 And then someone found this old story

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.360
 from the Danish sagas,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.440
 which is basically the entire story.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.520
 And that was written, you know,

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.600
 hundreds and hundreds of years before William Tell

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.280
 was supposed to have even existed.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.600
 And so it seems like they've taken an old story

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.160
 from the sagas and they've kind of appropriated it.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.280
 - It was a story of Harold Bluetooth.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.640
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.800
 - Veteran wireless technology, yeah.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.160
 Certainly the namesake of it.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.600
 Danish king of the 10th century.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.720
 - And it is, like, I looked at it and it's identical.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.920
 - It is the same story.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.960
 - Yeah.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.160
 There was a play.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:25.960
 - Shiller.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.680
 - Shiller's play.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.320
 - Yeah.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.480
 - And then the play became an opera by Rossini

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.400
 and it's just, it's such an international thing.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.640
 So it's an opera about a Swiss hero

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.480
 by an Italian composer, Rossini,

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.040
 based on a play by a German writer, Shiller,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.400
 which premiered in Paris.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:39.800
 - Brilliant.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.520
 - As in it's, all of Europe is involved in this, this, uh...

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.880
 - And you know the, but you know the famous

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.160
 William Tell Overture, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:47.640
 - Yeah.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.040
 - Rossini didn't actually write that for the William Tell Opera.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:50.520
 - Get out.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.200
 - He was, like, running out of time

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.640
 when he was writing the William Tell Opera.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.080
 (laughing)

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.160
 - That's not how it works when you're running out of time,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.960
 writing music.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.920
 When it speeds up.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.720
 (laughing)

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.320
 - No, he, he was running out of time

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.000
 to finish the entire opera

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.680
 and didn't have an Overture ready.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.800
 So he went and borrowed a pre-existing piece

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.720
 from one of his earlier operas,

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.480
 which was called Elizabeth, Queen of England.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.000
 So that was written almost 15 years beforehand.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.160
 - How interesting, because everything I can think of

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.400
 about Elizabeth, the Queen of England,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.640
 none of the events in her life fit in with that music.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.600
 - No, it doesn't really work, does it?

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:24.920
 Yeah.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.880
 - No, I mean, like, you can't imagine some Walter Raleigh

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.320
 laying down his cloak and her going,

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.320
 (humming)

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.240
 - The opera was only performed in full three times.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.880
 - Yeah, 'cause it was five hours long.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.600
 - Five hours?

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.680
 - Is that average time for an opera?

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.160
 - No.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:39.480
 - No, really?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.360
 - That's very long.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.920
 - Definitely more than a few hours is fine,

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.680
 but five hours is pretty long.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.320
 - Even three is.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.120
 - I've never been to one.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:46.840
 I always just always know that they're long.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.840
 - Especially given that some of the music was so fast.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.520
 Like, you would have thought the music would be slower

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.400
 if he was gonna write it out.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:51.640
 - Yeah.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.920
 - There's a Herman Göring link.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.680
 I can't believe there's another Herman Göring

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.400
 in the podcast.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.920
 The Nazi--

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.280
 - Which Herman Göring, by the way?

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:58.840
 - Sorry.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.560
 - The Nazi one.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.040
 - The Nazi one.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:00.840
 - Okay, sorry, good.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.000
 Just got to clarify.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.760
 - The Nazi regime made a movie of William Tell,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:09.640
 and they treated the Tell story as a kind of Nazi myth,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.480
 'cause at that point, I think it was before the war,

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.240
 they claimed they were liberating ethnic Germans

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.160
 living in other countries who had been oppressed

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.800
 by those countries, and Herman Göring's mistress

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.160
 was cast in a leading role.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.040
 - Okay, right.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.640
 - That was based on Schiller's play, wasn't it?

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.440
 - Yeah.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.160
 - But then Hitler banned it later on,

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.120
 because there was an assassination attempt on him

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.400
 by a guy called Maurice Bavo, who was known

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.680
 as the new William Tell.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.240
 - Yeah.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.640
 - And he thought, well, I better get rid

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.920
 of all other William Tells.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.040
 - He was Swiss as well.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.360
 - Yeah.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:38.840
 - That's great.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.480
 - Yeah.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.120
 - Yeah.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.840
 - I've been in Switzerland for Swiss Independence Day

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.720
 on the 1st of August.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.440
 - Oh, yeah.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.400
 - Which is when they have a lot of--

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.120
 - What happened?

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.520
 - It was sort of fireworks and stuff like that.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.200
 It was relatively low key.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.720
 - Lots of chocolate, probably cheese.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.160
 - Yeah, lots of chocolate.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.800
 - Where did you go?

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.600
 Like, specifically?

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.960
 - A few different places.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.360
 - Oh.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.120
 - They sound great.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.920
 - Did you go to Bern?

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.880
 I've been to Bern.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.400
 - I don't think I did go to Bern.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.120
 I was very young.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.400
 I didn't know where they got rid of all the books.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.440
 - Oh, my God.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.240
 - Brilliant.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:09.880
 Brilliant.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.840
 That was worth it.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.320
 - In the Bern, there's lots of, like, bears,

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.600
 because a bear is the symbol of the city of Bern.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.360
 And the Appenzell Canton flag,

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.680
 so the area of Switzerland called Appenzell,

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.000
 has a flag which is a bear with an erection.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.840
 - Crikey.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.080
 - Yeah.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:33.480
 So if you look at it, it's only a tiny little red triangle.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.040
 If you can imagine, a bear rampant.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.360
 And then you've got a little red triangle

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.480
 where his penis would be.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:46.040
 And there was a time when St. Gallen, this was in 1579.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.000
 So the Canton of St. Gallen had a printer,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.920
 and he did a calendar of all the Swiss Cantons.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.960
 And he did the Appenzell Canton flag,

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.120
 but he didn't put the erection in the bear.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.120
 And this was, it kicked off.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.240
 It really, really kicked off.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.600
 They almost went to war

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.920
 because they didn't have the penis on the bear.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.760
 And then it was only averted

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.160
 when the printer offered abject apologies,

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.240
 and St. Gallen agreed to destroy

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.800
 every single copy of the calendar they could find.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.440
 - Wow.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.520
 - Again, lots of rounding things up and destroying them.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:20.920
 - Yeah.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.040
 - It's a very spicy time.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.680
 No wonder Switzerland is so determinedly neutral and calm today.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.800
 - Yeah, it's rewarding.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.120
 - They say they're for a very organized country.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.800
 They've got a really chaotic origin story.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.240
 - I think they've got it all out of their system.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.080
 They've only decided, I think, at a certain point.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:38.040
 No, we cannot stop rounding up and destroying calendars.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:38.840
 And things like that.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:47.320
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.600
 And that is my fact.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.920
 My fact this week is that to make sure

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.440
 that no one leaked the answer to who shot JR

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.120
 on the TV show Dallas,

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.760
 the production team had every main character

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.680
 film a scene of them shooting JR, including JR.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.680
 It's an amazing thing.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.320
 So this is--

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.760
 - We need to explain what Dallas is.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.160
 - Exactly.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.800
 So Dallas was a soap opera in America,

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.800
 went on for a very long time in the 1980s it began.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.600
 And it was a show that kind of really transformed

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.160
 the idea of soap having these dramatic plot twists.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.800
 And also cliffhangers and so on.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.400
 And it created the greatest cliffhanger

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.040
 probably in TV history, certainly American TV history.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.440
 And it's about, it follows the escapades

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.640
 of a wealthy oil tycoon's family in Dallas, Texas.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.440
 - It's the earliest succession.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.720
 - Early cheesy succession, really.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.200
 - It is.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.440
 It's about us Williamers, and the main character

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.520
 is an anti-hero just like Logan Roy.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.480
 - I do think that succession is a very original idea.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.160
 And they definitely didn't rip off Dallas

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.800
 in any way whatsoever, just as an ultimate opinion.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.600
 - I'm not so sure.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.200
 I think, no.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.600
 - So yeah, it's at the end of this third series,

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.720
 it's the finale.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.400
 And JR, who is the character played by Larry Hagman,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.520
 is shot.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.600
 We don't know who's pulled the trigger.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.560
 And then there's a big break in the season.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.440
 And in that time, America goes slightly ballistic.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.720
 We're trying to work out.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.920
 - The world almost.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.920
 Who shot JR was basically the big question that everyone,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.640
 with t-shirts next to the, "I'm with this cunt."

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.880
 - Who shot JR.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.480
 Politicians were referencing it.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.520
 - Yeah, everyone.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.200
 - And just a spoiler alert, it was Kristen.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:28.840
 There we go.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.080
 - What?

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:35.240
 - But the thing is, the shooting of JR, this huge event,

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.960
 maybe the biggest event in fictional TV history,

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.640
 was not meant to be the end of the series.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.880
 They had already filmed an ending of the series.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.000
 And they'd had a load of events.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.600
 They'd had a deathbed murder confession.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.560
 They'd had the sectioning.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.600
 They had all sorts of, you know,

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.360
 greatly written themselves into a corner kind of thing.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:48.680
 - Yeah.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.400
 And then they got told,

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.560
 "Hey, great news. You've got four more episodes."

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.480
 And they had to write four more episodes.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.640
 And then there was a big head-scratching thing

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.280
 in the writer's room.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.000
 And someone said, "Why don't we just shoot the bastard?"

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.040
 And then they all...

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.600
 - 'Cause apparently a lot of the writers were comedians.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.280
 Or funny people at least.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.720
 Yeah, and this was, I read this in an interview

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.680
 with Lorraine Desprez, who was one of the main writers.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.480
 And yeah, she said that these were really funny guys

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.920
 who were trying to come up with ideas.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.040
 And almost let's shoot JR was one person going,

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.480
 "Wouldn't it be funny if we did that?

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.480
 'Cause wouldn't it fuck things up if we did that?"

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.640
 And then they all went, "Oh, actually, that would be good."

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.200
 - Well, that's...

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.760
 I mean, a lot of the writers of succession

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.040
 are very funny comic writers.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.920
 Jesse Armstrong, Lucy Crebel, Preble, sorry.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.840
 So, you know, it's another little link between the two, I'd say.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.000
 - But, you know, I mean, the world went crackers, didn't it?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.800
 - It did.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.280
 If you were on a plane going from Europe to America at the time,

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.800
 if it was an Air France plane,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.680
 they said that they would tell anyone over the intercom

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.040
 who'd shot JR, 'cause if you couldn't watch the show,

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.600
 someone would radio up from the ground and say,

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.480
 "It was Kristen."

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.160
 And then they'd go, "We're flying at 40,000 feet."

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.080
 And it was Kristen who shot JR.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.600
 - Oh, my God.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.640
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.920
 - That is a huge spoiler.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.480
 There's no way of avoiding a plane-tannoy spoiler.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.920
 - That's true, although in those days,

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.240
 you couldn't watch things on demand.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.840
 Like, you could have VHS'd it, or maybe...

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.680
 - So, you actually kind of wanted to ask me to spoil it more.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.280
 - Actually, even in 1980, I guess,

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.200
 you would have had VHS's, but only just.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.040
 - Yeah.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.880
 - Right.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.000
 - So, you had to watch it live.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.040
 If you didn't watch it live,

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.880
 you were not gonna watch it.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.720
 - Exactly, you weren't gonna know.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.160
 - The Turkish parliament suspended a session

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.360
 so that the legislators wouldn't be able to tune in

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.240
 and wouldn't miss it.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.200
 - It really is.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.160
 - There was a really fantastic piece in Texas Monthly,

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.320
 which if anyone's gonna cover who shot JR,

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.200
 then you're off.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.080
 - Front page, surely.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:37.880
 - Absolutely.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.640
 But no, there is an amazing piece,

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.720
 which is all about the madness that happened.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.640
 So, they shot at a real ranch.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.080
 You know, they shot some scenes at a real ranch,

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.800
 so it was just shot in interior sets in Hollywood.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.080
 But the son of the guy who lived at the ranch,

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.400
 they shot at, is called Joe Duncan.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.920
 And he says that they had people turning up

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.160
 to take chips of the fence,

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.000
 take pieces of rock.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.200
 - You know, they could have taken a chip of the fence

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.620
 and used it as a tiny fence in a model railway.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:12.480
 - That's like relics.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.320
 That's mad.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.160
 - It is, yeah.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.000
 - He said, listen to this quote.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.160
 He said, "I was once 20 feet away from a guy

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.800
 "who jumped to the fence and went out into the pasture

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.560
 "to pick up a piece of horse manure to take home

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.900
 "as a souvenir."

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.760
 - That was a time before eBay.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.600
 - Yeah, as well.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.120
 - The name was Dad Shriver.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.160
 (all laughing)

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.560
 - I read an article from, this was the day before

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.000
 they were about to show who shot JR,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.920
 and this was in the Minneapolis Star.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.360
 And they asked some local celebs

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.600
 who they thought had shot JR.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.240
 And like the head of the coach

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.280
 of one of the local sports teams said,

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.880
 "Oh, I don't know who shot JR,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.360
 "but there's a lot of agents of players

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.620
 "who I'd like to shoot."

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.440
 (all laughing)

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.520
 And then, zing!

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.360
 The police chief who's called Anthony Bouzard,

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.840
 he said, "I'm happy to report that I've never seen

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.480
 "a single minute of that goddamn program."

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.320
 - Wow.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.720
 - And they asked the mayor, Don Fraser,

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.920
 who's the mayor of Minneapolis.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.080
 And he said, "I haven't the foggiest who shot him.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.160
 "Are you serious?

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.120
 "I've only seen one episode of that show

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.840
 "and it was quite by accident."

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.960
 - Wow.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.200
 - Sounds like a lifelong fan.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.040
 (all laughing)

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.080
 - Just happily, they asked him.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.360
 Like, they asked someone and they got these answers

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.840
 and they felt, "Well, we'll look back as well, print."

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.000
 - Oh, yeah, yes, yeah, yes, that, yeah.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.440
 - The thing that I knew Dallas for,

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.840
 'cause I'd never really seen it.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.560
 But I know it as a famous,

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.640
 like a famous example of retconning,

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.560
 where you retroactively change what happened.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.720
 So they wrote, filmed and shot and broadcast

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.120
 an entire season in which a character, Bobby Ewing, died.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.480
 But this character was really popular

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.720
 and they decided they wanted to spring him back.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.960
 So in order to do that, they retconned it

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.440
 by the beginning of the next series.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.440
 They made the whole previous series of Dream Sequence.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.760
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.760
 - Which is hailed as one of the like,

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.960
 the cheesiest and rubbish ways of like retconning.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.240
 But one of the weird continuity things was that

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.160
 Dallas had a spin-off show called "Not's Landing"

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.000
 that existed in the same universe.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.400
 But when they brought back Bobby Ewing

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.080
 and was like, "Oh, this character never died,"

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.120
 in "Not's Landing," they had referenced

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.200
 the fact that Bobby had died.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.680
 So at that point, it's like a universe-splintering moment.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.600
 - It's like spider-verse into the multiverse.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.760
 - It is, yeah, exactly.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.800
 - But they were simultaneously taking into a,

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.600
 like they were like keeping track of the different universes

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.400
 while simultaneously wiping entire series off the face of the Earth.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.040
 - 'Cause you would think it would be easier to say,

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.400
 "Oh, he didn't die, he faked his own death."

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.240
 - Yes, exactly.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.200
 - Unless they showed, on camera, the funeral,

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.760
 the like, open cast gear.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.200
 - I think it was like the main part

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.720
 of a lot of the story of that season.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.160
 - They literally were like, "Forget that series happened."

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.000
 - It's weird.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.840
 - Yeah.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.520
 - There was a real life Bobby Ewing

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.200
 who lived in Texas and who owned an oil and cattle company.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.040
 - Oh, really?

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:46.880
 - Yeah.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.120
 And so when this big sort of who shot JR thing was happening,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.320
 they really kind of cashed in

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.480
 and you could buy JR Dolls, JR Cologne, JR Playing Cards.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.720
 And you could also buy fake certificates

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.480
 for Ewing Land Oil and Cattle Company,

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.280
 which was signed by Bobby Ewing, the fake Bobby Ewing.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.840
 But then the real Bobby Ewing, who lived in Texas,

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.440
 sued them and said, "Well, you can't do this

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.360
 'cause it makes it look like you're selling my company."

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.000
 And I found out that it was settled in the end

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.240
 and the real Bobby Ewing wasn't allowed

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.760
 to sell any novelty items.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.480
 And it didn't say, but I assume he got a massive payout.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.320
 He must have done, right?

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.520
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.920
 - Larry Hagman, who played JR.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.040
 So obviously there's a big break for the,

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.640
 when they're not shooting.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.040
 He hadn't signed his contract

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.680
 when they started shooting the next series

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.280
 and he held out for a long time.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.600
 - 'Cause he knows he's a star now, right?

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.200
 - Yeah, everyone's talking about him.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.760
 - He wanted a huge pay rise.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.600
 He dispatched his agents to negotiate

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.080
 wearing white stets and hats with the management of the show.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.920
 - And that was his kind of look, right?

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.240
 - Sorry, yeah, that was his thing, yeah.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.000
 - I don't feel really stupid if I was as Asian

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 as I was told to do that.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.360
 - Well, they were like, "You're overreaching

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.760
 with this negotiation and you want us

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.680
 to go in fancy dress."

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.880
 - It was worse when Mr. Blobby asked for a pay rise.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.480
 (all laughing)

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.880
 - He wouldn't come in and be like, "Ah, Mr. Blobby."

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.520
 (all laughing)

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.240
 - When they were trying to shoot the next series,

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.360
 they had to start shooting,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.200
 but without JR being present

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.800
 and having signed off his contract,

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.040
 without having signed his contract.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.120
 So what they started doing,

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.720
 they shot a couple of different versions.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.720
 One, they just shot JR from behind.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.560
 He just shot someone with the same hair,

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.320
 which they could just like fill in later.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.780
 And then they also shot scenes

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.800
 with a guy bandaged up like he did.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.480
 (all laughing)

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.840
 And they said, "If we have to bring in another actor

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.720
 to play JR, we can claim,

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.320
 you had to have reconstructive surgery."

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.840
 And now you're like, "This is so funny."

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.800
 - The problem is JR was shot in the stomach.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.360
 (all laughing)

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.200
 No reason.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.440
 - That's great.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.480
 Hagman, what an interesting kind of personality

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.400
 he was generally.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.480
 He used to do a thing for many, many years

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.280
 called "Silent Sundays."

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.640
 He just didn't talk on Sundays.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.480
 - So funny.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.320
 - Yeah.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.160
 So what happened was is that--

00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.000
 - Religious?

00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.840
 Religious?

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.680
 - No, no, it was part of,

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.120
 he used to be on a different show called "I Dream a Genie,"

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.080
 brilliant show, and during it, he had vocal problems.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.120
 And so he went to a doctor and the doctor said,

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.880
 "Why don't you try not talking for a few days?"

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.520
 And he thought not only did it work nicely,

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.840
 but he really enjoyed the experience.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.240
 So every Sunday he thought,

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.280
 "I'm just going to do this."

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.720
 And didn't speak for decades.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.560
 - It's so good.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.400
 - Yeah.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.000
 - Yeah, he claimed that for 25 years,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.960
 he never spoke on a Sunday.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.040
 I think it's not 100% true.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.360
 I think he kind of cheated a fair amount, but--

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.880
 - 'Cause Sunday's your birthday or--

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.720
 - Yeah.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.560
 - A Lego.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.120
 - Sometimes he would go like four days in a row

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.120
 without talking, wouldn't he?

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.200
 And his family would hate him for it, and--

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.040
 - Really?

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.160
 - He kicked it, because he says that he started realizing

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.680
 he was missing a lot of opportunities,

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.840
 'cause he says in LA,

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.680
 a lot of business is done on the weekends.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.640
 And so he said he couldn't call his agent.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.800
 He couldn't talk to them to say,

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.000
 "Hey, get on the case of doing this," or--

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.040
 - It's incredibly good negotiating to stay silent.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.880
 He probably should have done all this business on a Sunday.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.560
 Just sit there in silence while they just keep

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.400
 upping the offer until the clock goes over to Monday.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.280
 - He's like, "Yeah, great."

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.120
 - That's so funny.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.880
 - A Nazi who was a fan of Dallas?

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.720
 - Great.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.560
 - Rudolph Hasse.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.400
 - Rudolph Hasse?

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.720
 - No, he wasn't.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.560
 - Rudolph Hasse, yeah.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.040
 - Rudolph Hasse the Nazi?

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:12.880
 - No, he sure was.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.400
 - Didn't we cover another person?

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.240
 There was another,

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.840
 there was genuinely another Rudolph Hasse.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.840
 - Really?

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.000
 - Oh, he was called Rudolph Hasse,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:21.840
 the avocado man.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.680
 - Oh, the avocado guy.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.640
 - Yes, oh, unfortunately.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.600
 - The guy behind the house avocado was called Rudolph Hasse.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.440
 - Wow.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.200
 (laughing)

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.960
 - This one was the Nazi,

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.160
 and presumably train enthusiast.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.400
 - Was he still alive when--

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.480
 - He watched, he's found out prison.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.880
 He used to watch it in East,

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.480
 in Dallas and Dynasty with his two favorite TV shows.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.440
 - He did care.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.280
 - Did he?

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.620
 - They were all bad.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.080
 (laughing)

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.560
 - That is retcalling, Alex.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.820
 (laughing)

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.400
 (upbeat music)

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.680
 - Okay, that's it.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.720
 That is all of our facts.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.080
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.880

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.120
 - Oh, I've quit Twitter.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.680
 - Are you on, are you on Instagram?

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.520
 - No.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.360
 - Are you on anything?

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.200
 - Are you on Be Real?

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.200
 - Be Real, no.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.040
 (laughing)

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:16.880
 - That's good, that one.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:17.720
 - I'm still on Bebo.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.560

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.520
 (laughing)

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.120
 - No, don't be disgusting.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:22.960
 That sounds horrible.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:23.800
 What is that?

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.640
 (laughing)

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.880
 - Mafia-based porn sites.

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.120
 (laughing)

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.040

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.600
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.240
 All of our previous episodes are up there.

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.160
 Do check them out.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.520
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.720
 We will see you then.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.840
 Goodbye.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.420
