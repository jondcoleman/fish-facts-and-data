 [music]

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,840
 Hey everybody, Dan and Andy here.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,520
 Just wanted to let you know our special guest on this week's fish

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,960
 is none other than old friend of the podcast,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,000
 your friend of mine, Alex Bell.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,480
 That's right, Alex has returned.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,880
 I mean he hasn't been on for ages,

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,080
 but he has been there in the background the whole time.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,680
 Anytime you hear a song or a noise.

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,480
 Shadowy, the spider master.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,440
 But now he's back, he's funnier than ever.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,960
 We can't wait for you to hear it.

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,080
 He's brilliant, it's gonna be great.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,520
 So now I guess with no further ado,

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,360
 let's get on with the only podcast

16
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,480
 any of us has ever made or will ever make.

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,840
 Right Dan?

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,640
 Ah, actually I've got a bit of news.

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,000
 What?

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,520
 Yeah, I don't want this to be a shock,

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,000
 but I've actually launched a new podcast.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,800
 Alright, what's it called?

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,440
 It's called We Can Be Weirdos.

24
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,640
 Oh, I see, and I guess it's just about solid facts though, right?

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
 It's about stuff with a strong, evidential base.

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,240
 Well, let's ignore that question quickly

27
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,880
 and focus on what the show is about.

28
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,160
 So it's a weekly show where I sit down with someone remarkable

29
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,280
 and I try and find out all the weird stuff

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,080
 that they believe in and all the weird stuff

31
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,520
 they do in their life.

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,440
 So it features everyone from British museum curators

33
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,960
 like Irving Finkel who told me stuff about how he sits on buses

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
 and stares at the back of people's head

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,160
 trying to make them turn around.

36
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,720
 It's got a Betsy Cameron who used to be a part

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
 of the Children of God cult but who escaped

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,880
 and wrote a fascinating memoir about it.

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,280
 There's Steve Feltham who is the Guinness World Record

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,360
 for the longest continuous search for the Loch Ness Monster.

41
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
 Dan Aykroyd is coming on.

42
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,920
 There's so many amazing guests

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,040
 and it's a weekly show where I ask them to tell me

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,760
 about every single weird belief that they have.

45
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,600
 - That's right.

46
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,280
 And guys, the rest of us know

47
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,440
 how hard Dan's been working on this.

48
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,480
 It sounds absolutely great.

49
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,720
 It's called We Can Be Weirdos.

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,000
 Give it a go wherever you get your podcasts now.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,840
 And we should say it's all based on Dan's book,

52
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,240
 The Theory of Everything Else,

53
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,480
 which is out now in the UK in paperback

54
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,280
 and it's out in North America on the 27th of June.

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,080
 Louis Theroux himself has called it

56
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,760
 totally compelling and utterly bizarre.

57
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
 - That's right.

58
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,040
 - So it would mean the world to me

59
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,280
 if you all fish listeners would subscribe to it,

60
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,680
 follow it, give it a listen

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,640
 and also pick up a copy of my book

62
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,560
 and okay, okay, okay, back to the actual good podcast.

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
 Here we go.

64
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
 On with the show.

65
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,400
 On with the podcast.

66
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,000
 (upbeat music)

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:26,440
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

68
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,880
 of Know Such Thing as a Fish,

69
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,640
 a weekly podcast coming to you

70
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,720
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

71
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,320
 James Harkin and Alex Bell.

74
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,560
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

75
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,720
 And in a particular order, here we go.

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,680
 Starting with fact number one and that is Alex.

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,160
 - My fact this week is that when the founder

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,320
 of the budget supermarket chain Aldi

80
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,200
 was kidnapped in the 1970s,

81
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,600
 he successfully negotiated a discount off his own ransom.

82
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,640
 - Brilliant.

83
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,280
 Did he claim that he was going off?

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,680
 And that result, he had a yellow sticker on him, brilliant.

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,240
 - Oh, he's such a good idea.

86
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,320
 So this guy is called Theo Albrecht.

87
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,360
 He founded Aldi with his brother Carl.

88
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,120
 And they've got quite an interesting story

89
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,200
 in how they founded the supermarket.

90
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,160
 But in the 1970s, when he was one of the richest people

91
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,360
 in the world, he was kidnapped at gunpoint

92
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,520
 by a convicted burglar called Paul Cron.

93
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,720
 - Diamond Paul. - Nick was Diamond, yeah.

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,280
 And his crooked lawyer, apparently,

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,240
 who had gambling debts called Heinz Joachim Ollenberg.

96
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,160
 - Joachim. - Joachim Diamond Paul.

97
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,840
 - Home alone, wet bandits, kind of duo.

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
 - And yeah.

99
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,360
 - They kidnapped him for 17 days and held him in an office.

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,800
 - What, cupboard, wasn't he?

101
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,160
 - Yeah, he was in a cupboard, he was in a cupboard.

102
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,400
 And apparently his appearance was so nondescript

103
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,360
 and he sort of wore quite kind of cheap suits

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
 because he was as money pinching

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,640
 as his discount supermarket reputation suggests.

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
 They had to ask him for ID to check

107
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,600
 that they definitely kidnapped a billionaire.

108
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,440
 - The thing was that he didn't do any interviews,

109
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,960
 did he, or anything like that, right?

110
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,520
 He was really not very well known at the time.

111
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,720
 I read a US newspaper article from the week

112
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,000
 when he got kidnapped and they described him

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,640
 as West Germany's least known millionaire.

114
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,400
 - Yeah, wow. - So no one knew

115
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,120
 what he looked like, he was just a name.

116
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,680
 - So he was kept for 17 days.

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,800
 He negotiates a cheaper ransom and they agreed to it.

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,920
 A bishop comes and delivers it.

119
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,280
 - The Bishop of Essen. - Yeah.

120
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,760
 - Which is the city that they were from.

121
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,600
 - Yeah. - I guess it's where

122
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,440
 they lived at the time.

123
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
 - But I didn't realize that was a bishop's responsibility

124
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,000
 to do it. - He mediated.

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
 Yeah, I mean, what a call to get as the bishop.

126
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,400
 You must never get that.

127
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,240
 - No.

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,160
 - But then he was, isn't he the one who left the money?

129
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,040
 - Yes. - The actual--

130
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,880
 - Yeah, he did the handover.

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,480
 He pays the cash. - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

132
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,840
 - But then, and I think Albrecht stayed with him

133
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,720
 for 24 hours afterwards, stayed with the bishop.

134
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
 - Why?

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,840
 - Because the police were kept out of it completely

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,880
 because the family didn't want the police involved

137
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,680
 'cause they thought he might be in danger.

138
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,040
 And the kidnappers said they wanted

139
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,160
 the 24 hour period to get away.

140
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,440
 And so they said, okay, well he'll stay with the bishop

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,960
 for 24 hours and then after that time, we'll let him go

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,120
 and he'll tell the police who he's seen and stuff.

143
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,480
 - Okay, so he gets out, the bishop,

144
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,000
 they get these 24 hours and--

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,240
 - They catch them as well.

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,880
 - And they catch them, yeah, that's right.

147
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,600
 - And they only get half the money back.

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,880
 - And to the dying day of the two guys,

149
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,640
 they never recovered the missing 3.5 million.

150
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,600
 - And they died within a month of each other.

151
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
 - How weird is that?

152
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,120
 'Cause they were about 20 years different in age.

153
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,960
 - That's so romantic.

154
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,360
 - No, it was within six years, I think.

155
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,560
 - Within a decade, six, yeah.

156
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
 - Oh, yep.

157
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
 - Almost 87, the other was 93.

158
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
 - But no, so after he gets let out,

159
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,200
 Theo goes even more recluse.

160
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
 He goes into total lockdown.

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,960
 No photographs are gonna be taken of him evermore.

162
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,120
 He is, every time he gets into a car,

163
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,280
 it's an armored car.

164
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,200
 A different route every single day

165
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,960
 when he's going into his office.

166
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,120
 If he's staying somewhere,

167
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,480
 he goes and he finds the exits immediately.

168
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,680
 So it's obviously a huge trauma on this experience.

169
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,520
 - But he also--

170
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,600
 - Sorry, I know one thing

171
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,200
 that will make you interested in him, especially Dan,

172
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,420
 which is that Forbes described the brothers,

173
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,320
 the Old Brecht brothers, Theo and Carl,

174
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,240
 who co-founded Aldi,

175
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,040
 described them as more elusive than the Yeti.

176
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,460
 - Ooh.

177
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,480
 - I'm pretty sure like the Yeti doesn't have like a--

178
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,320
 - An armored car.

179
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,760
 - A business trail, like a paper trail.

180
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,780
 He's not registered with the company's house.

181
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,960
 (all laughing)

182
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,760
 - Also, that doesn't make me more interested.

183
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,720
 If he was a Yeti hunter, that's interesting.

184
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,640
 Just saying the word Yeti in a sentence

185
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,960
 doesn't immediately mean--

186
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,680
 - You've got a higher threshold for interesting--

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,760
 - I do. - Okay, okay.

188
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,200
 - I think my favorite bit of this whole story

189
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,120
 was that after the whole ordeal,

190
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,280
 Alde Brecht went to court to try and claim the money

191
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,520
 that was paid as the ransom

192
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,480
 as a tax-aductible business expense,

193
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
 which is brilliant.

194
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,200
 I don't think he was successful,

195
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,880
 but like, that's so cool.

196
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,800
 - I think you can still do that, certainly in some places.

197
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,200
 - If you have a good accountant,

198
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,000
 'cause I think it's in America, it's been done.

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,920
 - In America for sure, yeah, famously Yeti.

200
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
 - I guess it's-- - John Paul Yeti.

201
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,600
 - It is a business expense, isn't it?

202
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,960
 - Yeah. - Well, or is it?

203
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,000
 - If the person who is abducted

204
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 is the CEO of the company,

205
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
 then it's to do with the company.

206
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,240
 I think that's the argument.

207
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,280
 - His brother Carl stumped up a lot of money

208
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,640
 for that as well, the ransom.

209
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
 He was part of it.

210
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,880
 But yeah, I love how much the Alde Brecht brothers

211
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,880
 were really sort of stingy with their cash.

212
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
 - They're brilliant.

213
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,320
 I think Theo was the one who,

214
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,240
 they used to approve all the designs for all the shops,

215
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,680
 and there was one where he was given the plans,

216
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
 and he said, "The plans are fine,

217
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,600
 "but the paper you printed on is too thick.

218
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,760
 "Print it on thinner, cheaper paper."

219
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,120
 - He used to famously use pencils right down to the end.

220
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,560
 Like, when you see people with the pencil meets the rubber,

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
 he would be using pencils like that,

222
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,320
 and if he walked into the office of the Alde officers

223
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,840
 and he saw that the lights were on,

224
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,240
 but he could see that you could see

225
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,320
 in a room without the lights,

226
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,840
 he'd go around turning off all the lights.

227
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,920
 - It's so screechy, isn't it?

228
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
 - Yeah.

229
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,520
 - I did read one article that said,

230
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
 "He and his brother were the first people

231
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,080
 "to ever turn off the lights in the room

232
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,120
 "because they were worried that they were wasting electricity."

233
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,800
 What a thing to invent.

234
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,640
 - That's great.

235
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,160
 - I thought I was thinking about the timing.

236
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
 - Yeah, exactly.

237
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
 - He invented being a dad.

238
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
 - Yeah.

239
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
 - The timing almost works.

240
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,800
 - That's really funny.

241
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,240
 I think the story is very interesting

242
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,600
 'cause they founded it together, didn't they?

243
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 They founded Alde together.

244
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,320
 - Yeah, their mother ran a shop, like, I mean,

245
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,600
 like, so they took over the shop as part of their journey,

246
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,680
 but she was the one who really started there.

247
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
 I think she does a little bit of credit.

248
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,080
 - Yeah, you're right, that's a good point.

249
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,320
 And then actually they were dragoon into helping their mum

250
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,400
 because their father, he's been a coal miner

251
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
 and he got emphysema, so he couldn't really work,

252
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,920
 so they had to support the family.

253
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,840
 But anyway, they fell out

254
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,680
 over whether or not they should sell cigarettes

255
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,960
 in their shops, and I think Theo said we should

256
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,800
 and Kyle said we shouldn't.

257
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,120
 - And I think it was for shoplifting reasons.

258
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
 - Yeah.

259
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,760
 - I think, yeah, one thought that--

260
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
 - They didn't care about the health reasons.

261
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,760
 - It was its dinginess as well.

262
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,480
 - Despite their father having emphysema,

263
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
 they were, it was more about the deal.

264
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,320
 - Is that so interesting?

265
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,440
 Okay, and then they had this thing, the Alde Equator.

266
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,520
 - Yeah, that's incredible.

267
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,120
 - Where they divided Germany top to bottom

268
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,160
 and north was Theo's territory.

269
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,040
 - Not with any kind of wall, we should say, like--

270
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
 - So many people died crossing the Alde Equator.

271
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,680
 (all laughing)

272
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,200
 - People were desperately trying to get to those.

273
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
 - 'Cause they did, so this was 1961,

274
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
 and they had about 300 Aldes all over the country,

275
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,160
 and that's what got split up between them.

276
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,080
 And if you look at the logos,

277
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,560
 they are different colors across the Alde Equator,

278
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,200
 and so they are definitely two different operations

279
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
 that are going on.

280
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
 - Ironically, if you were kidnapped in Germany,

281
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,680
 you could use that to work out

282
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,920
 which half of the country you were in.

283
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,760
 - Yes!

284
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,600
 - Oh my God, yeah.

285
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,160
 - What a brilliant idea.

286
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
 - What a brilliant idea.

287
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
 - There's still different companies now, aren't they?

288
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,880
 - Mm-hmm.

289
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,680
 - Alde Nord and Alde Sud.

290
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,600
 - Yeah, that's right.

291
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,920
 - And I think, which ones do we have?

292
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,120
 We have Alde Nord.

293
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,960
 - No, British Alde Sud.

294
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,800
 - No, we have Alde Sud.

295
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,640
 - British Alde Sud, yeah, yeah.

296
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,680
 - And in America, they have them both,

297
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,240
 but one of them's called Trader Joe's.

298
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
 - Wow.

299
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,320
 - Yeah, that's what Trader Joe is, I never realized, yeah.

300
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,600
 And Alde itself is the name Alde that we said,

301
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,520
 it's a poor mancher of Albrecht discount.

302
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,360
 - Discount.

303
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,600
 (all laughing)

304
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,720
 - I was trying to remember what the German version was.

305
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,560
 - His brother came up with that, didn't he?

306
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,280
 (all laughing)

307
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,400
 - Distingy cunt.

308
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,120
 (all laughing)

309
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
 - The two of us is a real-called discount adaptor, right?

310
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,780
 (all laughing)

311
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,600
 - Imagine, like, big billboards with them kind of.

312
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,240
 (all laughing)

313
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
 Over the border.

314
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,200
 (all laughing)

315
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,360
 - I'm with discount, I'm with discount, yeah.

316
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,160
 (all laughing)

317
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,200
 - I think they liked each other.

318
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,520
 I think they got on perfectly well.

319
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
 They just disagreed over this.

320
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,960
 - I think it was amicable, yeah, I think it was amicable, yeah.

321
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

322
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,640
 - But I've never read into Alde before.

323
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,280
 I've been to Alde many times.

324
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,360
 God damn it, I love it so much.

325
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,240
 I don't want to treat this as an advert,

326
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,120
 but what an operation.

327
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,520
 Well, okay, so for example,

328
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,480
 they don't stock as many items as a regular supermarket will,

329
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
 and they've never compromised on that.

330
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,520
 It's grown ever so slightly,

331
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,360
 but an average supermarket might have something

332
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,200
 like 200,000 different items,

333
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,240
 whereas they might have 2,000 items.

334
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,960
 It has grown since the earlier days

335
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,080
 when it came to Britain.

336
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,960
 But one of the things was everyone who was working there

337
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,720
 was required to memorize the price

338
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,680
 of every single item in the shop, so every 2,000 item,

339
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
 which meant that there was a thing that's known as Alde panic,

340
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,000
 which is when you get to the checkout,

341
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,920
 the panic is I can't pack my bags as quickly

342
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,040
 as they're running the stuff through the till.

343
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
 So you get a bit worried.

344
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,800
 - And that's really common now,

345
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,000
 'cause they're so fast at scanning.

346
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,840
 - Well, here's the thing.

347
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,640
 The reason they're so fast at scanning these days,

348
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,480
 'cause this is another Alde innovation,

349
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,840
 is if you buy a product from any supermarket,

350
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,920
 you got a barcode, you get there,

351
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,680
 the person's looking around for the barcode.

352
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,120
 If you look on Alde products that are specifically Alde,

353
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,040
 they print the barcode all over it,

354
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,160
 so no matter where you turn the product,

355
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,200
 it scans exactly, boop, and it's right through.

356
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
 - Yeah, 'cause they also open, I think in the '50s,

357
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,800
 the first self-service grocery store in Germany.

358
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,720
 But in those days, self-service meant you go in

359
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
 and get stuff off the shelves and bring it to the checkout,

360
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,440
 as opposed to giving your list to a clerk

361
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,560
 who were going to get it for you.

362
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,440
 So that must have been a huge efficiency.

363
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
 - And they brought in shopping trolleys.

364
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,280
 And I think they were the first company

365
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,080
 to bring in the shopping trolleys

366
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,720
 where you had to put a coin in.

367
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,280
 - That's what they say, yeah.

368
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,240
 - I read an article with the communications director at Alde,

369
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,040
 and he said, "We're always amazed

370
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,520
 by the pay it forward spirit

371
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,760
 that happens in our parking lots."

372
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,240
 And apparently they reckon that in Germany, at least,

373
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,840
 people will pay for the next person's trolley.

374
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,560
 And I just, I've never seen that happen

375
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,280
 in my entire life in the UK.

376
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,840
 - I'd go around checking to see if anyone's left a quid.

377
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,240
 I could lose an hour or two sometimes

378
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
 if you've got a single, you know.

379
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,080
 - I literally only have one quid that I keep in my car

380
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,960
 for that thing,

381
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,800
 as I don't really use cash these days, right?

382
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,640
 - Yeah, right.

383
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,680
 - Do you keep it on a string?

384
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,040
 (all laughing)

385
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,280
 'Cause you're sounding a bit like Theodore Albrecht.

386
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,800
 (all laughing)

387
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
 - A bit like, I can't say.

388
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,720
 - They got big in Germany

389
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,560
 because they started looking at the models

390
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,120
 of what was happening in America with grocery stores.

391
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,680
 And so there was a Memphis grocer

392
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,840
 that was called Pigley Wiggly.

393
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,000
 So it was Pigley Wiggly, Hogley Wogley,

394
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,640
 and Handy Andy was the last one.

395
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,480
 These were all of the things going on

396
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,560
 in America at the time.

397
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,840
 And yeah, so they became Germany's--

398
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,040
 - So Pigley Wiggly was famously the first place

399
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,680
 that would let you take things off the shelves

400
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
 and put them in your trolley

401
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,080
 and then pay for them afterwards.

402
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
 - Exactly.

403
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,200
 - And I'm not sure if we said it here,

404
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,040
 we might not have done,

405
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,520
 but basically people didn't want to do it

406
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,720
 'cause they felt like they were shoplifting.

407
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
 - Well, I feel like that with the new Amazon fresh tools

408
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
 when you walk in and you scan.

409
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,800
 - Yeah, but you go and wear a motorbike helmet, don't you?

410
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
 - You don't scan anything and you're shouting

411
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,080
 and all of the baseball bat.

412
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,400
 - I actually was gonna kidnap Jeff Bezos,

413
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,000
 but he just walked into my house, into my cupboard.

414
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Two weeks later, they put loads of money in my cupboard.

415
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,840
 It was perfect.

416
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,600
 - So when you go to Audi, there's always,

417
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
 and I didn't realize this was a big thing,

418
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
 but in the middle of Audi,

419
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,240
 there's always this weird aisle

420
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,080
 where it's just random stuff.

421
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
 - The room of requirement is sort of like,

422
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,680
 every time it's different.

423
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,200
 It's huge. - It's so bizarre.

424
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,520
 So the middle aisle and it's sort of famous

425
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,120
 amongst online people.

426
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,560
 There's Twitter accounts where what random thing

427
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,040
 have you found in the middle aisle?

428
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,560
 Yeah, it's massive.

429
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,400
 Yeah, so everything from motion activated,

430
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,000
 toilet bowl, night lights, you know,

431
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,320
 it's just randomly to traffic cones.

432
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,520
 - It feels like it fell off the back of the lorry,

433
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,360
 kind of vibe.

434
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

435
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,240
 - Which definitely is not the case.

436
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,600
 - Sorry, they definitely did do that, obviously.

437
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,040
 - No, 'cause I remember like,

438
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,240
 you would always get like a flyer through the post

439
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,600
 and it would tell you what was gonna be

440
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,560
 in the middle aisle in the next month or so.

441
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,400
 - Oh, really?

442
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,120
 - You know that there was gonna be a canoe there

443
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,760
 and you'd be like, oh, shit, we gotta get there

444
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,520
 on the second Tuesday.

445
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,320
 Well, they only have a certain amount.

446
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,120
 And so if it was something really cool,

447
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,840
 everyone in the town would want to get there

448
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,680
 as quickly as possible together.

449
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,720
 - And they never restock ever, so it's just that.

450
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
 It's like a one flash sale.

451
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,080
 - It gets called the Isle of Shite.

452
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,920
 - That's it.

453
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,760
 (laughing)

454
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
 - It's very good.

455
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,440
 - Yeah, it's very good.

456
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,760
 - One other thing on German kidnapping.

457
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,600
 - Oh, yeah.

458
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,560
 - I think German.

459
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,440
 Do you know about the Pied Piper of Hamlin?

460
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,280
 - Yeah.

461
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,560
 - He famously kidnapped all the children of Hamlin.

462
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,200
 - I never thought of it that way.

463
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
 - Ah.

464
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,320
 - I thought he got rid of the rats.

465
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,360
 - And the parents didn't pay him?

466
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,620
 - Yeah, so then he did the same thing.

467
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,880
 He played his pipe and led them.

468
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,400
 He basically hypnotized children to come with him.

469
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,240
 - Oh, yeah.

470
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,480
 - So there's a question of like consent, really.

471
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,640
 - Yeah, it does sound like there is.

472
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,480
 - There's no question.

473
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,320
 There was no consent.

474
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,080
 Like, basically he took all the children out of the town

475
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,000
 'cause they didn't pay his bills.

476
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
 - So he was fictional.

477
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,960
 - Well, there was an entry in Hamlin town records

478
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,400
 dating to 1384 that says that it is 100 years

479
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,240
 since our children left.

480
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
 And that fits in with the date of when people said

481
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,960
 this happened which was in 1284.

482
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,480
 And it supposedly happened on the 26th of June,

483
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
 the day of St. John and St. Paul.

484
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,800
 And 130 children in Hamlin disappeared.

485
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,120
 And that's what the story is based on.

486
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
 - Was there a day of St. George and St. Ringo as well?

487
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,600
 (laughing)

488
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,440
 - But we now have theories as to what the Pied Piper was.

489
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,600
 So we think that possibly the Pied Piper story

490
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,080
 is a fictional account of something that actually happened.

491
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,440
 And the children did go missing

492
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,760
 and did get taken by someone.

493
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,320
 Can you guess what the actual job

494
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,200
 of the real life Pied Piper probably was?

495
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 - Oh, okay.

496
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,320
 - Are we gonna, is this guessable from?

497
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,640
 - School bus driver.

498
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,560
 - School bus, that's really good.

499
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,000
 I mean, the dates don't quite work for school buses.

500
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
 1284.

501
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,680
 - I've got it, I've got it.

502
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,520
 - It's called cart driver.

503
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,360
 - Swine herd.

504
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,200
 - Swine herd.

505
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,280
 - Dresses the children up as pigs, really.

506
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
 - No, that's not what the theory says.

507
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,920
 - Okay, how was he one of the wiggles then?

508
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,200
 (laughing)

509
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,260
 - Aldi trolley manager at the Minwood Free Trollies.

510
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,960
 - Well, according to most theories at the moment,

511
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,560
 he could have been a recruitment consultant.

512
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,400
 - Okay.

513
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,720
 (laughing)

514
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
 - I followed that in the street.

515
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,040
 I find it so beguiling.

516
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,880
 - These children were now working like Deloitte.

517
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,440
 (laughing)

518
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,800
 - There was an economic depression around that time

519
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,440
 and a lot of the youth of various towns

520
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,280
 were taken out of German sort of villages

521
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,200
 and taken to the bigger areas of Western Europe.

522
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,920
 And they had locators or recruiters

523
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,360
 that would go around these towns

524
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
 and try and bring the youth out there

525
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,480
 to work in different places.

526
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,800
 And so there's one possibility

527
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,000
 that the Piper story is based on a recruitment consultant.

528
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,840
 - Wow.

529
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,000
 - Well, they all got sort of free mugs.

530
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,880
 (laughing)

531
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
 - Came back later with those cool wireless phone headsets.

532
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,000
 - Pages.

533
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,580
 (upbeat music)

534
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,660
 (upbeat music)

535
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,780
 - It is time for fact number two, that is Andy.

536
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,940
 - My fact is that the world's largest collection

537
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,700
 of model trains doesn't fit on standard model train tracks.

538
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,540
 (laughing)

539
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,220
 - I'm really pleased you added the word standard in there

540
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,340
 'cause it's a big discussion.

541
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,700
 - Yeah, we had a big email chat about this.

542
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,780
 No, but I just got to say,

543
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,620
 Alex has got in front of him actual like,

544
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,220
 this is the weirdest bit of research I've seen ever said.

545
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,300
 - I'm not going to go into it, don't worry.

546
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,900
 - I'm going to say the basic fact

547
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,740
 and then we'll have the argument.

548
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,580
 - Yeah.

549
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,760
 - By the way, thank you to Neil Gibson

550
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,560
 who sent in this fact,

551
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,620
 who didn't realize the chaos he was unleashing

552
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,480
 in our previously happy team.

553
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,420
 This is something that's from the National Rail Museum

554
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,260
 in York.

555
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,820
 They have a collection of 610 model railway vehicles

556
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,020
 all made by the same man

557
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,180
 who was called James Peale Richards, 1902 to '99.

558
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,780
 And he was incredibly devoted to detail and accuracy

559
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,940
 and he thought he could get his models more accurate

560
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,300
 if you made them to a 33 millimeter gauge.

561
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,860
 So the gauge is the distance between the two train tracks

562
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,820
 and the normal gauge for model trains is 32 millimeters

563
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,040
 and they're not compatible

564
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,020
 with the vast majority of model railway lines

565
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,600
 and even the National Rail Museum don't have a layout

566
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,480
 where they can put these trains on a train track.

567
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,320
 - Yeah.

568
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,140
 - So I just think it's very sweet fact, I think.

569
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,260
 - I don't want to make this fact even more contentious

570
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,340
 but I have a feeling it was 612, not 610.

571
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,500
 What did you guys read?

572
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,100
 Did you maybe forgive me for a fractional rounding?

573
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,420
 - The idea is a lot of these model trains,

574
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,780
 you take anything that's one foot long

575
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,620
 and you make it seven millimeters long

576
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,260
 and you do the same for everything else

577
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,660
 in all the trains, right?

578
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,080
 Now, if you do that, then you get your gauge

579
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,860
 to be exactly 33 millimeters to a 0.01 of a millimeter.

580
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,020
 So it's pretty much 33 millimeters

581
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,460
 but historically they've always had 32 millimeter gauges.

582
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,380
 And so all the other trains that you would have

583
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,580
 are slightly not exact.

584
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,420
 - That's like the Hornby standard for example.

585
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,260
 - The Hornby standard, yeah.

586
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,580
 - The track you'll find is that width.

587
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,740
 - A lot of them, it's called the O gauge.

588
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,260
 But basically he decided,

589
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,180
 well, I want mine to be exactly right

590
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,100
 so I'm gonna get this one millimeter difference

591
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,260
 even though I won't be able to go on hardly any tracks.

592
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,100
 I'm gonna make it because I want it to be perfect.

593
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,220
 - Yeah, he's a hero.

594
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,140
 Did he make his own tracks?

595
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,100
 He must have, right?

596
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,220
 - I think as I went there and I had an amazing two days,

597
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,380
 I stayed up at night.

598
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,220
 (laughing)

599
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,340
 - Did you, seriously?

600
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,660
 - Was there a sleeper train in the...

601
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,500
 (laughing)

602
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,460
 - That was so great.

603
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,020
 - Alex Krammick, one finger into the sleeper train.

604
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,420
 (laughing)

605
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,940
 - No, because they have actual other stuff,

606
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,780
 they don't just have model,

607
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,740
 they have actual trains there and all sorts of that.

608
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,620
 No, it's an amazing, and I remember seeing them,

609
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,660
 they've got this fantastic,

610
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,780
 I think it's called an open archive

611
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,060
 where they've got all this stuff that they can't,

612
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,660
 they don't really have room to sort of display

613
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,140
 in proper museum, just like thrown on the shelves

614
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,460
 and sort of displays, you can see it.

615
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,340
 And I remember also seeing they've got scale models

616
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,500
 of the Queen Victoria's Royal train,

617
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,260
 which is all sort of entirely plush inside

618
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,220
 with a velvet upholstered toilet and things like that.

619
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,140
 - In miniature?

620
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,380
 - Yeah, yeah, this is all miniature.

621
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,220
 When they were designing and building the train,

622
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,580
 the actual full-on steam trains,

623
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,260
 they used to make scale models of the steam trains

624
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,540
 that are about, I'd say like a foot wide

625
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,460
 and several feet long,

626
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,780
 that were full-on working models to check that they worked

627
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,740
 and they were all kind of the right size.

628
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,100
 So they have these really stonking great models

629
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,420
 of like working steam trains.

630
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,060
 They've also got, you've mentioned it before on the podcast,

631
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
 there's a massive train set

632
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,340
 that was used to train signal operators.

633
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,180
 So was the train set,

634
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,020
 but the fun of the train set

635
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,500
 was like all about the signals and not the trains.

636
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,540
 - So can I ask, Alex,

637
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,500
 did you see the entire collection

638
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,060
 of J.P. Richards' trains when you were there?

639
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,340
 - Well, I don't know because there's loads on the wall.

640
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,780
 I remember them, they're all stacked up on the wall.

641
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,180
 - You've seen them, 'cause they're all there.

642
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,700
 - But I don't know if I saw 610.

643
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,980
 - What's really interesting is that J.P. Richards

644
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,180
 never saw the entire collection himself, we think.

645
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,840
 And that's because he always kept them in his home

646
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,660
 where most of them were in boxes.

647
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,060
 So they were never all out at the same time.

648
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,260
 And when he donated them to the museum,

649
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,340
 he was really, really sick.

650
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,420
 It was just before he died.

651
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,780
 He was too ill to travel.

652
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,100
 So when it was on display, he never got to see it.

653
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,900
 So he actually never saw his entire collection on display.

654
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,260
 - I'm really sad about that, 'cause what a hero,

655
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,980
 what a great guy, I love it.

656
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,300
 - The collection is still growing,

657
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,820
 but actually I should quickly say thank you

658
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,340
 to my friend Chris Valkoinen who is the associate archivist

659
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,420
 at the National Rail Museum,

660
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,680
 who sent me loads of stuff for this, absolutely brilliant.

661
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,480
 But yeah, the collection is still growing

662
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,880
 'cause a lot of his wagons weren't quite finished

663
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,960
 when he got there.

664
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,480
 So he left them to other people to finish them.

665
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,880
 'Cause he wanted the entirety of the train system

666
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,680
 of the London and Northwestern trains.

667
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,800
 - Well, that's what we all wanna see, really, isn't it?

668
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,080
 - Between 1902 and 1944.

669
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,240
 So he wanted everything.

670
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,640
 And they weren't all exactly done at that time.

671
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,160
 So some people are still doing them now.

672
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,920
 They're still kind of making them better and better.

673
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,280
 - It is the most impressive thing

674
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,540
 when you see the detail that someone goes into

675
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,940
 to recreating an area, 'cause you make,

676
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,780
 it's not, these aren't things you buy from the shop.

677
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,780
 You create the buildings and you create,

678
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,780
 and this is like when you're making a whole landscape,

679
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,620
 so the tracks, the trees, the buildings around it.

680
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,660
 I've only ever played with two model train sets before.

681
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,500
 - Oh yeah.

682
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,580
 - And they belonged to Eddie Izzard.

683
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,660
 So.

684
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,500
 - Plank.

685
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,340
 - Plank drop.

686
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,180
 - No, no, no.

687
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,340
 - Trust you, you'd have a celebrity train set anecdote.

688
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,220
 - This is not, it's not what it sounds like.

689
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,060
 So every time we go to Bexhill on C,

690
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,600
 which is, my family goes there a lot.

691
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,440
 I always take my boys to the Bexhill Museum

692
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,000
 and inside is Eddie Izzard's childhood model train set

693
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,960
 that her father had built when Eddie's brother was born,

694
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,200
 started building it then.

695
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,120
 And then Eddie's mother got a bit ill

696
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
 and eventually she passed away.

697
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,960
 And part of the project of keeping themselves busy

698
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,480
 from the sort of, you know, the horrible depression of it all

699
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,440
 was to continue building this train set.

700
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
 So you can go and press buttons

701
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
 and it sends two trains around

702
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
 and it's where Eddie's dad worked.

703
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,380
 You can see the train he used to get into London

704
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,940
 and it shows all the buildings around

705
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,540
 and they've commissioned all of Bexhill on C

706
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,620
 as a train set as well.

707
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,220
 Eddie's kind of put money into that

708
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,660
 and you press buttons and it goes around.

709
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,500
 It snows.

710
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,340
 - I love that.

711
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,180
 - It's incredible.

712
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,540
 Did you guys read about Simon George?

713
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,860
 - No, no, no.

714
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,300
 - Simon George is a model railway fan.

715
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,240
 Currently, currently modeling and making huge sets.

716
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,420
 So in 2021, he had just made a model railway

717
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,540
 which was really big, was 61 meters.

718
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,900
 And it was a model of a specific line

719
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,200
 from where he'd grown up in the 80s.

720
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,880
 It was the Calder Valley, lots of coal fired trains.

721
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,200
 And it's one of Britain's biggest,

722
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,240
 if not the biggest model trains set.

723
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,320
 Really impressive.

724
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,600
 Spent eight years working on it.

725
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,160
 And he met someone.

726
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,760
 He met his girlfriend while he was making it.

727
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,600
 - Wow.

728
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,440
 - Yeah.

729
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,400
 - That is amazing.

730
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,240
 - This is the thing.

731
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,080
 - Well, wait a minute.

732
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,920
 Okay, fun.

733
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,760
 - So he was interviewed about it.

734
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,000
 And he said, when I first met her,

735
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,800
 she didn't know I was building this.

736
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,720
 And what had happened was

737
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,480
 it wasn't in his home, this train that he was building.

738
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,640
 He'd leased a mill

739
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,900
 'cause it had this enormous basement, right?

740
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,980
 - So, and he said, okay,

741
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,340
 she knew I leased a mill with a huge basement, Simon said.

742
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,540
 But I kind of led her to believe I was a wine merchant

743
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,340
 because that sounded cooler than building a model railway.

744
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,820
 - I'm just imagining the discussion that he had

745
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,820
 when he said, now we've been getting on very well.

746
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,180
 I think there could be something here.

747
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,140
 I need to tell you that the basement in the mill,

748
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,940
 I've not let you go in.

749
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,220
 It's not a wine collection.

750
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,680
 - What was she a thought?

751
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,280
 - She turned up unannounced at his work one day.

752
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,680
 She wanted to surprise him.

753
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,660
 And she turned up to his wine merchant.

754
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,000
 - Oh my God.

755
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,080
 - What did he do?

756
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,580
 - Don't come in, I'm whanking.

757
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,680
 (all laughing)

758
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,080
 There are loads of bodies down here, don't worry.

759
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,060
 - This is where I keep a family locked up, come on.

760
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,760
 (all laughing)

761
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,280
 - He said, she wondered where all the wine was,

762
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,120
 but actually she really appreciated the detail

763
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,160
 and the artistic element.

764
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,840
 - Very, very cool.

765
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,340
 - Herman Göring, the Nazi, is also enthusiastic.

766
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,940
 - Who's Herman Göring, not the Nazi?

767
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,780
 (all laughing)

768
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,260
 - I don't think there's any others out there.

769
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,540
 He was an enthusiastic--

770
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,380
 - No.

771
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,620
 - Yeah, Nazis love trains.

772
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,500
 They love models, obviously.

773
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,340
 You know that famous big third Reich one.

774
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,180
 But--

775
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,260
 - No, sorry.

776
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,600
 Again, Alex, you spent two days in the National Royal Museum.

777
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,440
 - There's nothing to do with train models.

778
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,280
 No, no, sorry.

779
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,700
 That's a totally, totally off topic.

780
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,540
 But--

781
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,380
 - Did they have a big model?

782
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,300
 - The Hitler commissioned a huge model

783
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,500
 of what the center of Berlin was going to look like.

784
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,020
 And it's a really horrible, scary model that still exists.

785
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,860
 You can go see it there.

786
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,700
 - Okay, right.

787
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,100
 - And it's really bizarre and interesting.

788
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,320
 But I think that whole element of control from afar,

789
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,160
 you know the kind of--

790
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,000
 - You're saying Göring did the trains.

791
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,160
 - Göring had two train sets, just like Eddie is odd.

792
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,920
 One in the, no, just like, you've seen trains.

793
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,300
 Wait, you said you've seen two train sets in your life.

794
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,140
 - No, played with it twice.

795
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,980
 - Played with it twice.

796
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,820
 - You played with it twice.

797
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,660
 - Both of them were Eddie's, yeah.

798
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,680
 - Right, so okay, so Herman Göring had one train set

799
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,640
 in his attic and one in his basement.

800
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,480
 - Oh, yeah.

801
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,320
 - Okay.

802
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,400
 - And there are pictures of it.

803
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,920
 And they're really, it's pretty extensive,

804
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,960
 is that he lived, he lives in a big old Nazi house

805
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,480
 and had a huge attic and a massive basement.

806
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,220
 And there's a rumor that you can sort of maybe

807
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,360
 see evidence for in the pictures that there was,

808
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,120
 there were wires that went over the one in the attic

809
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,520
 that planes went across and you could drop little bombs

810
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,360
 out of the planes.

811
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,200
 - Okay, right.

812
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,960
 - Which is good fun.

813
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,160
 - Wow, they originated in Germany,

814
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,400
 didn't they, model railways, basically.

815
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,120
 There was a company called Marklin

816
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,600
 and they'd be making toys and stuff.

817
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,920
 But they mostly made dolls houses.

818
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,720
 The idea is you make a doll's house

819
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,400
 and you sell them the house.

820
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,640
 And then they have to buy the dolls to go inside

821
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,280
 and they have to buy the cookers and they have to buy

822
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,920
 the chairs and they have to buy all the bits and pieces.

823
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,320
 And they wanted something that boys would like.

824
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,560
 - How are the dolls gonna get to work?

825
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,400
 - Yeah.

826
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,120
 (all laughing)

827
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,300
 - And they just thought, well, by doing the railways,

828
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,640
 then we can sell the railway tracks,

829
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,080
 but then we can sell the stock

830
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
 and we can sell the little bushes that go,

831
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
 I don't know, I've never played with them.

832
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
 - There's another German connection,

833
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,360
 which is maybe the earliest ever model train

834
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,240
 belonged to the poet Goethe.

835
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,400
 - Did it? - Wow.

836
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,960
 - Clang yourself, mate.

837
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,400
 (all laughing)

838
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,620
 - This is from 1829, it's six years before Germany

839
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,880
 had even a railway, a steam railway of its own.

840
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,720
 - Wow.

841
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
 - Some English well-wishers gave him a tiny, tiny model

842
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,040
 of Stevenson's rocket, the earliest steam railway engine.

843
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,920
 I think the earliest steam railway engine.

844
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,940
 And it came with a set of wagons and rails

845
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,240
 and Goethe put it on his desk.

846
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,880
 I think he might have given it to his grandchildren

847
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,000
 at the time, 'cause he was an old man by that point.

848
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,440
 - Yeah, cool. - Wow.

849
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,960
 Do you wanna hear an incredibly, well, so, okay.

850
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,240
 Here's a fact about Moloroas.

851
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,400
 I'm just gonna tell you what. - Right.

852
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,800
 - Okay. - That's what we're all here for.

853
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,000
 (both laughing)

854
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,180
 - What a change of topic.

855
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,040
 (both laughing)

856
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,320
 - I know what's about to happen.

857
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,400
 - So, you know how you use different things to represent.

858
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
 So you might use a coffee stirrer as a piece of fencing.

859
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,240
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

860
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,560
 - Like things from our world.

861
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,600
 - Oh, okay, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

862
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,000
 - I see, yeah. - Okay.

863
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,320
 - You could use a marble as a boulder, for instance.

864
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,640
 - Yeah, you paint it or whatever, yeah, yeah, exactly.

865
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,900
 Okay, so do you know what they use to make coal?

866
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,640
 - Okay, so it's gotta be something that looks like coal,

867
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,280
 but is much smaller. - Yeah, mm.

868
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,320
 But maybe it's not the same color,

869
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,840
 but you could paint it black, right?

870
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,000
 - Is it not just small bits of coal?

871
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,600
 - They use coal. (both laughing)

872
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,920
 - Oh my God.

873
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,040
 - I hit it with a hammer and grinded it up small.

874
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,200
 - What? (both laughing)

875
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,360
 - Well, it's definitely a fact.

876
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,720
 - Is this by any chance the fact

877
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,840
 that you messaged us saying,

878
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,080
 "I just told my wife a fact,"

879
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,640
 and she said, "That's the dullest thing

880
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,560
 "you've ever said in your life?"

881
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,440
 - That's the fact.

882
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,280
 She just said, "Stop talking."

883
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,760
 (both laughing)

884
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,840
 - We found it so interesting, and it's so boring.

885
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,200
 - She took off her eye with this condition.

886
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,760
 (both laughing)

887
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,280
 - Amazing, Andy, great fact.

888
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,600
 - Great fact. - Thank you.

889
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,880
 Do you know the really tragic thing?

890
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,320
 - We last talked about "Model Railways" four years ago.

891
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,640
 I looked through my notes for that show.

892
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,480
 It was in there. (both laughing)

893
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,480
 - So, probably the most famous model railways in the world

894
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,000
 have to be the ones that we see in "Thomas the Tank Engine."

895
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,240
 "Thomas the Tank Engine."

896
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,760
 I mean, that's globally the biggest, most famous,

897
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,880
 and just a cool connection.

898
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,000
 So, there is famously the Fat Controller,

899
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,800
 who's now been renamed Sir Topham Hatt.

900
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,960
 - He was always called. - He was always his real name.

901
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,240
 - Yeah, but they kind of phased out the Fat Controller.

902
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,200
 He's in the cartoons.

903
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,440
 He's back to Sir Topham Hatt.

904
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,440
 And we know someone who was the real-life Sir Topham Hatt.

905
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,280
 - Sir Topham Hatt. - Yeah.

906
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,880
 - What do you mean that's in the vice?

907
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,560
 - No, so they used to have offices for "Thomas the Tank Engine."

908
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,160
 When children wrote in,

909
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
 they had an official Sir Topham Hatt,

910
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,520
 who would write letters back to the children.

911
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,840
 And we know that person.

912
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,080
 They've been on "Fish," they've been on "Fish."

913
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,560
 - Is it Craig Glenday? - Yes, Craig Glenday,

914
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,400
 Editor-in-Chief for the Guinness World Records.

915
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,160
 - Wow. - Okay, that's bizarre.

916
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,040
 When I was tiny, I wrote to Sir Topham Hatt.

917
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,640
 - No. - And I got a letter back.

918
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,760
 - Did you? - Oh, him.

919
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,960
 - It's just small coal.

920
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,960
 You're a really annoying child.

921
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:05,960
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

922
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,160
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1760,

923
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,040
 a book was publicly burned in Switzerland

924
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,080
 because it claimed that William Tell did not exist.

925
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,720
 - Is that a game? - Yeah.

926
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,800
 - Ah. - 'Cause I sort of think he did.

927
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
 I sort of think he did. - Oh, you're wrong.

928
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,360
 - Well, yeah, yeah. - Is it?

929
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,720
 - Well, publicly burned me then. - Is it like the Pied Piper,

930
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,240
 and he was just like a management consultant?

931
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,800
 - No, he's less historical than the Pied Piper, I would say.

932
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,320
 He was part of the foundation myth

933
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,920
 of the country of Switzerland, basically.

934
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,840
 - Yeah, he's kind of Robin Hood-esque, right?

935
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,320
 - Yeah, he is. - But in arrows to Dr. Power.

936
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,360
 - You're spot on, you know, shot an apple off his son's head.

937
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,480
 - That's the only thing I know.

938
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,320
 It's the only thing, like, shot an apple off his son's head.

939
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,920
 I didn't know any of the context.

940
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
 I just knew I never questioned it.

941
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,760
 - It was quite contrived, like, for some reason,

942
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,440
 he ended up in a situation where they were like,

943
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
 "Shoot it, or we'll kill you and your son,"

944
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,200
 and then he did it, and then they were like,

945
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,760
 "Well, how come you've got two arrows then?"

946
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,360
 And he was like, "Well, if I accidentally killed my son,

947
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,400
 "I was gonna shoot you."

948
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,600
 - It was quite cool, wasn't it?

949
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
 Because the reason this whole thing started

950
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,960
 was he was going through this town,

951
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,440
 which was called Altdorf, and he was...

952
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,520
 There's a guy there who was a bailiff called Gessler,

953
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,120
 and Gessler had this thing where he put a hat on a pole,

954
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,640
 and it was in the center of the town,

955
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,960
 and if you walked past the pole and you had a hat on,

956
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,640
 you had to sort of take your hat off and be like,

957
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,680
 "Hello, pole."

958
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,040
 - And so we...

959
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,400
 - I think we should say the pole represented

960
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,080
 the immensely powerful Hapsburg Empire.

961
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,280
 (all laughing)

962
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,960
 - It's still weird, it's still weird.

963
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,440
 So he goes past, doesn't take his hat off.

964
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,680
 I guess Gessler, who's just happens to be monitoring

965
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,960
 every passing by, sees that, says, "Hey, take your hat off."

966
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,680
 He says, "No."

967
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,600
 And then that's where this thing happens,

968
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,600
 where he says, "You need to now shoot your son,"

969
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,720
 or rather-- - Shoot the apple.

970
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,360
 - "Shoot the apple."

971
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,080
 (all laughing)

972
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,520
 He says, "You gotta put your son,

973
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,800
 "you gotta put an apple on his head,

974
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,000
 "and you gotta shoot through it,

975
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,560
 "and if you get it, then you guys can go free.

976
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,880
 "If you miss, then I'm gonna kill you as well."

977
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,000
 So it was a kind of big challenge.

978
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,720
 - Perfectly fair challenge punishment.

979
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,680
 - Fits the crime.

980
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,040
 - It doesn't make any sense.

981
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,280
 - It makes sense for someone who's put a hat on a pole

982
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,560
 and made it so he had it up to it.

983
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,600
 - Could he choose the apple, though?

984
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,440
 Could he choose a very large apple, like a pink lady?

985
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,160
 - Like the one I saw in "Me by any car dot com" that time.

986
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,280
 (all laughing)

987
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,760
 Honestly, I could have hit that for 200 yards.

988
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,800
 - I know you've stopped listening, Alex,

989
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,840
 but James has an anecdote

990
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,240
 about this very, very big apple he once saw.

991
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,840
 - It's actually, it's really weird to get bored

992
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,120
 on a podcast that you're on.

993
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,240
 You're not even listening to.

994
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,040
 (all laughing)

995
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,480
 - But if it had been that apple, yeah, you're right.

996
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,440
 - Yeah, it'd be easy.

997
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,400
 Anyway, look, like Dan said and Alex said,

998
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,440
 "This is the story."

999
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,200
 And then because he did the apple thing,

1000
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,760
 they said, "Okay, fine, Switzerland can exist."

1001
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,880
 And he became like the foundation myth of this country.

1002
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,080
 So everyone believed it and thought

1003
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,200
 that he was a real character.

1004
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,040
 And then there was a historian called Egidius Tudy,

1005
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,920
 and he found out that actually the earliest writing

1006
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,800
 of it was 250 years after the events.

1007
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,320
 And then they found the original Oath of Rutli,

1008
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,040
 which was for the foundation of Switzerland

1009
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,360
 for the early cantons all getting together.

1010
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,280
 And it named the three representatives

1011
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,880
 and none of them was called Tell.

1012
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,480
 None of them was called William Tell.

1013
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,960
 And so, and actually they got the date wrong as well

1014
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,160
 in the original, sort of the original story.

1015
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,800
 And so this guy called De Halle wrote a book

1016
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,120
 called William Tell at Danish Fable

1017
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,240
 and everyone in Switzerland thought this was outrageous

1018
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,160
 that he could put this in writing.

1019
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,440
 And the book was publicly burned in Altdorf Svær.

1020
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,800
 - Was he a Swiss author?

1021
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,320
 - He was a Swiss, yeah.

1022
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,800
 - And I, 'cause I sort of vaguely thought

1023
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,320
 of William Tell as a bit Robin Hoodish

1024
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,640
 as in somebody might have existed, but not really.

1025
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,560
 I didn't really think, oh, that doesn't seem

1026
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,680
 like a very significant thing to me.

1027
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,920
 But I read a piece about, it's from the Atlantic,

1028
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,360
 but it's from 1890.

1029
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,480
 And it said, just this line,

1030
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,560
 "To understand the commotion produced in Switzerland

1031
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,880
 "by cops exposé, we must try to imagine

1032
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,560
 "what would be the result in the United States

1033
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,400
 "if George Washington was suddenly declared

1034
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,920
 "to be a legendary character."

1035
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,040
 - Yeah, it's a bit of that.

1036
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,920
 - It was a huge, huge moment to find out.

1037
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,720
 - It was a bit of that.

1038
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,280
 And then what happened was, everyone was like,

1039
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,000
 "Dahalla, what are you doing, this ridiculous?"

1040
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,120
 And so he said, "No, no, no, no, this was a literary exercise.

1041
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,760
 "I was just, it was just an essay I was writing

1042
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,840
 "to see if I could, it was like, you know,

1043
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,360
 "it's like coming up with two reasons,

1044
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,680
 "whether we should leave the EU or not leave the EU.

1045
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,280
 "And this was the one I decided to go with.

1046
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,640
 "It wasn't supposed to be taken seriously."

1047
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
 - This is the first, like, "Dude, it's a social experiment,

1048
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,080
 "like, no, you should."

1049
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,360
 - It sounds like he was petrified.

1050
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,680
 Like, it sounds like had he not renounced that,

1051
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,920
 it could have been like a Salman Rushdie kind of situation

1052
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,280
 where he might have gone into a, you know,

1053
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,160
 hiding in a cupboard kind of thing.

1054
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,840
 - They were absolutely furious.

1055
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,920
 But then obviously he'd opened the floodgates

1056
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,080
 and suddenly all the skeptics came in,

1057
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
 like skeptics do and said,

1058
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,960
 "Well, actually there was no organized uprising after all.

1059
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,440
 "And there's no evidence that anyone called William Tell

1060
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,200
 "had lived, let alone shot and pull off anyone's head."

1061
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,840
 And they concluded that he was probably a fictional character,

1062
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,880
 possibly based on a little bit of, you know, real life stuff.

1063
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
 And then someone found this old story

1064
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,360
 from the Danish sagas,

1065
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,440
 which is basically the entire story.

1066
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,520
 And that was written, you know,

1067
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,600
 hundreds and hundreds of years before William Tell

1068
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,280
 was supposed to have even existed.

1069
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,600
 And so it seems like they've taken an old story

1070
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,160
 from the sagas and they've kind of appropriated it.

1071
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,280
 - It was a story of Harold Bluetooth.

1072
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,640
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1073
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,800
 - Veteran wireless technology, yeah.

1074
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,160
 Certainly the namesake of it.

1075
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,600
 Danish king of the 10th century.

1076
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

1077
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,720
 - And it is, like, I looked at it and it's identical.

1078
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,920
 - It is the same story.

1079
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,960
 - Yeah.

1080
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,160
 There was a play.

1081
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,960
 - Shiller.

1082
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,680
 - Shiller's play.

1083
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,320
 - Yeah.

1084
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,480
 - And then the play became an opera by Rossini

1085
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,400
 and it's just, it's such an international thing.

1086
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,640
 So it's an opera about a Swiss hero

1087
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,480
 by an Italian composer, Rossini,

1088
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,040
 based on a play by a German writer, Shiller,

1089
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,400
 which premiered in Paris.

1090
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,800
 - Brilliant.

1091
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,520
 - As in it's, all of Europe is involved in this, this, uh...

1092
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,880
 - And you know the, but you know the famous

1093
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,160
 William Tell Overture, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the.

1094
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,640
 - Yeah.

1095
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,040
 - Rossini didn't actually write that for the William Tell Opera.

1096
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,520
 - Get out.

1097
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,200
 - He was, like, running out of time

1098
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,640
 when he was writing the William Tell Opera.

1099
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,080
 (laughing)

1100
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,160
 - That's not how it works when you're running out of time,

1101
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,960
 writing music.

1102
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,920
 When it speeds up.

1103
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,720
 (laughing)

1104
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,320
 - No, he, he was running out of time

1105
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,000
 to finish the entire opera

1106
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,680
 and didn't have an Overture ready.

1107
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,800
 So he went and borrowed a pre-existing piece

1108
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,720
 from one of his earlier operas,

1109
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,480
 which was called Elizabeth, Queen of England.

1110
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,000
 So that was written almost 15 years beforehand.

1111
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,160
 - How interesting, because everything I can think of

1112
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,400
 about Elizabeth, the Queen of England,

1113
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,640
 none of the events in her life fit in with that music.

1114
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,600
 - No, it doesn't really work, does it?

1115
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:24,920
 Yeah.

1116
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,880
 - No, I mean, like, you can't imagine some Walter Raleigh

1117
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
 laying down his cloak and her going,

1118
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
 (humming)

1119
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,240
 - The opera was only performed in full three times.

1120
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,880
 - Yeah, 'cause it was five hours long.

1121
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,600
 - Five hours?

1122
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,680
 - Is that average time for an opera?

1123
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,160
 - No.

1124
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,480
 - No, really?

1125
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,360
 - That's very long.

1126
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,920
 - Definitely more than a few hours is fine,

1127
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,680
 but five hours is pretty long.

1128
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,320
 - Even three is.

1129
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,120
 - I've never been to one.

1130
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,840
 I always just always know that they're long.

1131
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
 - Especially given that some of the music was so fast.

1132
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,520
 Like, you would have thought the music would be slower

1133
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,400
 if he was gonna write it out.

1134
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:51,640
 - Yeah.

1135
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,920
 - There's a Herman Göring link.

1136
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,680
 I can't believe there's another Herman Göring

1137
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,400
 in the podcast.

1138
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,920
 The Nazi--

1139
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,280
 - Which Herman Göring, by the way?

1140
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,840
 - Sorry.

1141
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,560
 - The Nazi one.

1142
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,040
 - The Nazi one.

1143
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,840
 - Okay, sorry, good.

1144
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,000
 Just got to clarify.

1145
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,760
 - The Nazi regime made a movie of William Tell,

1146
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,640
 and they treated the Tell story as a kind of Nazi myth,

1147
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,480
 'cause at that point, I think it was before the war,

1148
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,240
 they claimed they were liberating ethnic Germans

1149
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,160
 living in other countries who had been oppressed

1150
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,800
 by those countries, and Herman Göring's mistress

1151
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,160
 was cast in a leading role.

1152
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,040
 - Okay, right.

1153
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,640
 - That was based on Schiller's play, wasn't it?

1154
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,440
 - Yeah.

1155
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,160
 - But then Hitler banned it later on,

1156
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,120
 because there was an assassination attempt on him

1157
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,400
 by a guy called Maurice Bavo, who was known

1158
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,680
 as the new William Tell.

1159
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,240
 - Yeah.

1160
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,640
 - And he thought, well, I better get rid

1161
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,920
 of all other William Tells.

1162
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,040
 - He was Swiss as well.

1163
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,360
 - Yeah.

1164
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,840
 - That's great.

1165
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,480
 - Yeah.

1166
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,120
 - Yeah.

1167
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,840
 - I've been in Switzerland for Swiss Independence Day

1168
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,720
 on the 1st of August.

1169
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,440
 - Oh, yeah.

1170
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,400
 - Which is when they have a lot of--

1171
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,120
 - What happened?

1172
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,520
 - It was sort of fireworks and stuff like that.

1173
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,200
 It was relatively low key.

1174
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,720
 - Lots of chocolate, probably cheese.

1175
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,160
 - Yeah, lots of chocolate.

1176
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1177
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,800
 - Where did you go?

1178
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,600
 Like, specifically?

1179
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,960
 - A few different places.

1180
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,360
 - Oh.

1181
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,120
 - They sound great.

1182
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,920
 - Did you go to Bern?

1183
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,880
 I've been to Bern.

1184
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,400
 - I don't think I did go to Bern.

1185
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,120
 I was very young.

1186
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,400
 I didn't know where they got rid of all the books.

1187
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,440
 - Oh, my God.

1188
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,240
 - Brilliant.

1189
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,880
 Brilliant.

1190
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,840
 That was worth it.

1191
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,320
 - In the Bern, there's lots of, like, bears,

1192
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,600
 because a bear is the symbol of the city of Bern.

1193
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,360
 And the Appenzell Canton flag,

1194
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,680
 so the area of Switzerland called Appenzell,

1195
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,000
 has a flag which is a bear with an erection.

1196
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,840
 - Crikey.

1197
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,080
 - Yeah.

1198
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,480
 So if you look at it, it's only a tiny little red triangle.

1199
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,040
 If you can imagine, a bear rampant.

1200
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,360
 And then you've got a little red triangle

1201
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,480
 where his penis would be.

1202
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,040
 And there was a time when St. Gallen, this was in 1579.

1203
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,000
 So the Canton of St. Gallen had a printer,

1204
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,920
 and he did a calendar of all the Swiss Cantons.

1205
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,960
 And he did the Appenzell Canton flag,

1206
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,120
 but he didn't put the erection in the bear.

1207
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,120
 And this was, it kicked off.

1208
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,240
 It really, really kicked off.

1209
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,600
 They almost went to war

1210
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,920
 because they didn't have the penis on the bear.

1211
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,760
 And then it was only averted

1212
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,160
 when the printer offered abject apologies,

1213
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,240
 and St. Gallen agreed to destroy

1214
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,800
 every single copy of the calendar they could find.

1215
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,440
 - Wow.

1216
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,520
 - Again, lots of rounding things up and destroying them.

1217
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:20,920
 - Yeah.

1218
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,040
 - It's a very spicy time.

1219
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,680
 No wonder Switzerland is so determinedly neutral and calm today.

1220
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,800
 - Yeah, it's rewarding.

1221
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,120
 - They say they're for a very organized country.

1222
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,800
 They've got a really chaotic origin story.

1223
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,240
 - I think they've got it all out of their system.

1224
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,080
 They've only decided, I think, at a certain point.

1225
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:38,040
 No, we cannot stop rounding up and destroying calendars.

1226
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,840
 And things like that.

1227
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:47,320
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

1228
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,600
 And that is my fact.

1229
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,920
 My fact this week is that to make sure

1230
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,440
 that no one leaked the answer to who shot JR

1231
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,120
 on the TV show Dallas,

1232
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,760
 the production team had every main character

1233
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,680
 film a scene of them shooting JR, including JR.

1234
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
 It's an amazing thing.

1235
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,320
 So this is--

1236
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,760
 - We need to explain what Dallas is.

1237
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,160
 - Exactly.

1238
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,800
 So Dallas was a soap opera in America,

1239
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,800
 went on for a very long time in the 1980s it began.

1240
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,600
 And it was a show that kind of really transformed

1241
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,160
 the idea of soap having these dramatic plot twists.

1242
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,800
 And also cliffhangers and so on.

1243
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,400
 And it created the greatest cliffhanger

1244
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,040
 probably in TV history, certainly American TV history.

1245
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,440
 And it's about, it follows the escapades

1246
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,640
 of a wealthy oil tycoon's family in Dallas, Texas.

1247
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,440
 - It's the earliest succession.

1248
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,720
 - Early cheesy succession, really.

1249
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,200
 - It is.

1250
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,440
 It's about us Williamers, and the main character

1251
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,520
 is an anti-hero just like Logan Roy.

1252
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,480
 - I do think that succession is a very original idea.

1253
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,160
 And they definitely didn't rip off Dallas

1254
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,800
 in any way whatsoever, just as an ultimate opinion.

1255
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,600
 - I'm not so sure.

1256
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,200
 I think, no.

1257
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,600
 - So yeah, it's at the end of this third series,

1258
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,720
 it's the finale.

1259
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,400
 And JR, who is the character played by Larry Hagman,

1260
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,520
 is shot.

1261
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,600
 We don't know who's pulled the trigger.

1262
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,560
 And then there's a big break in the season.

1263
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,440
 And in that time, America goes slightly ballistic.

1264
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,720
 We're trying to work out.

1265
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,920
 - The world almost.

1266
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1267
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,920
 Who shot JR was basically the big question that everyone,

1268
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,640
 with t-shirts next to the, "I'm with this cunt."

1269
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,880
 - Who shot JR.

1270
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,480
 Politicians were referencing it.

1271
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,520
 - Yeah, everyone.

1272
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,200
 - And just a spoiler alert, it was Kristen.

1273
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,840
 There we go.

1274
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,080
 - What?

1275
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:35,240
 - But the thing is, the shooting of JR, this huge event,

1276
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,960
 maybe the biggest event in fictional TV history,

1277
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,640
 was not meant to be the end of the series.

1278
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,880
 They had already filmed an ending of the series.

1279
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,000
 And they'd had a load of events.

1280
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,600
 They'd had a deathbed murder confession.

1281
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,560
 They'd had the sectioning.

1282
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,600
 They had all sorts of, you know,

1283
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,360
 greatly written themselves into a corner kind of thing.

1284
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:48,680
 - Yeah.

1285
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,400
 And then they got told,

1286
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,560
 "Hey, great news. You've got four more episodes."

1287
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,480
 And they had to write four more episodes.

1288
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,640
 And then there was a big head-scratching thing

1289
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,280
 in the writer's room.

1290
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,000
 And someone said, "Why don't we just shoot the bastard?"

1291
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,040
 And then they all...

1292
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,600
 - 'Cause apparently a lot of the writers were comedians.

1293
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,280
 Or funny people at least.

1294
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,720
 Yeah, and this was, I read this in an interview

1295
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,680
 with Lorraine Desprez, who was one of the main writers.

1296
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,480
 And yeah, she said that these were really funny guys

1297
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,920
 who were trying to come up with ideas.

1298
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,040
 And almost let's shoot JR was one person going,

1299
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,480
 "Wouldn't it be funny if we did that?

1300
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
 'Cause wouldn't it fuck things up if we did that?"

1301
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,640
 And then they all went, "Oh, actually, that would be good."

1302
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,200
 - Well, that's...

1303
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,760
 I mean, a lot of the writers of succession

1304
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,040
 are very funny comic writers.

1305
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,920
 Jesse Armstrong, Lucy Crebel, Preble, sorry.

1306
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,840
 So, you know, it's another little link between the two, I'd say.

1307
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,000
 - But, you know, I mean, the world went crackers, didn't it?

1308
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,800
 - It did.

1309
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,280
 If you were on a plane going from Europe to America at the time,

1310
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,800
 if it was an Air France plane,

1311
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,680
 they said that they would tell anyone over the intercom

1312
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,040
 who'd shot JR, 'cause if you couldn't watch the show,

1313
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,600
 someone would radio up from the ground and say,

1314
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,480
 "It was Kristen."

1315
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,160
 And then they'd go, "We're flying at 40,000 feet."

1316
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,080
 And it was Kristen who shot JR.

1317
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,600
 - Oh, my God.

1318
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,640
 - Isn't that amazing?

1319
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,920
 - That is a huge spoiler.

1320
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,480
 There's no way of avoiding a plane-tannoy spoiler.

1321
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,920
 - That's true, although in those days,

1322
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,240
 you couldn't watch things on demand.

1323
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,840
 Like, you could have VHS'd it, or maybe...

1324
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,680
 - So, you actually kind of wanted to ask me to spoil it more.

1325
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,280
 - Actually, even in 1980, I guess,

1326
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,200
 you would have had VHS's, but only just.

1327
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,040
 - Yeah.

1328
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,880
 - Right.

1329
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,000
 - So, you had to watch it live.

1330
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,040
 If you didn't watch it live,

1331
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,880
 you were not gonna watch it.

1332
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,720
 - Exactly, you weren't gonna know.

1333
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,160
 - The Turkish parliament suspended a session

1334
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,360
 so that the legislators wouldn't be able to tune in

1335
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,240
 and wouldn't miss it.

1336
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,200
 - It really is.

1337
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,160
 - There was a really fantastic piece in Texas Monthly,

1338
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,320
 which if anyone's gonna cover who shot JR,

1339
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,200
 then you're off.

1340
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,080
 - Front page, surely.

1341
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,880
 - Absolutely.

1342
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,640
 But no, there is an amazing piece,

1343
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,720
 which is all about the madness that happened.

1344
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,640
 So, they shot at a real ranch.

1345
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,080
 You know, they shot some scenes at a real ranch,

1346
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,800
 so it was just shot in interior sets in Hollywood.

1347
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,080
 But the son of the guy who lived at the ranch,

1348
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,400
 they shot at, is called Joe Duncan.

1349
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,920
 And he says that they had people turning up

1350
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,160
 to take chips of the fence,

1351
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,000
 take pieces of rock.

1352
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,200
 - You know, they could have taken a chip of the fence

1353
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,620
 and used it as a tiny fence in a model railway.

1354
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:12,480
 - That's like relics.

1355
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,320
 That's mad.

1356
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,160
 - It is, yeah.

1357
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,000
 - He said, listen to this quote.

1358
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,160
 He said, "I was once 20 feet away from a guy

1359
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,800
 "who jumped to the fence and went out into the pasture

1360
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,560
 "to pick up a piece of horse manure to take home

1361
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,900
 "as a souvenir."

1362
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,760
 - That was a time before eBay.

1363
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,600
 - Yeah, as well.

1364
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,120
 - The name was Dad Shriver.

1365
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,160
 (all laughing)

1366
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,560
 - I read an article from, this was the day before

1367
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,000
 they were about to show who shot JR,

1368
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,920
 and this was in the Minneapolis Star.

1369
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,360
 And they asked some local celebs

1370
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,600
 who they thought had shot JR.

1371
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,240
 And like the head of the coach

1372
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,280
 of one of the local sports teams said,

1373
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,880
 "Oh, I don't know who shot JR,

1374
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,360
 "but there's a lot of agents of players

1375
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,620
 "who I'd like to shoot."

1376
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,440
 (all laughing)

1377
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,520
 And then, zing!

1378
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,360
 The police chief who's called Anthony Bouzard,

1379
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,840
 he said, "I'm happy to report that I've never seen

1380
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,480
 "a single minute of that goddamn program."

1381
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,320
 - Wow.

1382
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,720
 - And they asked the mayor, Don Fraser,

1383
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,920
 who's the mayor of Minneapolis.

1384
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,080
 And he said, "I haven't the foggiest who shot him.

1385
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,160
 "Are you serious?

1386
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,120
 "I've only seen one episode of that show

1387
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,840
 "and it was quite by accident."

1388
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,960
 - Wow.

1389
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,200
 - Sounds like a lifelong fan.

1390
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,040
 (all laughing)

1391
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,080
 - Just happily, they asked him.

1392
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,360
 Like, they asked someone and they got these answers

1393
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,840
 and they felt, "Well, we'll look back as well, print."

1394
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,000
 - Oh, yeah, yes, yeah, yes, that, yeah.

1395
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,440
 - The thing that I knew Dallas for,

1396
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,840
 'cause I'd never really seen it.

1397
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,560
 But I know it as a famous,

1398
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,640
 like a famous example of retconning,

1399
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,560
 where you retroactively change what happened.

1400
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,720
 So they wrote, filmed and shot and broadcast

1401
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,120
 an entire season in which a character, Bobby Ewing, died.

1402
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,480
 But this character was really popular

1403
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,720
 and they decided they wanted to spring him back.

1404
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,960
 So in order to do that, they retconned it

1405
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,440
 by the beginning of the next series.

1406
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,440
 They made the whole previous series of Dream Sequence.

1407
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,760
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

1408
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,760
 - Which is hailed as one of the like,

1409
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,960
 the cheesiest and rubbish ways of like retconning.

1410
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,240
 But one of the weird continuity things was that

1411
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,160
 Dallas had a spin-off show called "Not's Landing"

1412
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,000
 that existed in the same universe.

1413
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,400
 But when they brought back Bobby Ewing

1414
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,080
 and was like, "Oh, this character never died,"

1415
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,120
 in "Not's Landing," they had referenced

1416
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,200
 the fact that Bobby had died.

1417
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,680
 So at that point, it's like a universe-splintering moment.

1418
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,600
 - It's like spider-verse into the multiverse.

1419
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,760
 - It is, yeah, exactly.

1420
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,800
 - But they were simultaneously taking into a,

1421
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,600
 like they were like keeping track of the different universes

1422
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,400
 while simultaneously wiping entire series off the face of the Earth.

1423
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,040
 - 'Cause you would think it would be easier to say,

1424
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,400
 "Oh, he didn't die, he faked his own death."

1425
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,240
 - Yes, exactly.

1426
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,200
 - Unless they showed, on camera, the funeral,

1427
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,760
 the like, open cast gear.

1428
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,200
 - I think it was like the main part

1429
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,720
 of a lot of the story of that season.

1430
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,160
 - They literally were like, "Forget that series happened."

1431
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,000
 - It's weird.

1432
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,840
 - Yeah.

1433
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,520
 - There was a real life Bobby Ewing

1434
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,200
 who lived in Texas and who owned an oil and cattle company.

1435
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,040
 - Oh, really?

1436
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,880
 - Yeah.

1437
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,120
 And so when this big sort of who shot JR thing was happening,

1438
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,320
 they really kind of cashed in

1439
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,480
 and you could buy JR Dolls, JR Cologne, JR Playing Cards.

1440
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,720
 And you could also buy fake certificates

1441
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,480
 for Ewing Land Oil and Cattle Company,

1442
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,280
 which was signed by Bobby Ewing, the fake Bobby Ewing.

1443
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,840
 But then the real Bobby Ewing, who lived in Texas,

1444
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,440
 sued them and said, "Well, you can't do this

1445
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,360
 'cause it makes it look like you're selling my company."

1446
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,000
 And I found out that it was settled in the end

1447
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,240
 and the real Bobby Ewing wasn't allowed

1448
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,760
 to sell any novelty items.

1449
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,480
 And it didn't say, but I assume he got a massive payout.

1450
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,320
 He must have done, right?

1451
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,520
 - Yeah, it's amazing.

1452
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,920
 - Larry Hagman, who played JR.

1453
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,040
 So obviously there's a big break for the,

1454
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,640
 when they're not shooting.

1455
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,040
 He hadn't signed his contract

1456
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,680
 when they started shooting the next series

1457
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,280
 and he held out for a long time.

1458
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,600
 - 'Cause he knows he's a star now, right?

1459
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,200
 - Yeah, everyone's talking about him.

1460
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,760
 - He wanted a huge pay rise.

1461
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,600
 He dispatched his agents to negotiate

1462
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,080
 wearing white stets and hats with the management of the show.

1463
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,920
 - And that was his kind of look, right?

1464
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,240
 - Sorry, yeah, that was his thing, yeah.

1465
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,000
 - I don't feel really stupid if I was as Asian

1466
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 as I was told to do that.

1467
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,360
 - Well, they were like, "You're overreaching

1468
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,760
 with this negotiation and you want us

1469
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,680
 to go in fancy dress."

1470
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,880
 - It was worse when Mr. Blobby asked for a pay rise.

1471
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,480
 (all laughing)

1472
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,880
 - He wouldn't come in and be like, "Ah, Mr. Blobby."

1473
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,520
 (all laughing)

1474
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,240
 - When they were trying to shoot the next series,

1475
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,360
 they had to start shooting,

1476
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,200
 but without JR being present

1477
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,800
 and having signed off his contract,

1478
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,040
 without having signed his contract.

1479
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,120
 So what they started doing,

1480
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,720
 they shot a couple of different versions.

1481
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,720
 One, they just shot JR from behind.

1482
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,560
 He just shot someone with the same hair,

1483
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,320
 which they could just like fill in later.

1484
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,780
 And then they also shot scenes

1485
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,800
 with a guy bandaged up like he did.

1486
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,480
 (all laughing)

1487
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,840
 And they said, "If we have to bring in another actor

1488
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,720
 to play JR, we can claim,

1489
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,320
 you had to have reconstructive surgery."

1490
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,840
 And now you're like, "This is so funny."

1491
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,800
 - The problem is JR was shot in the stomach.

1492
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,360
 (all laughing)

1493
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,200
 No reason.

1494
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,440
 - That's great.

1495
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,480
 Hagman, what an interesting kind of personality

1496
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,400
 he was generally.

1497
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,480
 He used to do a thing for many, many years

1498
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,280
 called "Silent Sundays."

1499
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,640
 He just didn't talk on Sundays.

1500
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,480
 - So funny.

1501
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,320
 - Yeah.

1502
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,160
 So what happened was is that--

1503
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,000
 - Religious?

1504
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,840
 Religious?

1505
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,680
 - No, no, it was part of,

1506
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,120
 he used to be on a different show called "I Dream a Genie,"

1507
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,080
 brilliant show, and during it, he had vocal problems.

1508
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,120
 And so he went to a doctor and the doctor said,

1509
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,880
 "Why don't you try not talking for a few days?"

1510
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,520
 And he thought not only did it work nicely,

1511
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,840
 but he really enjoyed the experience.

1512
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,240
 So every Sunday he thought,

1513
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,280
 "I'm just going to do this."

1514
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,720
 And didn't speak for decades.

1515
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,560
 - It's so good.

1516
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,400
 - Yeah.

1517
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,000
 - Yeah, he claimed that for 25 years,

1518
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,960
 he never spoke on a Sunday.

1519
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,040
 I think it's not 100% true.

1520
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,360
 I think he kind of cheated a fair amount, but--

1521
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,880
 - 'Cause Sunday's your birthday or--

1522
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,720
 - Yeah.

1523
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,560
 - A Lego.

1524
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,120
 - Sometimes he would go like four days in a row

1525
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,120
 without talking, wouldn't he?

1526
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,200
 And his family would hate him for it, and--

1527
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,040
 - Really?

1528
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,160
 - He kicked it, because he says that he started realizing

1529
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,680
 he was missing a lot of opportunities,

1530
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,840
 'cause he says in LA,

1531
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,680
 a lot of business is done on the weekends.

1532
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,640
 And so he said he couldn't call his agent.

1533
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,800
 He couldn't talk to them to say,

1534
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,000
 "Hey, get on the case of doing this," or--

1535
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,040
 - It's incredibly good negotiating to stay silent.

1536
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,880
 He probably should have done all this business on a Sunday.

1537
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,560
 Just sit there in silence while they just keep

1538
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,400
 upping the offer until the clock goes over to Monday.

1539
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,280
 - He's like, "Yeah, great."

1540
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,120
 - That's so funny.

1541
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,880
 - A Nazi who was a fan of Dallas?

1542
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,720
 - Great.

1543
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,560
 - Rudolph Hasse.

1544
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,400
 - Rudolph Hasse?

1545
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,720
 - No, he wasn't.

1546
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,560
 - Rudolph Hasse, yeah.

1547
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,040
 - Rudolph Hasse the Nazi?

1548
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,880
 - No, he sure was.

1549
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,400
 - Didn't we cover another person?

1550
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,240
 There was another,

1551
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,840
 there was genuinely another Rudolph Hasse.

1552
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,840
 - Really?

1553
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,000
 - Oh, he was called Rudolph Hasse,

1554
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,840
 the avocado man.

1555
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,680
 - Oh, the avocado guy.

1556
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,640
 - Yes, oh, unfortunately.

1557
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,600
 - The guy behind the house avocado was called Rudolph Hasse.

1558
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,440
 - Wow.

1559
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,200
 (laughing)

1560
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,960
 - This one was the Nazi,

1561
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,160
 and presumably train enthusiast.

1562
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,400
 - Was he still alive when--

1563
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,480
 - He watched, he's found out prison.

1564
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,880
 He used to watch it in East,

1565
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,480
 in Dallas and Dynasty with his two favorite TV shows.

1566
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,440
 - He did care.

1567
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,280
 - Did he?

1568
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,620
 - They were all bad.

1569
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,080
 (laughing)

1570
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,560
 - That is retcalling, Alex.

1571
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,820
 (laughing)

1572
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,400
 (upbeat music)

1573
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,680
 - Okay, that's it.

1574
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,720
 That is all of our facts.

1575
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,080
 Thank you so much for listening.

1576
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,880
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1577
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,000
