00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,440
 --Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,760
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,040
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,480
 and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,920
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,960
 --My fact this week is that in China, you can hire mistress dispellers to lure away your

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,200
 husband's mistress. --Yeah --What if your husband

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,760
 doesn't have a mistress? Do you have to hire a mistress and then hire a mistress dispeller?

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,120
 --Of course twice as much and it's almost futile. This was a piece of the New Yorker which

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,240
 they did on this new thing, which is becoming bigger and bigger, which are these companies

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,480
 that call themselves mistress dispellers and if your husband has a mistress that you

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,320
 know about and I think people have a lot of men in China are quite unsuttle about it,

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,080
 then you go to one of these mistress dispelling services and you say can you sort this out

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,160
 and they charge tens of thousands of dollars but they do a really comprehensive service.

15
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,200
 They have a psychotherapist, they have lawyers and it's a two-pronged attack, so one psychotherapist

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,080
 goes to the mistress and lures her away so for instance there was one case where a mistress

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,340
 was convinced by the therapist to get a job in a different city.

18
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,000
 --Yeah, they're banned from getting emotionally involved, although there are stories of some

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,620
 male mistress dispellers who will start having an affair with the mistress.

20
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,440
 --Yeah and there are lots of different companies so lots of them do different things, so there

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,080
 are some companies that say don't get involved but then there are other companies that openly

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,480
 say our mistress dispellers are attractive men, they're there to seduce the mistresses.

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,920
 --What's up, you guys probably know this, I'm surprised I don't.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,280
 What is the male mistress?

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
 --Master.

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
 --Just a master.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
 --Masterus?

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,760
 --Well, mistress is a feminine version of the word master, that's...

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
 --Yeah.

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
 --But there is no...

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,920
 --I think my wife's got a master.

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,480
 --You'd say she's got a fancy man.

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
 --Right.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 --Sorry, I think.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
 --A fancy man.

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
 --It's what I'd say.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,920
 --So obviously there's no equivalent because we've lived in a very sexist society for

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,920
 the last 4,000 years.

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,680
 --I know we may not have the wording but are there fancy man dispellers in China as well as

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
 mistress?

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
 --I don't think there are because it's just not such a commonplace thing.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
 --Isn't it true?

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,680
 I read somewhere that like actual family counsellors and people like that really don't

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,840
 think this is a particularly good idea at all.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,120
 --That sounds very plausible.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,000
 --I read that it was the director of the Guangdong province marriage and family counsellors

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,280
 association who says really these problems need to be solved between the husband and

48
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,140
 the wife rather than spending tens of thousands of pounds.

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
 --No, absolutely not.

50
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,640
 You need to spend $45,000 siring someone to trick your mistress into leaving here.

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,880
 --It's funny because if it's a traditional family where the husband is earning the money

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,400
 and sharing it with the wife, the wife then goes and spends the money on getting rid of

53
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,640
 the mistress.

54
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,160
 So it's money circling around.

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
 Do you see what I mean?

56
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
 --Yes, it's my husband.

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
 --The man has the breadwinner.

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,560
 It's then the husband's own money that's being spent on getting rid of his mistress.

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,260
 --Yes, it's quite pleasing.

60
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,280
 --Do you think he notices and says what's happened to all of our money and then the wife says

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,720
 what I've I spent on disposing of that woman you wish.

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,880
 --But I think that's probably the problem is that some of the case studies where they produce

63
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,840
 accounts from the wives and the reason they've done it.

64
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,600
 In some cases they've said too much money is disappearing from the family account because

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,160
 these guys with the mistress have gone too far in they're spending way too much money

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
 on them.

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,040
 --So stop to that by throwing thousands of dollars more.

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,160
 You'll have lots of very happy marriages of extremely poor people.

69
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
 --Yeah.

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,440
 I found another curious job.

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,400
 This is a website tester.

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,800
 So basically a lot of people release new websites they've created and they're way too complicated

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,880
 in some cases, unusable, not very friendly.

74
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,440
 So this is called this user is my mum and it's this guy's mum who is very bad at the internet.

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,480
 It's out your website and says out loud I don't understand what is this doing how's this

76
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,520
 lead and he writes you a report and his mum just tested it.

77
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,080
 --What's interesting about this is it's a job where the more you do it the worse you get

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
 it.

79
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
 --Yeah.

80
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,520
 --You get more proficient on the internet so you wouldn't be as stupid.

81
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
 --Yes.

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
 --It's still going.

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
 --You must be replaced.

84
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
 --She must be replaced.

85
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
 --She must be replaced.

86
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,920
 --You can't secretly replace someone's mother like you might do a hamster.

87
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,120
 --I don't know how it knows it is.

88
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,000
 --This isn't really a job, this is one bloke but James you and I were talking about China's

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,680
 doing this massive face recognition drive at the moment and they're installing facial recognition

90
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,880
 technology everywhere and you need it now to get into your taxi app on your phone or

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,960
 you need to get into your digital wallet or all this stuff.

92
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,480
 But there is a guy called I think he's called Wang Yuheng and last year he beat a facial recognition

93
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,800
 software machine.

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,560
 He's one of these super recognisers right and he played three rounds against a machine and

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,040
 it was a draw for the first two rounds and then he won the third one but on the TV show

96
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
 he was on last year.

97
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,400
 He successfully identified a single glass of water from more than 520 identical glasses

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 of water.

99
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
 --What?

100
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
 --Yep.

101
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
 --Yep.

102
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
 --Yep.

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,480
 --Well the one thing here is they can't have been identical.

104
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
 Yeah.

105
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,680
 --They were identical to you and I but really.

106
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
 --What did he see in it?

107
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
 What are you seeing?

108
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
 --I don't know.

109
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 --I don't know.

110
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
 --I don't know whether that was the only one which was.

111
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,760
 --That one was half empty and all the others were half full.

112
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,640
 --I went to a club the other week and they had facial recognition stuff so you went with

113
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,120
 your ID and they scanned your ID and then they scanned your face and it had to look the

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,400
 same otherwise they wouldn't let you in.

115
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,840
 But mine didn't look the same because my ID is from when I was about 18 when I had shot

116
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,240
 hair but they just let me go anyway.

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,840
 --They must look at the age it was taken at and they thought that guy is obviously this guy

118
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
 needs a drink.

119
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,640
 --This guy is at a hard life and that's not it.

120
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,440
 --That was the same club I tried to get into at the weekend to meet you and they didn't

121
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,320
 let me in but then I didn't bring any ID so that's probably they couldn't scan it.

122
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
 --Just brought a glass of water.

123
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,080
 --Wait you guys hanging out on the weekend?

124
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
 --Yeah what the hell?

125
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 --We went to a party.

126
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 --You guys are invited I think?

127
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
 --I don't know.

128
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
 --I just just not mention it.

129
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 --Yeah.

130
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,960
 --Well I've been doing a bit of extra research because I've been freer the weekend.

131
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,820
 I was reading about sort of the King's mistress which in France was an official position for

132
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,820
 centuries.

133
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,320
 You'd get your own flats and you'd get an official title and so Madame de Pompadot was

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,720
 an extremely famous mistress to Louis XV for 20 years despite the fact they didn't

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 really sleep together.

136
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
 She found other women for him to go to bed with and then she would just talk to him.

137
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
 --So she's a pimp?

138
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
 --Well no she's Madame.

139
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
 --A Madame yes.

140
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
 --A Madame yeah.

141
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
 --Well she is Madame de Pompadot yeah.

142
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,920
 --Yeah but she used to be called Miss Fish she was called Mamzel Poisson before she was

143
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
 elevated.

144
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 --Was that her surname?

145
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 --Yeah.

146
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
 --Yeah yeah.

147
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,740
 But when she met Louis XIV it was at a ball in 1745 where she was dressed as a Jepadess

148
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,760
 and he was dressed as a tree.

149
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,640
 --So does she bring her sheep underneath him to shelter from the rain or something?

150
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 --Yeah I think that was it.

151
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
 --Yeah yeah.

152
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
 --So romantic.

153
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
 --Very cool.

154
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,260
 --Until 2006 in America if you wanted to get divorced you could get divorced in Guam

155
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,840
 by mail.

156
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,200
 So both of the people could write to Guam and say we want to get divorced and they would

157
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,680
 just do it.

158
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,180
 You need never have ever been to Guam you could just do that and that was a legal thing.

159
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,680
 And then they changed the law so now you can still get divorced in Guam but you need

160
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,680
 to have stayed there for eight days and no one does it anymore.

161
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,040
 --Yeah because Guam is really far from everywhere.

162
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,880
 Imagine how suspicious you'd be as the partner when they say hey I've booked us a holiday

163
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
 to Guam.

164
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
 --How about you?

165
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,960
 --I'll ask work for eight days after you pick it.

166
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,280
 --So Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter which was advice to a friend on choosing a mistress.

167
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
 Have any of you read this?

168
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
 --Yeah bedside reading.

169
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,480
 --It's not going well is it handy so this is a last chance.

170
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
 --That is harsh no.

171
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 I've just been dispelled.

172
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,880
 --They didn't dispelled the mistress they dispelled the husband it was the only case they decided

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
 to change policy.

174
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,480
 --She's way better off of that other guy which is kind of fancy man.

175
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
 --He still uses phrases like fancy man.

176
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
 --What is the phrase?

177
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
 What's the word?

178
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
 --Well master according to James.

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 --I was talking etymological.

180
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
 --Bit on the side that's it.

181
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 --Squeeze.

182
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 --Squeeze.

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 --Yeah sorry am I you were saying else.

184
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
 --Anyways.

185
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 --Squeeze is not.

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
 --Squeeze is just as old as fancy man.

187
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
 --Sorce gentlemen.

188
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
 --Andy and I are from the same century.

189
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
 --Sorce gentlemen.

190
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
 --Speaking of centuries.

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,280
 So Ben Franklin in the 18th century wrote this letter to a friend of his called Cad Waller

192
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,640
 Colton who had written a letter to Ben Franklin saying I really want a mistress and a

193
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,680
 mistress in those days wasn't someone who you were cheating on your wife where it was just

194
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,280
 if you didn't have a wife anyone you wanted to have sex with was your mistress.

195
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,280
 So Ben where you got this was you wrote to Benjamin Franklin.

196
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,280
 --And he would get his mum to look through a list of people.

197
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,280
 --Maybe his mum was involved because his first piece of advice was choose an older woman.

198
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,280
 --When you ring old Mrs Franklin I hope she's good.

199
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,280
 --Anyway he wrote this letter in 1745 and it was actually genuinely quite good advice.

200
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
 And first of all it said actually advise you get married.

201
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,280
 But if you will insist on not getting married for a while first of all get married to an

202
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,280
 older woman because they're smarter they've lived longer they've got better chat.

203
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 And also he said there's no hazard of children which irregularly produced may be attended

204
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
 with much inconvenience.

205
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
 --So he's talking about quite an older woman.

206
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,280
 --Well indeed postman appausal and he also says when they stop being beautiful they study

207
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,280
 to be good in other ways but it sounds a little misogynistic.

208
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:23,280
 --I don't know what you're talking about James I'm the woman here and I think he's right on the feminist money.

209
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
 But this is interesting he says don't worry about the appearance issue because even

210
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,280
 though in old age some bits get wrinkly it starts from the top down.

211
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,280
 So he says the face first gets wrinkled then the neck and then the breasts and arms

212
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,280
 but the lower parts continue to last as plump as ever so that if you cover all above with a basket

213
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,280
 and regard only what is below the girdle it is impossible to know an old woman from a young woman.

214
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
 --We're absolutely right this is feminist.

215
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
 --Happy birthday darling get the basket ready.

216
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,280
 --Fucked upgrade you to a deeper basket.

217
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,280
 --Basket does your pregnant side off with.

218
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:06,280
 You should see my mom she's got a basket on them she's all right.

219
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,280
 --A teacher actually got in trouble for using a quote from this letter in his classroom

220
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,280
 but there's this teacher in Oklahoma and he had a picture in his classroom of a cat

221
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,280
 and he had the quote in the dark all cats agree which maybe is saying something

222
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,280
 about don't judge my appearance and actually Frank been said in this letter also

223
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,280
 you don't need to worry about the appearance because in the dark all cats agree

224
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,280
 as in doesn't know you're telling the lights out not an issue and this teacher got suspended.

225
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
 --It's quite an old gag as well.

226
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,280
 I mean that was used by one of the Russians Catherine the Great or Peter the Great or somebody.

227
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
 --Oh it was about the same kind of era.

228
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,280
 --It would have been like darker then as well right because this is pre-electricity

229
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,280
 so yeah just when it gets dark either got your candles or you're in the dark.

230
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,280
 --So are you saying people even more were even more familiar with darkness?

231
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,280
 --Just cats like might as well not have even bothered.

232
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,280
 --Yeah I mean what's the point of having color if you're a cat in the open days?

233
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
 --That's a cat's car blend anyway.

234
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
 --No.

235
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
 --No.

236
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
 --I think it's dogs.

237
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 --Yeah.

238
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
 --Old dogs are great.

239
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
 --To all of the dogs.

240
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
 --To all of the dogs.

241
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
 --All the time.

242
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,280
 --Do you know that the first ever divorce in America was due to bigomy.

243
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,280
 I was a guy called James Luxford and he was found a hundred pounds

244
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,280
 and sentenced to an hour in the stocks but they gave him an even worse punishment

245
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
 which is the worst they could come up with.

246
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
 They banished him to England.

247
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
 --Oh wow.

248
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
 --That is rough.

249
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,280
 --I guess if you're an American being sent back to England isn't embarrassing because it's like being sent back to your mum's house.

250
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
 --Yeah it is.

251
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
 --That's exactly what it is because they were all English.

252
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
 They'd old come over for their new life.

253
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
 --Oh okay right.

254
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
 --Okay we don't need you here anymore.

255
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
 Head off back to England.

256
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
 --Do you think you went back to England and went?

257
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
 Didn't even like it there anyway.

258
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
 There's rubbish.

259
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
 --Two many wives.

260
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:59,280
 --Okay it is time for fact number two and that is James.

261
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:05,280
 --My fact this week is that Richard Nixon's chair was 2.5 inches higher than everyone else's in the cabinet room.

262
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
 --It's amazing.

263
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:15,280
 --So I read this in an article in International Business Times and it's about how much money Donald Trump has spent on furnishings for the White House.

264
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,280
 So in four months he spent 133 thousand dollars which is triple what Obama spent.

265
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,280
 But one of the things he bought was a conference table from a company called Kittinger.

266
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:33,280
 And on Kittinger's website it says that they got this stuff for Richard Nixon including a 24 chairs around a table

267
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,280
 one of which was 2.5 inches higher than the rest and that was for him.

268
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
 --It's just the back I think.

269
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
 I think the back of the chair isn't it?

270
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:47,280
 --The back of the chair is just the horizontal bit that supports your back but surely if that's higher then you will look a bit shorter relatively in your chair.

271
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:56,280
 --I think the idea being that you have such a magnificent chair 5 inches that people give you a bit more kind of leeway because like it's like a throne isn't it?

272
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
 --Yes.

273
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,280
 --Big throne that the queen sits on presumably I don't know does she sit on a big throne?

274
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,280
 --Yeah imagine she sits on one that bit like the game of thrones I am thrown.

275
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
 --Yeah a bit less bony but a bit less made of swords.

276
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,280
 --Yeah but she did at the opening of Parliament.

277
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
 --Oh yeah.

278
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,280
 --And one of the reasons because obviously they were mucking around with when they were going to have the queen speech.

279
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,280
 I think part of the reason that she was angry they said it was going to be because she was going to miss Ascot and she loves seeing the horses.

280
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:28,280
 But also I think it's because she normally practices wearing the crown for a week before the ceremonies.

281
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
 --It's really heavy.

282
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
 --It's extremely heavy yeah.

283
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,280
 And so I think she didn't know when to start practicing.

284
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,280
 --It's a little bit like the guy's mum with the website though right.

285
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,280
 She's been wearing the crown so often now that surely she is used to it at this point.

286
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
 It's only her neck muscles is permanently.

287
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,280
 --Look at the queen she doesn't look like Frank Bruno with his back to neck.

288
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
 Does she?

289
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,280
 --Anyway sorry chairs yeah.

290
00:14:52,280 --> 00:15:01,280
 --Can I just ask if because Nixon ordered the Kittinger table and do you think he actually was looking for Kissinger and he just mispronounced it?

291
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
 --And it was all a big mistake.

292
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
 --Is that the we want you guy in the poster?

293
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,280
 --No that's Lord Kitchener from the First World War in the other country.

294
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,280
 --So Kitchener had very little to do with Richard Nixon where it's Kissinger and Nixon were very strong partnership for a very long time.

295
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
 --Oh yeah yeah.

296
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:22,280
 --But he did try and buy some furniture for his kitchen and accidentally got a poster of Lord Kitchener.

297
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:33,280
 --Sorry just to say I read there's a book called Believer my 40 years in politics by David Axelrod who was a chief strategist for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.

298
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,280
 And he says that Obama's chair was slightly taller and he was president.

299
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
 --So it was not the same chair because it's the same table still.

300
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,280
 --I think I thought it was maybe it's not actually.

301
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:48,280
 --So the cabinet office in Downing Street the Prime Minister chair is the only one with arms on.

302
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,280
 --And this is prompted a diplomatic row in the past.

303
00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:00,280
 In 1979 the president of France Valerie Giskert Destaink was visiting the UK and he was going to visit Tatcher in the cabinet room.

304
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,280
 And his aide said yes could you have a chair with equal status to the Prime Minister please and they said what?

305
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,280
 And they said well it's very simple either he wants one with arms or you have to put that one in the corner and Tatcher has to have one without arms.

306
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:21,280
 And they had to write to the British ambassador in Paris to look can you sort this out and he wrote back saying yeah they're really serious about this thing.

307
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,280
 --So we're actually still at war with them.

308
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:34,280
 --The ambassador said his first reaction was to think that the obvious solution was to stand the Prime Minister's chair in a corner and have first seated on the same sort of chair as the president.

309
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
 He thought the president would be very surprised if it was otherwise.

310
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:45,280
 Unfortunately it's not recorded how they solved it but --I think the obvious solution is to have one sit on the other's lap and then they switch around halfway through.

311
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:56,280
 --Hey the other difference of cabinet chairs in the British cabinet room is that the Prime Minister's chair is the only chair that's left on an angle so that it's more accessible to the Prime Minister.

312
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:03,280
 They can just slip into it whereas the others have to pull the chair out to give them that chucked out of it.

313
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:11,280
 --That's very interesting. --Yeah it's just when they walk in all the positions are straight except for the Prime Minister's which is on a slight angle which allows easier access.

314
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,280
 --Another important person in the world who has a high chair is --Prince George.

315
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:29,280
 --I was going to say Lord Sugar in the apprentice. --Oh yeah he has a platform that his chair is on which is about three inches higher so that he's the highest person in the room.

316
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,280
 They found that out because they had a camera shot from behind him in one of the episodes and everyone kind of noticed that there was like a little platform that you sat on.

317
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:45,280
 --Really? --It's interesting. It's always people who are universally loved and respected who have these slightly higher chairs in the box and Alan Sugar.

318
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:58,280
 --So Kozy, if we talked about when So Kozy went to because he was obviously quite sure he went to do a speech in a factory and he had lots of factory workers standing behind him when he made the speech.

319
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:10,280
 And he made sure to select the 20 shortest factory workers to stand behind him and they interviewed them afterwards and said why were you chosen to be in this picture and they said well they checked my height and they said I was adequately small to not make him look too short.

320
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:21,280
 --Was he working in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory? --So okay I do have one wild fact about presidential chairs.

321
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:31,280
 --There was a guy in the 19th century and his name was Seth Kinman, right? He was a hunter. He claimed to have shot 800 grizzly bears in his life.

322
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:44,280
 --Yeah, I'm sure he did. I'm sure he did. He was Californian but he made for a spell every single new president of the USA got a chair made by Seth Kinman and they were the creepiest chairs you've ever seen.

323
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:53,280
 One of them is made just from elk antlers strapped together. He once played for President Lincoln according to Wikipedia on a fiddle made from the skull of a mule.

324
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,280
 --Wow. --This the kind of guy was. Anyway the chair he made for Andrew Johnson was made from two wild bears, right?

325
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:10,280
 The legs of the chair, the four legs were all bare legs and when you touched a cord the head of the grizzly bear would snap out from under the seat and gnash its teeth and then go back.

326
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:19,280
 --That's amazing. Who was that for? --That one was for Andrew Johnson. --That's incredible. You can see photos of it and it is terrifying.

327
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:28,280
 --If you wanted to make a really creepy chair, you should have a chair that then has an arm built into it where if you sit in it the hand is resting on your thigh.

328
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:35,280
 --Oh, I just think that would be a good creepy chair. --That's a good creepy chair. --You're in the market for me. --It was a good idea.

329
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,280
 --Because it's always creepy when someone rests the handle on your thigh. --It's not always creepy.

330
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,280
 --I find it's on detail in the judge.

331
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
 --When you become Prime Minister Anna, you can have one of those chairs in the British cabinet room.

332
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,280
 --Well, probably they wouldn't let me because it has to be this, you know, slightly armchair. Perhaps I can be honest to what you want.

333
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,280
 --As long as you have the same creepy chair for the President of France.

334
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:11,280
 --Can I make a quick presidential chair correction? Many, many, many podcasts ago, probably about 10 in. I made a mistake.

335
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:25,280
 I said that underneath the chair of Barack Obama's Oval Office table was a trap door that should the President and an emergency need to get out of the room, he could open the trap door and slide down the slide.

336
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:37,280
 --It turns out that that's not true. I was fooled by a website, the White House website, which turned out to be a website called Not the White House website, a parody of the White House website.

337
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:45,280
 --And I failed to read the strap line and the not think if this guy needs to replace his mum, he could quite easily lie you down.

338
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:59,280
 --The apologies to anyone who's used that fact because I didn't edit it out of the show. Just point having learned that. --So Richard Nixon's inauguration, one thing he didn't want was a pigeon poo all the way down the road where he was being inaugurated.

339
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
 --Who does?

340
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,280
 --No, every other President has requested it.

341
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:17,280
 --But he was weird, he just didn't like it. And so he decided that what he would do is try and get rid of all the pigeons. And so they sprayed something called Roost No More, which is a burdr repellent on all the trees nearby.

342
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:25,280
 And the idea was it would make the pigeons feet burn and they would fly off. But unfortunately it contained a chemical that killed them.

343
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:37,280
 --And so as he was being inaugurated they went down the road and they were just dead pigeons everywhere. --Amazing. --That's amazing. --That's incredible. --It's not a good start, is it?

344
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:47,280
 --It's a first omen. --Or is it like when you get pooed on by a bird? So that's actually a really good sign. Lots of dead birds falling all over you.

345
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,280
 --Sure, that's what his advisor said. --But that's the thing, I guess being pooed on by birds is supposed to be good luck, isn't it?

346
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:03,280
 --So he's got rid of all the good luck and got pigeon corpses. --That's a double bad luck. --No wonder things played out as they did.

347
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:13,280
 So Nixon was very, very clumsy. I haven't quite realised the plethora of hilarious stories about him. So he used to always drop medals, award ceremonies.

348
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:21,280
 So any military award ceremony was trying to put a medal on somebody to drop it to the extent that --The dead veterans scattered all over the thing.

349
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:33,280
 --So one of his military aid said that he had to take the pins off the back of medals and replace them with clip-on devices, because if he didn't drop the medal, he'd then stab the military person in the chest with it.

350
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:43,280
 He once picked up a lobster as part of like a PR thing. He was visiting a fish farm and he picked up a lobster and it clawed onto his suit, Lapella, wouldn't let go, was hanging from him.

351
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:51,280
 He spilled the inkwill at Downing Street. He always spilled soup on himself and so he said that soup courses had to be eliminated from state venues.

352
00:22:51,280 --> 00:23:01,280
 --That is so funny, it's really good. In middle-kingdom Egypt, it was a symbol of status to have a folding stool.

353
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:12,280
 --Wow! --Yeah, stools were popular, but folding stools were very difficult to get hold of and they were expensive. So if you weren't quite as posh as a feral, but you were pretty posh you would have a folding stool.

354
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,280
 --I didn't even know they were invented as far back as I know, it's amazing. --Is that to prove you are rich enough to go on beach holidays?

355
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,280
 --I think every holiday is a beach holiday in Egypt. --It's a constant beach holiday.

356
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:39,280
 --Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy. --My fact is that there is a special police unit in France whose job is to monitor six million dead people.

357
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:51,280
 --And they are called the catacombs. So these are the guys who look after the catacombs in Paris and the catacombs are this massive thing.

358
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:59,280
 I'd heard of them before, I didn't realize how big they were. They are 200 miles of tunnels over 32 square kilometers in area.

359
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:17,280
 So they still haven't all been explored. It's ten times the area of Central Park in New York. It's absolutely massive. And the catacombs are the people who walk around underground trying to find people who are trespassing and, you know, people who are mistreating the catacombs.

360
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,280
 --So they're not actually policing the dead themselves and checking they don't cause trouble? --No.

361
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:30,280
 --But although if they do cause trouble, I'm sure they'll be first on the scene. --Exactly, yeah. Although there are only five people in the catacombs these days.

362
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,280
 --I read that they're called cataflex in French. --Yeah. --What are the people who go down there? --The cops.

363
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,280
 --Oh, the cops. Oh, that's good. Because everyone is called catacombs. There are cataclasts. These are people who mistreat the catacombs.

364
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:49,280
 They're people who leave rubbish and they spray paint over all the works of art and they're very bad people. But there are catafiles as well. People who love the catacombs and who treat them well.

365
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:58,280
 And then if you're a catafil and you bump into a catacop, you might well let you go. --Sure, if you're a catacolast and you claim you're a catafile, if a catacop comes along.

366
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:05,280
 --Yeah, but if there's litter behind you or you're door being stuff on a wall, then you're carrying spray paint cans. --Exactly, you're a cataclass, aren't you?

367
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:12,280
 --No, no, because I actually took them off a cataclass because I saw they were doing something wrong. So I've got the cans, but they're not mine. I haven't been using them.

368
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,280
 --Oh, well, on your way. Thank you. --And then you point and you say he went that way.

369
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:25,280
 --He went 200 miles that way. --And also there's catachix apparently who are a subculture who walk around the tunnels in bikinis.

370
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,280
 --No, apparently. --Is there a pool down there?

371
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,280
 --There's a lot of flooded catacombs area, in fact. --In that case, yes.

372
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:42,280
 --Yeah. I think it was last year, maybe the year before, a surfer called Allison Teal went surfing inside a catacombs.

373
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:51,280
 You can watch the video. It's pretty extraordinary. She says surfing and all the media said surfing. She's laying on the surfboard in her bikini. She's in a bikini.

374
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:59,280
 And she goes through it, but it's an amazing video because she goes into these tunnels which are super tight. Like it's just her and the surfboard can fit through.

375
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:06,280
 And there's moments where people who've been down there, obviously having fun with all the bones down there, then arranging them into a chair.

376
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:17,280
 --You can see her sit in a bone chair. --What? It's an extraordinary. Like incredible. --Is that chair made by Seth Kinman, the 19th century grizzly bear?

377
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:26,280
 --Oh, they are incredible though, these catacombs. And when the first ever catacop, chief, retired. His name was Jean-Claude Sorrette. He did 20 years in the tunnels.

378
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:34,280
 The catafiles organized a massive feast for him. And he turned up and he said, "I tried for years to catch you, but now I'm retiring. If you want, you can take pictures with me."

379
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,280
 --And they all had their picture taken with them. --Oh, wow. --They threw them a party.

380
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,280
 --I've got to say, catacops sounds like quite a cool 80s cartoon. --It does. --Really does.

381
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,280
 --Are they cats? --Yeah, but they're in the catacombs. --Are they also cops?

382
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,280
 --Oh yeah. --And they wear policemen's outfit. --The catacat. --And it's in the title.

383
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:58,280
 Every element of this cartoon is in the title. --It's right about the 80s. You never had to think about titles of cartoons.

384
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:04,280
 They're usually straight in their thunder cats. They're cats and they like thunder. --Dangerous. --Yeah, yeah. --Dangerous.

385
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,280
 --Did you? --Didn't even have to watch the cartoon. Look at the title. You know what you got.

386
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,280
 --For us Peppa Pig, what's that about? --No one knows. --That's for anyone.

387
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:22,280
 --So the catafiles are incredible, aren't they? I really would recommend looking them up. This is one of those facts. I was so glad you chose it, because I had no idea they existed.

388
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:37,280
 And they sort of invented themselves in about 1980 and the idea is they're kind of urban explorers, but they go around restoring parts of Paris that are going without being restored or the government hasn't got the funds to restore them all.

389
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:49,280
 I think need restoring. And the catafiles are the people who do so in the catacombs. And so for instance, a few years ago, the catacops just came across underground in some of the catacombs that you're not allowed to access.

390
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:59,280
 A cinema, complete with like a bar and a restaurant. This is all underneath the Trocadero, an area of Paris. It had seats to watch films in it.

391
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:09,280
 It had this whole collection of films. They'd wired in at least three phone lines. They had their own electricity system. And they were just people hanging out down there watching films on a big cinema screen.

392
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:17,280
 And so they found this. And they were like, wow, this is amazing. We found this whole cinema system. Who the hell is this? And the police came back three days later.

393
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,280
 And all the electrics have been cut off. And there was just a note that red do not try to find us.

394
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,280
 Wow. Can you find what films they watched? Because I have been trying to find out.

395
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,280
 Oh, right. Yeah. I actually saw the name of one of the films. It's very art house sort of stuff.

396
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:38,280
 Oh, because I was hoping they were watching, you know, Terminator or while you mean, like, lovely bones.

397
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:44,280
 Oh, that'd be good. Like, bone related. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, you can have a great time watching zombie films down there.

398
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,280
 The mummy, surely. Yes. They've all got their own catacomb name as well.

399
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:58,280
 Everyone has a nom de plume or a nom de catacomb down there. And you're not meant to. You're not meant to ask about anyone's above surface life.

400
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,280
 You don't say, so what do you do? Because the answer is I walk around the catacomb. Yeah. I see. Yeah. Right.

401
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:11,280
 Do you know what they also found in the cinema, by the way? They discovered that there was a CCTV monitor in order to see who was coming.

402
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,280
 So they can review the tapes. I guess if they could see if it was cops or anything. And along with the CCTV,

403
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:24,280
 they had a bit of sound equipment. So if anyone passed a certain point, it triggered a dog barking to scare them off from going further down the tunnel.

404
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:31,280
 Wow. Yeah. So it was like, that was their security system to stop the cinema from being discovered. That would work for the catacop cartoon cats.

405
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:41,280
 Yes. But they're very dangerous. These catacombs, if you are not a catapile and if you decide to go exploring off the beaten path as it were, because these are ginormous.

406
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:48,280
 And there are counts of people who've heard of stashes of wine. And they've said, I'm just going to go down and look for a stash of wine and never seen again.

407
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:58,280
 I mean, you're in France. There's wine everywhere. Yeah. I can get some of this mysterious wine that they speak of.

408
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:09,280
 They're very recently two boys disappeared for three days. They were found. They got put into hospital. They had hypothermia. And they were only found because they'd been leaving clues along the way.

409
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:24,280
 But the catacops, I guess, sent in search dogs in order to find them. And they managed to find them. But I kept thinking that that's, you can imagine being a dog and going down into a place with all those bones.

410
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:35,280
 Well, this is a thing. Do you know why the bones are down there in the first place? Because they weren't originally there. So the bones were put underground because all the cemeteries were running out of space in the city above ground. And it was horrible.

411
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:44,280
 So there's a very famous cemetery in Paris called innocent, the innocence. And it was giving off a strong smell of decomposing flesh in the late 18th century.

412
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:56,280
 And supposedly even perfume shops were claiming they couldn't do business because of the off-putting smell. Surely they're the one people should be catching it.

413
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:02,280
 It's amazing, isn't it? Yeah. If they can't support that business opportunity, you know, I don't deserve a wife.

414
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:15,280
 Anyway, in 1780, a wall collapsed, let's innocent, and rotting corpses fell into a nearby house. At that point, people said, oh, maybe we should move these millions and millions of corpses.

415
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,280
 So they over a period of years and years, they moved all these six million bodies from the city cemeteries into the catacombs.

416
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:35,280
 And what it was is they'd had all these tunnels because it was where they mined for limestone. Originally, they would get limestone from near the ground level. But actually, that was kind of spiraling the top soil so you couldn't make any agriculture there or anything like that.

417
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,280
 So they had to go deep, deep down to get their rocks.

418
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:50,280
 And this is amazing. Once they've made, they got rid of all the rock and the catacombs existed, but completely abandoned because they weren't being used for anything. People started farming there.

419
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,280
 So mushrooms were grown in these catacombs and all the farmers got kicked out because they wanted to throw all the bones in there.

420
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
 No way.

421
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:04,280
 And still today, in bits of catacombs that are not occupied by bones are growing mushrooms still.

422
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:12,280
 I got to say, someone who's scared of mushrooms like, hey, I have a real phobia. I think I could live with the bones and the skulls and stuff like that.

423
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,280
 You'd brush it out and I really would. That's a horror movie.

424
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:26,280
 And here's the other thing about the catacombs is they are the reason that Paris has maintained not having high risers in the city.

425
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
 Because they collapse.

426
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,280
 They would collapse. There's the ground underneath them. It are not stable enough in order to allow for high-rise buildings.

427
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:40,280
 It was Louis the 16th. He founded the organisation, the IGC, the inspection general to carry here, which does all the maintenance and mapping.

428
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:49,280
 And he was forced to found it because in 1774, 300 meters of street just collapsed into a 20 meter deep hole.

429
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
 Imagine.

430
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
 Wow.

431
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:58,280
 Because obviously the limestone is eroded or is eaten away by rain or whatever it might be. And suddenly, boom, 300 meters of a street.

432
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,280
 It sounds almost fun to be on a street that then kind of turns into a tunnel sign.

433
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,280
 What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I'm not saying it would be. It sounds like it could be.

434
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
 My sister is terrified of sinkholes.

435
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
 Yeah, me too.

436
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
 Absolutely.

437
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
 It has a massive phobia.

438
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,280
 Doesn't she live in a cemetery?

439
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 No, the other sisters are right here.

440
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:23,280
 Surely it's more logical if you do live in a cemetery to be afraid of falling into the ground.

441
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
 Because you've seen all these other people who've done it.

442
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,280
 My sister. That's not how they all die.

443
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,280
 My sister who lives in a cemetery grows her own vegetables.

444
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,280
 And my other sister who doesn't live in a cemetery refuses to eat them because she thinks they've got dead bodies in it.

445
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
 Oh, I don't blame her.

446
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,280
 That's, yeah, there's something about that connection.

447
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,280
 You eat crops grown with excrement as fertilizer. That doesn't bother you, does it?

448
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
 Yeah, but it's not bizarre.

449
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,280
 That we're constantly eating food that's grown using cow poo, human poo, or poo.

450
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
 It's just poo. Any kind of poo.

451
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
 It works.

452
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
 But does the trick.

453
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
 That is weird, isn't it?

454
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
 We're all over it now.

455
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
 Well, enough gets made of that.

456
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
 You're right. I agree with you.

457
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:10,280
 People always say they look at like the way that animals are killed and say maybe if you knew how your animals were killed, you would all go vegetarian.

458
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
 Yeah.

459
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,280
 But maybe if you knew that there was poo smeared all over your vegetables, you'd only eat meat.

460
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:25,280
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

461
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
 And that is my fact.

462
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,280
 My fact this week is that the number one place to buy CDs in Indonesia now is KFC.

463
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,280
 KFC, the fast food restaurant.

464
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
 They should call it KFCD.

465
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
 Oh, yeah.

466
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
 This is amazing.

467
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
 This is such an amazing fact.

468
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
 This is extraordinary.

469
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,280
 Hang on. KFCD will be the Kentucky Fried Chicken disc.

470
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
 Kentucky Fried Compact disc.

471
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,280
 KFCD is what you're suggesting.

472
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
 Yeah.

473
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:02,280
 So in Indonesia now, in KFC, when you go to buy your chicken, you are offered a bundle deal in which you can also purchase a CD.

474
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:10,280
 And they sell over 500,000 albums a month in the KFCs all over Indonesia.

475
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:18,280
 And this was set up by a very well-respected, well-known producer of bands like the Killers, predominantly you two.

476
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,280
 He's done the majority of their biggest albums outside of Brinino.

477
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,280
 And he realized over there, credit cards and streaming isn't such a massive thing.

478
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
 So people are still buying the physical objects.

479
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,280
 CDs get sold for $4 and there's a lot of black market CDs that go on.

480
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,280
 He thought no one goes out to buy things anymore physically, but they do go out to buy chicken.

481
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,280
 So what if I combined chicken and CDs together and started selling them there and it's absolutely worked?

482
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,280
 So he releases at the moment, predominantly Indonesian artists, but they're looking into bringing in the Western.

483
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,280
 You two have got that new album coming out, haven't they, Family Bucket?

484
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,280
 His name's Steve Lilly White, by the way, the producer of all these albums.

485
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
 He's done the Rolling Stones as well.

486
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
 I mean, he's ginormous.

487
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
 They interviewed him. The New York Times interviewed him.

488
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,280
 And he said, "My job is basically like running a record label, except this record label also happens to sell chicken."

489
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,280
 So I think his amount is not fully adjusted to the new reality.

490
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:21,280
 He very much sounds like a man who used to be a record label guy, then fell on hard times, got a job at KFC.

491
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,280
 And then someone from the New York Times came along and said, "I knew that guy who used to produce you too."

492
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,280
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, I still do that kind of stuff."

493
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:40,280
 But incredibly, that's not the case. While he gave this interview to the New York Times, he was busy mixing or playing the latest U2 single that he just made in the background.

494
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,280
 Like this is a guy who's like jumping between producing pop hits and selling...

495
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,280
 And the music that he sells in KFC in Indonesia is not English language, is it?

496
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
 So it's all Indonesian music at the moment.

497
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,280
 And he says that he thinks 98% of the music sales come from people who just went to buy chicken and turn up there and go,

498
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
 "Oh, I'll have a CD too."

499
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
 Impulse buy, it definitely makes sense.

500
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
 But also, piracy is not necessarily bad for CD sales.

501
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,280
 So Japan is somewhere where CDs are still a huge thing.

502
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,280
 So I think globally 39% of music sales come from CDs.

503
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
 Or this is true last year, the year before.

504
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:24,280
 Whereas in Japan, it's 75%. And piracy isn't necessarily a bad thing because apparently when people pirate CDs, they copy them onto other CDs.

505
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,280
 And that gets people used to just physically having CDs.

506
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,280
 I think people are all used to physically having CDs now.

507
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,280
 I think that's the argument of a pirate in the dog.

508
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
 Quite possibly.

509
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,280
 Actually, it's having to spread the sale of CDs just happened to be blank ones that I was buying and then ripping off.

510
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
 I don't know.

511
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
 The Japan thing is bizarre though, the CD thing.

512
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,280
 So CDs in Japan cost about 25 pounds on average, each one.

513
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
 So it's not like they're cheaper.

514
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
 What's because of all the bonus tracks?

515
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,280
 Japan famously, there's a great comedian who once said where all the bonus tracks live.

516
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:07,280
 Every Japanese CD, which is why they're often imported to other countries around the world, is there may be four songs that don't appear on a CD released in the West.

517
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,280
 So if Coldplay releases an album there, most likely there'll be four bonus tracks, which are the B-sides or something that they would use later down the line.

518
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,280
 Four more completely indistinguishable tracks.

519
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,280
 Well, I don't know how disappointed you'd be if you got to the end of what you thought was a Coldplay album and tell that there were four more tracks you had to listen to.

520
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,280
 The first massive selling CD was "Diastrates".

521
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,280
 It was an album called "Brothers in Arms", and it was the first one to sell a million CDs. It was absolutely huge.

522
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,280
 And since then, I think it's all about something crazy, like 50 or 30 million copies.

523
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:48,280
 But they were the band who were chosen for the big push of the CD, because the guys who made it for Philips said their mainstream enough.

524
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,280
 Like we can't push punk, we can't push something as "Nisha".

525
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,280
 But also maybe they didn't want something really poppy.

526
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
 Is that right? They wanted something another song.

527
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,280
 I guess so. But they were the ones who were almost chosen for that massive promotional push. It was interesting.

528
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:12,280
 The first person to have a CD released in America was Bruce Brinkstein, born in the USA, wasn't he? But Abba was the first band to be imprinted onto a CD.

529
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
 It's always the big ones.

530
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,280
 When you say that kind of thing, it almost feels like there probably was someone else.

531
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
 Doesn't it? Yeah.

532
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,280
 It kind of depends, though, because it's launching a new medium.

533
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,280
 So I guess like Jay-Z doing "Tidal". You know, he signed up.

534
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,280
 So "Tidal" is its own Spotify, effectively.

535
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,280
 "Tidal" is looking at my completely blank face about the words Jay-Z and "Tidal".

536
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,280
 So "Tidal" is like its own iTunes, its own Spotify. It's an exclusive streaming and downloading place.

537
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
 You can only listen to Jay-Z.

538
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,280
 You can only listen to Jay-Z. It's like a beat of Max, but all the tapes are Jay-Z.

539
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
 Exactly.

540
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
 Okay, I understand. When you put it like that.

541
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,280
 So "Beyonce" released her Lemonade album on there, and as a result, it didn't make it to the top of the charts.

542
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,280
 That's the first time that's ever happened to Beyonce in a solo career because it was a new medium and not enough people were signed up.

543
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,280
 Right. But yeah, so you need a biggie in order to push the medium.

544
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
 Yeah.

545
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,280
 Just in Japan, on Japan CDs, you were saying they come with extras.

546
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,280
 So as well as bonus tracks, they come with other extra things as well.

547
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,280
 So now they're keeping the CD market alive in Japan by giving away prizes with CDs.

548
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,280
 So you get raffle tickets with CDs, you get these prizes, you get a family bucket.

549
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,280
 A raffle ticket is a terrible prize because it's basically not a prize, is it?

550
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,280
 It's a piece of paper, which always is a prize.

551
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,280
 It's almost always not a very nice bottle of wine, though.

552
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
 Or a box of matchmakers.

553
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
 Yeah, exactly.

554
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,280
 You can get, sometimes, if you're the first, you know, thousands of people to buy a CD,

555
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,280
 you get the handshake thing, which is where you get to meet the band of the CD you've bought and shake that hand.

556
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
 That's incredible.

557
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
 Yeah, exactly. Get to Japan, Andy.

558
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
 But this is a cool thing.

559
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,280
 So there's a band in Japan, I think we might have talked about before called AKB48,

560
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
 which is a band with loads of members.

561
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,280
 And they hold band elections via CD purchases.

562
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,280
 So the way they get people to buy their CDs is if you buy a CD by these guys,

563
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
 then it has a ballot paper inside.

564
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,280
 And you can write on that ballot paper, which member of the band is your favourite?

565
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
 And then it's announced who's the favourite.

566
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
 Wow.

567
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
 So that gets people to buy it.

568
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
 That's pretty harsh.

569
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
 Yeah.

570
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
 You're in that band.

571
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
 Yeah, but at least there are 50 members.

572
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
 Those are supposed to be the Rolling Stones, but there are five of them.

573
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
 You get to call a Rolling Stone every time.

574
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
 It's Chas and Dave.

575
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,280
 And every year, Dave's like, sorry, Chas.

576
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,280
 Well, it's not the end of the world if you lose,

577
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,280
 because the girl that came 48, or the girl that came bottom in the vote one year,

578
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
 the following year, I think this is last year or the year before,

579
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,280
 one fan spent £240,000, buying up as many CDs as they possibly could

580
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
 in order to send all the votes.

581
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
 Because there's no limit to how many times you can vote.

582
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
 Whoa.

583
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,280
 So what I would say is if you want to buy 250,000 copies of our new book that comes out.

584
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
 It's a pen book.

585
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
 Should we put a little ballot paper inside saying,

586
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
 who's your favourite member of the pop-up?

587
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
 I really don't think we should.

588
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
 I could be absolutely sure.

589
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
 I think for you and me, we should.

590
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,280
 Why don't you just photocopy the bit of paper?

591
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
 That's a lot of money.

592
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
 There's going to be a barcode on there, isn't there?

593
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,280
 Some listener in Japan is going, "Fuck right now!"

594
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,280
 With a massive countercruel of unsolved CDs.

595
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,280
 Eating that dinner often makes maths.

596
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,280
 People keep releasing CDs in Sims language, by the way.

597
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
 What?

598
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
 What does that mean?

599
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
 You never played on the Sims.

600
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,280
 It sounds like you have an eye for the way you said that.

601
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,280
 No, I was going to like to play on the Sims.

602
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,280
 I think I'm the only one who has played the Sims.

603
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
 I've never played on the Sims.

604
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
 I've never played on the Sims.

605
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
 I've never played on the Sims.

606
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
 I've never played on the Sims.

607
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,280
 I just didn't ever talk about it until now, apparently.

608
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,280
 I was actually looking at weird music brand partnerships for this.

609
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,280
 Simlish is the language they speak in Sims.

610
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,280
 Katie Perry has recorded a song on an album called Teenage Dream.

611
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
 What?

612
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,280
 No, I need B-side.

613
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
 I'm with Anna on this.

614
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,280
 What is that about for something?

615
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,280
 It's not something I would say.

616
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,280
 It's one of the best-selling albums of this decade.

617
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
 Well, I bet I'm the only one.

618
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,280
 I'm the only one of us for that's heard the Simlish version.

619
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,280
 So who's the big of Katie Perry fans?

620
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,280
 All these bands keep releasing albums in Simlish.

621
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
 Okay, go.

622
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
 Depeche mode.

623
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
 Rita Aura, Lily Allen.

624
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,280
 Cool.

625
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
 They will release Simlish songs.

626
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,280
 That is very cool.

627
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,280
 And so they just redo the language.

628
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,280
 Is there an album where you can buy all the Simlish songs?

629
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,280
 No, that's what I call Simlish.

630
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,280
 One of the guys who developed the CD for Philips.

631
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,280
 When it was first introduced, he was so excited about the new technology.

632
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,280
 He said, "I decided to get rid of all my final albums and get my old Rolling Stones and Beatles records on CD.

633
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
 It still hurts."

634
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,280
 Because he just feels like a complete idiot that he did that.

635
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,280
 He got rid of all these fantastic original Rolling Stones and Beatles records.

636
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
 And he just has one CD now.

637
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
 He was married to the cause though.

638
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280
 You've got to throw yourself in with both people to this.

639
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
 All five of the cause.

640
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
 He was married too.

641
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
 Even Jim?

642
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
 Yeah.

643
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,280
 That is big of me.

644
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,280
 You should go in the stocks for like five hours for that.

645
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:21,280
 It's a joke that dates us, doesn't it?

646
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
 I mean, I did a chasadave joke.

647
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:32,280
 We're all revealing our deeper secrets about, you know, Jay-Z or playing on the Sims.

648
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:41,280
 In Indonesia, there's a big trend for music related to bus horns.

649
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
 Okay.

650
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
 And this is like a little meme that starts on the internet.

651
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,280
 And it's...

652
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,280
 They videoed these kids holding signs up reading "om tello letom."

653
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,280
 Okay.

654
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
 Which means...

655
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
 Honk driver, honk.

656
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,280
 Or driver, honk driver.

657
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,280
 I'm not sure which one.

658
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,280
 And the thing is, Indonesian buses have got really cool horns.

659
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,280
 So they make like little melodic noises.

660
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,280
 And the kids just wanted to hear these horns.

661
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
 And it became a bit of an internet meme.

662
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,280
 And now there's a load of DJs in Indonesia who are making songs related to bus horns.

663
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,280
 Cool.

664
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,280
 That's very cool.

665
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,280
 So popular DJs such as Z and Firebeats.

666
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
 And DJ Marshmello.

667
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,280
 You say that in the same tone of voice.

668
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
 Yeah.

669
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,280
 The Anna talks about Casey Perry.

670
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,280
 So we've all got blind spots, there's a lot of things.

671
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,280
 Because Andy's downloaded their albums already.

672
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,280
 I love DJ Marshmello and the other one you said.

673
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,280
 I've got some KFC stuff.

674
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
 Do you?

675
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,280
 Yeah, me, me, me.

676
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,280
 Yeah.

677
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,280
 Finally, we're getting to the nub of this fact.

678
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,280
 So in Japan, they have a KFC with a high-end whiskey bar.

679
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
 Cool.

680
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,280
 She's pretty good.

681
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,280
 In Russia, they had an advert because people weren't really eating KFC.

682
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,280
 They had an advert.

683
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,280
 And what it was is there was a little kid in a school.

684
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
 And he was eating KFC or something.

685
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
 And the teacher got annoyed.

686
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,280
 And so the teacher got the bucket and put it on this kid's head.

687
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,280
 And he had to walk around school with a bucket on his head.

688
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
 Wow.

689
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
 And it started.

690
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,280
 He hasn't been aging quite prematurely.

691
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,280
 Yeah.

692
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,280
 And it was just a meme in Russia, like the bucket head meme.

693
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,280
 I don't think we've mentioned this before.

694
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
 This year KFC have released a novel for the first time.

695
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
 What?

696
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,280
 It's a novel starring the Colonel.

697
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,280
 And it's a mils and boon style romance.

698
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,280
 And it's called Tender Wings of Desire.

699
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,280
 He is a sexy man.

700
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,280
 Well, we have to tell you before we started recording this podcast

701
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
 that you're quite fancy Richard Nixon.

702
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
 Oh, yeah.

703
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,280
 So you're talking--

704
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,280
 And did we miss that when we got to that?

705
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,280
 We didn't have to tell you that.

706
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
 That's warping of the truth.

707
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,280
 Oh, I'm sorry.

708
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,280
 I find him not unattractive.

709
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,280
 Give him that.

710
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,280
 Well, for Andy, that's pretty much someone saying you're attractive.

711
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,280
 That's the best I can hope for these days.

712
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,280
 I'm not physically repulsed by him.

713
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,280
 Great, Dave.

714
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,280
 He said in an interview that something like,

715
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
 I know how I look.

716
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,280
 I'm under no illusions about my appearance.

717
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,280
 So I'll have to be good in other ways.

718
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,280
 And I read that interview.

719
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
 And I thought, well, he's good in other ways, isn't he?

720
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
 Yeah.

721
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
 Lots of ways.

722
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,280
 Richard Nixon is a very good man.

723
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
 What would he say?

724
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,280
 What are your top five ways in which he's a great guy?

725
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,280
 Got a bird problem?

726
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,280
 He's your man.

727
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,280
 Colonel Sanders was kind of divorced from KFC

728
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,280
 from quite early on, as he sold the company.

729
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,280
 So he did loads of marketing for it throughout his life.

730
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,280
 He traveled 250,000 miles, I think,

731
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,280
 visiting KFC restaurants around the world until he died in 1980.

732
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,280
 But he used to turn up unexpected at various KFC outlets,

733
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,280
 constantly, to test their chicken because he was really pissed off

734
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,280
 that they weren't using the video.

735
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,280
 He was a big picture of him on the wall.

736
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,280
 On every bucket there's a picture of his face.

737
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,280
 People behind the desk would be like,

738
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,280
 you look a bit familiar.

739
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,280
 I guess if he takes the suit off and the glasses.

740
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,280
 He never did.

741
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,280
 They showed him into it.

742
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,280
 He's completely recognizable.

743
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,280
 He never took his-- what?

744
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
 Even in the shower.

745
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,280
 Even when he was swimming.

746
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,280
 Richard, Ronald McDonald was going to every McDonald's

747
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,280
 as a secret customer.

748
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
 It's just not going to work.

749
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,280
 Well, gave it away.

750
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,280
 Was it my height?

751
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,280
 Yeah.

752
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,280
 So first of all, he literally didn't go out in public

753
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,280
 without wearing his white suit.

754
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,280
 And he bleached his facial hair to match his head hair and stuff.

755
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,280
 So he never didn't wear his white suit.

756
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,280
 And he turned up unannounced.

757
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,280
 And then they would serve.

758
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,280
 He'd say, give me your chicken and gravy.

759
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,280
 Please.

760
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,280
 [LAUGHTER]

761
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,280
 And then he would be really angry if they got it wrong,

762
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
 which they often did.

763
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,280
 So KFC sued him once.

764
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,280
 [LAUGHTER]

765
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
 They did.

766
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,280
 They sued him for referring to their gravy

767
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,280
 as sludge and wallpaper-like.

768
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
 Because he turned up and said it was bad.

769
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,280
 He sold the company.

770
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,280
 He sold the company.

771
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
 He was still doing their marketing and stuff.

772
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,280
 But he turned up and he--

773
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
 Was I pro-smoking?

774
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,280
 [LAUGHTER]

775
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,280
 Trying new wallpaper-y sludge.

776
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,280
 [LAUGHTER]

777
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,280
 There was one employee who complained.

778
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,280
 So he did say there was a piece on him in the New York Times

779
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,280
 in the '70s when they interviewed him saying,

780
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,280
 "The Colonel is vexed almost beyond endurance

781
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,280
 by the subject of gravy."

782
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,280
 And one of the executives that KFC said,

783
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,280
 "Look, the Colonel's gravy was fantastic,

784
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
 but you had to be a Rhodes scholar to cook it."

785
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,280
 It was really, really complicated recipe

786
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,280
 that was way too labor-intensive.

787
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,280
 I think everyone really likes KFC gravy, don't they?

788
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,280
 Is it that of the thing that everyone loves about it?

789
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,280
 I think it is a thing.

790
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,280
 Because he did make this massive deal about the gravy.

791
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,280
 What did he win the case?

792
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,280
 He had to pay $1 million.

793
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,280
 A lot of damages.

794
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,280
 Yeah.

795
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,280
 Well, he called the gravy sludgey wallpaper pay.

796
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,280
 So what do you expect?

797
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,280
 I guess so.

798
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,280
 They sued him for about 30 million, I think.

799
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,280
 And he got it down to a minute.

800
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,280
 He could have said it's all gravy and the dark.

801
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,280

803
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,280
 OK, that's it.

804
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,280
 That is all of our facts.

805
