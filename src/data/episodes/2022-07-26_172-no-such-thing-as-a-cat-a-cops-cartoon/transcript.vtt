00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.440
 --Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.760
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.040
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.480
 and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.920
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.960
 --My fact this week is that in China, you can hire mistress dispellers to lure away your

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.200
 husband's mistress. --Yeah --What if your husband

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.760
 doesn't have a mistress? Do you have to hire a mistress and then hire a mistress dispeller?

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.120
 --Of course twice as much and it's almost futile. This was a piece of the New Yorker which

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.240
 they did on this new thing, which is becoming bigger and bigger, which are these companies

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.480
 that call themselves mistress dispellers and if your husband has a mistress that you

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.320
 know about and I think people have a lot of men in China are quite unsuttle about it,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.080
 then you go to one of these mistress dispelling services and you say can you sort this out

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.160
 and they charge tens of thousands of dollars but they do a really comprehensive service.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.200
 They have a psychotherapist, they have lawyers and it's a two-pronged attack, so one psychotherapist

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.080
 goes to the mistress and lures her away so for instance there was one case where a mistress

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.340
 was convinced by the therapist to get a job in a different city.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.000
 --Yeah, they're banned from getting emotionally involved, although there are stories of some

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.620
 male mistress dispellers who will start having an affair with the mistress.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.440
 --Yeah and there are lots of different companies so lots of them do different things, so there

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.080
 are some companies that say don't get involved but then there are other companies that openly

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.480
 say our mistress dispellers are attractive men, they're there to seduce the mistresses.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.920
 --What's up, you guys probably know this, I'm surprised I don't.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.280
 What is the male mistress?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 --Master.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 --Just a master.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280
 --Masterus?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.760
 --Well, mistress is a feminine version of the word master, that's...

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 --Yeah.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 --But there is no...

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.920
 --I think my wife's got a master.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.480
 --You'd say she's got a fancy man.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480
 --Right.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480
 --Sorry, I think.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
 --A fancy man.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480
 --It's what I'd say.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.920
 --So obviously there's no equivalent because we've lived in a very sexist society for

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.920
 the last 4,000 years.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.680
 --I know we may not have the wording but are there fancy man dispellers in China as well as

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 mistress?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.520
 --I don't think there are because it's just not such a commonplace thing.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520
 --Isn't it true?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.680
 I read somewhere that like actual family counsellors and people like that really don't

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.840
 think this is a particularly good idea at all.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.120
 --That sounds very plausible.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.000
 --I read that it was the director of the Guangdong province marriage and family counsellors

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.280
 association who says really these problems need to be solved between the husband and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.140
 the wife rather than spending tens of thousands of pounds.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.140
 --No, absolutely not.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.640
 You need to spend $45,000 siring someone to trick your mistress into leaving here.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.880
 --It's funny because if it's a traditional family where the husband is earning the money

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.400
 and sharing it with the wife, the wife then goes and spends the money on getting rid of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.640
 the mistress.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.160
 So it's money circling around.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160
 Do you see what I mean?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 --Yes, it's my husband.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160
 --The man has the breadwinner.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.560
 It's then the husband's own money that's being spent on getting rid of his mistress.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.260
 --Yes, it's quite pleasing.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.280
 --Do you think he notices and says what's happened to all of our money and then the wife says

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.720
 what I've I spent on disposing of that woman you wish.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.880
 --But I think that's probably the problem is that some of the case studies where they produce

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.840
 accounts from the wives and the reason they've done it.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.600
 In some cases they've said too much money is disappearing from the family account because

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.160
 these guys with the mistress have gone too far in they're spending way too much money

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
 on them.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.040
 --So stop to that by throwing thousands of dollars more.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.160
 You'll have lots of very happy marriages of extremely poor people.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.160
 --Yeah.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.440
 I found another curious job.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.400
 This is a website tester.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.800
 So basically a lot of people release new websites they've created and they're way too complicated

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.880
 in some cases, unusable, not very friendly.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.440
 So this is called this user is my mum and it's this guy's mum who is very bad at the internet.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.480
 It's out your website and says out loud I don't understand what is this doing how's this

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.520
 lead and he writes you a report and his mum just tested it.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.080
 --What's interesting about this is it's a job where the more you do it the worse you get

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080
 it.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.080
 --Yeah.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.520
 --You get more proficient on the internet so you wouldn't be as stupid.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 --Yes.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.520
 --It's still going.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 --You must be replaced.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.520
 --She must be replaced.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.520
 --She must be replaced.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.920
 --You can't secretly replace someone's mother like you might do a hamster.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.120
 --I don't know how it knows it is.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.000
 --This isn't really a job, this is one bloke but James you and I were talking about China's

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.680
 doing this massive face recognition drive at the moment and they're installing facial recognition

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.880
 technology everywhere and you need it now to get into your taxi app on your phone or

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.960
 you need to get into your digital wallet or all this stuff.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.480
 But there is a guy called I think he's called Wang Yuheng and last year he beat a facial recognition

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.800
 software machine.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.560
 He's one of these super recognisers right and he played three rounds against a machine and

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.040
 it was a draw for the first two rounds and then he won the third one but on the TV show

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.360
 he was on last year.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.400
 He successfully identified a single glass of water from more than 520 identical glasses

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 of water.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 --What?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 --Yep.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400
 --Yep.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400
 --Yep.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.480
 --Well the one thing here is they can't have been identical.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 Yeah.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.680
 --They were identical to you and I but really.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.840
 --What did he see in it?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.840
 What are you seeing?

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840
 --I don't know.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840
 --I don't know.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.840
 --I don't know whether that was the only one which was.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.760
 --That one was half empty and all the others were half full.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.640
 --I went to a club the other week and they had facial recognition stuff so you went with

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.120
 your ID and they scanned your ID and then they scanned your face and it had to look the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.400
 same otherwise they wouldn't let you in.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.840
 But mine didn't look the same because my ID is from when I was about 18 when I had shot

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.240
 hair but they just let me go anyway.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.840
 --They must look at the age it was taken at and they thought that guy is obviously this guy

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840
 needs a drink.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.640
 --This guy is at a hard life and that's not it.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.440
 --That was the same club I tried to get into at the weekend to meet you and they didn't

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.320
 let me in but then I didn't bring any ID so that's probably they couldn't scan it.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.320
 --Just brought a glass of water.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.080
 --Wait you guys hanging out on the weekend?

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080
 --Yeah what the hell?

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080
 --We went to a party.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.080
 --You guys are invited I think?

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080
 --I don't know.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.080
 --I just just not mention it.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080
 --Yeah.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.960
 --Well I've been doing a bit of extra research because I've been freer the weekend.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.820
 I was reading about sort of the King's mistress which in France was an official position for

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.820
 centuries.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.320
 You'd get your own flats and you'd get an official title and so Madame de Pompadot was

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.720
 an extremely famous mistress to Louis XV for 20 years despite the fact they didn't

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720
 really sleep together.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.880
 She found other women for him to go to bed with and then she would just talk to him.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880
 --So she's a pimp?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.880
 --Well no she's Madame.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.880
 --A Madame yes.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880
 --A Madame yeah.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.880
 --Well she is Madame de Pompadot yeah.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.920
 --Yeah but she used to be called Miss Fish she was called Mamzel Poisson before she was

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.920
 elevated.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920
 --Was that her surname?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.920
 --Yeah.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920
 --Yeah yeah.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.740
 But when she met Louis XIV it was at a ball in 1745 where she was dressed as a Jepadess

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.760
 and he was dressed as a tree.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.640
 --So does she bring her sheep underneath him to shelter from the rain or something?

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.640
 --Yeah I think that was it.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640
 --Yeah yeah.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640
 --So romantic.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640
 --Very cool.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.260
 --Until 2006 in America if you wanted to get divorced you could get divorced in Guam

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.840
 by mail.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.200
 So both of the people could write to Guam and say we want to get divorced and they would

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.680
 just do it.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.180
 You need never have ever been to Guam you could just do that and that was a legal thing.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.680
 And then they changed the law so now you can still get divorced in Guam but you need

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.680
 to have stayed there for eight days and no one does it anymore.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.040
 --Yeah because Guam is really far from everywhere.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.880
 Imagine how suspicious you'd be as the partner when they say hey I've booked us a holiday

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880
 to Guam.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880
 --How about you?

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.960
 --I'll ask work for eight days after you pick it.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.280
 --So Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter which was advice to a friend on choosing a mistress.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280
 Have any of you read this?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280
 --Yeah bedside reading.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.480
 --It's not going well is it handy so this is a last chance.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480
 --That is harsh no.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480
 I've just been dispelled.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.880
 --They didn't dispelled the mistress they dispelled the husband it was the only case they decided

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.880
 to change policy.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:44.480
 --She's way better off of that other guy which is kind of fancy man.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.480
 --He still uses phrases like fancy man.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.480
 --What is the phrase?

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.480
 What's the word?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.480
 --Well master according to James.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.480
 --I was talking etymological.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.480
 --Bit on the side that's it.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480
 --Squeeze.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480
 --Squeeze.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480
 --Yeah sorry am I you were saying else.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480
 --Anyways.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480
 --Squeeze is not.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.480
 --Squeeze is just as old as fancy man.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.480
 --Sorce gentlemen.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.480
 --Andy and I are from the same century.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.480
 --Sorce gentlemen.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.480
 --Speaking of centuries.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.280
 So Ben Franklin in the 18th century wrote this letter to a friend of his called Cad Waller

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.640
 Colton who had written a letter to Ben Franklin saying I really want a mistress and a

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.680
 mistress in those days wasn't someone who you were cheating on your wife where it was just

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.280
 if you didn't have a wife anyone you wanted to have sex with was your mistress.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.280
 So Ben where you got this was you wrote to Benjamin Franklin.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:34.280
 --And he would get his mum to look through a list of people.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.280
 --Maybe his mum was involved because his first piece of advice was choose an older woman.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.280
 --When you ring old Mrs Franklin I hope she's good.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.280
 --Anyway he wrote this letter in 1745 and it was actually genuinely quite good advice.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.280
 And first of all it said actually advise you get married.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.280
 But if you will insist on not getting married for a while first of all get married to an

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.280
 older woman because they're smarter they've lived longer they've got better chat.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.280
 And also he said there's no hazard of children which irregularly produced may be attended

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.280
 with much inconvenience.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.280
 --So he's talking about quite an older woman.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.280
 --Well indeed postman appausal and he also says when they stop being beautiful they study

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.280
 to be good in other ways but it sounds a little misogynistic.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:23.280
 --I don't know what you're talking about James I'm the woman here and I think he's right on the feminist money.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.280
 But this is interesting he says don't worry about the appearance issue because even

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.280
 though in old age some bits get wrinkly it starts from the top down.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.280
 So he says the face first gets wrinkled then the neck and then the breasts and arms

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:42.280
 but the lower parts continue to last as plump as ever so that if you cover all above with a basket

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.280
 and regard only what is below the girdle it is impossible to know an old woman from a young woman.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.280
 --We're absolutely right this is feminist.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.280
 --Happy birthday darling get the basket ready.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.280
 --Fucked upgrade you to a deeper basket.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.280
 --Basket does your pregnant side off with.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:06.280
 You should see my mom she's got a basket on them she's all right.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.280
 --A teacher actually got in trouble for using a quote from this letter in his classroom

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.280
 but there's this teacher in Oklahoma and he had a picture in his classroom of a cat

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:19.280
 and he had the quote in the dark all cats agree which maybe is saying something

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.280
 about don't judge my appearance and actually Frank been said in this letter also

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.280
 you don't need to worry about the appearance because in the dark all cats agree

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.280
 as in doesn't know you're telling the lights out not an issue and this teacher got suspended.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.280
 --It's quite an old gag as well.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.280
 I mean that was used by one of the Russians Catherine the Great or Peter the Great or somebody.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.280
 --Oh it was about the same kind of era.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.280
 --It would have been like darker then as well right because this is pre-electricity

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.280
 so yeah just when it gets dark either got your candles or you're in the dark.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.280
 --So are you saying people even more were even more familiar with darkness?

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.280
 --Just cats like might as well not have even bothered.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.280
 --Yeah I mean what's the point of having color if you're a cat in the open days?

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.280
 --That's a cat's car blend anyway.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.280
 --No.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.280
 --No.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.280
 --I think it's dogs.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.280
 --Yeah.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280
 --Old dogs are great.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280
 --To all of the dogs.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.280
 --To all of the dogs.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.280
 --All the time.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.280
 --Do you know that the first ever divorce in America was due to bigomy.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.280
 I was a guy called James Luxford and he was found a hundred pounds

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.280
 and sentenced to an hour in the stocks but they gave him an even worse punishment

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.280
 which is the worst they could come up with.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.280
 They banished him to England.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.280
 --Oh wow.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.280
 --That is rough.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.280
 --I guess if you're an American being sent back to England isn't embarrassing because it's like being sent back to your mum's house.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.280
 --Yeah it is.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.280
 --That's exactly what it is because they were all English.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 They'd old come over for their new life.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.280
 --Oh okay right.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.280
 --Okay we don't need you here anymore.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.280
 Head off back to England.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.280
 --Do you think you went back to England and went?

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280
 Didn't even like it there anyway.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.280
 There's rubbish.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.280
 --Two many wives.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:59.280
 --Okay it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:05.280
 --My fact this week is that Richard Nixon's chair was 2.5 inches higher than everyone else's in the cabinet room.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.280
 --It's amazing.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:15.280
 --So I read this in an article in International Business Times and it's about how much money Donald Trump has spent on furnishings for the White House.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:21.280
 So in four months he spent 133 thousand dollars which is triple what Obama spent.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.280
 But one of the things he bought was a conference table from a company called Kittinger.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:33.280
 And on Kittinger's website it says that they got this stuff for Richard Nixon including a 24 chairs around a table

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.280
 one of which was 2.5 inches higher than the rest and that was for him.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.280
 --It's just the back I think.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.280
 I think the back of the chair isn't it?

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:47.280
 --The back of the chair is just the horizontal bit that supports your back but surely if that's higher then you will look a bit shorter relatively in your chair.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:56.280
 --I think the idea being that you have such a magnificent chair 5 inches that people give you a bit more kind of leeway because like it's like a throne isn't it?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280
 --Yes.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.280
 --Big throne that the queen sits on presumably I don't know does she sit on a big throne?

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.280
 --Yeah imagine she sits on one that bit like the game of thrones I am thrown.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.280
 --Yeah a bit less bony but a bit less made of swords.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.280
 --Yeah but she did at the opening of Parliament.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.280
 --Oh yeah.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.280
 --And one of the reasons because obviously they were mucking around with when they were going to have the queen speech.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.280
 I think part of the reason that she was angry they said it was going to be because she was going to miss Ascot and she loves seeing the horses.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:28.280
 But also I think it's because she normally practices wearing the crown for a week before the ceremonies.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.280
 --It's really heavy.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.280
 --It's extremely heavy yeah.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.280
 And so I think she didn't know when to start practicing.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.280
 --It's a little bit like the guy's mum with the website though right.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.280
 She's been wearing the crown so often now that surely she is used to it at this point.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.280
 It's only her neck muscles is permanently.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.280
 --Look at the queen she doesn't look like Frank Bruno with his back to neck.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.280
 Does she?

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.280
 --Anyway sorry chairs yeah.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:15:01.280
 --Can I just ask if because Nixon ordered the Kittinger table and do you think he actually was looking for Kissinger and he just mispronounced it?

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.280
 --And it was all a big mistake.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.280
 --Is that the we want you guy in the poster?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.280
 --No that's Lord Kitchener from the First World War in the other country.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.280
 --So Kitchener had very little to do with Richard Nixon where it's Kissinger and Nixon were very strong partnership for a very long time.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.280
 --Oh yeah yeah.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:22.280
 --But he did try and buy some furniture for his kitchen and accidentally got a poster of Lord Kitchener.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:33.280
 --Sorry just to say I read there's a book called Believer my 40 years in politics by David Axelrod who was a chief strategist for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.280
 And he says that Obama's chair was slightly taller and he was president.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.280
 --So it was not the same chair because it's the same table still.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.280
 --I think I thought it was maybe it's not actually.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:48.280
 --So the cabinet office in Downing Street the Prime Minister chair is the only one with arms on.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.280
 --And this is prompted a diplomatic row in the past.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:16:00.280
 In 1979 the president of France Valerie Giskert Destaink was visiting the UK and he was going to visit Tatcher in the cabinet room.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:06.280
 And his aide said yes could you have a chair with equal status to the Prime Minister please and they said what?

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:13.280
 And they said well it's very simple either he wants one with arms or you have to put that one in the corner and Tatcher has to have one without arms.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:21.280
 And they had to write to the British ambassador in Paris to look can you sort this out and he wrote back saying yeah they're really serious about this thing.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.280
 --So we're actually still at war with them.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:34.280
 --The ambassador said his first reaction was to think that the obvious solution was to stand the Prime Minister's chair in a corner and have first seated on the same sort of chair as the president.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.280
 He thought the president would be very surprised if it was otherwise.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:45.280
 Unfortunately it's not recorded how they solved it but --I think the obvious solution is to have one sit on the other's lap and then they switch around halfway through.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:56.280
 --Hey the other difference of cabinet chairs in the British cabinet room is that the Prime Minister's chair is the only chair that's left on an angle so that it's more accessible to the Prime Minister.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:03.280
 They can just slip into it whereas the others have to pull the chair out to give them that chucked out of it.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:11.280
 --That's very interesting. --Yeah it's just when they walk in all the positions are straight except for the Prime Minister's which is on a slight angle which allows easier access.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.280
 --Another important person in the world who has a high chair is --Prince George.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:29.280
 --I was going to say Lord Sugar in the apprentice. --Oh yeah he has a platform that his chair is on which is about three inches higher so that he's the highest person in the room.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:37.280
 They found that out because they had a camera shot from behind him in one of the episodes and everyone kind of noticed that there was like a little platform that you sat on.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:45.280
 --Really? --It's interesting. It's always people who are universally loved and respected who have these slightly higher chairs in the box and Alan Sugar.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:58.280
 --So Kozy, if we talked about when So Kozy went to because he was obviously quite sure he went to do a speech in a factory and he had lots of factory workers standing behind him when he made the speech.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:10.280
 And he made sure to select the 20 shortest factory workers to stand behind him and they interviewed them afterwards and said why were you chosen to be in this picture and they said well they checked my height and they said I was adequately small to not make him look too short.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:21.280
 --Was he working in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory? --So okay I do have one wild fact about presidential chairs.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:31.280
 --There was a guy in the 19th century and his name was Seth Kinman, right? He was a hunter. He claimed to have shot 800 grizzly bears in his life.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:44.280
 --Yeah, I'm sure he did. I'm sure he did. He was Californian but he made for a spell every single new president of the USA got a chair made by Seth Kinman and they were the creepiest chairs you've ever seen.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:53.280
 One of them is made just from elk antlers strapped together. He once played for President Lincoln according to Wikipedia on a fiddle made from the skull of a mule.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.280
 --Wow. --This the kind of guy was. Anyway the chair he made for Andrew Johnson was made from two wild bears, right?

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:10.280
 The legs of the chair, the four legs were all bare legs and when you touched a cord the head of the grizzly bear would snap out from under the seat and gnash its teeth and then go back.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:19.280
 --That's amazing. Who was that for? --That one was for Andrew Johnson. --That's incredible. You can see photos of it and it is terrifying.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:28.280
 --If you wanted to make a really creepy chair, you should have a chair that then has an arm built into it where if you sit in it the hand is resting on your thigh.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:35.280
 --Oh, I just think that would be a good creepy chair. --That's a good creepy chair. --You're in the market for me. --It was a good idea.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.280
 --Because it's always creepy when someone rests the handle on your thigh. --It's not always creepy.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.280
 --I find it's on detail in the judge.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.280
 --When you become Prime Minister Anna, you can have one of those chairs in the British cabinet room.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:55.280
 --Well, probably they wouldn't let me because it has to be this, you know, slightly armchair. Perhaps I can be honest to what you want.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:01.280
 --As long as you have the same creepy chair for the President of France.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:11.280
 --Can I make a quick presidential chair correction? Many, many, many podcasts ago, probably about 10 in. I made a mistake.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:25.280
 I said that underneath the chair of Barack Obama's Oval Office table was a trap door that should the President and an emergency need to get out of the room, he could open the trap door and slide down the slide.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:37.280
 --It turns out that that's not true. I was fooled by a website, the White House website, which turned out to be a website called Not the White House website, a parody of the White House website.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:45.280
 --And I failed to read the strap line and the not think if this guy needs to replace his mum, he could quite easily lie you down.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:59.280
 --The apologies to anyone who's used that fact because I didn't edit it out of the show. Just point having learned that. --So Richard Nixon's inauguration, one thing he didn't want was a pigeon poo all the way down the road where he was being inaugurated.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.280
 --Who does?

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.280
 --No, every other President has requested it.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:17.280
 --But he was weird, he just didn't like it. And so he decided that what he would do is try and get rid of all the pigeons. And so they sprayed something called Roost No More, which is a burdr repellent on all the trees nearby.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:25.280
 And the idea was it would make the pigeons feet burn and they would fly off. But unfortunately it contained a chemical that killed them.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:37.280
 --And so as he was being inaugurated they went down the road and they were just dead pigeons everywhere. --Amazing. --That's amazing. --That's incredible. --It's not a good start, is it?

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:47.280
 --It's a first omen. --Or is it like when you get pooed on by a bird? So that's actually a really good sign. Lots of dead birds falling all over you.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:53.280
 --Sure, that's what his advisor said. --But that's the thing, I guess being pooed on by birds is supposed to be good luck, isn't it?

00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:03.280
 --So he's got rid of all the good luck and got pigeon corpses. --That's a double bad luck. --No wonder things played out as they did.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:13.280
 So Nixon was very, very clumsy. I haven't quite realised the plethora of hilarious stories about him. So he used to always drop medals, award ceremonies.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:21.280
 So any military award ceremony was trying to put a medal on somebody to drop it to the extent that --The dead veterans scattered all over the thing.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:33.280
 --So one of his military aid said that he had to take the pins off the back of medals and replace them with clip-on devices, because if he didn't drop the medal, he'd then stab the military person in the chest with it.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:43.280
 He once picked up a lobster as part of like a PR thing. He was visiting a fish farm and he picked up a lobster and it clawed onto his suit, Lapella, wouldn't let go, was hanging from him.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:51.280
 He spilled the inkwill at Downing Street. He always spilled soup on himself and so he said that soup courses had to be eliminated from state venues.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:23:01.280
 --That is so funny, it's really good. In middle-kingdom Egypt, it was a symbol of status to have a folding stool.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:12.280
 --Wow! --Yeah, stools were popular, but folding stools were very difficult to get hold of and they were expensive. So if you weren't quite as posh as a feral, but you were pretty posh you would have a folding stool.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:18.280
 --I didn't even know they were invented as far back as I know, it's amazing. --Is that to prove you are rich enough to go on beach holidays?

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:24.280
 --I think every holiday is a beach holiday in Egypt. --It's a constant beach holiday.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:39.280
 --Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy. --My fact is that there is a special police unit in France whose job is to monitor six million dead people.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:51.280
 --And they are called the catacombs. So these are the guys who look after the catacombs in Paris and the catacombs are this massive thing.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:59.280
 I'd heard of them before, I didn't realize how big they were. They are 200 miles of tunnels over 32 square kilometers in area.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:17.280
 So they still haven't all been explored. It's ten times the area of Central Park in New York. It's absolutely massive. And the catacombs are the people who walk around underground trying to find people who are trespassing and, you know, people who are mistreating the catacombs.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.280
 --So they're not actually policing the dead themselves and checking they don't cause trouble? --No.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:30.280
 --But although if they do cause trouble, I'm sure they'll be first on the scene. --Exactly, yeah. Although there are only five people in the catacombs these days.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:35.280
 --I read that they're called cataflex in French. --Yeah. --What are the people who go down there? --The cops.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:41.280
 --Oh, the cops. Oh, that's good. Because everyone is called catacombs. There are cataclasts. These are people who mistreat the catacombs.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:49.280
 They're people who leave rubbish and they spray paint over all the works of art and they're very bad people. But there are catafiles as well. People who love the catacombs and who treat them well.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:58.280
 And then if you're a catafil and you bump into a catacop, you might well let you go. --Sure, if you're a catacolast and you claim you're a catafile, if a catacop comes along.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:05.280
 --Yeah, but if there's litter behind you or you're door being stuff on a wall, then you're carrying spray paint cans. --Exactly, you're a cataclass, aren't you?

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:12.280
 --No, no, because I actually took them off a cataclass because I saw they were doing something wrong. So I've got the cans, but they're not mine. I haven't been using them.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.280
 --Oh, well, on your way. Thank you. --And then you point and you say he went that way.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:25.280
 --He went 200 miles that way. --And also there's catachix apparently who are a subculture who walk around the tunnels in bikinis.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.280
 --No, apparently. --Is there a pool down there?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.280
 --There's a lot of flooded catacombs area, in fact. --In that case, yes.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:42.280
 --Yeah. I think it was last year, maybe the year before, a surfer called Allison Teal went surfing inside a catacombs.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:51.280
 You can watch the video. It's pretty extraordinary. She says surfing and all the media said surfing. She's laying on the surfboard in her bikini. She's in a bikini.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:59.280
 And she goes through it, but it's an amazing video because she goes into these tunnels which are super tight. Like it's just her and the surfboard can fit through.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:06.280
 And there's moments where people who've been down there, obviously having fun with all the bones down there, then arranging them into a chair.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:17.280
 --You can see her sit in a bone chair. --What? It's an extraordinary. Like incredible. --Is that chair made by Seth Kinman, the 19th century grizzly bear?

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:26.280
 --Oh, they are incredible though, these catacombs. And when the first ever catacop, chief, retired. His name was Jean-Claude Sorrette. He did 20 years in the tunnels.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:34.280
 The catafiles organized a massive feast for him. And he turned up and he said, "I tried for years to catch you, but now I'm retiring. If you want, you can take pictures with me."

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.280
 --And they all had their picture taken with them. --Oh, wow. --They threw them a party.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:44.280
 --I've got to say, catacops sounds like quite a cool 80s cartoon. --It does. --Really does.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.280
 --Are they cats? --Yeah, but they're in the catacombs. --Are they also cops?

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.280
 --Oh yeah. --And they wear policemen's outfit. --The catacat. --And it's in the title.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:58.280
 Every element of this cartoon is in the title. --It's right about the 80s. You never had to think about titles of cartoons.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:04.280
 They're usually straight in their thunder cats. They're cats and they like thunder. --Dangerous. --Yeah, yeah. --Dangerous.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.280
 --Did you? --Didn't even have to watch the cartoon. Look at the title. You know what you got.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.280
 --For us Peppa Pig, what's that about? --No one knows. --That's for anyone.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:22.280
 --So the catafiles are incredible, aren't they? I really would recommend looking them up. This is one of those facts. I was so glad you chose it, because I had no idea they existed.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:37.280
 And they sort of invented themselves in about 1980 and the idea is they're kind of urban explorers, but they go around restoring parts of Paris that are going without being restored or the government hasn't got the funds to restore them all.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:49.280
 I think need restoring. And the catafiles are the people who do so in the catacombs. And so for instance, a few years ago, the catacops just came across underground in some of the catacombs that you're not allowed to access.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:59.280
 A cinema, complete with like a bar and a restaurant. This is all underneath the Trocadero, an area of Paris. It had seats to watch films in it.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:09.280
 It had this whole collection of films. They'd wired in at least three phone lines. They had their own electricity system. And they were just people hanging out down there watching films on a big cinema screen.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:17.280
 And so they found this. And they were like, wow, this is amazing. We found this whole cinema system. Who the hell is this? And the police came back three days later.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.280
 And all the electrics have been cut off. And there was just a note that red do not try to find us.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.280
 Wow. Can you find what films they watched? Because I have been trying to find out.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:32.280
 Oh, right. Yeah. I actually saw the name of one of the films. It's very art house sort of stuff.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:38.280
 Oh, because I was hoping they were watching, you know, Terminator or while you mean, like, lovely bones.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:44.280
 Oh, that'd be good. Like, bone related. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, you can have a great time watching zombie films down there.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:49.280
 The mummy, surely. Yes. They've all got their own catacomb name as well.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:58.280
 Everyone has a nom de plume or a nom de catacomb down there. And you're not meant to. You're not meant to ask about anyone's above surface life.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:03.280
 You don't say, so what do you do? Because the answer is I walk around the catacomb. Yeah. I see. Yeah. Right.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:11.280
 Do you know what they also found in the cinema, by the way? They discovered that there was a CCTV monitor in order to see who was coming.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:16.280
 So they can review the tapes. I guess if they could see if it was cops or anything. And along with the CCTV,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:24.280
 they had a bit of sound equipment. So if anyone passed a certain point, it triggered a dog barking to scare them off from going further down the tunnel.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:31.280
 Wow. Yeah. So it was like, that was their security system to stop the cinema from being discovered. That would work for the catacop cartoon cats.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:41.280
 Yes. But they're very dangerous. These catacombs, if you are not a catapile and if you decide to go exploring off the beaten path as it were, because these are ginormous.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:48.280
 And there are counts of people who've heard of stashes of wine. And they've said, I'm just going to go down and look for a stash of wine and never seen again.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:58.280
 I mean, you're in France. There's wine everywhere. Yeah. I can get some of this mysterious wine that they speak of.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:09.280
 They're very recently two boys disappeared for three days. They were found. They got put into hospital. They had hypothermia. And they were only found because they'd been leaving clues along the way.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:24.280
 But the catacops, I guess, sent in search dogs in order to find them. And they managed to find them. But I kept thinking that that's, you can imagine being a dog and going down into a place with all those bones.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:35.280
 Well, this is a thing. Do you know why the bones are down there in the first place? Because they weren't originally there. So the bones were put underground because all the cemeteries were running out of space in the city above ground. And it was horrible.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:44.280
 So there's a very famous cemetery in Paris called innocent, the innocence. And it was giving off a strong smell of decomposing flesh in the late 18th century.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:56.280
 And supposedly even perfume shops were claiming they couldn't do business because of the off-putting smell. Surely they're the one people should be catching it.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:02.280
 It's amazing, isn't it? Yeah. If they can't support that business opportunity, you know, I don't deserve a wife.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:15.280
 Anyway, in 1780, a wall collapsed, let's innocent, and rotting corpses fell into a nearby house. At that point, people said, oh, maybe we should move these millions and millions of corpses.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.280
 So they over a period of years and years, they moved all these six million bodies from the city cemeteries into the catacombs.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:35.280
 And what it was is they'd had all these tunnels because it was where they mined for limestone. Originally, they would get limestone from near the ground level. But actually, that was kind of spiraling the top soil so you couldn't make any agriculture there or anything like that.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.280
 So they had to go deep, deep down to get their rocks.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:50.280
 And this is amazing. Once they've made, they got rid of all the rock and the catacombs existed, but completely abandoned because they weren't being used for anything. People started farming there.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:56.280
 So mushrooms were grown in these catacombs and all the farmers got kicked out because they wanted to throw all the bones in there.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.280
 No way.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:04.280
 And still today, in bits of catacombs that are not occupied by bones are growing mushrooms still.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:12.280
 I got to say, someone who's scared of mushrooms like, hey, I have a real phobia. I think I could live with the bones and the skulls and stuff like that.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.280
 You'd brush it out and I really would. That's a horror movie.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:26.280
 And here's the other thing about the catacombs is they are the reason that Paris has maintained not having high risers in the city.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280
 Because they collapse.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:33.280
 They would collapse. There's the ground underneath them. It are not stable enough in order to allow for high-rise buildings.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:40.280
 It was Louis the 16th. He founded the organisation, the IGC, the inspection general to carry here, which does all the maintenance and mapping.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:49.280
 And he was forced to found it because in 1774, 300 meters of street just collapsed into a 20 meter deep hole.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280
 Imagine.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.280
 Wow.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:58.280
 Because obviously the limestone is eroded or is eaten away by rain or whatever it might be. And suddenly, boom, 300 meters of a street.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:03.280
 It sounds almost fun to be on a street that then kind of turns into a tunnel sign.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.280
 What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I'm not saying it would be. It sounds like it could be.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.280
 My sister is terrified of sinkholes.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.280
 Yeah, me too.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.280
 Absolutely.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.280
 It has a massive phobia.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280
 Doesn't she live in a cemetery?

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.280
 No, the other sisters are right here.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:23.280
 Surely it's more logical if you do live in a cemetery to be afraid of falling into the ground.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.280
 Because you've seen all these other people who've done it.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.280
 My sister. That's not how they all die.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.280
 My sister who lives in a cemetery grows her own vegetables.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:38.280
 And my other sister who doesn't live in a cemetery refuses to eat them because she thinks they've got dead bodies in it.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.280
 Oh, I don't blame her.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.280
 That's, yeah, there's something about that connection.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.280
 You eat crops grown with excrement as fertilizer. That doesn't bother you, does it?

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.280
 Yeah, but it's not bizarre.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.280
 That we're constantly eating food that's grown using cow poo, human poo, or poo.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.280
 It's just poo. Any kind of poo.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.280
 It works.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.280
 But does the trick.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280
 That is weird, isn't it?

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.280
 We're all over it now.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.280
 Well, enough gets made of that.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.280
 You're right. I agree with you.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:10.280
 People always say they look at like the way that animals are killed and say maybe if you knew how your animals were killed, you would all go vegetarian.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.280
 Yeah.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.280
 But maybe if you knew that there was poo smeared all over your vegetables, you'd only eat meat.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:25.280
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.280
 And that is my fact.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:32.280
 My fact this week is that the number one place to buy CDs in Indonesia now is KFC.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.280
 KFC, the fast food restaurant.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.280
 They should call it KFCD.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.280
 This is amazing.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.280
 This is such an amazing fact.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280
 This is extraordinary.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.280
 Hang on. KFCD will be the Kentucky Fried Chicken disc.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.280
 Kentucky Fried Compact disc.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.280
 KFCD is what you're suggesting.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.280
 Yeah.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:35:02.280
 So in Indonesia now, in KFC, when you go to buy your chicken, you are offered a bundle deal in which you can also purchase a CD.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:10.280
 And they sell over 500,000 albums a month in the KFCs all over Indonesia.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:18.280
 And this was set up by a very well-respected, well-known producer of bands like the Killers, predominantly you two.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.280
 He's done the majority of their biggest albums outside of Brinino.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.280
 And he realized over there, credit cards and streaming isn't such a massive thing.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.280
 So people are still buying the physical objects.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.280
 CDs get sold for $4 and there's a lot of black market CDs that go on.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.280
 He thought no one goes out to buy things anymore physically, but they do go out to buy chicken.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:45.280
 So what if I combined chicken and CDs together and started selling them there and it's absolutely worked?

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.280
 So he releases at the moment, predominantly Indonesian artists, but they're looking into bringing in the Western.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.280
 You two have got that new album coming out, haven't they, Family Bucket?

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.280
 His name's Steve Lilly White, by the way, the producer of all these albums.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.280
 He's done the Rolling Stones as well.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.280
 I mean, he's ginormous.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.280
 They interviewed him. The New York Times interviewed him.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:10.280
 And he said, "My job is basically like running a record label, except this record label also happens to sell chicken."

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.280
 So I think his amount is not fully adjusted to the new reality.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:21.280
 He very much sounds like a man who used to be a record label guy, then fell on hard times, got a job at KFC.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.280
 And then someone from the New York Times came along and said, "I knew that guy who used to produce you too."

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.280
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, I still do that kind of stuff."

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:40.280
 But incredibly, that's not the case. While he gave this interview to the New York Times, he was busy mixing or playing the latest U2 single that he just made in the background.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.280
 Like this is a guy who's like jumping between producing pop hits and selling...

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.280
 And the music that he sells in KFC in Indonesia is not English language, is it?

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.280
 So it's all Indonesian music at the moment.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:58.280
 And he says that he thinks 98% of the music sales come from people who just went to buy chicken and turn up there and go,

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.280
 "Oh, I'll have a CD too."

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.280
 Impulse buy, it definitely makes sense.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.280
 But also, piracy is not necessarily bad for CD sales.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.280
 So Japan is somewhere where CDs are still a huge thing.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.280
 So I think globally 39% of music sales come from CDs.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.280
 Or this is true last year, the year before.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:24.280
 Whereas in Japan, it's 75%. And piracy isn't necessarily a bad thing because apparently when people pirate CDs, they copy them onto other CDs.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.280
 And that gets people used to just physically having CDs.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.280
 I think people are all used to physically having CDs now.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.280
 I think that's the argument of a pirate in the dog.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.280
 Quite possibly.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:42.280
 Actually, it's having to spread the sale of CDs just happened to be blank ones that I was buying and then ripping off.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280
 I don't know.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.280
 The Japan thing is bizarre though, the CD thing.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.280
 So CDs in Japan cost about 25 pounds on average, each one.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.280
 So it's not like they're cheaper.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.280
 What's because of all the bonus tracks?

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.280
 Japan famously, there's a great comedian who once said where all the bonus tracks live.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:07.280
 Every Japanese CD, which is why they're often imported to other countries around the world, is there may be four songs that don't appear on a CD released in the West.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:14.280
 So if Coldplay releases an album there, most likely there'll be four bonus tracks, which are the B-sides or something that they would use later down the line.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.280
 Four more completely indistinguishable tracks.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:24.280
 Well, I don't know how disappointed you'd be if you got to the end of what you thought was a Coldplay album and tell that there were four more tracks you had to listen to.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.280
 The first massive selling CD was "Diastrates".

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.280
 It was an album called "Brothers in Arms", and it was the first one to sell a million CDs. It was absolutely huge.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:39.280
 And since then, I think it's all about something crazy, like 50 or 30 million copies.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:48.280
 But they were the band who were chosen for the big push of the CD, because the guys who made it for Philips said their mainstream enough.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.280
 Like we can't push punk, we can't push something as "Nisha".

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.280
 But also maybe they didn't want something really poppy.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.280
 Is that right? They wanted something another song.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:03.280
 I guess so. But they were the ones who were almost chosen for that massive promotional push. It was interesting.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:12.280
 The first person to have a CD released in America was Bruce Brinkstein, born in the USA, wasn't he? But Abba was the first band to be imprinted onto a CD.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.280
 It's always the big ones.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.280
 When you say that kind of thing, it almost feels like there probably was someone else.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.280
 Doesn't it? Yeah.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.280
 It kind of depends, though, because it's launching a new medium.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:27.280
 So I guess like Jay-Z doing "Tidal". You know, he signed up.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.280
 So "Tidal" is its own Spotify, effectively.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.280
 "Tidal" is looking at my completely blank face about the words Jay-Z and "Tidal".

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:41.280
 So "Tidal" is like its own iTunes, its own Spotify. It's an exclusive streaming and downloading place.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.280
 You can only listen to Jay-Z.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.280
 You can only listen to Jay-Z. It's like a beat of Max, but all the tapes are Jay-Z.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.280
 Exactly.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.280
 Okay, I understand. When you put it like that.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:55.280
 So "Beyonce" released her Lemonade album on there, and as a result, it didn't make it to the top of the charts.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:01.280
 That's the first time that's ever happened to Beyonce in a solo career because it was a new medium and not enough people were signed up.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.280
 Right. But yeah, so you need a biggie in order to push the medium.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.280
 Yeah.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.280
 Just in Japan, on Japan CDs, you were saying they come with extras.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.280
 So as well as bonus tracks, they come with other extra things as well.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.280
 So now they're keeping the CD market alive in Japan by giving away prizes with CDs.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.280
 So you get raffle tickets with CDs, you get these prizes, you get a family bucket.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:27.280
 A raffle ticket is a terrible prize because it's basically not a prize, is it?

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.280
 It's a piece of paper, which always is a prize.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.280
 It's almost always not a very nice bottle of wine, though.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.280
 Or a box of matchmakers.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280
 Yeah, exactly.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.280
 You can get, sometimes, if you're the first, you know, thousands of people to buy a CD,

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.280
 you get the handshake thing, which is where you get to meet the band of the CD you've bought and shake that hand.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.280
 That's incredible.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.280
 Yeah, exactly. Get to Japan, Andy.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.280
 But this is a cool thing.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.280
 So there's a band in Japan, I think we might have talked about before called AKB48,

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.280
 which is a band with loads of members.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.280
 And they hold band elections via CD purchases.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:04.280
 So the way they get people to buy their CDs is if you buy a CD by these guys,

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.280
 then it has a ballot paper inside.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.280
 And you can write on that ballot paper, which member of the band is your favourite?

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.280
 And then it's announced who's the favourite.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.280
 Wow.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280
 So that gets people to buy it.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.280
 That's pretty harsh.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.280
 Yeah.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.280
 You're in that band.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280
 Yeah, but at least there are 50 members.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.280
 Those are supposed to be the Rolling Stones, but there are five of them.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.280
 You get to call a Rolling Stone every time.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.280
 It's Chas and Dave.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.280
 And every year, Dave's like, sorry, Chas.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.280
 Well, it's not the end of the world if you lose,

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.280
 because the girl that came 48, or the girl that came bottom in the vote one year,

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.280
 the following year, I think this is last year or the year before,

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:46.280
 one fan spent £240,000, buying up as many CDs as they possibly could

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.280
 in order to send all the votes.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.280
 Because there's no limit to how many times you can vote.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280
 Whoa.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.280
 So what I would say is if you want to buy 250,000 copies of our new book that comes out.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.280
 It's a pen book.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.280
 Should we put a little ballot paper inside saying,

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.280
 who's your favourite member of the pop-up?

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.280
 I really don't think we should.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.280
 I could be absolutely sure.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.280
 I think for you and me, we should.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:09.280
 Why don't you just photocopy the bit of paper?

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.280
 That's a lot of money.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.280
 There's going to be a barcode on there, isn't there?

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.280
 Some listener in Japan is going, "Fuck right now!"

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.280
 With a massive countercruel of unsolved CDs.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.280
 Eating that dinner often makes maths.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.280
 People keep releasing CDs in Sims language, by the way.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.280
 What?

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.280
 What does that mean?

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.280
 You never played on the Sims.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.280
 It sounds like you have an eye for the way you said that.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.280
 No, I was going to like to play on the Sims.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.280
 I think I'm the only one who has played the Sims.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.280
 I've never played on the Sims.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.280
 I've never played on the Sims.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.280
 I've never played on the Sims.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280
 I've never played on the Sims.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.280
 I just didn't ever talk about it until now, apparently.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.280
 I was actually looking at weird music brand partnerships for this.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.280
 Simlish is the language they speak in Sims.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.280
 Katie Perry has recorded a song on an album called Teenage Dream.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.280
 What?

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.280
 No, I need B-side.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.280
 I'm with Anna on this.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.280
 What is that about for something?

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.280
 It's not something I would say.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.280
 It's one of the best-selling albums of this decade.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.280
 Well, I bet I'm the only one.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.280
 I'm the only one of us for that's heard the Simlish version.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.280
 So who's the big of Katie Perry fans?

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.280
 All these bands keep releasing albums in Simlish.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280
 Okay, go.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.280
 Depeche mode.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.280
 Rita Aura, Lily Allen.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280
 Cool.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280
 They will release Simlish songs.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.280
 That is very cool.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.280
 And so they just redo the language.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.280
 Is there an album where you can buy all the Simlish songs?

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.280
 No, that's what I call Simlish.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.280
 One of the guys who developed the CD for Philips.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.280
 When it was first introduced, he was so excited about the new technology.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:54.280
 He said, "I decided to get rid of all my final albums and get my old Rolling Stones and Beatles records on CD.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.280
 It still hurts."

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.280
 Because he just feels like a complete idiot that he did that.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.280
 He got rid of all these fantastic original Rolling Stones and Beatles records.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.280
 And he just has one CD now.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.280
 He was married to the cause though.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.280
 You've got to throw yourself in with both people to this.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.280
 All five of the cause.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.280
 He was married too.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.280
 Even Jim?

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.280
 Yeah.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.280
 That is big of me.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.280
 You should go in the stocks for like five hours for that.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:21.280
 It's a joke that dates us, doesn't it?

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.280
 I mean, I did a chasadave joke.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:32.280
 We're all revealing our deeper secrets about, you know, Jay-Z or playing on the Sims.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:41.280
 In Indonesia, there's a big trend for music related to bus horns.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.280
 Okay.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.280
 And this is like a little meme that starts on the internet.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280
 And it's...

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.280
 They videoed these kids holding signs up reading "om tello letom."

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.280
 Okay.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.280
 Which means...

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.280
 Honk driver, honk.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.280
 Or driver, honk driver.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.280
 I'm not sure which one.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.280
 And the thing is, Indonesian buses have got really cool horns.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.280
 So they make like little melodic noises.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.280
 And the kids just wanted to hear these horns.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.280
 And it became a bit of an internet meme.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:12.280
 And now there's a load of DJs in Indonesia who are making songs related to bus horns.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.280
 Cool.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280
 That's very cool.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.280
 So popular DJs such as Z and Firebeats.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.280
 And DJ Marshmello.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.280
 You say that in the same tone of voice.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.280
 Yeah.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.280
 The Anna talks about Casey Perry.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.280
 So we've all got blind spots, there's a lot of things.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.280
 Because Andy's downloaded their albums already.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.280
 I love DJ Marshmello and the other one you said.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.280
 I've got some KFC stuff.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.280
 Do you?

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.280
 Yeah, me, me, me.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.280
 Yeah.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.280
 Finally, we're getting to the nub of this fact.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.280
 So in Japan, they have a KFC with a high-end whiskey bar.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.280
 Cool.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.280
 She's pretty good.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.280
 In Russia, they had an advert because people weren't really eating KFC.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.280
 They had an advert.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.280
 And what it was is there was a little kid in a school.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.280
 And he was eating KFC or something.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.280
 And the teacher got annoyed.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.280
 And so the teacher got the bucket and put it on this kid's head.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.280
 And he had to walk around school with a bucket on his head.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.280
 Wow.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.280
 And it started.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.280
 He hasn't been aging quite prematurely.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.280
 Yeah.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.280
 And it was just a meme in Russia, like the bucket head meme.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.280
 I don't think we've mentioned this before.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.280
 This year KFC have released a novel for the first time.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.280
 What?

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.280
 It's a novel starring the Colonel.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.280
 And it's a mils and boon style romance.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.280
 And it's called Tender Wings of Desire.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.280
 He is a sexy man.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.280
 Well, we have to tell you before we started recording this podcast

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.280
 that you're quite fancy Richard Nixon.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.280
 So you're talking--

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.280
 And did we miss that when we got to that?

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.280
 We didn't have to tell you that.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.280
 That's warping of the truth.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.280
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.280
 I find him not unattractive.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.280
 Give him that.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.280
 Well, for Andy, that's pretty much someone saying you're attractive.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.280
 That's the best I can hope for these days.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.280
 I'm not physically repulsed by him.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.280
 Great, Dave.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.280
 He said in an interview that something like,

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.280
 I know how I look.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.280
 I'm under no illusions about my appearance.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.280
 So I'll have to be good in other ways.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.280
 And I read that interview.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.280
 And I thought, well, he's good in other ways, isn't he?

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.280
 Yeah.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.280
 Lots of ways.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.280
 Richard Nixon is a very good man.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.280
 What would he say?

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.280
 What are your top five ways in which he's a great guy?

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.280
 Got a bird problem?

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.280
 He's your man.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.280
 Colonel Sanders was kind of divorced from KFC

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.280
 from quite early on, as he sold the company.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.280
 So he did loads of marketing for it throughout his life.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.280
 He traveled 250,000 miles, I think,

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:28.280
 visiting KFC restaurants around the world until he died in 1980.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.280
 But he used to turn up unexpected at various KFC outlets,

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.280
 constantly, to test their chicken because he was really pissed off

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.280
 that they weren't using the video.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.280
 He was a big picture of him on the wall.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.280
 On every bucket there's a picture of his face.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.280
 People behind the desk would be like,

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.280
 you look a bit familiar.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.280
 I guess if he takes the suit off and the glasses.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.280
 He never did.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.280
 They showed him into it.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.280
 He's completely recognizable.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.280
 He never took his-- what?

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.280
 Even in the shower.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.280
 Even when he was swimming.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.280
 Richard, Ronald McDonald was going to every McDonald's

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.280
 as a secret customer.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.280
 It's just not going to work.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.280
 Well, gave it away.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.280
 Was it my height?

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.280
 Yeah.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.280
 So first of all, he literally didn't go out in public

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.280
 without wearing his white suit.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.280
 And he bleached his facial hair to match his head hair and stuff.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.280
 So he never didn't wear his white suit.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.280
 And he turned up unannounced.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.280
 And then they would serve.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.280
 He'd say, give me your chicken and gravy.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.280
 Please.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.280
 And then he would be really angry if they got it wrong,

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.280
 which they often did.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.280
 So KFC sued him once.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.280
 They did.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.280
 They sued him for referring to their gravy

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.280
 as sludge and wallpaper-like.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.280
 Because he turned up and said it was bad.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.280
 He sold the company.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.280
 He sold the company.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.280
 He was still doing their marketing and stuff.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.280
 But he turned up and he--

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.280
 Was I pro-smoking?

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.280
 Trying new wallpaper-y sludge.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.280
 There was one employee who complained.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.280
 So he did say there was a piece on him in the New York Times

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.280
 in the '70s when they interviewed him saying,

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.280
 "The Colonel is vexed almost beyond endurance

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.280
 by the subject of gravy."

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.280
 And one of the executives that KFC said,

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.280
 "Look, the Colonel's gravy was fantastic,

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.280
 but you had to be a Rhodes scholar to cook it."

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.280
 It was really, really complicated recipe

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.280
 that was way too labor-intensive.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.280
 I think everyone really likes KFC gravy, don't they?

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.280
 Is it that of the thing that everyone loves about it?

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.280
 I think it is a thing.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.280
 Because he did make this massive deal about the gravy.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.280
 What did he win the case?

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.280
 He had to pay $1 million.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.280
 A lot of damages.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.280
 Yeah.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.280
 Well, he called the gravy sludgey wallpaper pay.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.280
 So what do you expect?

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.280
 I guess so.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.280
 They sued him for about 30 million, I think.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.280
 And he got it down to a minute.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.280
 He could have said it's all gravy and the dark.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.280

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.280
 OK, that's it.
