 [MUSIC]

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And there's a big database of them. There's over 37,000 of them.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And there's a lot of serious normal ones, but there are, as you say, plenty of very joky ones.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and America, when you're heading in there, they have a sort of Warner Brothers tribute to the cartoons.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So your wayfinding points are going to be called "I Tought."

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 [LAUGHTER]

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And then--

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And you can fill the rest in there.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 [LAUGHTER]

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Yeah, I taught, and then I taught, and then--

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 What did you taught?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 [LAUGHTER]

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 A putty.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 [LAUGHTER]

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And then lastly, I did.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 [LAUGHTER]

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 But they're all really badly spelled presumably.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Yeah.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So "taught" must be with three "teas" on the end or something.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 It's got two "teas" and then two "teas."

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Your thing is meant to be pronounceable.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I would look at them and be like, "Where are we?"

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 [LAUGHTER]

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Yeah, they are very good.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Yeah, you're from South London, aren't you, Dan?

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And I look to the one that was closest to where you live, and it's "DORKIDORKI."

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 No!

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 No!

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 [LAUGHTER]

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 You're on the heckled in the sky.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 [LAUGHTER]

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And sometimes they have local tributes to people who just live nearby.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 So near St. Louis, there's Annie and then Lennox.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 [LAUGHTER]

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And then in Boston there's Nimoy, because Lennox Nimoy was born there.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Nice.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And it's a really nice one.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 We're in California.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 There's a place near where Charles Schultz, the cartoonist, was from.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And that's Snoopy.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 That's where he goes.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Where are you?

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Where are you?

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Yeah, nice.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Sometimes they change them though.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So in 2010, when the apprentice was massive in America,

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 you had Donald Trump and you're fired.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 [LAUGHTER]

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 You're kidding.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 You're fired.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 You're fired.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 It's less menacing when you say it like that, isn't it?

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It's how as well.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You F-I-R-D.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You're fired.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 You're fired.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 But they also had Ivanka as well.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And it got to the point where people started pilots were complaining going,

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 "I don't want to fly, you know, past Ivanka."

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And so they actually changed it.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 They removed it.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 So it no longer exists.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Okay.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Those waypoints.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Wow.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Well, you applaud.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 But now there are 100 pilots lost somewhere in America.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 [LAUGHTER]

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 They do like a bit of wordplay pilots.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So if you are a helicopter pilot, before you set off,

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 you need to check your shits and tits.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 The tits, for instance, is your checklist for your navigation radio,

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 which is twist, identity, test, and select.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And that's how they teach you how to fly a helicopter.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Because my wife's a pilot, so she did that.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And every time you get on an aeroplane, before it sets off,

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 they always do their bum fish.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Which is brakes under carriage, fuel, or flaps.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Instruments, switches, and haluses.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And they know it as bum fishing.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Really?

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Wow.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 That's there.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 That's very cool.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Yeah, see, they've got a sense of humor these guys.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 You don't want them too funny, though.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I found out a guy who we think is the man behind the airline pilot voice.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 What?

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 We're just experiencing a little turbulence as we head over the North Atlantic.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But don't worry, that's going to be possible.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And voice each time it's not pre-recorded.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 It's not pre-recorded.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I'm not saying it's pre-recorded.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I'm saying there's a kind of way that pilots speak.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Oh.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Which is, you know what I get?

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Well, we've got some turbulence.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 [LAUGHTER]

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 We're going to be throwing them out of sight, man.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But, surely, they're just being calm.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Oh, you're saying that?

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I've read a theory, which is that they're all being calm,

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 because of Chuck Yeager, who I think we might have mentioned before.

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 So he was a fighter pilot, and then a test pilot, and then he broke the sound barrier.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 He had a very calm and gravelly voice, and everyone thought,

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 "Oh, wow, Chuck Yeager is so cool and in control."

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And so people started imitating him.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And so there's a theory that pilot voices are now like that, partly because of him.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Obviously, it just makes sense also to sound calm and authoritatively.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I was looking into air traffic control, generally.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And the guys who do it, he throw particularly the ones who are in the tower.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 They do 90-minute dedicated towering.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 They sort of stare at the screen, and they make sure all the planes come in.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And then, in their break, after 90 minutes, there's a special room that they go to,

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 where they're told not to read emails.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 They're told not to do anything where their eyes are staring at anything,

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 because of the intensity of it.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 So there's just movies and books for them to read.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 It's like a recreation room for them to go into.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 They have their break, and then they come back for the intensity of flight.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 You know, you can eavesdrop on them now, if you want.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Really?

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 You can eavesdrop on any air traffic control you like.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 There is an app. I think it's called Live ATC, and you can basically get that,

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 and tap into the conversations that air traffic control are having.

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And it's if your plane isn't taking off yet, or it's delayed,

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 or, you know, it's not landing yet, and you can find out what an earth is going on.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And I think, I don't know if it's technically legal in some countries,

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 so you might want to read your constitution first.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 But, yeah, it sounds really cool.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And you can understand all of it, because I didn't know that air traffic control

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 is all done in one language, the language of English, except one country,

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 which I don't know if people can guess what that is.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 No, it's career?

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 No, fine with English and North Korea is France.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Yeah.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I was reading that one of the problems that Eric traffic control people have is that,

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 obviously, they're monitoring planes that are going by,

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 but other things register on the screen.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And I was reading a report that in Ireland, they often have to report UFOs,

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 because they're appearing quite a lot, these unexplained,

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 so they don't necessarily think that they are alien spacecraft.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 The problem is, is that at night, sometimes the instruments are so sensitive

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 to picking up lights and so on, that they think what they often mistaken

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 as a possible UFO are a flock of birds, clouds,

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 and then even possibly a large truck on the ground.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 We're going to have to move on very shortly.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Oh, I've got a detective of a Guinness.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Yeah?

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Oh, yeah.

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 No, your audience, Andy.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So Guinness was invented in Wales.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 At what point exactly do you think you lost the Mandy?

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Well, there's a pub in a place called Bloody Hell.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Flanfer second, I think, is what it's called.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 It's near Bangor, and they claim that Arthur Guinness took the recipe from there

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 on his way to Dublin in the 1750s, and they say it should be called Guinwiss.

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 It sometimes is called that after about 10, 30, 11 p.m.

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 various other names.

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Obviously it has a really huge worldwide spread Guinness,

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 which is, you know, people think it was a very Irish thing,

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 but it's three biggest markets.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Well, its biggest market is the UK, isn't it?

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And then its second biggest market is Nigeria,

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 which overtook Ireland about 10 years ago now, I think.

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Very popular there, and also they're drinking the strongest stuff in Nigeria.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So that's, as far as more than 10 years ago,

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 but they're drinking the more original Guinness.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 So it was originally... Well, the Welsh stuff, yeah.

197
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 The Welsh stuff.

198
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 After you won them back, when did you think you lost them again?

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So when it first came about in the very start of the 19th century,

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 wasn't it, Arthur Guinness, then it was stronger, so it's 70...

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 It's not 17%.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It's 7.5% in Nigeria, and that's because it has to be much happier

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 to be able to be exported abroad and more alcohol to preserve it more.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And so that's what they're drinking. And apparently there was someone who works in the Guinness factory,

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 one of the Guinness factories in Nigeria, who was saying you tell Nigerians

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 that they drink Guinness in Ireland, and they're like, "Why do they drink Guinness there?"

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 So I'll drink.

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 You guys have some beef with a few countries, Arthur.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 In 1991, you know the little widget inside a Guinness can,

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 which helps it to fizz up. In 1991, that was voted by Britain's

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 as the best invention of the previous 40 years.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Very good.

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 That was...

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 In second place, the internet.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 No!

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 OK, my fact this week is that the first ever bone transplant

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 used a dog's bones to repair a man's head.

219
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 The patient was immediately excommunicated by the church for no longer being fully human.

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 That is incredible. Someone shouted out, "Damn right."

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 So when was this?

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 It was in 1668, and the surgeon was called a "Yobvan-American,"

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 and the patient was a Russian nobleman called Butterline.

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And is that for me?

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Butterline.

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Butterline had been hit in the head with a sword,

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 and he put some dog bone in there, and then he survived,

228
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 but he was immediately excommunicated.

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And then Butterline demanded that the surgeon took the dog bone back out,

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 but by then his own bone had regrown around it,

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 so he couldn't get it out, so he was stuck.

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And he's...

233
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Yeah.

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 He's still there in purgatory somewhere.

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 But that's a thing that happens, doesn't it?

236
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I believe when we're born, we have over around 300 bones,

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 but then as we grow up, it slowly shrinks down to about 206.

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And that's because there's a lot in the head, which fuse is over.

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 So if you're going to put a bone in that you want to take back out,

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 don't go for the skull.

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 It's all about the fusion up there.

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Yeah, I'm not sure that's exactly what I mean.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 That's with babies, isn't it?

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 With cartilage turning into bone.

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But old Butterline's head.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Well, they do it well, but because bone through generate very, very well.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 So if you've ever broken a bone, I've heard most people have,

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I broke a bone last year, and they just say,

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 "Keep it still for a month, and it's fine."

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And that's why things like this can work.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And it's why in the 18th and 19th centuries, in fact,

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 so from when Cook got to Tahiti, he met Tahiti Islanders,

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 and he realised that they fixed skull fractures with coconut.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 So if you had a skull fracture, they'd cut out the damage bit of your skull,

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 and they'd just slaughter a bit of coconut shell in there,

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and then your new bone grew around that.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Yeah, it's really cool.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 That's so good at doing it.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 If you were running, could you do that Monty Python thing?

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Yes.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So just another kind of transplant you can have.

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 We've mentioned this before.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 A big thing is fecal transplants,

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 where your stomach bacteria don't work,

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 and you have someone else's feces implanted into you.

266
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 So we've mentioned that before on the podcast.

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 You know, it's a big thing these days.

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 But I've read this.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I did not know this.

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Okay, a few people have had it. Great. Good on you.

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 A few, a big problem these days is people doing DIY fecal transplants.

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Based on YouTube tutorials, and I look them up,

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 and now my YouTube is just going to be recommending these things to me for weeks.

274
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 That's true.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And because the problem is, you know, the microbiome,

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 or the bacteria in your intestines are very, very powerful.

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 So transferring cells can have an unintended consequence.

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 So normally, you're screened for any autoimmune diseases, things like this.

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And if you have any, you can't be a poo donor.

280
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 But if you just do a DIY one at home,

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 you can transfer, over, you can transfer obesity.

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 But just what? You can try.

283
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Because your microbiome will change.

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 How much of it are you eating?

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 No, you're not.

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Oh, God.

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Okay.

288
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 So you need to transfer it by you to get it?

289
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 No, it's not by you. No.

290
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 How do you get in?

291
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Go and watch these tutorials. They'll tell you.

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Except, no, don't.

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 But you can even hand over, like, poor sleep.

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 But how do you get it in?

295
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I think it goes up, not down.

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I think it's a pill.

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 If you do it properly, it's a pill.

298
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I don't know what YouTube tells you to wear.

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 YouTube, probably, just, no, I'm...

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 If you go to bumfishing.com, you will find...

301
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 But you know, cats can repair their own bones.

302
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Okay.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And do you know how they do it?

304
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Sorry, what do you mean?

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 So not naturally, like, if you break it.

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Well, yeah, basically. So if cat breaks its bone,

307
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 the way it repairs it is just it purrs.

308
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And that's what cat purring is, they think, now.

309
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 What?

310
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 They're healing their fractures.

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 So, well, they pour a frequency, which is between 25 and 150 Hertz,

312
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 and sound.

313
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 If you fire a certain sound frequency at damaged bones or damaged muscles,

314
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 then it repairs them.

315
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And it's exactly the right sound frequency.

316
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And it's sort of the reason they're just sitting there purring contentedly.

317
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 It's just they're just healing and developing their bones and muscles.

318
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I think you've got my notes.

319
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I know, okay.

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 That's what they're doing.

321
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 They're very clever.

322
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 So there was another dog, a human transplant.

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 This was in 1891.

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 It was a doctor called Phelps.

325
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 There was a young boy who had injured his leg.

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And a bit of his bone had come off and they'd had to remove it.

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And so they had to put a dog bone in there.

328
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 But the way that they did it in those days

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 is both the donor and the host were attached to each other for two weeks.

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So that the blood circulation could carry on going around.

331
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 So this young boy had, he was playing like a, wait a minute,

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 one, two, three, four, a five-legged race with a dog.

333
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Because he had to have one of his legs attached to the dog's leg.

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 That's cool, isn't it?

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Did he get to keep the dog afterwards?

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Because you'd be so bonded by that, I think.

337
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Well, they've said that they both recovered after a brief convalescence.

338
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 So they both got better, yeah?

339
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 They did a lot of experimenting on dogs with surgery.

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Because another kind of surgery that has a similar mechanism

341
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 is skin grafting, really.

342
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So if you put a skin graft on, then it can cause new skin to regenerate.

343
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And the first person to experiment with skin grafts properly

344
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 was a guy called Walter Charlton, who did it actually with Robert Hook,

345
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 who he talked about a few weeks ago.

346
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 This was in 1663.

347
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And he basically did it by, he got a dog.

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And he sliced the skin off one side of the dog and then plugged it onto the other side

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 to see if it would be able to like still stay alive there and grow.

350
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 But the dog, understandably, just chewed the whole thing off quite quickly.

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 So they got it back in the lab and they tried to do it again.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And the dog escaped and was never seen again.

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Wow.

354
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 So that's why they put doors on hospitals now.

355
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Are we ready to go on to ex-communication?

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Yeah, sure.

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Okay, so there's a big long list online of things you can get ex-communicated for.

358
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Posing as a nun, stealing from a Christian who's been shipwrecked.

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Oh, no.

360
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Oh, no.

361
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 I'm taking place in any jousting tournament between 1245 and 1248.

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Oh, no.

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I didn't want this afternoon at 1247.

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Well, the good news is that there is a ecclesiastical law which is canon 1324,

365
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 which makes a number of exceptions for ex-communicable offenses.

366
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And if you're under 16, you can't be ex-communicated.

367
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And also, if you lack the use of reason because of drunkenness.

368
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Oh.

369
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 So you're old lipo.

370
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 If you're pissed, you could do what the fuck you want.

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 That's why Ireland has remained such a religious country.

372
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 The rest of us have drifted.

373
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So there are some offenses where, oh, you might be ex-communicated.

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And there are some which bring immediate automatic ex-communication.

375
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 So, grasping people up after confession, just automatic,

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 desecrating the Holy Communion, fair enough to you, Christ.

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 This is all over the internet.

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Physically attacking the Pope, which I would have thought...

379
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 I think fair play, actually, that's completely ex-communicable.

380
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 But there is always a way back.

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Because I thought it was that if you were ex-communicated, you were out.

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And that's it. You're not even a Catholic anymore.

383
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Yeah.

384
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And it's not the case.

385
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 No, you stay Catholic.

386
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And actually, they do.

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 If you go... I mean, you probably know this a lot of you,

388
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 but if you go to Catholic resources online,

389
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 they say the whole point of ex-communication

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 is to try and encourage you to repent and come back to the church.

391
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And so you can be un-ex-communicated.

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's the naughty step, basically.

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's the naughty step.

394
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 But there is... I like the Eucharist one,

395
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 where you're not allowed to throw away the Eucharist,

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 because what that basically means is that if you're a priest

397
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 and you're going, giving the Eucharist,

398
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 you will be ex-communicated if there's wine left at the end

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 and you toss it away, which is why at the end you have to drink

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 all of the wine left over as the priest.

401
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And all of the bread.

402
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And that's why the bread, they were really, really hard to engineer

403
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 crumb-free Eucharist bread,

404
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 because if you drop a crumb, then that's it, you're out.

405
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 You've automatically gone.

406
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I love that bread so much.

407
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Do you?

408
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Yeah, I'm annoyed you can't get in shops.

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I would totally...

410
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 When are you... when are you eating this stuff?

411
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 A church.

412
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Oh.

413
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Every Sunday, where the fuck are you guys?

414
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Wow, you are definitely ex-communicated.

415
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Yes.

416
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 You just keep going up in a different moustache act.

417
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Meanwhile, how does that neck it into the bottle of wine?

418
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 It's really hard, though, to get ex-communicated these days,

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 as you were saying.

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 There was a site that was online called countmeout.ie.

421
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And yeah.

422
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And it was a website that was providing information

423
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 to how you can be ex-communicated if you wanted to go out.

424
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So it was sort of gave you the form that you could send in.

425
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And you would...

426
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 So because the idea is that you need it on your baptism certificate

427
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 to say that you're officially ex-communicated.

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 But then this was launched in 2009, this website.

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And in that same year, the Pope set up new Canon laws

430
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 about what is the way to get ex-communicated,

431
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 which they couldn't get past.

432
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 They couldn't get their head round it.

433
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 So the site had to close because they were like,

434
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 "We've got no idea how to get ex-communicated anymore."

435
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 It's too complicated.

436
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 So it's not difficult.

437
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I don't think to get automatically ex-communicated, like you said.

438
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 There's two types.

439
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 There's the automatic, super easy, flush communion wine down the toilet.

440
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 You're out.

441
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 I mean, I've set before on the podcast that I have been ex-communicated.

442
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Yeah.

443
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Because I'm a Catholic and I mention Jesus is fast.

444
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I've done it again.

445
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Yeah, you've done it again.

446
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Yeah.

447
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Jesus, if you mention Jesus is fast, then you get automatically ex-communicated.

448
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 You do.

449
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 But to get specifically ex-communicated is quite special.

450
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And to get ex-communicated by the Pope is very exciting.

451
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So he does this very rarely.

452
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And the last one was the start of last year.

453
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And it was someone who spilled secrets from their confessional.

454
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Ooh.

455
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Yeah.

456
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And that was the first for about two or three years, I think.

457
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Yeah. In 2014, the Mafia in Italy got ex-communicated.

458
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And high time, I think, 2014.

459
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 But the really cool thing was that in the 15th century used to be able to ex-communicate all kinds of stuff.

460
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 So in the 1480s, the Bishop of Orta in France, he ruled against some slugs which were in his garden.

461
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And he ordered them to leave or be cursed.

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And basically, slugs were quite frequently ex-communicated in the 15th century.

463
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Really?

464
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Of course, it made it easier to destroy them.

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So--

466
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 What?

467
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 What, did he felt less guilty about it?

468
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 He felt less guilty.

469
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Like the people who were looking after gardens didn't want to destroy God's creatures.

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 But if they'd been ex-communicated--

471
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Yeah.

472
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 That must have been a hassle for the Pope, though.

473
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Just every slide he needed to approve the ex-communication.

474
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I think he could send an envoy.

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 I found a guy who was ex-communicated called Pedro the Cruel.

476
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And he was ex-communicated by a guy called Blessed Urban the Fifth.

477
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And yeah, so he was ex-communicated for cruelty.

478
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So I don't know which came first, the name, but it's like a chicken egg thing with that one.

479
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Speaking of urban popes, I don't know if this is true, but it's certainly stated online that it's true.

480
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And that is that Pope Urban the eighth ordered that anyone that found guilty of taking snuff in church

481
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 should be ex-communicated.

482
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And that's because it led to sneezing, which he thought too closely resembled sexual ecstasy.

483
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Ah, I get that.

484
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I understand that.

485
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Guys, we're going to have to move on a second.

486
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And we're going to have to move on without ever fighting out why James has been talking about Jesus' foreskin.

487
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Can I just give you one fact about Catholic confessions?

488
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Yeah.

489
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 So this is the news that Paddy Power is getting really wrapped up with the Catholic Church, and it's a good thing.

490
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 So first of all, in fact, last year the Pope came here, and apparently Paddy Power erected a massive confessionals.

491
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Did any of you guys see it?

492
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 It was just opposite of Phoenix Park. It was obviously a publicity star.

493
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 But they said they'd put these adverts out saying we invite everyone to come and have their sins absorbed.

494
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Sorry, do you mean a single enormous booth?

495
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Yes, yes. We're a drive-through.

496
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Are you joking?

497
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 If it was a drive-through, is the priest in another car next to you?

498
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 They didn't, I don't know.

499
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 They didn't seem to advertise the presence of a priest.

500
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Not how drive-throughs work.

501
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 If you go to McDonald's, you've not got Ronald McDonald in a Mazda going past you throwing burgers at you.

502
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 But no, this isn't the first time they've bonded, so in 2010 there's a church.

503
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 In Suffolk, right in a new market, which was trying to raise £65,000 for refurbishment.

504
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 They've phoned lots of places.

505
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 They phoned Paddy Power, one source said, because they thought Ireland is a Catholic place.

506
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It's a Catholic-looking name. Why don't we just phoned them up and see if they want to donate.

507
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And Paddy Power said, "Yeah, we'd love to donate to your new confessional."

508
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And so they did. They put £10,000, I believe, towards a new confession box.

509
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And it's got their own little logo, their little Paddy Power marker.

510
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 It says, "It's got a plaque on it that says Paddy Power sin bin."

511
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 In a church.

512
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Like, do they offer odds on the things that are going to be confessed inside?

513
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 We've got adultery at 8-1 today, if you fancy a flutter.

514
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Okay, so we need to move on to our next fact.

515
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

516
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 My fact is, there is a world record for pulling a train with model trains.

517
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 This is so cool.

518
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Is it cool?

519
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 It's cool.

520
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 We're going to get a real insight into Andy's childhood in the next five minutes.

521
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 So this was, I saw this guy called Tim Dunn who tweets a lot about trains.

522
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 He is really cool. He put this up recently.

523
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And this record was broken a few years ago in Germany at a place called Miniatur Wunderland.

524
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And the video is online. It is incredible.

525
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 They get 198 mini trains.

526
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And they've all got little engines in them.

527
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And they attach them to one single row, which is attached to the front of a massive train.

528
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Not a train.

529
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It just looks massive because of the little ones next.

530
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Yeah, it does.

531
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And it works.

532
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And they manage to pull whole thing along.

533
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And the really cool thing is that the model trains are exactly the same model of train as the train.

534
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Nice.

535
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 When did they get on the rail gauge?

536
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Can they fit on the rail?

537
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It was done under controlled circumstances.

538
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Some of it was not a normal railway.

539
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I think they built them a little platform.

540
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Oh, did they?

541
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Okay, so it's not a platform.

542
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Oh dear, here we go.

543
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 But they're not saying it's a viable way for trains to get about in future.

544
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 No, they're not.

545
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 They were very clear on that.

546
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 This miniature Wunderland is amazing, isn't it?

547
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I think it's the biggest model railway in the world, is it?

548
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Or something?

549
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Yeah.

550
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It has an airport with planes taking off and landing.

551
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 It has a football stadium where they have commentary of a famous football match that happened.

552
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 It has, because it's Germany, it has many natureists.

553
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And people doing things in bushes.

554
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Oh, wow.

555
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 It's 1,100 square meters.

556
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And they started by building Germany as a replica of Germany.

557
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And they've moved on to other countries like Venice.

558
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 But like countries like Venice, really.

559
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 That is still living in the 14th century.

560
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 You're about city states.

561
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 They are moving on to other countries, though.

562
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 They've got a whole spread of countries.

563
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Yeah, like Sydney and...

564
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 So, as I think you were trying to say,

565
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 they do have a bunch of countries already there.

566
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 They've expanded into Austria and America.

567
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 It's a weird sort of territory world.

568
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 America is actually a continent, not a country.

569
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Sorry.

570
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 You're absolutely right.

571
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 You're absolutely right.

572
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I meant the United States of America.

573
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Switzerland, Scandinavia, which again, not a country,

574
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 but they didn't love the more than together.

575
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 But they've planned up to 2028, what they're going to do.

576
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 England's getting on there. England and Scotland are getting on there by 2021.

577
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Ireland and Wales have to wait till 2025, I'm afraid.

578
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Yeah.

579
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 One thing it does have is it has a mini replica model of the miniature wonderland

580
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 with tiny miniature trains going around.

581
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Wow, really?

582
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 They also have, because I got a Guinness World Record,

583
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 they also have the adjudicator who came to give them the World Record.

584
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 They made a mini version of her to stand in front of their building.

585
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Nice.

586
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 So the guy who came up with the idea was called Frederick Brown.

587
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And in 2000, he'd been running a nightclub for eight years,

588
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 and he decided, "Don't want to do it anymore."

589
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 He said, "This is not my life. People are always getting drunk.

590
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 They hug you, but they do not know you."

591
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And so on.

592
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 So he realised he wanted to do something else, and he didn't know what to do.

593
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 And he said, "At that time, it was possible to send emails

594
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 to thousands of AOL users without it being spam."

595
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Around 3,000 people answered my question for what kind of attraction they would like to see in Hamburg.

596
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 For men, a model railroad was number three.

597
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 For women, it was the last out of a list of 40.

598
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 But I'm a man, so we went with the model thing.

599
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 The model railway thing, model trains.

600
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Someone who loves model trains is Rod Stewart.

601
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Oh, yes.

602
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 So he has one, he has a model railway, the size of a tennis court in his home.

603
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He has admitted as well that he likes model trains so much that when he goes on tour,

604
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 he books a second hotel room just for his model trains.

605
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And they go on the road with him.

606
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Yeah.

607
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 He loves it.

608
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 He's featured on a model railroad magazine a bunch of times.

609
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 He's been a cover star.

610
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Yeah, cover star.

611
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And he wrote to them saying, "Can I be included in your magazine?"

612
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Wow, they didn't write to him.

613
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 And he's more proud of that than being on the front of Rolling Stone, on NME.

614
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 He's not the only rock star.

615
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Neil Young, as well, massively into model railways.

616
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And he actually has bought into a big brand called Lionel Trains.

617
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 He did that in the '90s.

618
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And he's worked on sound technology for them.

619
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Really?

620
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Yeah, so for when they're moving.

621
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 This is how into it he is.

622
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 When he's playing with his model railways,

623
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 he uses a pseudonym created to be the model railway enthusiast.

624
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 He calls himself Clyde Coil.

625
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 And Clyde Coil is his alter ego, who runs Coil Picks,

626
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 which is a short film set inside his model railway system.

627
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Totally into it.

628
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Oh, so exciting.

629
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 I don't know if that's the best way to recruit new users.

630
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And that is a problem for railway enthusiasts, right?

631
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 So the average age of your model railway enthusiast is going up and up.

632
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And they're worried that the younger generation is not as into it.

633
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 So there was, for instance, there was an interview with a guy called Ron May,

634
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 who lives in Phoenix.

635
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And he said that he's been into railways since the '50s, right?

636
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And he's like really obsessive about it.

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And they interviewed his son, who was 26 years old, a guy called Tony,

638
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 who said, "I'm so impressed by my dad's level of detail, the layout."

639
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 He recreates train scenes from the 1950s.

640
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Write down to what pigeons would have been at what train station at what time.

641
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 At no way.

642
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 And he's done the research.

643
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 He's a keen reader of what pigeon magazine?

644
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And the rust streaks on the box cards.

645
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And so he said, "I really respect my dad for this," so the journalist said,

646
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 "And are you, the younger Mr. May, tempted to take up the hobby?"

647
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And he said, "To be honest, not really."

648
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 No.

649
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Yeah, the National Model Railroad Association has 19,000 members,

650
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 and their average age is 64.

651
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 And their average sex is male.

652
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 [laughter]

653
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Very cruel reviews associated them with average sex.

654
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 [laughter]

655
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Average sex.

656
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 A lot of them may be very fiery lovers.

657
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 [laughter]

658
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Look, if you scale this up 100 times bigger than that.

659
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 [laughter]

660
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 There was a great story in the newspaper in February.

661
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 And this is the headline.

662
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Oxygenarians sat on burglar who tried to steal his Model Railway collection.

663
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 This is true. He's a guy called John Hellington.

664
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 He was in his mid 80s. He used to work on the railways.

665
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And there was a man who broke into his home and was trying to steal his very valuable trains.

666
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And his wife sat on the burglar together until the police arrived.

667
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Really?

668
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Is that sweet?

669
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I reckon if two 80-year-old people sat on me, I would still be able to get up.

670
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Yeah.

671
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Well, you weren't this burglar, Mr. Barnes, who, yeah.

672
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 It was actually just a five-year-old child who'd been invited around to play.

673
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 [laughter]

674
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Picked up one of the trains sat on him.

675
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 [laughter]

676
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 We're going to have to move on very shortly.

677
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Just the Model trains have been around for a while.

678
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 So the early 1800s, really, almost since trains.

679
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 But the first Model trains were carpet.

680
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 [laughter]

681
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 The first were carpet railways. And they were trains that you'd have in your house.

682
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And they were invented in the 1840s.

683
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And they were called the Birmingham dribblers.

684
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Which, having just kicked in Birmingham means a different thing today.

685
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 But they were called that because they were basically a steam-powered boiler.

686
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 So they'd have an alcohol-fueled flame.

687
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 And then it was powering. It was steam-powered.

688
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 So it had a big tray of water above it.

689
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 And then it would dribble.

690
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Because it was made of tin. So it had lots of gaps.

691
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 It just dribbled all over your carpet as you ran it.

692
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 But it was also a massive fire risk.

693
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Because of the alcohol-fueled flame on a very unstable wooden floor.

694
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Another floors were wooden in those days.

695
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 So it would frequently just bump into the furniture and fall over and set fire.

696
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 [laughter]

697
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Wow.

698
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 We've come a long way.

699
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Should we move on to our final facts?

700
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 We can do, yeah.

701
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 I have another world record about trains.

702
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Okay, quickly.

703
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Just in 2012, Romanian wedding salon got the world's longest train of a wedding dress.

704
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Okay.

705
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 It was 1.85 miles long.

706
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 What?

707
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And it stretched across the entire city centre of Bucharest.

708
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 And it was modelled by a lady called Imer Duma Trescu,

709
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 who went up in a hot air balloon while the train went down throughout the whole town.

710
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And according to the telegraph, this was mostly ignored by unimpressed bystanders.

711
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 [laughter]

712
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show.

713
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 And that is my fact.

714
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 My fact this week is that in the 19th century, if the owner of an estate died,

715
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 it was traditional for the estate's beekeeper to inform all of the bees of the death.

716
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 And then allow them to mourn by covering the hives in black veils.

717
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 But you wouldn't have to inform them one by one, would you?

718
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 I think you only tell one of them and he lets the others know about that.

719
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Oh, yeah.

720
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Yeah.

721
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 This was the thing that did often happen.

722
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 It was called telling the bees.

723
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And this was not just her.

724
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And how did it get that name?

725
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 [laughter]

726
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And it wasn't, you weren't just telling them about death.

727
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 You were telling them everything.

728
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 This juicy gossip, the beekeeper would go to the hive and be like, guess what?

729
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Guess who's dating who?

730
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And by keeping them informed, you pleased the bees because they wanted to feel part of the family.

731
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And so that was the purpose of them.

732
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And when people died, if they weren't told, people would worry that they would get sick and die.

733
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 So that was a very important thing to do, to make sure the bees knew otherwise.

734
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And yeah, it wasn't just death.

735
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 It was, because they get offended if they're not kept up to speed with the idea, wasn't it?

736
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 So if you had a new birth in the family or if you got married or anything like that,

737
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 then you had to inform them straight away.

738
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 If a couple got married and they went back to their parents' house,

739
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 they had to introduce themselves formally to the bees.

740
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And sometimes, actually, if you had a wedding and you got married,

741
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 then you'd leave them a piece of wedding cake as well to make sure that they knew that they were welcome.

742
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 And they were invited to funerals as well.

743
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I read they were invited to weddings, too, sometimes.

744
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Yeah, very different.

745
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 You don't want to be sat next to one of them in a wedding.

746
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 The baby on my left and then the swarm of bees on my right.

747
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Sometimes they protected them when the body was leaving the house as well.

748
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 They would turn the hive around.

749
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 So they wouldn't see and get upset.

750
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 Yeah, people didn't mad stuff before Telly, didn't they?

751
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 That's really what we've learned.

752
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Yeah, you had to sing to them.

753
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Sometimes there were traditional bee songs along the same lines, you know.

754
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 So bees, bees awake, your master is dead, another you must take.

755
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 What a song.

756
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 I don't know.

757
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 It does sound like a bee side.

758
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 I was reading a story as you, which one of our colleagues Matt posted a few years ago on our forums.

759
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 But it's related to the fact that every funeral, another thing that you did out of respect

760
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 was you turned round the beehives that belonged to the dead person out of respect.

761
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 And then sometimes people didn't know how to do that.

762
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 So this was in 1790, a report where a servant didn't really know about the fact that he had to turn the beehives around when their owner died.

763
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 And so instead he lifted the beehives up, which of course released them all.

764
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And they intact the entire funeral procession.

765
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 The horses and their riders, a general confusion took place, attended with lots of hats, wigs, etc.

766
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 But many stings and a corpse left unattended.

767
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 And so the oldest laws ever in Ireland are the 7th century brethren laws.

768
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 And we have a group of 7th century Irish lawyers in tonight, I believe.

769
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 They were written by a Welshman called No.

770
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 So they have some bee laws in these laws.

771
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And so if your bees were found to be collecting nectar from flowers on the neighbor's land, they could be accused of trespassing.

772
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 And to get around the laws, the rule said you had three years of freedom with your bees.

773
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 So they were allowed to do what they wanted for three years.

774
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 But on the fourth year, if they went to a neighbor's area and they et his flowers next year, then he had to give the bees to the neighbor's payment.

775
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Yes.

776
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 So there was another one.

777
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 If a person was stunned by a bee, they were entitled to a meal of honey from the bee's owner.

778
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 A meal of honey.

779
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Oh great.

780
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 What?

781
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Just like a bowl of honey.

782
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Yeah.

783
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Well, some food, some honey.

784
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Yeah.

785
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Unless he or she had retaliated by killing the bee.

786
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 They used to think that honey was ready made though, didn't they? Until in fact, 1800, people around about then, the prevailing belief was that honey just existed in the atmosphere.

787
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 And all the bees were doing was they were picking it up and putting it in their houses.

788
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 They were like stealing it.

789
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 And so it wasn't until then that they sort of people realised that it was a chemical reaction.

790
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And the bees actually added some stuff to it.

791
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 So they just thought bees were collecting it from flowers and it was naturally produced. And in fact, people thought that bees were naturally produced as well.

792
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 So for a long time, people like Aristotle and Virgil wrote that bees didn't give birth to their young.

793
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 They went to nearby flowers and they found baby bees in them.

794
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 What?

795
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 And they gathered them up in their mouths and took them back to a hive.

796
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 That's how bees come about.

797
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Well, there's the other belief about how you got bees, which was called bugonia, I think.

798
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And that was spontaneous generation from dead animals.

799
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 So we may have mentioned that in the past.

800
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 It was that bees came out of the body of a dead ox. If you had a dead ox, you left it for a long time, you would get bees.

801
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 And different things came out of different animals. So drones came from horses, hornets came from mules, and wasps came out of asses.

802
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 It does sound uncomfortable. But there were even like Virgil gave instructions on how to get bees.

803
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 So he said, you have to take a bullock whose second year's horns are just curling over its brow, stop up its nostrils and mouth and beat it to death.

804
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 And then, it's not one of Virgil's best lines.

805
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 And then you have to shut up and shut it up in a room with some herbs. And then after nine days, the bees will appear from the body.

806
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Yeah, because they, in Egypt, in about 250 bees, they thought the same thing. And when a cow died or an ox died, you buried it, but it had its horns sticking up above the ground.

807
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 And they thought the body would basically turn into bees, and then they'd come up through the horns.

808
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 So you must have just been walking through Egypt, and you've got these horns poking up through the ground everywhere.

809
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Turning into bees.

810
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Do you know that there is Undertaker bees? So roughly daily, about 15 bees will die in the area of the hive.

811
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And what happens then is they wait for a few days when it loses moisture. And some bees will go out, and they'll pick up the bee, and they'll drop them off about 150 meters away.

812
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 And it's known as the Undertaker bee, they're bringing them.

813
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 So it's the idea to get it away from the hive so that anything coming to eat it doesn't find the other-

814
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 150 feet, I should say, meters is a pretty long journey.

815
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 They could still do that. They're not as advanced as Undertaker humans. I think you'd be annoyed if you called it Undertaker to take away your granny.

816
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 And they just picked her up, dumped her by the roadside, 150 feet away.

817
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 I think the Undertaker bees also grab the deceased in their jaws and drag them that way.

818
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 There's a belief that's really ancient about bees that is still practiced, according to a lot of beekeepers that I know, and also on the internet.

819
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 So I don't know if they're any beekeepers here, but they're into a thing called tangling.

820
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 So there's been this belief that's been around for over 2,000 years, that they really love the sound of metal clashing together with other metal.

821
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 And that is how you can calm them down. So if they're freaking out and swarming, you can settle them into your hive.

822
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And so, you know, you've got pictures of women in the 16th century who have gotten bashed metal onto a saucepan to try and get the bees to settle.

823
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 And if you go on to beekeeper forums, they still say, "Do you do tangling? Do you guys do tangling?"

824
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 So we know what they think the bees think.

825
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 I think they think that it's like thunder, and so when they hear thunder, then they look for shelter.

826
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 And so they'll immediately go back into the hive.

827
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Okay.

828
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Flava.

829
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Oh, there he works.

830
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second, guys.

831
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 Do you know if bees communicate by headbutting each other?

832
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Just like people of Dublin.

833
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 And it is to communicate with their rivals.

834
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 But I really like the way this was found out.

835
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 So one of the worlds leading bee experts, or two of them actually called Thomas Celian Kirk Vischer,

836
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 and they were on an island of the coast of Canada, I believe.

837
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 And basically, what they do is, one of them goes out and places lots of bee hives of different levels of goodness.

838
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 And then he waits outside, though, and then they release some bees and wait for them to find the hives.

839
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 And then Kirk sits outside one of the hives with paint on a brush.

840
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 And as soon as he sees a bee go in, he gets poised.

841
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 And when the bee emerges, he flicks the paintbrush at them to put a little colored dot on a bee.

842
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 And that marks it as a bee that's been into this hive.

843
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 And then the bees go back to, let's call it, base, where they started out.

844
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 And so the ones with a pink dot, you know, have been to one hive, and then the ones with a yellow dot,

845
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 I think he puts on others, have been to another hive.

846
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 And then we learn that, because bees are always trying to advertise to each other where they should move,

847
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 what house they should move to next. They love moving house.

848
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And so they come back, and they're always saying, hey, you should come and move to the house that I've just found for us.

849
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 So when the ones with a pink dot come back, they want everyone to move to the pink dot house,

850
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 whereas the ones with a yellow dot want them to move to the other house,

851
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 and they headbutted out until they've decided, and they just bash into each other until eventually they've been silent.

852
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 So, you know, you basically can cuss a bee to the extent it says,

853
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 "Wow." "Final move to your place. It was fine."

854
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 That's crazy. That's it.

855
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Just on color with the hives, I was reading a thing. It just reminded me that there was in North France somewhere,

856
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 there was a hive that was producing blue honey, and then green honey,

857
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 and they had no idea what was going on, and it was just doing it for ages,

858
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 and they had to investigate it going, have they evolved in some way?

859
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 What's going on? What's producing this?

860
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 And they think they've worked out the answer, and that is 2.5 miles away as an M&M factory.

861
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

862
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 Thank you so much for listening.
