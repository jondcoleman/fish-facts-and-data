 [MUSIC]

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And there's a big database of them. There's over 37,000 of them.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And there's a lot of serious normal ones, but there are, as you say, plenty of very joky ones.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 So in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and America, when you're heading in there, they have a sort of Warner Brothers tribute to the cartoons.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 So your wayfinding points are going to be called "I Tought."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 And then--

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And you can fill the rest in there.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Yeah, I taught, and then I taught, and then--

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 What did you taught?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 A putty.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And then lastly, I did.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 But they're all really badly spelled presumably.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Yeah.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 So "taught" must be with three "teas" on the end or something.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 It's got two "teas" and then two "teas."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Your thing is meant to be pronounceable.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 I would look at them and be like, "Where are we?"

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Yeah, they are very good.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Yeah, you're from South London, aren't you, Dan?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And I look to the one that was closest to where you live, and it's "DORKIDORKI."

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 No!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 No!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 You're on the heckled in the sky.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And sometimes they have local tributes to people who just live nearby.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 So near St. Louis, there's Annie and then Lennox.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 And then in Boston there's Nimoy, because Lennox Nimoy was born there.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Nice.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And it's a really nice one.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 We're in California.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 There's a place near where Charles Schultz, the cartoonist, was from.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 And that's Snoopy.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 That's where he goes.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Where are you?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Where are you?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Yeah, nice.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Sometimes they change them though.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 So in 2010, when the apprentice was massive in America,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 you had Donald Trump and you're fired.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 You're kidding.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 You're fired.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 You're fired.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 It's less menacing when you say it like that, isn't it?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 It's how as well.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 You F-I-R-D.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 You're fired.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 You're fired.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 But they also had Ivanka as well.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And it got to the point where people started pilots were complaining going,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 "I don't want to fly, you know, past Ivanka."

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 And so they actually changed it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 They removed it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So it no longer exists.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Okay.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Those waypoints.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Wow.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Well, you applaud.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 But now there are 100 pilots lost somewhere in America.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 They do like a bit of wordplay pilots.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 So if you are a helicopter pilot, before you set off,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 you need to check your shits and tits.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 The tits, for instance, is your checklist for your navigation radio,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 which is twist, identity, test, and select.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 And that's how they teach you how to fly a helicopter.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Because my wife's a pilot, so she did that.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 And every time you get on an aeroplane, before it sets off,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 they always do their bum fish.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Which is brakes under carriage, fuel, or flaps.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Instruments, switches, and haluses.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And they know it as bum fishing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Really?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Wow.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 That's there.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 That's very cool.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Yeah, see, they've got a sense of humor these guys.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 You don't want them too funny, though.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 I found out a guy who we think is the man behind the airline pilot voice.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 What?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 We're just experiencing a little turbulence as we head over the North Atlantic.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 But don't worry, that's going to be possible.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And voice each time it's not pre-recorded.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 It's not pre-recorded.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 I'm not saying it's pre-recorded.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 I'm saying there's a kind of way that pilots speak.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Oh.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Which is, you know what I get?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Well, we've got some turbulence.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 We're going to be throwing them out of sight, man.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 But, surely, they're just being calm.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Oh, you're saying that?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 I've read a theory, which is that they're all being calm,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 because of Chuck Yeager, who I think we might have mentioned before.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 So he was a fighter pilot, and then a test pilot, and then he broke the sound barrier.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 He had a very calm and gravelly voice, and everyone thought,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 "Oh, wow, Chuck Yeager is so cool and in control."

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 And so people started imitating him.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 And so there's a theory that pilot voices are now like that, partly because of him.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Obviously, it just makes sense also to sound calm and authoritatively.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 I was looking into air traffic control, generally.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And the guys who do it, he throw particularly the ones who are in the tower.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 They do 90-minute dedicated towering.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 They sort of stare at the screen, and they make sure all the planes come in.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 And then, in their break, after 90 minutes, there's a special room that they go to,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 where they're told not to read emails.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 They're told not to do anything where their eyes are staring at anything,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 because of the intensity of it.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 So there's just movies and books for them to read.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 It's like a recreation room for them to go into.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 They have their break, and then they come back for the intensity of flight.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 You know, you can eavesdrop on them now, if you want.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Really?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 You can eavesdrop on any air traffic control you like.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 There is an app. I think it's called Live ATC, and you can basically get that,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 and tap into the conversations that air traffic control are having.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And it's if your plane isn't taking off yet, or it's delayed,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 or, you know, it's not landing yet, and you can find out what an earth is going on.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And I think, I don't know if it's technically legal in some countries,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 so you might want to read your constitution first.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 But, yeah, it sounds really cool.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 And you can understand all of it, because I didn't know that air traffic control

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 is all done in one language, the language of English, except one country,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 which I don't know if people can guess what that is.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 No, it's career?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 No, fine with English and North Korea is France.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Yeah.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 I was reading that one of the problems that Eric traffic control people have is that,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 obviously, they're monitoring planes that are going by,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 but other things register on the screen.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 And I was reading a report that in Ireland, they often have to report UFOs,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 because they're appearing quite a lot, these unexplained,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 so they don't necessarily think that they are alien spacecraft.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 The problem is, is that at night, sometimes the instruments are so sensitive

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 to picking up lights and so on, that they think what they often mistaken

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 as a possible UFO are a flock of birds, clouds,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 and then even possibly a large truck on the ground.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 We're going to have to move on very shortly.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Oh, I've got a detective of a Guinness.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Yeah?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 No, your audience, Andy.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 So Guinness was invented in Wales.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 At what point exactly do you think you lost the Mandy?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Well, there's a pub in a place called Bloody Hell.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Flanfer second, I think, is what it's called.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 It's near Bangor, and they claim that Arthur Guinness took the recipe from there

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 on his way to Dublin in the 1750s, and they say it should be called Guinwiss.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 It sometimes is called that after about 10, 30, 11 p.m.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 various other names.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Obviously it has a really huge worldwide spread Guinness,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 which is, you know, people think it was a very Irish thing,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 but it's three biggest markets.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Well, its biggest market is the UK, isn't it?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 And then its second biggest market is Nigeria,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 which overtook Ireland about 10 years ago now, I think.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Very popular there, and also they're drinking the strongest stuff in Nigeria.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 So that's, as far as more than 10 years ago,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 but they're drinking the more original Guinness.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 So it was originally... Well, the Welsh stuff, yeah.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 The Welsh stuff.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 After you won them back, when did you think you lost them again?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 So when it first came about in the very start of the 19th century,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 wasn't it, Arthur Guinness, then it was stronger, so it's 70...

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 It's not 17%.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 It's 7.5% in Nigeria, and that's because it has to be much happier

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 to be able to be exported abroad and more alcohol to preserve it more.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 And so that's what they're drinking. And apparently there was someone who works in the Guinness factory,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 one of the Guinness factories in Nigeria, who was saying you tell Nigerians

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 that they drink Guinness in Ireland, and they're like, "Why do they drink Guinness there?"

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 So I'll drink.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 You guys have some beef with a few countries, Arthur.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 In 1991, you know the little widget inside a Guinness can,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 which helps it to fizz up. In 1991, that was voted by Britain's

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 as the best invention of the previous 40 years.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Very good.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 That was...

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 In second place, the internet.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 No!

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 OK, my fact this week is that the first ever bone transplant

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 used a dog's bones to repair a man's head.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 The patient was immediately excommunicated by the church for no longer being fully human.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 That is incredible. Someone shouted out, "Damn right."

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 So when was this?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 It was in 1668, and the surgeon was called a "Yobvan-American,"

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 and the patient was a Russian nobleman called Butterline.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 And is that for me?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Butterline.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Butterline had been hit in the head with a sword,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 and he put some dog bone in there, and then he survived,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 but he was immediately excommunicated.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 And then Butterline demanded that the surgeon took the dog bone back out,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 but by then his own bone had regrown around it,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 so he couldn't get it out, so he was stuck.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 And he's...

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Yeah.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 He's still there in purgatory somewhere.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 But that's a thing that happens, doesn't it?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 I believe when we're born, we have over around 300 bones,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 but then as we grow up, it slowly shrinks down to about 206.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And that's because there's a lot in the head, which fuse is over.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 So if you're going to put a bone in that you want to take back out,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 don't go for the skull.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 It's all about the fusion up there.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Yeah, I'm not sure that's exactly what I mean.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 That's with babies, isn't it?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 With cartilage turning into bone.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 But old Butterline's head.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Well, they do it well, but because bone through generate very, very well.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 So if you've ever broken a bone, I've heard most people have,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 I broke a bone last year, and they just say,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 "Keep it still for a month, and it's fine."

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 And that's why things like this can work.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And it's why in the 18th and 19th centuries, in fact,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 so from when Cook got to Tahiti, he met Tahiti Islanders,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 and he realised that they fixed skull fractures with coconut.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 So if you had a skull fracture, they'd cut out the damage bit of your skull,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 and they'd just slaughter a bit of coconut shell in there,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 and then your new bone grew around that.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Yeah, it's really cool.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 That's so good at doing it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 If you were running, could you do that Monty Python thing?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 Yes.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 So just another kind of transplant you can have.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 We've mentioned this before.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 A big thing is fecal transplants,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 where your stomach bacteria don't work,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 and you have someone else's feces implanted into you.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 So we've mentioned that before on the podcast.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 You know, it's a big thing these days.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 But I've read this.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 I did not know this.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Okay, a few people have had it. Great. Good on you.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 A few, a big problem these days is people doing DIY fecal transplants.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Based on YouTube tutorials, and I look them up,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 and now my YouTube is just going to be recommending these things to me for weeks.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 That's true.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 And because the problem is, you know, the microbiome,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 or the bacteria in your intestines are very, very powerful.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 So transferring cells can have an unintended consequence.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 So normally, you're screened for any autoimmune diseases, things like this.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 And if you have any, you can't be a poo donor.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 But if you just do a DIY one at home,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 you can transfer, over, you can transfer obesity.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 But just what? You can try.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Because your microbiome will change.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 How much of it are you eating?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 No, you're not.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Oh, God.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Okay.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 So you need to transfer it by you to get it?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 No, it's not by you. No.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 How do you get in?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Go and watch these tutorials. They'll tell you.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Except, no, don't.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 But you can even hand over, like, poor sleep.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 But how do you get it in?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 I think it goes up, not down.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 I think it's a pill.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 If you do it properly, it's a pill.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 I don't know what YouTube tells you to wear.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 YouTube, probably, just, no, I'm...

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 If you go to bumfishing.com, you will find...

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 But you know, cats can repair their own bones.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 Okay.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 And do you know how they do it?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Sorry, what do you mean?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 So not naturally, like, if you break it.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Well, yeah, basically. So if cat breaks its bone,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 the way it repairs it is just it purrs.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 And that's what cat purring is, they think, now.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 What?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 They're healing their fractures.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 So, well, they pour a frequency, which is between 25 and 150 Hertz,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 and sound.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 If you fire a certain sound frequency at damaged bones or damaged muscles,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 then it repairs them.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 And it's exactly the right sound frequency.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And it's sort of the reason they're just sitting there purring contentedly.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 It's just they're just healing and developing their bones and muscles.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 I think you've got my notes.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 I know, okay.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 That's what they're doing.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 They're very clever.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 So there was another dog, a human transplant.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 This was in 1891.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 It was a doctor called Phelps.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 There was a young boy who had injured his leg.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 And a bit of his bone had come off and they'd had to remove it.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 And so they had to put a dog bone in there.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 But the way that they did it in those days

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 is both the donor and the host were attached to each other for two weeks.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 So that the blood circulation could carry on going around.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 So this young boy had, he was playing like a, wait a minute,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 one, two, three, four, a five-legged race with a dog.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Because he had to have one of his legs attached to the dog's leg.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 That's cool, isn't it?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Did he get to keep the dog afterwards?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Because you'd be so bonded by that, I think.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Well, they've said that they both recovered after a brief convalescence.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 So they both got better, yeah?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 They did a lot of experimenting on dogs with surgery.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Because another kind of surgery that has a similar mechanism

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 is skin grafting, really.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 So if you put a skin graft on, then it can cause new skin to regenerate.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 And the first person to experiment with skin grafts properly

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 was a guy called Walter Charlton, who did it actually with Robert Hook,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 who he talked about a few weeks ago.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 This was in 1663.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And he basically did it by, he got a dog.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 And he sliced the skin off one side of the dog and then plugged it onto the other side

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 to see if it would be able to like still stay alive there and grow.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 But the dog, understandably, just chewed the whole thing off quite quickly.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 So they got it back in the lab and they tried to do it again.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 And the dog escaped and was never seen again.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Wow.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 So that's why they put doors on hospitals now.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Are we ready to go on to ex-communication?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Yeah, sure.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Okay, so there's a big long list online of things you can get ex-communicated for.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Posing as a nun, stealing from a Christian who's been shipwrecked.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Oh, no.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Oh, no.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 I'm taking place in any jousting tournament between 1245 and 1248.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Oh, no.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 I didn't want this afternoon at 1247.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Well, the good news is that there is a ecclesiastical law which is canon 1324,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 which makes a number of exceptions for ex-communicable offenses.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 And if you're under 16, you can't be ex-communicated.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And also, if you lack the use of reason because of drunkenness.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Oh.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 So you're old lipo.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 If you're pissed, you could do what the fuck you want.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 That's why Ireland has remained such a religious country.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 The rest of us have drifted.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 So there are some offenses where, oh, you might be ex-communicated.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And there are some which bring immediate automatic ex-communication.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 So, grasping people up after confession, just automatic,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 desecrating the Holy Communion, fair enough to you, Christ.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 This is all over the internet.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Physically attacking the Pope, which I would have thought...

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 I think fair play, actually, that's completely ex-communicable.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 But there is always a way back.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Because I thought it was that if you were ex-communicated, you were out.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 And that's it. You're not even a Catholic anymore.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Yeah.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 And it's not the case.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 No, you stay Catholic.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 And actually, they do.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 If you go... I mean, you probably know this a lot of you,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 but if you go to Catholic resources online,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 they say the whole point of ex-communication

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 is to try and encourage you to repent and come back to the church.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 And so you can be un-ex-communicated.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 It's the naughty step, basically.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 It's the naughty step.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 But there is... I like the Eucharist one,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 where you're not allowed to throw away the Eucharist,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 because what that basically means is that if you're a priest

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 and you're going, giving the Eucharist,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 you will be ex-communicated if there's wine left at the end

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 and you toss it away, which is why at the end you have to drink

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 all of the wine left over as the priest.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 And all of the bread.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 And that's why the bread, they were really, really hard to engineer

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 crumb-free Eucharist bread,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 because if you drop a crumb, then that's it, you're out.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 You've automatically gone.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 I love that bread so much.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Do you?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Yeah, I'm annoyed you can't get in shops.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 I would totally...

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 When are you... when are you eating this stuff?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 A church.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Oh.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Every Sunday, where the fuck are you guys?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Wow, you are definitely ex-communicated.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Yes.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 You just keep going up in a different moustache act.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Meanwhile, how does that neck it into the bottle of wine?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 It's really hard, though, to get ex-communicated these days,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 as you were saying.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 There was a site that was online called countmeout.ie.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And yeah.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 And it was a website that was providing information

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 to how you can be ex-communicated if you wanted to go out.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 So it was sort of gave you the form that you could send in.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 And you would...

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 So because the idea is that you need it on your baptism certificate

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 to say that you're officially ex-communicated.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 But then this was launched in 2009, this website.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 And in that same year, the Pope set up new Canon laws

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 about what is the way to get ex-communicated,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 which they couldn't get past.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 They couldn't get their head round it.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 So the site had to close because they were like,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 "We've got no idea how to get ex-communicated anymore."

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 It's too complicated.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 So it's not difficult.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 I don't think to get automatically ex-communicated, like you said.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 There's two types.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 There's the automatic, super easy, flush communion wine down the toilet.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 You're out.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 I mean, I've set before on the podcast that I have been ex-communicated.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Yeah.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Because I'm a Catholic and I mention Jesus is fast.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 I've done it again.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Yeah, you've done it again.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Yeah.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Jesus, if you mention Jesus is fast, then you get automatically ex-communicated.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 You do.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 But to get specifically ex-communicated is quite special.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 And to get ex-communicated by the Pope is very exciting.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 So he does this very rarely.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And the last one was the start of last year.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 And it was someone who spilled secrets from their confessional.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Ooh.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Yeah.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 And that was the first for about two or three years, I think.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Yeah. In 2014, the Mafia in Italy got ex-communicated.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And high time, I think, 2014.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 But the really cool thing was that in the 15th century used to be able to ex-communicate all kinds of stuff.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 So in the 1480s, the Bishop of Orta in France, he ruled against some slugs which were in his garden.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And he ordered them to leave or be cursed.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 And basically, slugs were quite frequently ex-communicated in the 15th century.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Really?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Of course, it made it easier to destroy them.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 So--

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 What?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 What, did he felt less guilty about it?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 He felt less guilty.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Like the people who were looking after gardens didn't want to destroy God's creatures.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 But if they'd been ex-communicated--

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Yeah.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 That must have been a hassle for the Pope, though.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Just every slide he needed to approve the ex-communication.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 I think he could send an envoy.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 I found a guy who was ex-communicated called Pedro the Cruel.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 And he was ex-communicated by a guy called Blessed Urban the Fifth.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 And yeah, so he was ex-communicated for cruelty.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 So I don't know which came first, the name, but it's like a chicken egg thing with that one.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Speaking of urban popes, I don't know if this is true, but it's certainly stated online that it's true.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 And that is that Pope Urban the eighth ordered that anyone that found guilty of taking snuff in church

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 should be ex-communicated.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And that's because it led to sneezing, which he thought too closely resembled sexual ecstasy.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Ah, I get that.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 I understand that.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Guys, we're going to have to move on a second.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 And we're going to have to move on without ever fighting out why James has been talking about Jesus' foreskin.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Can I just give you one fact about Catholic confessions?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Yeah.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 So this is the news that Paddy Power is getting really wrapped up with the Catholic Church, and it's a good thing.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 So first of all, in fact, last year the Pope came here, and apparently Paddy Power erected a massive confessionals.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 Did any of you guys see it?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 It was just opposite of Phoenix Park. It was obviously a publicity star.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 But they said they'd put these adverts out saying we invite everyone to come and have their sins absorbed.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Sorry, do you mean a single enormous booth?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Yes, yes. We're a drive-through.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 Are you joking?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 If it was a drive-through, is the priest in another car next to you?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 They didn't, I don't know.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 They didn't seem to advertise the presence of a priest.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Not how drive-throughs work.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 If you go to McDonald's, you've not got Ronald McDonald in a Mazda going past you throwing burgers at you.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 But no, this isn't the first time they've bonded, so in 2010 there's a church.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 In Suffolk, right in a new market, which was trying to raise £65,000 for refurbishment.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 They've phoned lots of places.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 They phoned Paddy Power, one source said, because they thought Ireland is a Catholic place.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 It's a Catholic-looking name. Why don't we just phoned them up and see if they want to donate.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 And Paddy Power said, "Yeah, we'd love to donate to your new confessional."

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And so they did. They put £10,000, I believe, towards a new confession box.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And it's got their own little logo, their little Paddy Power marker.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 It says, "It's got a plaque on it that says Paddy Power sin bin."

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 In a church.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Like, do they offer odds on the things that are going to be confessed inside?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 We've got adultery at 8-1 today, if you fancy a flutter.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Okay, so we need to move on to our next fact.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 My fact is, there is a world record for pulling a train with model trains.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 This is so cool.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Is it cool?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 It's cool.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 We're going to get a real insight into Andy's childhood in the next five minutes.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 So this was, I saw this guy called Tim Dunn who tweets a lot about trains.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 He is really cool. He put this up recently.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 And this record was broken a few years ago in Germany at a place called Miniatur Wunderland.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 And the video is online. It is incredible.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 They get 198 mini trains.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 And they've all got little engines in them.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 And they attach them to one single row, which is attached to the front of a massive train.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Not a train.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 It just looks massive because of the little ones next.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Yeah, it does.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 And it works.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And they manage to pull whole thing along.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 And the really cool thing is that the model trains are exactly the same model of train as the train.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Nice.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 When did they get on the rail gauge?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Can they fit on the rail?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 It was done under controlled circumstances.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Some of it was not a normal railway.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 I think they built them a little platform.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Oh, did they?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Okay, so it's not a platform.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Oh dear, here we go.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 But they're not saying it's a viable way for trains to get about in future.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 No, they're not.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 They were very clear on that.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 This miniature Wunderland is amazing, isn't it?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 I think it's the biggest model railway in the world, is it?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Or something?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Yeah.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 It has an airport with planes taking off and landing.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 It has a football stadium where they have commentary of a famous football match that happened.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 It has, because it's Germany, it has many natureists.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 And people doing things in bushes.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Oh, wow.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 It's 1,100 square meters.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 And they started by building Germany as a replica of Germany.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And they've moved on to other countries like Venice.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 But like countries like Venice, really.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 That is still living in the 14th century.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 You're about city states.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 They are moving on to other countries, though.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 They've got a whole spread of countries.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Yeah, like Sydney and...

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 So, as I think you were trying to say,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 they do have a bunch of countries already there.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 They've expanded into Austria and America.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 It's a weird sort of territory world.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 America is actually a continent, not a country.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 Sorry.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 You're absolutely right.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 You're absolutely right.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 I meant the United States of America.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Switzerland, Scandinavia, which again, not a country,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 but they didn't love the more than together.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 But they've planned up to 2028, what they're going to do.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 England's getting on there. England and Scotland are getting on there by 2021.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 Ireland and Wales have to wait till 2025, I'm afraid.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Yeah.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 One thing it does have is it has a mini replica model of the miniature wonderland

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 with tiny miniature trains going around.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Wow, really?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 They also have, because I got a Guinness World Record,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 they also have the adjudicator who came to give them the World Record.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 They made a mini version of her to stand in front of their building.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Nice.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 So the guy who came up with the idea was called Frederick Brown.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 And in 2000, he'd been running a nightclub for eight years,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 and he decided, "Don't want to do it anymore."

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 He said, "This is not my life. People are always getting drunk.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 They hug you, but they do not know you."

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And so on.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 So he realised he wanted to do something else, and he didn't know what to do.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 And he said, "At that time, it was possible to send emails

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 to thousands of AOL users without it being spam."

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Around 3,000 people answered my question for what kind of attraction they would like to see in Hamburg.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 For men, a model railroad was number three.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 For women, it was the last out of a list of 40.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 But I'm a man, so we went with the model thing.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 The model railway thing, model trains.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 Someone who loves model trains is Rod Stewart.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Oh, yes.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 So he has one, he has a model railway, the size of a tennis court in his home.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 He has admitted as well that he likes model trains so much that when he goes on tour,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 he books a second hotel room just for his model trains.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 And they go on the road with him.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Yeah.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 He loves it.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 He's featured on a model railroad magazine a bunch of times.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 He's been a cover star.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Yeah, cover star.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 And he wrote to them saying, "Can I be included in your magazine?"

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Wow, they didn't write to him.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 And he's more proud of that than being on the front of Rolling Stone, on NME.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 He's not the only rock star.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Neil Young, as well, massively into model railways.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 And he actually has bought into a big brand called Lionel Trains.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 He did that in the '90s.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 And he's worked on sound technology for them.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Really?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Yeah, so for when they're moving.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 This is how into it he is.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 When he's playing with his model railways,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 he uses a pseudonym created to be the model railway enthusiast.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 He calls himself Clyde Coil.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 And Clyde Coil is his alter ego, who runs Coil Picks,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 which is a short film set inside his model railway system.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Totally into it.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Oh, so exciting.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 I don't know if that's the best way to recruit new users.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 And that is a problem for railway enthusiasts, right?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 So the average age of your model railway enthusiast is going up and up.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 And they're worried that the younger generation is not as into it.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 So there was, for instance, there was an interview with a guy called Ron May,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 who lives in Phoenix.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 And he said that he's been into railways since the '50s, right?

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 And he's like really obsessive about it.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 And they interviewed his son, who was 26 years old, a guy called Tony,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 who said, "I'm so impressed by my dad's level of detail, the layout."

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 He recreates train scenes from the 1950s.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 Write down to what pigeons would have been at what train station at what time.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 At no way.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 And he's done the research.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 He's a keen reader of what pigeon magazine?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 And the rust streaks on the box cards.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 And so he said, "I really respect my dad for this," so the journalist said,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 "And are you, the younger Mr. May, tempted to take up the hobby?"

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 And he said, "To be honest, not really."

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 No.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Yeah, the National Model Railroad Association has 19,000 members,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 and their average age is 64.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 And their average sex is male.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 [laughter]

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Very cruel reviews associated them with average sex.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 [laughter]

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Average sex.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 A lot of them may be very fiery lovers.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 [laughter]

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Look, if you scale this up 100 times bigger than that.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 [laughter]

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 There was a great story in the newspaper in February.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 And this is the headline.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Oxygenarians sat on burglar who tried to steal his Model Railway collection.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 This is true. He's a guy called John Hellington.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 He was in his mid 80s. He used to work on the railways.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 And there was a man who broke into his home and was trying to steal his very valuable trains.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 And his wife sat on the burglar together until the police arrived.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Really?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Is that sweet?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 I reckon if two 80-year-old people sat on me, I would still be able to get up.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Yeah.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Well, you weren't this burglar, Mr. Barnes, who, yeah.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 It was actually just a five-year-old child who'd been invited around to play.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 [laughter]

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Picked up one of the trains sat on him.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 [laughter]

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 We're going to have to move on very shortly.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Just the Model trains have been around for a while.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 So the early 1800s, really, almost since trains.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 But the first Model trains were carpet.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 [laughter]

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 The first were carpet railways. And they were trains that you'd have in your house.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 And they were invented in the 1840s.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 And they were called the Birmingham dribblers.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 Which, having just kicked in Birmingham means a different thing today.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 But they were called that because they were basically a steam-powered boiler.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 So they'd have an alcohol-fueled flame.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 And then it was powering. It was steam-powered.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 So it had a big tray of water above it.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 And then it would dribble.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Because it was made of tin. So it had lots of gaps.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 It just dribbled all over your carpet as you ran it.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 But it was also a massive fire risk.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Because of the alcohol-fueled flame on a very unstable wooden floor.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Another floors were wooden in those days.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 So it would frequently just bump into the furniture and fall over and set fire.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 [laughter]

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Wow.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 We've come a long way.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 Should we move on to our final facts?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 We can do, yeah.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 I have another world record about trains.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Okay, quickly.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Just in 2012, Romanian wedding salon got the world's longest train of a wedding dress.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Okay.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 It was 1.85 miles long.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 What?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 And it stretched across the entire city centre of Bucharest.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 And it was modelled by a lady called Imer Duma Trescu,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 who went up in a hot air balloon while the train went down throughout the whole town.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 And according to the telegraph, this was mostly ignored by unimpressed bystanders.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 [laughter]

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 And that is my fact.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 My fact this week is that in the 19th century, if the owner of an estate died,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 it was traditional for the estate's beekeeper to inform all of the bees of the death.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 And then allow them to mourn by covering the hives in black veils.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 But you wouldn't have to inform them one by one, would you?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 I think you only tell one of them and he lets the others know about that.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Yeah.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 This was the thing that did often happen.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 It was called telling the bees.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 And this was not just her.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 And how did it get that name?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 [laughter]

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 And it wasn't, you weren't just telling them about death.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 You were telling them everything.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 This juicy gossip, the beekeeper would go to the hive and be like, guess what?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Guess who's dating who?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And by keeping them informed, you pleased the bees because they wanted to feel part of the family.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 And so that was the purpose of them.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 And when people died, if they weren't told, people would worry that they would get sick and die.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 So that was a very important thing to do, to make sure the bees knew otherwise.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 And yeah, it wasn't just death.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 It was, because they get offended if they're not kept up to speed with the idea, wasn't it?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 So if you had a new birth in the family or if you got married or anything like that,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 then you had to inform them straight away.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 If a couple got married and they went back to their parents' house,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 they had to introduce themselves formally to the bees.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 And sometimes, actually, if you had a wedding and you got married,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 then you'd leave them a piece of wedding cake as well to make sure that they knew that they were welcome.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 And they were invited to funerals as well.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 I read they were invited to weddings, too, sometimes.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Yeah, very different.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 You don't want to be sat next to one of them in a wedding.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 The baby on my left and then the swarm of bees on my right.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Sometimes they protected them when the body was leaving the house as well.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 They would turn the hive around.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 So they wouldn't see and get upset.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 Yeah, people didn't mad stuff before Telly, didn't they?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 That's really what we've learned.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 Yeah, you had to sing to them.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Sometimes there were traditional bee songs along the same lines, you know.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 So bees, bees awake, your master is dead, another you must take.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 What a song.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 I don't know.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 It does sound like a bee side.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 I was reading a story as you, which one of our colleagues Matt posted a few years ago on our forums.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 But it's related to the fact that every funeral, another thing that you did out of respect

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 was you turned round the beehives that belonged to the dead person out of respect.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 And then sometimes people didn't know how to do that.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 So this was in 1790, a report where a servant didn't really know about the fact that he had to turn the beehives around when their owner died.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 And so instead he lifted the beehives up, which of course released them all.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 And they intact the entire funeral procession.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 The horses and their riders, a general confusion took place, attended with lots of hats, wigs, etc.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 But many stings and a corpse left unattended.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 And so the oldest laws ever in Ireland are the 7th century brethren laws.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 And we have a group of 7th century Irish lawyers in tonight, I believe.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 They were written by a Welshman called No.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 So they have some bee laws in these laws.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 And so if your bees were found to be collecting nectar from flowers on the neighbor's land, they could be accused of trespassing.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 And to get around the laws, the rule said you had three years of freedom with your bees.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 So they were allowed to do what they wanted for three years.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 But on the fourth year, if they went to a neighbor's area and they et his flowers next year, then he had to give the bees to the neighbor's payment.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Yes.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 So there was another one.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 If a person was stunned by a bee, they were entitled to a meal of honey from the bee's owner.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 A meal of honey.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Oh great.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 What?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 Just like a bowl of honey.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 Yeah.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 Well, some food, some honey.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Yeah.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 Unless he or she had retaliated by killing the bee.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 They used to think that honey was ready made though, didn't they? Until in fact, 1800, people around about then, the prevailing belief was that honey just existed in the atmosphere.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 And all the bees were doing was they were picking it up and putting it in their houses.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 They were like stealing it.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 And so it wasn't until then that they sort of people realised that it was a chemical reaction.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 And the bees actually added some stuff to it.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 So they just thought bees were collecting it from flowers and it was naturally produced. And in fact, people thought that bees were naturally produced as well.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 So for a long time, people like Aristotle and Virgil wrote that bees didn't give birth to their young.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 They went to nearby flowers and they found baby bees in them.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 What?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 And they gathered them up in their mouths and took them back to a hive.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 That's how bees come about.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Well, there's the other belief about how you got bees, which was called bugonia, I think.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 And that was spontaneous generation from dead animals.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 So we may have mentioned that in the past.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 It was that bees came out of the body of a dead ox. If you had a dead ox, you left it for a long time, you would get bees.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 And different things came out of different animals. So drones came from horses, hornets came from mules, and wasps came out of asses.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 It does sound uncomfortable. But there were even like Virgil gave instructions on how to get bees.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 So he said, you have to take a bullock whose second year's horns are just curling over its brow, stop up its nostrils and mouth and beat it to death.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 And then, it's not one of Virgil's best lines.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 And then you have to shut up and shut it up in a room with some herbs. And then after nine days, the bees will appear from the body.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Yeah, because they, in Egypt, in about 250 bees, they thought the same thing. And when a cow died or an ox died, you buried it, but it had its horns sticking up above the ground.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 And they thought the body would basically turn into bees, and then they'd come up through the horns.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 So you must have just been walking through Egypt, and you've got these horns poking up through the ground everywhere.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 Turning into bees.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Do you know that there is Undertaker bees? So roughly daily, about 15 bees will die in the area of the hive.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 And what happens then is they wait for a few days when it loses moisture. And some bees will go out, and they'll pick up the bee, and they'll drop them off about 150 meters away.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 And it's known as the Undertaker bee, they're bringing them.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 So it's the idea to get it away from the hive so that anything coming to eat it doesn't find the other-

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 150 feet, I should say, meters is a pretty long journey.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 They could still do that. They're not as advanced as Undertaker humans. I think you'd be annoyed if you called it Undertaker to take away your granny.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 And they just picked her up, dumped her by the roadside, 150 feet away.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 I think the Undertaker bees also grab the deceased in their jaws and drag them that way.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 There's a belief that's really ancient about bees that is still practiced, according to a lot of beekeepers that I know, and also on the internet.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 So I don't know if they're any beekeepers here, but they're into a thing called tangling.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 So there's been this belief that's been around for over 2,000 years, that they really love the sound of metal clashing together with other metal.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 And that is how you can calm them down. So if they're freaking out and swarming, you can settle them into your hive.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 And so, you know, you've got pictures of women in the 16th century who have gotten bashed metal onto a saucepan to try and get the bees to settle.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 And if you go on to beekeeper forums, they still say, "Do you do tangling? Do you guys do tangling?"

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 So we know what they think the bees think.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 I think they think that it's like thunder, and so when they hear thunder, then they look for shelter.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 And so they'll immediately go back into the hive.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Okay.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Flava.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Oh, there he works.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second, guys.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 Do you know if bees communicate by headbutting each other?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 Just like people of Dublin.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 And it is to communicate with their rivals.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 But I really like the way this was found out.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 So one of the worlds leading bee experts, or two of them actually called Thomas Celian Kirk Vischer,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 and they were on an island of the coast of Canada, I believe.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 And basically, what they do is, one of them goes out and places lots of bee hives of different levels of goodness.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 And then he waits outside, though, and then they release some bees and wait for them to find the hives.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 And then Kirk sits outside one of the hives with paint on a brush.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 And as soon as he sees a bee go in, he gets poised.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 And when the bee emerges, he flicks the paintbrush at them to put a little colored dot on a bee.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 And that marks it as a bee that's been into this hive.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 And then the bees go back to, let's call it, base, where they started out.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 And so the ones with a pink dot, you know, have been to one hive, and then the ones with a yellow dot,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 I think he puts on others, have been to another hive.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 And then we learn that, because bees are always trying to advertise to each other where they should move,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 what house they should move to next. They love moving house.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 And so they come back, and they're always saying, hey, you should come and move to the house that I've just found for us.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 So when the ones with a pink dot come back, they want everyone to move to the pink dot house,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 whereas the ones with a yellow dot want them to move to the other house,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 and they headbutted out until they've decided, and they just bash into each other until eventually they've been silent.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 So, you know, you basically can cuss a bee to the extent it says,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 "Wow." "Final move to your place. It was fine."

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 That's crazy. That's it.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Just on color with the hives, I was reading a thing. It just reminded me that there was in North France somewhere,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 there was a hive that was producing blue honey, and then green honey,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 and they had no idea what was going on, and it was just doing it for ages,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 and they had to investigate it going, have they evolved in some way?

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 What's going on? What's producing this?

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 And they think they've worked out the answer, and that is 2.5 miles away as an M&M factory.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
