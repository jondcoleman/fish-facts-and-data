1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,360
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,720
 You did no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,880
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,800
 No such thing as a fish.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:28,240
 Hello and welcome to the pilot episode of No Such Thing as a Fish

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,000
 My name is Dan.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,200
 I'm sitting with three other QI elves, James, Andy, and Anna.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,160
 And each week we're going to get around this microphone

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,040
 and share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,920
 So in no particular order, here are the best things

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
 we found out this week.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,720
 OK, let's start with fact number one that

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,240
 comes from you, James.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,600
 I went this weekend to the Collider Exhibition,

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
 the Large Hadron Collider Exhibition at the Science Museum.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
 OK.

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,480
 And I got fat there.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,240
 The Large Hadron Collider was almost turned off.

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,520
 I think it was turned off for a short amount of time,

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,320
 for what reason?

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,200
 What do you think?

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,120
 Because the rewiring needed maintenance.

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,800
 We're good maintenance.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,320
 And it's a lot more low-fi than that.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,560
 Apparently they found a piece of baguette in the machinery.

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,920
 And it made the temperature go up by seven degrees

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,440
 and they had to turn the whole thing off

31
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,880
 before they found the baguette.

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,800
 If you work with a friend, this will happen.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,080
 I've always thrown my baguette into the machine.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,240
 You're actually a pest, sorry.

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,120
 But what they actually think happened

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,080
 is that a bird somehow dropped it into an event

37
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,960
 or something like that.

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,240
 And it was found there.

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,280
 But some of the physicists who were there at the time

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,600
 actually thought that maybe it was a time-traveling bird

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,960
 sent from the future to ask about the experiment.

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,160
 Well, he's just pretty cool.

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,640
 Maybe the worst thing I've ever made to seek for ever.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,680
 Or when they first saw the baguette, they're like,

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,920
 "Whoa, the Higgs boson is way bigger than that."

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
 Found it!

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,720
 Yeah, it's here.

48
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,080
 It's all bread-like.

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
 That's why they turned it off.

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,400
 Job done.

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,760
 The Higgs baguette is--

52
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,120
 The Higgs boson is covered in tuna mayonnaise.

53
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,440
 Surely someone's marketing a Higgs baguette now in Paris.

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,280
 But there it was.

55
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,120
 There was a guy who wasn't there who broke into CERN.

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,320
 He broke in.

57
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,040
 His name was--

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,920
 How would you say this, Andy?

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,040
 Eloy?

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,920
 Eloy?

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
 Eloy at Cole.

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
 Strangely dressed match.

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,240
 Man, he said that he traveled back in time

64
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,080
 to prevent the LHC from destroying the world.

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,560
 So they've had a number of time-traveling--

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,000
 Yeah, well, that was one theory that the reason we hadn't had

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,920
 time-travelers yet was we hadn't invented the Large Hadron

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
 Collider, which would presumably then

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,080
 be the machine that would get them back.

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,600
 So you can't have time-travelers until you build the machine.

71
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,880
 So that's why we haven't had them in the past.

72
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,520
 Well, here's the final sentence of this story.

73
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,040
 Mr. Cole, as his name was, was taken

74
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,120
 to a secure mental health facility in Geneva,

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,640
 but later disappeared from his cell.

76
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,000
 Police are battled, but not that bothered.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 [LAUGHTER]

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,680
 What a second.

79
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,440
 I should point out that Dad is on David Aikdog.

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
 [LAUGHTER]

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,200
 Because I just googled it, and that's the first thing

82
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,760
 that came on, but this is the talkboards.

83
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,280
 It looks like they've lifted this from Crave Docks.

84
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
 OK.

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,800
 Good.

86
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,440
 I don't know if that's any more reputable,

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,920
 but--

88
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,160
 Because there was a bit of worry at the time

89
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,800
 that the whole universe was going to end, wasn't there?

90
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,440
 Yeah.

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,400
 They thought that--

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,720
 because what they were actually doing

93
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,840
 was making very, very, very tiny black holes.

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,680
 And I think in people's minds, they thought,

95
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,440
 well, what if they get--

96
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
 What if they get bigger?

97
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,240
 Yeah, yeah.

98
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,680
 But I think what had happened, I might be wrong about this,

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,040
 because I'm going off memory a little bit.

100
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,600
 But I think this scientist said that there was a chance

101
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,440
 of the world ending, but it was something like 10,000 billion,

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,480
 billion, billion, billion to one chance, which is pretty much

103
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,680
 the chance of the world ending anyway in that kind of time.

104
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,080
 But I think they didn't help themselves by saying that.

105
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,720
 And some old people here is what the world's going to end.

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,800
 I think there was a big switch on day.

107
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,400
 Do you remember?

108
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,160
 It was when the machine was first used to be switched on.

109
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,040
 And the BBC went to a wall-to-wall coverage

110
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,920
 over-- I had to write about it for private eyes.

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,400
 Everyone going crazy about it.

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,160
 And when it didn't work for another nine months,

113
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,880
 they couldn't switch.

114
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,800
 Oh, yeah, I remember that.

115
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,440
 That was a slight problem in the world.

116
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,240
 That's-- there was a story in the news this week

117
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,000
 about the spaceship that had been--

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,160
 Oh, yeah, yeah, there's a lot like that.

119
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,360
 Is it called Atticus?

120
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,880
 Can you check what's the--

121
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,720
 it's satellite that we sent up that's

122
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,000
 been asleep for three years.

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,240
 And we sort of sent an alarm on it to wake it up yesterday.

124
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,080
 That's it, yeah.

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,400
 And so there was a big thing where they're all waiting.

126
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,280
 And you could stream mission control in--

127
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,320
 was it Russia or maybe, I'm not sure what country it was,

128
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,840
 America?

129
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,240
 You could watch it, what do you mean?

130
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,080
 You could watch it.

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
 You could watch the controller.

132
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,920
 They were waiting, because it was going to be switched on.

133
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,240
 And there was an hour window where it didn't come on.

134
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,080
 So they were waiting.

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
 And then tension started getting high.

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,840
 And then--

137
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,280
 Yeah, so it was actually-- it wasn't too long,

138
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,200
 but yeah, so there was 10 minutes where it was late waking up.

139
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,120
 And it happened to any signals back.

140
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,800
 And then they started to get increasingly tense.

141
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
 And if you watch the video, which I now have,

142
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,120
 they suddenly start to panic.

143
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
 And it all goes really silent.

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,640
 And then it was actually 18 minutes late waking up,

145
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,200
 because what they think happened

146
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,320
 is somehow the satellite put its alarm on snooze.

147
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,920
 And just postpone its wake up call for 18 minutes.

148
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
 And then-- which is fair enough, you know?

149
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,200
 If you're going to think for three years,

150
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,360
 you can't be expected to just bounce out of there.

151
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,800
 I think it was Rosetta, wasn't it?

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,880
 Rosetta, yeah.

153
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,960
 Rosetta, yes.

154
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,800
 It's a silent--

155
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,120
 That's incredible, I'm trying.

156
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,240
 Has got an awesome solar system, in fact, how many?

157
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,840
 Yes.

158
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,280
 OK, no, this is going--

159
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,760
 I know, you haven't heard this yet, so--

160
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,280
 No, I haven't.

161
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
 I'm prepared.

162
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,520
 It's your turn.

163
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,960
 This has raised some controversy in the office,

164
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,360
 but let's go for it.

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,760
 In 2007, the largest object in the solar system

166
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,240
 was-- what do you think, Anna?

167
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,200
 The sun.

168
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,760
 No, it was a comet called comet homes, which was--

169
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,480
 the comet itself, the main body of it,

170
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 is three kilometers across.

171
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,080
 And it had this extraordinary explosion at the surface.

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,280
 And the corona of dust, they call it the comet coma,

173
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,720
 is the name for it, was bigger than the sun.

174
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,640
 It was 1.4 million kilometers.

175
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,080
 Out of here, it was 1.4 million kilometers across, I think.

176
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,440
 And that all counted as part of the body of the comet.

177
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,360
 Yes, it was 1% of the total mass of the comet

178
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,760
 is a huge dust.

179
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,080
 Because the sun is emptier than we think it is,

180
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,160
 I think that was fair to say.

181
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,680
 Who do you think?

182
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,160
 I mean, it depends on your definition of the sun, really,

183
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,360
 because there's an argument that the sun is actually

184
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,000
 the size of the solar system, because that's

185
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,600
 as far as the solar, as you know, the--

186
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,440
 As long as the solar wind goes all the way out to there,

187
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
 there's still articles from the sun

188
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,800
 that are getting all the way out to Pluto and beyond.

189
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,800
 So there is an argument that we all live inside the sun

190
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
 at the moment.

191
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,040
 Yeah, well, that's true, then the comet thing is not.

192
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,480
 But if the sun is the size that everyone else says it is,

193
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,440
 it's a comet.

194
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,760
 It was bigger, briefly.

195
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,280
 And nothing is only me who says that.

196
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
 What's the comet called?

197
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,960
 Comet Holmes, as in show.

198
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,040
 Oh, a comet, OK.

199
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 Big boy.

200
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,720
 That's interesting, Salah.

201
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,680
 They're not just doing this for the naming, really.

202
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,840
 That's what you would have called it.

203
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,880
 That's what I would have called it, I guess,

204
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,840
 is why I'm not a scientist.

205
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,880
 There's actually a body, Alex only took this up,

206
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,120
 because I can't remember what it's called, which

207
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,200
 is responsible for the official non-oncature

208
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,840
 of everything in the solar system.

209
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,680
 And it has these most specific rules

210
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
 that everything has to be called.

211
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,880
 It's called like the internet.

212
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,360
 It's a branch of NASA.

213
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,520
 So for instance, one of its rules

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,200
 is that Martian craters that measure less than 60 kilometers

215
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,880
 in diameter have to be named after villages of the world

216
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,160
 with a population smaller than 100,000 people.

217
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
 So they have to-- so like, tooting.

218
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,440
 There's a critical tooting, because--

219
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,120
 It is, though.

220
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,280
 Yeah, there it is.

221
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
 It's so pleasing.

222
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,440
 And the other one, and this is, I think,

223
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
 was a headline that James saw when he came

224
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,280
 onto my computer at it, is there

225
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,840
 is to be no penis on Venus.

226
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,200
 This is-- this is your excuse.

227
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,440
 I saw there is no penis on Venus.

228
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,560
 And now you'll make it up a story.

229
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,960
 And I was hopefully googling in case there was.

230
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,120
 You taste.

231
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,360
 I've been through that.

232
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,200
 That's nothing.

233
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,920
 That's me.

234
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,000
 [LAUGHTER]

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
 Oh, guys.

236
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,440
 Better from Mars.

237
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,000
 Better from Mars.

238
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
 Women are probably Venus.

239
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,480
 And yet there's no like only male or Mars.

240
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,880
 So you're not allowed to call anything on Venus

241
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,640
 after anything male.

242
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,440
 So everything on Venus.

243
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,000
 And either the real thing or everything.

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,400
 Or the craters or the mountains.

245
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,640
 Because Venus is--

246
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,240
 I don't know.

247
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,800
 Oh, because Venus was female.

248
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,280
 Venus is female.

249
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,760
 Except this was only introduced in the early '70s.

250
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,520
 And before that, they had named the highest mountain.

251
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
 Malpidus.

252
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,360
 [LAUGHTER]

253
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,960
 Which is called Maxwell Montaise, named

254
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
 after a male physicist.

255
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 But so he's sitting there on Venus, the only guy

256
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,200
 who has mountains surrounded by thousands

257
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,280
 and thousands of women.

258
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,640
 And you can't do anything about it.

259
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,880
 Because he's a mountain.

260
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
 That's why he's known that as brilliant.

261
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,400
 That is amazing.

262
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,960
 Alpha ladies for the L series.

263
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
 Albinadies.

264
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
 Yeah.

265
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,520
 That's a hell of a lot of masters.

266
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
 Yeah.

267
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,000
 You know any man on Venus?

268
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,520
 Cool.

269
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,200
 OK, well, let's wrap up because we've got stuff to do.

270
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,240
 OK, before we go, I just got to say, if anyone wants

271
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,200
 to see the Collider exhibition, it's pretty good.

272
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,760
 Go down to the Science Museum.

273
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
 On until 6 May, it costs about 10 and so again.

274
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And I highly recommend it.

275
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,520
 And what do you get to see, is it?

276
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,960
 It's just lots of facts about how it works.

277
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,400
 And there's lots of interactive stuff.

278
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,920
 Yeah, and do us a favor.

279
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
 Bring a baguette.

280
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
 Leave it there.

281
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,920
 Take a photo of some baffle science.

282
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,760
 Let's try to work out how we got it there.

283
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,440
 OK, fact number two, Anna, this one's yours.

284
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
 Yeah.

285
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,920
 So, for the last month of his life, US President James Garfield ate

286
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,640
 everything through his anus.

287
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,960
 Big claim, Anna.

288
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,080
 I mean, we all get letters from a lot of people.

289
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
 Yeah.

290
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,080
 I mean, I wasn't there, but this is what the doctors tell me.

291
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,040
 No, so James Garfield was, as everyone obviously knows,

292
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,240
 shot in July 1881.

293
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
 And he lived for a further 80 days.

294
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
 He was shot in the small, in the like,

295
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,040
 small of his back and once in the arm.

296
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,680
 So doctors now say he would have been

297
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,480
 that our hospital about two or three days later.

298
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,720
 But obviously, because medicine was not as

299
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,000
 quite as effective as it is now in 1881,

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,680
 they just invited like dozens of doctors to his bedside

301
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,920
 who all prodded around trying to find this bullet.

302
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,600
 They didn't know where the bullet had gone in his body.

303
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
 So they gathered around, prodded about, made him worse and worse.

304
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,880
 He's stopped being able to eat.

305
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,920
 And obviously, if you stop being able to consume food in those days,

306
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,720
 they just shoved it up your ass.

307
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
 And so that's what they did.

308
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,320
 So does that work?

309
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,960
 It does not work, no.

310
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,920
 It was widely discredited in the '30s.

311
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,960
 I think you get about an eighth of the nutrition from some of the food.

312
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,800
 Oh, there's some food that you can't absorb at all.

313
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,600
 What I love is the list of foods that he was fed in this morning.

314
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 That's brilliant.

315
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
 Beef, we are.

316
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,800
 Egg yolks, milk, egg yolks.

317
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,000
 Egg yolks, wait a minute.

318
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,240
 So for the moment, guys, egg yolks was only true for a while.

319
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,960
 So I was reading the doctor at the time, his report on it.

320
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,080
 So yeah, he was fed egg yolks for a bit of time.

321
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,960
 And then all the surgeons complained that it was causing an annoying

322
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
 and offensive flitus.

323
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,560
 And so they ceased beating in the egg yolks.

324
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,720
 And the truth had to be.

325
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,840
 So they stopped it, because it was annoying then.

326
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,600
 Not the other way around.

327
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,320
 Guys, I'd be quite happy with my mouth.

328
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,360
 That's all I'd like for you guys.

329
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,520
 That's the thing as well.

330
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,000
 He wasn't shut in his mouth.

331
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,320
 That's not my--

332
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,160
 Because you and me have still one time.

333
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,600
 He could've still-- he could've still-- he could've just--

334
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,920
 He's still tall.

335
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,560
 Yeah, he's still tall.

336
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
 Yeah.

337
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
 The doctors were amazing.

338
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,520
 The main doctor in charge of saving it was called Dr. Willard Bliss,

339
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
 with two doctors.

340
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,160
 His first name was Dr. Willard Bliss.

341
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
 The doctor is really tragic.

342
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,080
 You should go on with the lit, because they're different.

343
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,440
 Yeah, what else is there?

344
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,680
 That's all I know about what he was fed in that time.

345
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,400
 I think maybe that was the only food they were

346
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,240
 at an intergrinding beef.

347
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,640
 But he was also given whisky and drops of opium

348
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
 and whisky--

349
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,480
 Whisky up his ass.

350
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,320
 Whisky up his ass?

351
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,360
 Yeah, because I mean, if you're in that sort of a state,

352
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,920
 I think at least you want a few drums.

353
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,120
 Yeah, it's terrible.

354
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,160
 He was such a talented man that his party

355
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,440
 was he could write Latin in one hand and greet

356
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,080
 with the other simultaneously.

357
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,600
 Wow.

358
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,280
 He campaigned for the presidency in more than one language.

359
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,800
 Wow.

360
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,720
 Sometimes he campaigned in English, some places

361
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
 he spoke in German.

362
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
 He was this eventually--

363
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,440
 No, I didn't.

364
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 I didn't think he did that.

365
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,240
 But he was president for four months.

366
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,760
 And then he was shocked.

367
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,000
 And then he lingered for another three months.

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,480
 It's like the matter of what?

369
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,520
 Like, you could write Greek with your left

370
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,800
 and land it with your right.

371
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,400
 In the fact, you could eat to your age.

372
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,240
 Well, forever, overshadowed.

373
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,160
 Trump's it all.

374
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,280
 I actually looked up-- because I knew Andy said earlier

375
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,880
 that you had a list of things that he ate.

376
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,120
 I thought it would be interesting to look up

377
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,360
 of what his favorite foods were.

378
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
 [LAUGHTER]

379
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,200
 So that--

380
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,760
 If I was there, I'd be like, I'm going

381
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,400
 to try and get you a sneaky dish on the side, you know?

382
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,160
 So his favorite food was squirrel soup.

383
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,660
 What?

384
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,160
 Yeah.

385
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,960
 Really?

386
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,280
 And actually, there was a guy called Crook.

387
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,040
 And he really wanted to cook squirrel soup for the president.

388
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,680
 They needed him to be a bit better.

389
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,440
 I think to the point where he was eating again with his mouth.

390
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,160
 That kind of good.

391
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,240
 And they were given permission to shoot squirrels

392
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,120
 on the grounds of the soldier's homes

393
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,680
 in order to get the squirrels in order to do it.

394
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,360
 And he loved milk.

395
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,160
 Really loved milk.

396
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,520
 And there was a company called the Adams Express Company

397
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,640
 from Baltimore.

398
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,520
 And they actually sent a cow to the White House

399
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,720
 so they could milk it every day so that he could get fresh milk

400
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,480
 while he was dying.

401
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,640
 Well, he was shocked.

402
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,040
 He was given milk in the manner we've described.

403
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
 Yeah.

404
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
 Yeah.

405
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,800
 Well, you were saying that Alexander Graham Bell

406
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,480
 was there while he was dying?

407
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
 Yes.

408
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,960
 So I mean, I initially thought about phrasing this fact.

409
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,880
 As Alexander Graham Bell actually killed President James

410
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,760
 Garfield, and then I felt like there might be lawsuits

411
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,720
 from his family.

412
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,240
 But because they'd lost the bullet and because in his body

413
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,400
 and because, coincidentally, Alexander Graham Bell

414
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,280
 had been developing the metal detector at the time,

415
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,720
 they invited him along.

416
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,760
 And he tried to find the bullet in his body.

417
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,880
 But failed on account of the fact that he was on a bed,

418
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,800
 whether on a metal bedsprings, and so

419
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,120
 they obviously thought he'd been machine-guned.

420
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
 [LAUGHTER]

421
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,360
 [INAUDIBLE]

422
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,520
 They're everywhere.

423
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
 There's something I can do.

424
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
 It's just incredible that--

425
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,320
 I mean, the genius of inventing a metal detector

426
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,000
 and they're not thinking to remove the massive source

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,840
 of metal, and they think, I'm not incredible.

428
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,080
 I think you imagined, like, quietly Alexander Graham Bell

429
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,600
 was like, I think the president is a robot.

430
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,720
 [LAUGHTER]

431
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
 That would have been his discovery, OK?

432
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,400
 I'm not sure if James Garfield was a robot.

433
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,760
 He might have been a sea cucumber,

434
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,240
 because they actually do eat through the renaces.

435
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,720
 Do they?

436
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,640
 Yeah.

437
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,960
 They found this out quite recently,

438
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,440
 because you know that they breathe through the renaces.

439
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,160
 They pull water in and then push it out

440
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,680
 and the oxygenated water helps them to breathe.

441
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,240
 And they thought, well, maybe they take in food there as well.

442
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,680
 And they found out that they have a gut in the middle

443
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
 and they eat through the mouth and through the renaces.

444
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,480
 So it comes in from both sides.

445
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
 That's pretty cool, isn't it?

446
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,000
 That is cool.

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,040
 It's amazing.

448
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,800
 Yeah.

449
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,240
 And can they taste it?

450
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,320
 Do they have taste buds in the renaces, do you think?

451
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,040
 I don't know if they have taste buds in the renaces.

452
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,720
 Well, James, you found out what else you can taste with,

453
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,400
 didn't you?

454
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,720
 Oh, yeah.

455
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,560
 You can taste with your testicles.

456
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,800
 Well, well, here's the thing.

457
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
 You have taste receptors in your testicles.

458
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
 No one's quite sure what they're for.

459
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,680
 But you also have smell receptors in your lungs.

460
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,400
 And the reason we do know why they're there,

461
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,480
 because if you get a really terrible smell

462
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,920
 and your receptors in your lungs can smell it,

463
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,520
 then it'll close up your esophagus

464
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,000
 and stop anything poisonous from going into your body.

465
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,640
 But as far as I know, no one's found out yet

466
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,960
 why we have taste receptors in their testicles.

467
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,120
 Maybe someone will tweet me at egg shapes

468
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,720
 if you know why we can taste with our testicles.

469
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

470
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,200
 Let's move on to fact three.

471
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,560
 That is James, your facts.

472
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,480
 So my fact is, in 2013, six people in the US

473
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,080
 named their child Mushroom.

474
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,080
 [LAUGHTER]

475
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,640
 I mean, I just love that.

476
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,800
 I love the kind of thing which we do on QI,

477
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,720
 which you sometimes just get a load of data

478
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,320
 and mine through it for the funny bits,

479
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,760
 which is where this came from, which

480
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,240
 is a big list of all the baby names in the American Mushroom.

481
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,960
 I mean, it's what would possess you to--

482
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,520
 I think this one's quite nice.

483
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,960
 It does sound cool actually.

484
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,000
 Mushroom. Mushroom.

485
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,960
 Hey, mushroom.

486
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,120
 It's sort of--

487
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,640
 Shroom for sure.

488
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,560
 Is that any fungus?

489
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,880
 Fungus doesn't sound nice.

490
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,400
 Fungus.

491
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,120
 Because I like that.

492
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,040
 I think it's weird, because I have a mild mushroom phobia.

493
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,520
 I think I know how to do.

494
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,200
 Yeah, I find them like very disgusting things.

495
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,120
 What the hell are you talking about, James?

496
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,640
 It's just the way that they reproduced with spars

497
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,240
 and they grow at dead things and stuff.

498
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,840
 I just find--

499
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,760
 I think a lot of people don't.

500
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,920
 Yeah, don't like mushrooms.

501
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,120
 There's something dead about them.

502
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
 Yeah.

503
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,560
 And it's a weird one that you--

504
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,160
 I find-- because my friend hates mushrooms as well.

505
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,000
 And if I have a pizza with them, we have to remove them.

506
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,520
 Yeah.

507
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,120
 Well, you know him, Ash, who did the theme tune for our show,

508
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,480
 and pre-S.

509
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,040
 But you kind of have to respect a hatred of mushroom or a feared

510
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,800
 mushroom in the same way you respect someone's religious beliefs.

511
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,400
 [LAUGHTER]

512
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,280
 I really feel like someone doesn't like mushrooms.

513
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,080
 I really have to be like, oh, OK, I appreciate them.

514
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,160
 I will remove it from any of the foods

515
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,520
 that we will have in this house from here on in.

516
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,320
 Yeah, it's true.

517
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,600
 Mushrooms are really hateful.

518
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,760
 Yeah, they've paid it with a passion.

519
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
 Oh, really?

520
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,920
 It's a bit like vegetarianism because you're

521
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,240
 excluding an entire area of the mushrooms in their own kingdom.

522
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
 Yeah, yeah.

523
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,520
 And the mushrooms are a kingdom, aren't they?

524
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,200
 Yeah, fungi are a kingdom in the same way

525
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,560
 that animals and plants are.

526
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,080
 But if you think actually mushrooms are more closely

527
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,560
 related to animals than they are to plants, are they?

528
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,400
 Yeah, no.

529
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,520
 Yeah, that's true.

530
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,320
 How?

531
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,200
 How?

532
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
 As in they bread and stuff.

533
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,800
 What animal-like activities do they take part in?

534
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,520
 Do you get packs of mushrooms hunting and are they?

535
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,960
 [LAUGHTER]

536
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,480
 The mushroom approaches it's really.

537
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,520
 Really slowly.

538
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 Yeah.

539
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,360
 [LAUGHTER]

540
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,080
 I love names.

541
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,600
 I'm obsessed with--

542
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,720
 because I always find them, particularly in pop culture.

543
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,240
 I mean, it's definitely been the rise of the celebrity world

544
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,760
 that suddenly--

545
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,440
 it's like celebrities are going, I've

546
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,760
 called my child mushroom.

547
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,960
 What are you going to do about it?

548
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,240
 I'm going to say, oh, nothing.

549
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,440
 Good, catch you later.

550
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,160
 We'll do the same.

551
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,240
 Jazee's out.

552
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,600
 Yeah.

553
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,920
 Because my two favorite ones from recent times

554
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
 are, "Dramane Jackson of the Jackson 5"

555
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:06,040
 has changed his surname from Jackson to Jackson.

556
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,000
 And so he's taken the apostrophe now.

557
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,360
 No, so instead of Jackson with an "o" end at the end,

558
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,760
 it's "u" end.

559
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,120
 So it's Jackson.

560
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,320
 Because he doesn't want to be associated anymore

561
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,960
 with the Jackson brand.

562
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

563
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,480
 And he held a press conference because he

564
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,600
 was talking about his new album.

565
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,000
 And he announced it as press conference.

566
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,120
 He said, by the way, I have changed my name from here on in.

567
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,320
 I want to be now known as "Dramane Jackson," not "Dramane Jackson."

568
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,480
 And so they asked him, why have you done this?

569
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,760
 And he said, I don't want to talk about it.

570
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,640
 [LAUGHTER]

571
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,560
 So we don't know his actual proper reasonings that everyone

572
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,600
 just thinks that he wants to get away from it.

573
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,480
 I have this big list of American people's names,

574
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,440
 like baby names from 2013.

575
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,440
 And these are all male children with five people named

576
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,560
 these names in America.

577
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,120
 So Vader, Darth Vader, that's a good name as well.

578
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,440
 And also Vader was a WWF wrestler.

579
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,080
 Oh, of course.

580
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,560
 Yeah.

581
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,440
 Is there anyone called Darth Vader?

582
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,840
 Darth Vader?

583
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,240
 Just accidentally.

584
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,040
 No, no, no, no.

585
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
 No, no, no, no, with a G.

586
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,040
 [LAUGHTER]

587
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,360
 Don't have what happens all the time.

588
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,600
 [LAUGHTER]

589
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,480
 Anyway, because I just pick up my asthma bottle.

590
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,960
 [LAUGHTER]

591
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,440
 Sorry, Vader.

592
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,040
 Yeah, so five boys called Vader.

593
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,560
 Five boys called Kestrel, which is quite a nice name.

594
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,880
 Yeah, Kestrel is good.

595
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,640
 Five boys named Lucifer, not as nice.

596
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
 That's an odd one, yeah, not as nice.

597
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,200
 It means light bearing.

598
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,720
 I mean, they could have said that he started out well.

599
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,200
 He was an angel to start.

600
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
 That is weird.

601
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
 Five boys called Sophie.

602
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 [LAUGHTER]

603
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,280
 And also Romance and Naomi.

604
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
 They were boys with those names.

605
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
 Oh.

606
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,600
 Oh, man.

607
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,960
 Romance is quite unfair.

608
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
 This is very nice.

609
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,160
 Obama's mum.

610
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,360
 Do you know what her name was?

611
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,080
 No.

612
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,480
 This really shocked me when I read this.

613
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,800
 I was reading his autobiography.

614
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,160
 And because remember the time when he was initially

615
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,200
 being nominated, everyone went on about his name.

616
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,320
 Like, there's a big thing his name.

617
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,240
 And so I'm surprised no one picked up on this.

618
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,280
 His mother's first name was Stanley.

619
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,880
 Stanley Obama, she was called Stand the Man at School.

620
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
 [LAUGHTER]

621
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
 Actually, in the older days, obviously,

622
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,440
 names sometimes do change sex.

623
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,560
 So I looked at the 1880 census.

624
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,640
 And there were 13 girls in America called Frank.

625
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,320
 Is it true?

626
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,560
 Oh, one of them.

627
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
 Ruth Felt.

628
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,400
 Oh, was it Ruth Felt?

629
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,520
 I had an aunt called Frank.

630
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,240
 One of the American presidents had an aunt called Frank.

631
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,080
 There were also 14 Sessels and 46 John's, the one of our female.

632
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,440
 And in last year in America, there were 31 Johans.

633
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
 Because, like, did you want to spell John's name?

634
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,080
 Oh, I want to spell John's name.

635
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
 It's a tough word.

636
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,600
 Yeah.

637
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,160
 Also, there were 1,436 people called Israel.

638
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,880
 And 64 called Israel.

639
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,680
 Israel.

640
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,920
 Israel, man.

641
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,680
 I also-- I love people who have a name that kind of means

642
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,400
 that you can do a lot with it, like Mike Love of the Beach Boys.

643
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,880
 So Love, being his surname, he's obviously gone great.

644
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
 I can put Love onto everything.

645
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,240
 So he's got four unreleased albums.

646
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,840
 They're really bad.

647
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,960
 So the first album was called First Love.

648
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,520
 Second album was called Second Love.

649
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,240
 Country Love.

650
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,760
 Oh, nice.

651
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,520
 He missed a trick there.

652
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,120
 Then there was Looking Back with Love.

653
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,280
 This is great.

654
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,400
 That one was released.

655
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,160
 That one made it.

656
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,960
 So the third unreleased one was Unleash the Love.

657
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,200
 And then this is the best one at all.

658
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,400
 His fourth unreleased album.

659
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,600
 Anyone have a bash?

660
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,040
 What pun times will he like?

661
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,440
 Love hurts.

662
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,400
 Oh, that's good.

663
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,240
 Yeah.

664
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,440
 15 Love.

665
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,600
 Oh, nice.

666
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,960
 No, Andy.

667
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,320
 The power of Love?

668
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,400
 That's good, but no.

669
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,240
 Where is the Love?

670
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,320
 We're just naming other songs.

671
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
 They can't still love the songs we love.

672
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,480
 OK, it was Mike Love, not War.

673
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,720
 I love War.

674
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,160
 We know someone called Diamond Love, don't we?

675
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,600
 We do know Diamond Love, that's very good.

676
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,000
 Oh, and you had your friends dad.

677
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,440
 That's-- I love this one.

678
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,640
 OK, yeah.

679
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,560
 So this is Jenny Ryan, who's done a lot of work on QI.

680
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,840
 Ryan The Past.

681
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,280
 And her stepfather, I think, is called--

682
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,880
 he was called James Brown.

683
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,400
 And he got so annoyed with people making jokes about him

684
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,720
 that he changed his name to Dan Brown.

685
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,080
 And then became the most famous author of all time.

686
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,200
 That's so good.

687
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,880
 I love that one.

688
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
 That's great.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

690
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,000
 Fact number four.

691
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,520
 OK, fact number four is--

692
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,000
 I was talking to this historian the other day on Twitter.

693
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,160
 Because I don't know if you saw on Friday last week on Twitter.

694
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,920
 It just went nuts with people.

695
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,880
 Historians talking about Alfred the Great bones being found.

696
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,600
 Because we haven't found many monarchs, right?

697
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,360
 Generally.

698
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,880
 Yeah.

699
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,400
 Well, we famously found Richard III.

700
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,960
 Richard III about two years ago.

701
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,360
 And so they're really excited because they dug up an area

702
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,120
 where they saw Alfred the Great was meant to be buried.

703
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,920
 Turns out he wasn't buried there.

704
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,440
 And then they went to a museum storage

705
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,560
 where they had a bunch of other bones

706
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,000
 that they assumed to be animal bones.

707
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,800
 And they found his pelvis bone now.

708
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,720
 So we have Alfred the Great's pelvis bone.

709
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,320
 Or do we?

710
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,560
 They don't quite know.

711
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,600
 Where's the rest of him, if we're not sure about him?

712
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,520
 We're not sure, but we have a pelvis bone, which feels just

713
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,800
 really like-- you know all those classic Jesus's grandmother's

714
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,440
 head and all those relics of the past.

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,280
 or whatever, you can give it to them.

720
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,840
 And they'll tell you what it is.

721
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,960
 And it's usually people who find what they think

722
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,280
 is like jelly from space or cryptozoology things.

723
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,400
 Jelly from space.

724
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,280
 Yeah, yeah.

725
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,040
 Well, it's what people think, you know.

726
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,240
 What is it, though?

727
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,280
 OK, that wasn't my fight, but the jelly from space

728
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,080
 is whenever there is a meter, right?

729
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,720
 People seem to find this jelly on the floor.

730
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,760
 And there's been for hundreds of years,

731
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,760
 people have thought that the two are to do with each other.

732
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,260
 Yeah.

733
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,860
 Nobody knows what it's from, it's called Star Jelly.

734
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,060
 And nobody really knows what it is, there's lots of theories.

735
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,460
 There's jelly that we don't know what it is.

736
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,980
 I think, yeah.

737
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,740
 I've heard of Star Jelly, but I've never researched what it is.

738
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,580
 You know about this mysterious jelly

739
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,020
 that I've heard about in my thought, well, I'll just leave that be.

740
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,100
 I'm sure a team worker can be curious about everything.

741
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,140
 OK, so as well as getting weird jelly,

742
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,620
 they also get what people think are dragon heads.

743
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,420
 And whenever they find a dragon head,

744
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,540
 it is usually the pelvis of a seabird like a puffin.

745
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,100
 Because apparently a puffin's pelvis looks like a dragon's head.

746
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,940
 That's great.

747
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,660
 So that's my pelvis for all claims of dragon heads

748
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,940
 turn out to be pelvis.

749
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,740
 Yeah, the ones that these guys get, yeah.

750
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,020
 Because do you know that this thing about--

751
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,500
 you find people thought that you would have one-eyed monsters.

752
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,540
 So they're like, what do you call these monsters with one eye?

753
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,160
 Psychologists.

754
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,660
 Yeah.

755
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,440
 And the theory is that what they actually

756
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,720
 did was they would find the skulls of elephants.

757
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,800
 And were the elephant skulls, actually.

758
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,600
 They would look like they have a big hole in the middle,

759
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,320
 like it would be one eye hole.

760
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,560
 And that's where the theory sometimes goes wrong.

761
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,800
 Well, the best thing that you've told me

762
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,960
 that I've been telling everyone for the past two weeks

763
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,560
 is that the majority of sightings photos taken of semonsters

764
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,840
 turn out not to be semonsters, but in most cases,

765
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,920
 the penises of gray whales.

766
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,200
 Because they mate at the surface.

767
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,200
 So these giant whales, they always mate at the surface.

768
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,640
 And they always mate in three-sums, two males and a female,

769
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
 which means that there's always one spare penis

770
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,320
 floating around the surface.

771
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,920
 And it's sticking out of the top of the wall.

772
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,440
 Yeah, if people Google this, if you're at home listening

773
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,000
 and you Google gray whale penis, you will see it.

774
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,840
 And it doesn't.

775
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,440
 It does.

776
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,280
 I can't believe it.

777
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
 That's very important.

778
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,960
 But it's very true.

779
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,480
 I've looked at it.

780
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,320
 And the majority of the photos that you will see

781
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,960
 of people claiming to have caught a semonster in camera,

782
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,600
 they just-- they have it.

783
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,880
 But anyway, so on Twitter, when I was talking

784
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,840
 to Greg Jenner, Francesca Stavracapolo, all these historians,

785
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,320
 they started off by going, wow, Alfred the Great,

786
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,720
 an interesting find potentially.

787
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,280
 And then they're all now saying not so much an interesting find.

788
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,440
 Like it probably will turn out not to be.

789
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,200
 But it got me-- I just wanted to look into it

790
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,520
 because I didn't know much about it.

791
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,840
 And it led me to the story of how Richard III's bones

792
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,160
 were found recently.

793
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,280
 Yeah, so they were found in a car park in Lester.

794
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,880
 They were found in a car park in Lester.

795
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,240
 So what I didn't know, we all know that exactly.

796
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,360
 It was a very big find.

797
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,640
 What I didn't know is the person who found it,

798
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,440
 Philip Alangley.

799
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,600
 Does anyone here know about Philip Alangley?

800
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,640
 So you do change, Anna?

801
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,360
 Do you know that?

802
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,880
 OK.

803
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,440
 What would you assume the person who found Richard III's bones

804
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,200
 does for a profound--

805
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,880
 You assume she was an archaeologist, although--

806
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,720
 I have read something about her that tells me she's not,

807
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,160
 and I was like, I assume you wouldn't ask me if she were.

808
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,120
 You're like--

809
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
 I'm sure I'm going to be a archaeologist.

810
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,840
 Yeah, so she's not an archaeologist.

811
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,680
 She's a screenwriter.

812
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,800
 She's been writing for the last seven years, a story

813
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,520
 of script about Richard III, and she got involved in research.

814
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
 And so she started going to all the places

815
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,280
 where potentially Richard III was supposed to be buried.

816
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,320
 She went to Lester, and she went to a spot

817
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
 where it was a loose end.

818
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,440
 It didn't look like where they said he might be buried,

819
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,960
 where he was.

820
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,600
 And as she was leaving from effectively a disappointing trip,

821
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
 another one over the course of seven years,

822
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,280
 she saw a car park on the side and got an uncontrollable urge

823
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,520
 to go inside.

824
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,080
 So she went into the car park, and she was like,

825
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,320
 I feel like the king is here.

826
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,000
 But she left it.

827
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,520
 She went off.

828
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,400
 She came back a year later.

829
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,440
 She felt the same urge, and she saw on the ground

830
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,560
 a gigantic r handwriting, because the huge r on the floor.

831
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,520
 And she said, that's where he's buried.

832
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,560
 Now, the r is a painted r for reserved on a car park.

833
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,120
 Oh, she's not a crazy person.

834
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,040
 Yeah, so she said it's here.

835
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,000
 No one believed her.

836
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 She raised 34,000 pounds for them to dig it up.

837
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,800
 She got channeled forward to come and film it.

838
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,720
 And they dug in the spot, a rich of the third was there.

839
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,800
 And it was a psychic.

840
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,320
 What was the word that I said to you earlier?

841
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
 A pre-sentiment.

842
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,640
 A psychic pre-sentiment.

843
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
 She just went, this is where he is.

844
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,040
 But what you don't know is that she's actually

845
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,240
 be going all over the country digging up holes for 20 years.

846
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,120
 Exactly.

847
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,240
 And he's saying that in our heart.

848
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,920
 Every part of you, so good.

849
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,440
 Does that mean, Dan, that you believe that psychic?

850
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,240
 No, not at all.

851
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,440
 I just think that's one of the most wonderful--

852
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,880
 that story could not get any better.

853
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,720
 A giant R, like an X marks the spot, but the initial of the king.

854
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,920
 You know that the Ministry of Defense spent 20,000 pounds

855
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,360
 trying to prove that ESP existed.

856
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,840
 Only even in the last 20 years, they did that.

857
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,320
 Really?

858
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,840
 Yes.

859
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,160
 Why are they trying to prove that?

860
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,880
 Well, I always think the reason they do it

861
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,200
 is because they think if it does, we want to be first.

862
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,680
 And they think the Russians are probably going into this.

863
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,520
 So is everyone else.

864
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,920
 We might as well have a go at it.

865
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,040
 I could have told them that it didn't.

866
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,920
 In fact, I tried to tell them really hard.

867
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,120
 [LAUGHTER]

868
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,280
 What was strange when they found Richard III,

869
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,440
 I thought, is we'd actually run on QI a few years ago

870
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,680
 whether Richard had a hunchback.

871
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,640
 And we said he didn't.

872
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,720
 It was all made up by Shakespeare and people

873
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,120
 who wanted to deface him after his death.

874
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,440
 But then when they found him, they

875
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,600
 found that he did have like an arch to his--

876
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,800
 Yes, an S-shaped spine, as what they said.

877
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,880
 But no, I just find that fascinating,

878
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,800
 because I love it when things are found by people

879
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,960
 who shouldn't be finding the thing in question.

880
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,640
 But convinced they're going to find it.

881
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,960
 I mean, that's the only instance.

882
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,760
 Is it maybe something to do with the fact

883
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,840
 that just like you usually do dig up ground,

884
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,760
 like either it's agricultural ground, so you dig it up,

885
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
 or you're like putting buildings into your dig it up.

886
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,920
 So car parks don't really need to foundation.

887
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,440
 So they're just things that haven't been discovered yet.

888
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,040
 Not sure.

889
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,640
 Because yeah, there are quite a lot of discoveries.

890
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,040
 In fact, I think we should ask at some point the question,

891
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,800
 what vital archaeological discovery was made

892
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,320
 under a car park in Leicester last year?

893
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,960
 I'm going to say that was the body of Rich of the Third last year.

894
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,000
 Oh, James, you fell right into the--

895
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,160
 No, no, no, no.

896
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,600
 Last year, yeah.

897
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
 Last year.

898
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,600
 No, no, I did.

899
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,880
 Yeah, another car park in Leicester.

900
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,040
 Same team who dug up the Rich of the Third

901
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,680
 after psychic women pointed them the right direction.

902
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,880
 I dug up this ancient Roman cemetery,

903
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,320
 which like revealed a whole bunch of stuff

904
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,920
 about how Romans used to bury pagans and religious people

905
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
 and Christians together and--

906
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,040
 Yeah, just revealed this.

907
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,200
 No, the car park, Leicester.

908
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,360
 Why don't we just dig up all the car parks in Leicester?

909
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,800
 Yeah, so under that one, that Romans.

910
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,040
 Dig up the helicopter zoo and find King Harrel.

911
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:56,080
 Cool, so that's our show.

912
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,640
