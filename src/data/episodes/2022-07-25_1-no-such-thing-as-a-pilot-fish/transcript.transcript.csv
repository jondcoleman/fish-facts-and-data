00:00:00,00:00:02,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,You did no such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:11,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:28,Hello and welcome to the pilot episode of No Such Thing as a Fish
00:00:28,00:00:32,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:32,00:00:33,My name is Dan.
00:00:33,00:00:37,"I'm sitting with three other QI elves, James, Andy, and Anna."
00:00:37,00:00:39,And each week we're going to get around this microphone
00:00:39,00:00:43,and share our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:43,00:00:45,"So in no particular order, here are the best things"
00:00:45,00:00:46,we found out this week.
00:00:46,00:00:53,"OK, let's start with fact number one that"
00:00:53,00:00:55,"comes from you, James."
00:00:55,00:00:59,"I went this weekend to the Collider Exhibition,"
00:00:59,00:01:02,the Large Hadron Collider Exhibition at the Science Museum.
00:01:02,00:01:03,OK.
00:01:03,00:01:05,And I got fat there.
00:01:05,00:01:09,The Large Hadron Collider was almost turned off.
00:01:09,00:01:11,"I think it was turned off for a short amount of time,"
00:01:11,00:01:12,for what reason?
00:01:12,00:01:13,What do you think?
00:01:13,00:01:16,Because the rewiring needed maintenance.
00:01:16,00:01:17,We're good maintenance.
00:01:17,00:01:19,And it's a lot more low-fi than that.
00:01:19,00:01:22,Apparently they found a piece of baguette in the machinery.
00:01:22,00:01:24,And it made the temperature go up by seven degrees
00:01:24,00:01:26,and they had to turn the whole thing off
00:01:26,00:01:27,before they found the baguette.
00:01:27,00:01:30,"If you work with a friend, this will happen."
00:01:30,00:01:34,I've always thrown my baguette into the machine.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"You're actually a pest, sorry."
00:01:36,00:01:38,But what they actually think happened
00:01:38,00:01:42,is that a bird somehow dropped it into an event
00:01:42,00:01:42,or something like that.
00:01:42,00:01:44,And it was found there.
00:01:44,00:01:46,But some of the physicists who were there at the time
00:01:46,00:01:49,actually thought that maybe it was a time-traveling bird
00:01:49,00:01:52,sent from the future to ask about the experiment.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"Well, he's just pretty cool."
00:01:54,00:01:57,Maybe the worst thing I've ever made to seek for ever.
00:01:57,00:01:59,"Or when they first saw the baguette, they're like,"
00:01:59,00:02:02,"""Whoa, the Higgs boson is way bigger than that."""
00:02:02,00:02:04,Found it!
00:02:04,00:02:05,"Yeah, it's here."
00:02:05,00:02:07,It's all bread-like.
00:02:07,00:02:08,That's why they turned it off.
00:02:08,00:02:09,Job done.
00:02:09,00:02:10,The Higgs baguette is--
00:02:10,00:02:14,The Higgs boson is covered in tuna mayonnaise.
00:02:14,00:02:17,Surely someone's marketing a Higgs baguette now in Paris.
00:02:17,00:02:18,But there it was.
00:02:18,00:02:22,There was a guy who wasn't there who broke into CERN.
00:02:22,00:02:23,He broke in.
00:02:23,00:02:25,His name was--
00:02:25,00:02:25,"How would you say this, Andy?"
00:02:25,00:02:27,Eloy?
00:02:27,00:02:27,Eloy?
00:02:27,00:02:29,Eloy at Cole.
00:02:29,00:02:30,Strangely dressed match.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"Man, he said that he traveled back in time"
00:02:33,00:02:36,to prevent the LHC from destroying the world.
00:02:36,00:02:38,So they've had a number of time-traveling--
00:02:38,00:02:41,"Yeah, well, that was one theory that the reason we hadn't had"
00:02:41,00:02:43,time-travelers yet was we hadn't invented the Large Hadron
00:02:43,00:02:45,"Collider, which would presumably then"
00:02:45,00:02:49,be the machine that would get them back.
00:02:49,00:02:51,So you can't have time-travelers until you build the machine.
00:02:51,00:02:53,So that's why we haven't had them in the past.
00:02:53,00:02:55,"Well, here's the final sentence of this story."
00:02:55,00:02:58,"Mr. Cole, as his name was, was taken"
00:02:58,00:03:00,"to a secure mental health facility in Geneva,"
00:03:00,00:03:01,but later disappeared from his cell.
00:03:01,00:03:04,"Police are battled, but not that bothered."
00:03:04,00:03:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:06,00:03:06,What a second.
00:03:06,00:03:09,I should point out that Dad is on David Aikdog.
00:03:09,00:03:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:10,00:03:12,"Because I just googled it, and that's the first thing"
00:03:12,00:03:13,"that came on, but this is the talkboards."
00:03:13,00:03:16,It looks like they've lifted this from Crave Docks.
00:03:16,00:03:17,OK.
00:03:17,00:03:17,Good.
00:03:17,00:03:19,"I don't know if that's any more reputable,"
00:03:19,00:03:19,but--
00:03:19,00:03:22,Because there was a bit of worry at the time
00:03:22,00:03:24,"that the whole universe was going to end, wasn't there?"
00:03:24,00:03:25,Yeah.
00:03:25,00:03:26,They thought that--
00:03:26,00:03:27,because what they were actually doing
00:03:27,00:03:30,"was making very, very, very tiny black holes."
00:03:30,00:03:32,"And I think in people's minds, they thought,"
00:03:32,00:03:33,"well, what if they get--"
00:03:33,00:03:34,What if they get bigger?
00:03:34,00:03:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:03:35,00:03:37,"But I think what had happened, I might be wrong about this,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,because I'm going off memory a little bit.
00:03:39,00:03:43,But I think this scientist said that there was a chance
00:03:43,00:03:47,"of the world ending, but it was something like 10,000 billion,"
00:03:47,00:03:51,"billion, billion, billion to one chance, which is pretty much"
00:03:51,00:03:54,the chance of the world ending anyway in that kind of time.
00:03:54,00:03:57,But I think they didn't help themselves by saying that.
00:03:57,00:04:00,And some old people here is what the world's going to end.
00:04:00,00:04:02,I think there was a big switch on day.
00:04:02,00:04:03,Do you remember?
00:04:03,00:04:06,It was when the machine was first used to be switched on.
00:04:06,00:04:08,And the BBC went to a wall-to-wall coverage
00:04:08,00:04:09,over-- I had to write about it for private eyes.
00:04:09,00:04:12,Everyone going crazy about it.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"And when it didn't work for another nine months,"
00:04:14,00:04:14,they couldn't switch.
00:04:14,00:04:15,"Oh, yeah, I remember that."
00:04:15,00:04:18,That was a slight problem in the world.
00:04:18,00:04:20,That's-- there was a story in the news this week
00:04:20,00:04:23,about the spaceship that had been--
00:04:23,00:04:25,"Oh, yeah, yeah, there's a lot like that."
00:04:25,00:04:26,Is it called Atticus?
00:04:26,00:04:27,Can you check what's the--
00:04:27,00:04:29,it's satellite that we sent up that's
00:04:29,00:04:32,been asleep for three years.
00:04:32,00:04:35,And we sort of sent an alarm on it to wake it up yesterday.
00:04:35,00:04:36,"That's it, yeah."
00:04:36,00:04:38,And so there was a big thing where they're all waiting.
00:04:38,00:04:41,And you could stream mission control in--
00:04:41,00:04:43,"was it Russia or maybe, I'm not sure what country it was,"
00:04:43,00:04:43,America?
00:04:43,00:04:45,"You could watch it, what do you mean?"
00:04:45,00:04:46,You could watch it.
00:04:46,00:04:47,You could watch the controller.
00:04:47,00:04:49,"They were waiting, because it was going to be switched on."
00:04:49,00:04:53,And there was an hour window where it didn't come on.
00:04:53,00:04:54,So they were waiting.
00:04:54,00:04:56,And then tension started getting high.
00:04:56,00:04:56,And then--
00:04:56,00:04:59,"Yeah, so it was actually-- it wasn't too long,"
00:04:59,00:05:02,"but yeah, so there was 10 minutes where it was late waking up."
00:05:02,00:05:04,And it happened to any signals back.
00:05:04,00:05:05,And then they started to get increasingly tense.
00:05:05,00:05:07,"And if you watch the video, which I now have,"
00:05:07,00:05:08,they suddenly start to panic.
00:05:08,00:05:09,And it all goes really silent.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"And then it was actually 18 minutes late waking up,"
00:05:11,00:05:13,because what they think happened
00:05:13,00:05:18,is somehow the satellite put its alarm on snooze.
00:05:18,00:05:21,And just postpone its wake up call for 18 minutes.
00:05:21,00:05:23,"And then-- which is fair enough, you know?"
00:05:23,00:05:25,"If you're going to think for three years,"
00:05:25,00:05:27,you can't be expected to just bounce out of there.
00:05:27,00:05:28,"I think it was Rosetta, wasn't it?"
00:05:28,00:05:29,"Rosetta, yeah."
00:05:29,00:05:30,"Rosetta, yes."
00:05:30,00:05:31,It's a silent--
00:05:31,00:05:33,"That's incredible, I'm trying."
00:05:33,00:05:36,"Has got an awesome solar system, in fact, how many?"
00:05:36,00:05:36,Yes.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"OK, no, this is going--"
00:05:38,00:05:39,"I know, you haven't heard this yet, so--"
00:05:39,00:05:40,"No, I haven't."
00:05:40,00:05:41,I'm prepared.
00:05:41,00:05:42,It's your turn.
00:05:42,00:05:44,"This has raised some controversy in the office,"
00:05:44,00:05:47,but let's go for it.
00:05:47,00:05:53,"In 2007, the largest object in the solar system"
00:05:53,00:05:56,"was-- what do you think, Anna?"
00:05:56,00:05:57,The sun.
00:05:57,00:06:03,"No, it was a comet called comet homes, which was--"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"the comet itself, the main body of it,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,is three kilometers across.
00:06:07,00:06:10,And it had this extraordinary explosion at the surface.
00:06:10,00:06:14,"And the corona of dust, they call it the comet coma,"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"is the name for it, was bigger than the sun."
00:06:17,00:06:19,It was 1.4 million kilometers.
00:06:19,00:06:24,"Out of here, it was 1.4 million kilometers across, I think."
00:06:24,00:06:26,And that all counted as part of the body of the comet.
00:06:26,00:06:28,"Yes, it was 1% of the total mass of the comet"
00:06:28,00:06:29,is a huge dust.
00:06:29,00:06:32,"Because the sun is emptier than we think it is,"
00:06:32,00:06:33,I think that was fair to say.
00:06:33,00:06:33,Who do you think?
00:06:33,00:06:36,"I mean, it depends on your definition of the sun, really,"
00:06:36,00:06:39,because there's an argument that the sun is actually
00:06:39,00:06:41,"the size of the solar system, because that's"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"as far as the solar, as you know, the--"
00:06:44,00:06:49,"As long as the solar wind goes all the way out to there,"
00:06:49,00:06:50,there's still articles from the sun
00:06:50,00:06:53,that are getting all the way out to Pluto and beyond.
00:06:53,00:06:56,So there is an argument that we all live inside the sun
00:06:56,00:06:57,at the moment.
00:06:57,00:07:01,"Yeah, well, that's true, then the comet thing is not."
00:07:01,00:07:04,"But if the sun is the size that everyone else says it is,"
00:07:04,00:07:05,it's a comet.
00:07:05,00:07:06,"It was bigger, briefly."
00:07:06,00:07:09,And nothing is only me who says that.
00:07:09,00:07:10,What's the comet called?
00:07:10,00:07:11,"Comet Holmes, as in show."
00:07:11,00:07:13,"Oh, a comet, OK."
00:07:13,00:07:15,Big boy.
00:07:15,00:07:16,"That's interesting, Salah."
00:07:16,00:07:18,"They're not just doing this for the naming, really."
00:07:18,00:07:19,That's what you would have called it.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"That's what I would have called it, I guess,"
00:07:20,00:07:21,is why I'm not a scientist.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"There's actually a body, Alex only took this up,"
00:07:23,00:07:25,"because I can't remember what it's called, which"
00:07:25,00:07:27,is responsible for the official non-oncature
00:07:27,00:07:28,of everything in the solar system.
00:07:28,00:07:30,And it has these most specific rules
00:07:30,00:07:31,that everything has to be called.
00:07:31,00:07:32,It's called like the internet.
00:07:32,00:07:34,It's a branch of NASA.
00:07:34,00:07:35,"So for instance, one of its rules"
00:07:35,00:07:39,is that Martian craters that measure less than 60 kilometers
00:07:39,00:07:42,in diameter have to be named after villages of the world
00:07:42,00:07:46,"with a population smaller than 100,000 people."
00:07:46,00:07:47,"So they have to-- so like, tooting."
00:07:47,00:07:49,"There's a critical tooting, because--"
00:07:49,00:07:50,"It is, though."
00:07:50,00:07:51,"Yeah, there it is."
00:07:51,00:07:52,It's so pleasing.
00:07:52,00:07:53,"And the other one, and this is, I think,"
00:07:53,00:07:55,was a headline that James saw when he came
00:07:55,00:07:57,"onto my computer at it, is there"
00:07:57,00:08:01,is to be no penis on Venus.
00:08:01,00:08:03,This is-- this is your excuse.
00:08:03,00:08:05,I saw there is no penis on Venus.
00:08:05,00:08:07,And now you'll make it up a story.
00:08:07,00:08:10,And I was hopefully googling in case there was.
00:08:10,00:08:12,You taste.
00:08:12,00:08:13,I've been through that.
00:08:13,00:08:14,That's nothing.
00:08:14,00:08:14,That's me.
00:08:14,00:08:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:18,00:08:19,"Oh, guys."
00:08:19,00:08:20,Better from Mars.
00:08:20,00:08:21,Better from Mars.
00:08:21,00:08:22,Women are probably Venus.
00:08:22,00:08:24,And yet there's no like only male or Mars.
00:08:24,00:08:26,So you're not allowed to call anything on Venus
00:08:26,00:08:27,after anything male.
00:08:27,00:08:28,So everything on Venus.
00:08:28,00:08:30,And either the real thing or everything.
00:08:30,00:08:32,Or the craters or the mountains.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Because Venus is--
00:08:33,00:08:34,I don't know.
00:08:34,00:08:35,"Oh, because Venus was female."
00:08:35,00:08:37,Venus is female.
00:08:37,00:08:39,Except this was only introduced in the early '70s.
00:08:39,00:08:42,"And before that, they had named the highest mountain."
00:08:42,00:08:43,Malpidus.
00:08:43,00:08:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:46,00:08:48,"Which is called Maxwell Montaise, named"
00:08:48,00:08:50,after a male physicist.
00:08:50,00:08:53,"But so he's sitting there on Venus, the only guy"
00:08:53,00:08:55,who has mountains surrounded by thousands
00:08:55,00:08:56,and thousands of women.
00:08:56,00:08:57,And you can't do anything about it.
00:08:57,00:08:58,Because he's a mountain.
00:08:58,00:09:00,That's why he's known that as brilliant.
00:09:00,00:09:01,That is amazing.
00:09:01,00:09:02,Alpha ladies for the L series.
00:09:02,00:09:03,Albinadies.
00:09:03,00:09:04,Yeah.
00:09:04,00:09:06,That's a hell of a lot of masters.
00:09:06,00:09:07,Yeah.
00:09:07,00:09:10,You know any man on Venus?
00:09:10,00:09:10,Cool.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"OK, well, let's wrap up because we've got stuff to do."
00:09:12,00:09:14,"OK, before we go, I just got to say, if anyone wants"
00:09:14,00:09:16,"to see the Collider exhibition, it's pretty good."
00:09:16,00:09:17,Go down to the Science Museum.
00:09:17,00:09:20,"On until 6 May, it costs about 10 and so again."
00:09:20,00:09:21,And I highly recommend it.
00:09:21,00:09:22,"And what do you get to see, is it?"
00:09:22,00:09:24,It's just lots of facts about how it works.
00:09:24,00:09:27,And there's lots of interactive stuff.
00:09:27,00:09:28,"Yeah, and do us a favor."
00:09:28,00:09:29,Bring a baguette.
00:09:29,00:09:30,Leave it there.
00:09:30,00:09:32,Take a photo of some baffle science.
00:09:32,00:09:35,Let's try to work out how we got it there.
00:09:35,00:09:41,"OK, fact number two, Anna, this one's yours."
00:09:41,00:09:42,Yeah.
00:09:42,00:09:46,"So, for the last month of his life, US President James Garfield ate"
00:09:46,00:09:48,everything through his anus.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"Big claim, Anna."
00:09:49,00:09:54,"I mean, we all get letters from a lot of people."
00:09:54,00:09:55,Yeah.
00:09:55,00:10:01,"I mean, I wasn't there, but this is what the doctors tell me."
00:10:01,00:10:04,"No, so James Garfield was, as everyone obviously knows,"
00:10:04,00:10:06,shot in July 1881.
00:10:06,00:10:08,And he lived for a further 80 days.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"He was shot in the small, in the like,"
00:10:10,00:10:12,small of his back and once in the arm.
00:10:12,00:10:13,So doctors now say he would have been
00:10:13,00:10:16,that our hospital about two or three days later.
00:10:16,00:10:19,"But obviously, because medicine was not as"
00:10:19,00:10:22,"quite as effective as it is now in 1881,"
00:10:22,00:10:24,they just invited like dozens of doctors to his bedside
00:10:24,00:10:26,who all prodded around trying to find this bullet.
00:10:26,00:10:29,They didn't know where the bullet had gone in his body.
00:10:29,00:10:32,"So they gathered around, prodded about, made him worse and worse."
00:10:32,00:10:33,He's stopped being able to eat.
00:10:33,00:10:36,"And obviously, if you stop being able to consume food in those days,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,they just shoved it up your ass.
00:10:38,00:10:39,And so that's what they did.
00:10:39,00:10:41,So does that work?
00:10:41,00:10:42,"It does not work, no."
00:10:42,00:10:44,It was widely discredited in the '30s.
00:10:44,00:10:48,I think you get about an eighth of the nutrition from some of the food.
00:10:48,00:10:51,"Oh, there's some food that you can't absorb at all."
00:10:51,00:10:55,What I love is the list of foods that he was fed in this morning.
00:10:55,00:10:56,That's brilliant.
00:10:56,00:10:58,"Beef, we are."
00:10:58,00:11:00,"Egg yolks, milk, egg yolks."
00:11:00,00:11:02,"Egg yolks, wait a minute."
00:11:02,00:11:05,"So for the moment, guys, egg yolks was only true for a while."
00:11:05,00:11:07,"So I was reading the doctor at the time, his report on it."
00:11:07,00:11:10,"So yeah, he was fed egg yolks for a bit of time."
00:11:10,00:11:12,And then all the surgeons complained that it was causing an annoying
00:11:12,00:11:14,and offensive flitus.
00:11:14,00:11:17,And so they ceased beating in the egg yolks.
00:11:17,00:11:18,And the truth had to be.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"So they stopped it, because it was annoying then."
00:11:21,00:11:24,Not the other way around.
00:11:24,00:11:30,"Guys, I'd be quite happy with my mouth."
00:11:30,00:11:32,That's all I'd like for you guys.
00:11:32,00:11:33,That's the thing as well.
00:11:33,00:11:36,He wasn't shut in his mouth.
00:11:36,00:11:37,That's not my--
00:11:37,00:11:39,Because you and me have still one time.
00:11:39,00:11:41,He could've still-- he could've still-- he could've just--
00:11:41,00:11:42,He's still tall.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"Yeah, he's still tall."
00:11:44,00:11:45,Yeah.
00:11:45,00:11:46,The doctors were amazing.
00:11:46,00:11:51,"The main doctor in charge of saving it was called Dr. Willard Bliss,"
00:11:51,00:11:52,with two doctors.
00:11:52,00:11:57,His first name was Dr. Willard Bliss.
00:11:57,00:11:59,The doctor is really tragic.
00:11:59,00:12:01,"You should go on with the lit, because they're different."
00:12:01,00:12:02,"Yeah, what else is there?"
00:12:02,00:12:05,That's all I know about what he was fed in that time.
00:12:05,00:12:07,I think maybe that was the only food they were
00:12:07,00:12:08,at an intergrinding beef.
00:12:08,00:12:11,But he was also given whisky and drops of opium
00:12:11,00:12:12,and whisky--
00:12:12,00:12:13,Whisky up his ass.
00:12:13,00:12:14,Whisky up his ass?
00:12:14,00:12:16,"Yeah, because I mean, if you're in that sort of a state,"
00:12:16,00:12:18,I think at least you want a few drums.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"Yeah, it's terrible."
00:12:20,00:12:22,He was such a talented man that his party
00:12:22,00:12:24,was he could write Latin in one hand and greet
00:12:24,00:12:26,with the other simultaneously.
00:12:26,00:12:26,Wow.
00:12:26,00:12:29,He campaigned for the presidency in more than one language.
00:12:29,00:12:29,Wow.
00:12:29,00:12:30,"Sometimes he campaigned in English, some places"
00:12:30,00:12:31,he spoke in German.
00:12:31,00:12:32,He was this eventually--
00:12:32,00:12:33,"No, I didn't."
00:12:33,00:12:34,I didn't think he did that.
00:12:34,00:12:36,But he was president for four months.
00:12:36,00:12:37,And then he was shocked.
00:12:37,00:12:40,And then he lingered for another three months.
00:12:40,00:12:41,It's like the matter of what?
00:12:41,00:12:43,"Like, you could write Greek with your left"
00:12:43,00:12:45,and land it with your right.
00:12:45,00:12:48,"In the fact, you could eat to your age."
00:12:48,00:12:50,"Well, forever, overshadowed."
00:12:50,00:12:51,Trump's it all.
00:12:51,00:12:56,I actually looked up-- because I knew Andy said earlier
00:12:56,00:12:58,that you had a list of things that he ate.
00:12:58,00:13:00,I thought it would be interesting to look up
00:13:00,00:13:01,of what his favorite foods were.
00:13:01,00:13:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:03,00:13:04,So that--
00:13:04,00:13:05,"If I was there, I'd be like, I'm going"
00:13:05,00:13:10,"to try and get you a sneaky dish on the side, you know?"
00:13:10,00:13:13,So his favorite food was squirrel soup.
00:13:13,00:13:13,What?
00:13:13,00:13:14,Yeah.
00:13:14,00:13:14,Really?
00:13:14,00:13:18,"And actually, there was a guy called Crook."
00:13:18,00:13:21,And he really wanted to cook squirrel soup for the president.
00:13:21,00:13:22,They needed him to be a bit better.
00:13:22,00:13:25,I think to the point where he was eating again with his mouth.
00:13:25,00:13:27,That kind of good.
00:13:27,00:13:29,And they were given permission to shoot squirrels
00:13:29,00:13:31,on the grounds of the soldier's homes
00:13:31,00:13:33,in order to get the squirrels in order to do it.
00:13:33,00:13:35,And he loved milk.
00:13:35,00:13:36,Really loved milk.
00:13:36,00:13:38,And there was a company called the Adams Express Company
00:13:38,00:13:39,from Baltimore.
00:13:39,00:13:42,And they actually sent a cow to the White House
00:13:42,00:13:45,so they could milk it every day so that he could get fresh milk
00:13:45,00:13:46,while he was dying.
00:13:46,00:13:47,"Well, he was shocked."
00:13:47,00:13:50,He was given milk in the manner we've described.
00:13:50,00:13:51,Yeah.
00:13:51,00:13:52,Yeah.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"Well, you were saying that Alexander Graham Bell"
00:13:54,00:13:56,was there while he was dying?
00:13:56,00:13:57,Yes.
00:13:57,00:13:59,"So I mean, I initially thought about phrasing this fact."
00:13:59,00:14:02,As Alexander Graham Bell actually killed President James
00:14:02,00:14:04,"Garfield, and then I felt like there might be lawsuits"
00:14:04,00:14:05,from his family.
00:14:05,00:14:09,But because they'd lost the bullet and because in his body
00:14:09,00:14:11,"and because, coincidentally, Alexander Graham Bell"
00:14:11,00:14:14,"had been developing the metal detector at the time,"
00:14:14,00:14:15,they invited him along.
00:14:15,00:14:18,And he tried to find the bullet in his body.
00:14:18,00:14:22,"But failed on account of the fact that he was on a bed,"
00:14:22,00:14:25,"whether on a metal bedsprings, and so"
00:14:25,00:14:28,they obviously thought he'd been machine-guned.
00:14:28,00:14:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:29,00:14:32,[INAUDIBLE]
00:14:32,00:14:33,They're everywhere.
00:14:33,00:14:34,There's something I can do.
00:14:34,00:14:36,It's just incredible that--
00:14:36,00:14:39,"I mean, the genius of inventing a metal detector"
00:14:39,00:14:42,and they're not thinking to remove the massive source
00:14:42,00:14:45,"of metal, and they think, I'm not incredible."
00:14:45,00:14:48,"I think you imagined, like, quietly Alexander Graham Bell"
00:14:48,00:14:51,"was like, I think the president is a robot."
00:14:51,00:14:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:52,00:14:54,"That would have been his discovery, OK?"
00:14:54,00:14:57,I'm not sure if James Garfield was a robot.
00:14:57,00:14:58,"He might have been a sea cucumber,"
00:14:58,00:15:01,because they actually do eat through the renaces.
00:15:01,00:15:01,Do they?
00:15:01,00:15:02,Yeah.
00:15:02,00:15:03,"They found this out quite recently,"
00:15:03,00:15:07,because you know that they breathe through the renaces.
00:15:07,00:15:10,They pull water in and then push it out
00:15:10,00:15:13,and the oxygenated water helps them to breathe.
00:15:13,00:15:17,"And they thought, well, maybe they take in food there as well."
00:15:17,00:15:19,And they found out that they have a gut in the middle
00:15:19,00:15:22,and they eat through the mouth and through the renaces.
00:15:22,00:15:24,So it comes in from both sides.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"That's pretty cool, isn't it?"
00:15:25,00:15:26,That is cool.
00:15:26,00:15:27,It's amazing.
00:15:27,00:15:27,Yeah.
00:15:27,00:15:29,And can they taste it?
00:15:29,00:15:31,"Do they have taste buds in the renaces, do you think?"
00:15:31,00:15:33,I don't know if they have taste buds in the renaces.
00:15:33,00:15:35,"Well, James, you found out what else you can taste with,"
00:15:35,00:15:36,didn't you?
00:15:36,00:15:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:36,00:15:38,You can taste with your testicles.
00:15:38,00:15:40,"Well, well, here's the thing."
00:15:40,00:15:43,You have taste receptors in your testicles.
00:15:43,00:15:45,No one's quite sure what they're for.
00:15:45,00:15:48,But you also have smell receptors in your lungs.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"And the reason we do know why they're there,"
00:15:50,00:15:53,because if you get a really terrible smell
00:15:53,00:15:56,"and your receptors in your lungs can smell it,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,then it'll close up your esophagus
00:15:58,00:16:01,and stop anything poisonous from going into your body.
00:16:01,00:16:03,"But as far as I know, no one's found out yet"
00:16:03,00:16:05,why we have taste receptors in their testicles.
00:16:05,00:16:08,Maybe someone will tweet me at egg shapes
00:16:08,00:16:10,if you know why we can taste with our testicles.
00:16:10,00:16:14,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:16:14,00:16:16,Let's move on to fact three.
00:16:16,00:16:18,"That is James, your facts."
00:16:18,00:16:22,"So my fact is, in 2013, six people in the US"
00:16:22,00:16:24,named their child Mushroom.
00:16:24,00:16:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:27,00:16:28,"I mean, I just love that."
00:16:28,00:16:30,"I love the kind of thing which we do on QI,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,which you sometimes just get a load of data
00:16:32,00:16:35,"and mine through it for the funny bits,"
00:16:35,00:16:36,"which is where this came from, which"
00:16:36,00:16:41,is a big list of all the baby names in the American Mushroom.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"I mean, it's what would possess you to--"
00:16:43,00:16:45,I think this one's quite nice.
00:16:45,00:16:46,It does sound cool actually.
00:16:46,00:16:48,Mushroom. Mushroom.
00:16:48,00:16:48,"Hey, mushroom."
00:16:48,00:16:50,It's sort of--
00:16:50,00:16:50,Shroom for sure.
00:16:50,00:16:51,Is that any fungus?
00:16:51,00:16:52,Fungus doesn't sound nice.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Fungus.
00:16:53,00:16:54,Because I like that.
00:16:54,00:16:57,"I think it's weird, because I have a mild mushroom phobia."
00:16:57,00:16:58,I think I know how to do.
00:16:58,00:17:01,"Yeah, I find them like very disgusting things."
00:17:01,00:17:05,"What the hell are you talking about, James?"
00:17:05,00:17:07,It's just the way that they reproduced with spars
00:17:07,00:17:09,and they grow at dead things and stuff.
00:17:09,00:17:09,I just find--
00:17:09,00:17:10,I think a lot of people don't.
00:17:10,00:17:11,"Yeah, don't like mushrooms."
00:17:11,00:17:13,There's something dead about them.
00:17:13,00:17:14,Yeah.
00:17:14,00:17:15,And it's a weird one that you--
00:17:15,00:17:18,I find-- because my friend hates mushrooms as well.
00:17:18,00:17:21,"And if I have a pizza with them, we have to remove them."
00:17:21,00:17:21,Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:25,"Well, you know him, Ash, who did the theme tune for our show,"
00:17:25,00:17:26,and pre-S.
00:17:26,00:17:31,But you kind of have to respect a hatred of mushroom or a feared
00:17:31,00:17:33,mushroom in the same way you respect someone's religious beliefs.
00:17:33,00:17:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:36,00:17:39,I really feel like someone doesn't like mushrooms.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"I really have to be like, oh, OK, I appreciate them."
00:17:42,00:17:45,I will remove it from any of the foods
00:17:45,00:17:47,that we will have in this house from here on in.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"Yeah, it's true."
00:17:48,00:17:49,Mushrooms are really hateful.
00:17:49,00:17:51,"Yeah, they've paid it with a passion."
00:17:51,00:17:52,"Oh, really?"
00:17:52,00:17:54,It's a bit like vegetarianism because you're
00:17:54,00:18:00,excluding an entire area of the mushrooms in their own kingdom.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:18:01,00:18:02,"And the mushrooms are a kingdom, aren't they?"
00:18:02,00:18:04,"Yeah, fungi are a kingdom in the same way"
00:18:04,00:18:05,that animals and plants are.
00:18:05,00:18:09,But if you think actually mushrooms are more closely
00:18:09,00:18:12,"related to animals than they are to plants, are they?"
00:18:12,00:18:13,"Yeah, no."
00:18:13,00:18:14,"Yeah, that's true."
00:18:14,00:18:15,How?
00:18:15,00:18:16,How?
00:18:16,00:18:17,As in they bread and stuff.
00:18:17,00:18:20,What animal-like activities do they take part in?
00:18:20,00:18:23,Do you get packs of mushrooms hunting and are they?
00:18:23,00:18:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:25,00:18:29,The mushroom approaches it's really.
00:18:29,00:18:30,Really slowly.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Yeah.
00:18:31,00:18:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:34,00:18:35,I love names.
00:18:35,00:18:36,I'm obsessed with--
00:18:36,00:18:39,"because I always find them, particularly in pop culture."
00:18:39,00:18:43,"I mean, it's definitely been the rise of the celebrity world"
00:18:43,00:18:44,that suddenly--
00:18:44,00:18:46,"it's like celebrities are going, I've"
00:18:46,00:18:47,called my child mushroom.
00:18:47,00:18:48,What are you going to do about it?
00:18:48,00:18:50,"I'm going to say, oh, nothing."
00:18:50,00:18:51,"Good, catch you later."
00:18:51,00:18:52,We'll do the same.
00:18:52,00:18:53,Jazee's out.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Yeah.
00:18:54,00:18:56,Because my two favorite ones from recent times
00:18:56,00:18:59,"are, ""Dramane Jackson of the Jackson 5"""
00:18:59,00:19:06,has changed his surname from Jackson to Jackson.
00:19:06,00:19:09,And so he's taken the apostrophe now.
00:19:09,00:19:12,"No, so instead of Jackson with an ""o"" end at the end,"
00:19:12,00:19:13,"it's ""u"" end."
00:19:13,00:19:15,So it's Jackson.
00:19:15,00:19:17,Because he doesn't want to be associated anymore
00:19:17,00:19:18,with the Jackson brand.
00:19:18,00:19:20,[INTERPOSING VOICES]
00:19:20,00:19:23,And he held a press conference because he
00:19:23,00:19:24,was talking about his new album.
00:19:24,00:19:26,And he announced it as press conference.
00:19:26,00:19:29,"He said, by the way, I have changed my name from here on in."
00:19:29,00:19:35,"I want to be now known as ""Dramane Jackson,"" not ""Dramane Jackson."""
00:19:35,00:19:37,"And so they asked him, why have you done this?"
00:19:37,00:19:39,"And he said, I don't want to talk about it."
00:19:39,00:19:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:40,00:19:43,So we don't know his actual proper reasonings that everyone
00:19:43,00:19:45,just thinks that he wants to get away from it.
00:19:45,00:19:49,"I have this big list of American people's names,"
00:19:49,00:19:52,like baby names from 2013.
00:19:52,00:19:57,And these are all male children with five people named
00:19:57,00:19:59,these names in America.
00:19:59,00:20:03,"So Vader, Darth Vader, that's a good name as well."
00:20:03,00:20:05,And also Vader was a WWF wrestler.
00:20:05,00:20:06,"Oh, of course."
00:20:06,00:20:06,Yeah.
00:20:06,00:20:08,Is there anyone called Darth Vader?
00:20:08,00:20:09,Darth Vader?
00:20:09,00:20:11,Just accidentally.
00:20:11,00:20:12,"No, no, no, no."
00:20:12,00:20:13,"No, no, no, no, with a G."
00:20:13,00:20:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:16,00:20:20,Don't have what happens all the time.
00:20:20,00:20:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:22,00:20:25,"Anyway, because I just pick up my asthma bottle."
00:20:25,00:20:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:27,00:20:31,"Sorry, Vader."
00:20:31,00:20:34,"Yeah, so five boys called Vader."
00:20:34,00:20:36,"Five boys called Kestrel, which is quite a nice name."
00:20:36,00:20:37,"Yeah, Kestrel is good."
00:20:37,00:20:40,"Five boys named Lucifer, not as nice."
00:20:40,00:20:42,"That's an odd one, yeah, not as nice."
00:20:42,00:20:44,It means light bearing.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"I mean, they could have said that he started out well."
00:20:46,00:20:48,He was an angel to start.
00:20:48,00:20:49,That is weird.
00:20:49,00:20:51,Five boys called Sophie.
00:20:51,00:20:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:54,00:20:56,And also Romance and Naomi.
00:20:56,00:20:57,They were boys with those names.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Oh.
00:20:58,00:20:59,"Oh, man."
00:20:59,00:21:00,Romance is quite unfair.
00:21:00,00:21:01,This is very nice.
00:21:01,00:21:03,Obama's mum.
00:21:03,00:21:04,Do you know what her name was?
00:21:04,00:21:05,No.
00:21:05,00:21:06,This really shocked me when I read this.
00:21:06,00:21:07,I was reading his autobiography.
00:21:07,00:21:10,And because remember the time when he was initially
00:21:10,00:21:12,"being nominated, everyone went on about his name."
00:21:12,00:21:14,"Like, there's a big thing his name."
00:21:14,00:21:16,And so I'm surprised no one picked up on this.
00:21:16,00:21:19,His mother's first name was Stanley.
00:21:19,00:21:22,"Stanley Obama, she was called Stand the Man at School."
00:21:22,00:21:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:24,00:21:26,"Actually, in the older days, obviously,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,names sometimes do change sex.
00:21:28,00:21:31,So I looked at the 1880 census.
00:21:31,00:21:36,And there were 13 girls in America called Frank.
00:21:36,00:21:37,Is it true?
00:21:37,00:21:38,"Oh, one of them."
00:21:38,00:21:39,Ruth Felt.
00:21:39,00:21:40,"Oh, was it Ruth Felt?"
00:21:40,00:21:41,I had an aunt called Frank.
00:21:41,00:21:43,One of the American presidents had an aunt called Frank.
00:21:43,00:21:48,"There were also 14 Sessels and 46 John's, the one of our female."
00:21:48,00:21:52,"And in last year in America, there were 31 Johans."
00:21:52,00:21:54,"Because, like, did you want to spell John's name?"
00:21:54,00:21:55,"Oh, I want to spell John's name."
00:21:55,00:21:56,It's a tough word.
00:21:56,00:21:56,Yeah.
00:21:56,00:22:02,"Also, there were 1,436 people called Israel."
00:22:02,00:22:04,And 64 called Israel.
00:22:04,00:22:05,Israel.
00:22:05,00:22:06,"Israel, man."
00:22:06,00:22:11,I also-- I love people who have a name that kind of means
00:22:11,00:22:16,"that you can do a lot with it, like Mike Love of the Beach Boys."
00:22:16,00:22:18,"So Love, being his surname, he's obviously gone great."
00:22:18,00:22:20,I can put Love onto everything.
00:22:20,00:22:23,So he's got four unreleased albums.
00:22:23,00:22:24,They're really bad.
00:22:24,00:22:26,So the first album was called First Love.
00:22:26,00:22:29,Second album was called Second Love.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Country Love.
00:22:30,00:22:30,"Oh, nice."
00:22:30,00:22:32,He missed a trick there.
00:22:32,00:22:36,Then there was Looking Back with Love.
00:22:36,00:22:37,This is great.
00:22:37,00:22:38,That one was released.
00:22:38,00:22:39,That one made it.
00:22:39,00:22:42,So the third unreleased one was Unleash the Love.
00:22:42,00:22:44,And then this is the best one at all.
00:22:44,00:22:45,His fourth unreleased album.
00:22:45,00:22:46,Anyone have a bash?
00:22:46,00:22:48,What pun times will he like?
00:22:48,00:22:49,Love hurts.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"Oh, that's good."
00:22:50,00:22:51,Yeah.
00:22:51,00:22:52,15 Love.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Oh, nice."
00:22:53,00:22:56,"No, Andy."
00:22:56,00:22:58,The power of Love?
00:22:58,00:22:59,"That's good, but no."
00:22:59,00:23:00,Where is the Love?
00:23:00,00:23:01,We're just naming other songs.
00:23:01,00:23:03,They can't still love the songs we love.
00:23:03,00:23:07,"OK, it was Mike Love, not War."
00:23:07,00:23:10,I love War.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"We know someone called Diamond Love, don't we?"
00:23:13,00:23:14,"We do know Diamond Love, that's very good."
00:23:14,00:23:17,"Oh, and you had your friends dad."
00:23:17,00:23:18,That's-- I love this one.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"OK, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:23,"So this is Jenny Ryan, who's done a lot of work on QI."
00:23:23,00:23:24,Ryan The Past.
00:23:24,00:23:29,"And her stepfather, I think, is called--"
00:23:29,00:23:31,he was called James Brown.
00:23:31,00:23:34,And he got so annoyed with people making jokes about him
00:23:34,00:23:37,that he changed his name to Dan Brown.
00:23:37,00:23:42,And then became the most famous author of all time.
00:23:42,00:23:43,That's so good.
00:23:43,00:23:43,I love that one.
00:23:43,00:23:44,That's great.
00:23:44,00:23:48,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:23:48,00:23:52,Fact number four.
00:23:52,00:23:53,"OK, fact number four is--"
00:23:53,00:23:58,I was talking to this historian the other day on Twitter.
00:23:58,00:24:01,Because I don't know if you saw on Friday last week on Twitter.
00:24:01,00:24:02,It just went nuts with people.
00:24:02,00:24:05,Historians talking about Alfred the Great bones being found.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"Because we haven't found many monarchs, right?"
00:24:08,00:24:09,Generally.
00:24:09,00:24:09,Yeah.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"Well, we famously found Richard III."
00:24:11,00:24:12,Richard III about two years ago.
00:24:12,00:24:15,And so they're really excited because they dug up an area
00:24:15,00:24:17,where they saw Alfred the Great was meant to be buried.
00:24:17,00:24:18,Turns out he wasn't buried there.
00:24:18,00:24:20,And then they went to a museum storage
00:24:20,00:24:21,where they had a bunch of other bones
00:24:21,00:24:23,that they assumed to be animal bones.
00:24:23,00:24:24,And they found his pelvis bone now.
00:24:24,00:24:26,So we have Alfred the Great's pelvis bone.
00:24:26,00:24:27,Or do we?
00:24:27,00:24:28,They don't quite know.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"Where's the rest of him, if we're not sure about him?"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"We're not sure, but we have a pelvis bone, which feels just"
00:24:32,00:24:36,really like-- you know all those classic Jesus's grandmother's
00:24:36,00:24:39,head and all those relics of the past.
00:24:39,00:24:41,I have a fact about pelvis bones.
00:24:41,00:24:43,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:24:43,00:24:47,"OK, so there's a department in the Natural History"
00:24:47,00:24:51,Museum that if you find something weird in your garden
00:24:51,00:24:52,"or whatever, you can give it to them."
00:24:52,00:24:53,And they'll tell you what it is.
00:24:53,00:24:55,And it's usually people who find what they think
00:24:55,00:25:00,is like jelly from space or cryptozoology things.
00:25:00,00:25:01,Jelly from space.
00:25:01,00:25:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:02,00:25:04,"Well, it's what people think, you know."
00:25:04,00:25:05,"What is it, though?"
00:25:05,00:25:08,"OK, that wasn't my fight, but the jelly from space"
00:25:08,00:25:11,"is whenever there is a meter, right?"
00:25:11,00:25:13,People seem to find this jelly on the floor.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"And there's been for hundreds of years,"
00:25:15,00:25:18,people have thought that the two are to do with each other.
00:25:18,00:25:19,Yeah.
00:25:19,00:25:22,"Nobody knows what it's from, it's called Star Jelly."
00:25:22,00:25:26,"And nobody really knows what it is, there's lots of theories."
00:25:26,00:25:28,There's jelly that we don't know what it is.
00:25:28,00:25:29,"I think, yeah."
00:25:29,00:25:35,"I've heard of Star Jelly, but I've never researched what it is."
00:25:35,00:25:37,You know about this mysterious jelly
00:25:37,00:25:40,"that I've heard about in my thought, well, I'll just leave that be."
00:25:40,00:25:45,I'm sure a team worker can be curious about everything.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"OK, so as well as getting weird jelly,"
00:25:47,00:25:50,they also get what people think are dragon heads.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"And whenever they find a dragon head,"
00:25:52,00:25:55,it is usually the pelvis of a seabird like a puffin.
00:25:55,00:26:00,Because apparently a puffin's pelvis looks like a dragon's head.
00:26:00,00:26:00,That's great.
00:26:00,00:26:03,So that's my pelvis for all claims of dragon heads
00:26:03,00:26:04,turn out to be pelvis.
00:26:04,00:26:06,"Yeah, the ones that these guys get, yeah."
00:26:06,00:26:09,Because do you know that this thing about--
00:26:09,00:26:12,you find people thought that you would have one-eyed monsters.
00:26:12,00:26:15,"So they're like, what do you call these monsters with one eye?"
00:26:15,00:26:16,Psychologists.
00:26:16,00:26:16,Yeah.
00:26:16,00:26:18,And the theory is that what they actually
00:26:18,00:26:21,did was they would find the skulls of elephants.
00:26:21,00:26:24,"And were the elephant skulls, actually."
00:26:24,00:26:26,"They would look like they have a big hole in the middle,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,like it would be one eye hole.
00:26:28,00:26:30,And that's where the theory sometimes goes wrong.
00:26:30,00:26:31,"Well, the best thing that you've told me"
00:26:31,00:26:34,that I've been telling everyone for the past two weeks
00:26:34,00:26:40,is that the majority of sightings photos taken of semonsters
00:26:40,00:26:43,"turn out not to be semonsters, but in most cases,"
00:26:43,00:26:45,the penises of gray whales.
00:26:45,00:26:47,Because they mate at the surface.
00:26:47,00:26:50,"So these giant whales, they always mate at the surface."
00:26:50,00:26:53,"And they always mate in three-sums, two males and a female,"
00:26:53,00:26:55,which means that there's always one spare penis
00:26:55,00:26:57,floating around the surface.
00:26:57,00:26:58,And it's sticking out of the top of the wall.
00:26:58,00:27:01,"Yeah, if people Google this, if you're at home listening"
00:27:01,00:27:05,"and you Google gray whale penis, you will see it."
00:27:05,00:27:05,And it doesn't.
00:27:05,00:27:06,It does.
00:27:06,00:27:07,I can't believe it.
00:27:07,00:27:08,That's very important.
00:27:08,00:27:08,But it's very true.
00:27:08,00:27:09,I've looked at it.
00:27:09,00:27:11,And the majority of the photos that you will see
00:27:11,00:27:13,"of people claiming to have caught a semonster in camera,"
00:27:13,00:27:15,they just-- they have it.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"But anyway, so on Twitter, when I was talking"
00:27:17,00:27:21,"to Greg Jenner, Francesca Stavracapolo, all these historians,"
00:27:21,00:27:24,"they started off by going, wow, Alfred the Great,"
00:27:24,00:27:25,an interesting find potentially.
00:27:25,00:27:29,And then they're all now saying not so much an interesting find.
00:27:29,00:27:31,Like it probably will turn out not to be.
00:27:31,00:27:33,But it got me-- I just wanted to look into it
00:27:33,00:27:34,because I didn't know much about it.
00:27:34,00:27:36,And it led me to the story of how Richard III's bones
00:27:36,00:27:38,were found recently.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"Yeah, so they were found in a car park in Lester."
00:27:40,00:27:41,They were found in a car park in Lester.
00:27:41,00:27:44,"So what I didn't know, we all know that exactly."
00:27:44,00:27:45,It was a very big find.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"What I didn't know is the person who found it,"
00:27:47,00:27:49,Philip Alangley.
00:27:49,00:27:51,Does anyone here know about Philip Alangley?
00:27:51,00:27:52,"So you do change, Anna?"
00:27:52,00:27:53,Do you know that?
00:27:53,00:27:53,OK.
00:27:53,00:27:58,What would you assume the person who found Richard III's bones
00:27:58,00:27:59,does for a profound--
00:27:59,00:28:01,"You assume she was an archaeologist, although--"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"I have read something about her that tells me she's not,"
00:28:03,00:28:06,"and I was like, I assume you wouldn't ask me if she were."
00:28:06,00:28:07,You're like--
00:28:07,00:28:09,I'm sure I'm going to be a archaeologist.
00:28:09,00:28:10,"Yeah, so she's not an archaeologist."
00:28:10,00:28:12,She's a screenwriter.
00:28:12,00:28:16,"She's been writing for the last seven years, a story"
00:28:16,00:28:20,"of script about Richard III, and she got involved in research."
00:28:20,00:28:22,And so she started going to all the places
00:28:22,00:28:25,where potentially Richard III was supposed to be buried.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"She went to Lester, and she went to a spot"
00:28:28,00:28:29,where it was a loose end.
00:28:29,00:28:32,"It didn't look like where they said he might be buried,"
00:28:32,00:28:32,where he was.
00:28:32,00:28:35,"And as she was leaving from effectively a disappointing trip,"
00:28:35,00:28:37,"another one over the course of seven years,"
00:28:37,00:28:42,she saw a car park on the side and got an uncontrollable urge
00:28:42,00:28:43,to go inside.
00:28:43,00:28:46,"So she went into the car park, and she was like,"
00:28:46,00:28:48,I feel like the king is here.
00:28:48,00:28:49,But she left it.
00:28:49,00:28:49,She went off.
00:28:49,00:28:51,She came back a year later.
00:28:51,00:28:54,"She felt the same urge, and she saw on the ground"
00:28:54,00:28:59,"a gigantic r handwriting, because the huge r on the floor."
00:28:59,00:29:01,"And she said, that's where he's buried."
00:29:01,00:29:04,"Now, the r is a painted r for reserved on a car park."
00:29:04,00:29:06,"Oh, she's not a crazy person."
00:29:06,00:29:08,"Yeah, so she said it's here."
00:29:08,00:29:09,No one believed her.
00:29:09,00:29:12,"She raised 34,000 pounds for them to dig it up."
00:29:12,00:29:13,She got channeled forward to come and film it.
00:29:13,00:29:16,"And they dug in the spot, a rich of the third was there."
00:29:16,00:29:18,And it was a psychic.
00:29:18,00:29:20,What was the word that I said to you earlier?
00:29:20,00:29:21,A pre-sentiment.
00:29:21,00:29:22,A psychic pre-sentiment.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"She just went, this is where he is."
00:29:24,00:29:26,But what you don't know is that she's actually
00:29:26,00:29:29,be going all over the country digging up holes for 20 years.
00:29:29,00:29:30,Exactly.
00:29:30,00:29:32,And he's saying that in our heart.
00:29:32,00:29:33,"Every part of you, so good."
00:29:33,00:29:36,"Does that mean, Dan, that you believe that psychic?"
00:29:36,00:29:37,"No, not at all."
00:29:37,00:29:39,I just think that's one of the most wonderful--
00:29:39,00:29:40,that story could not get any better.
00:29:40,00:29:44,"A giant R, like an X marks the spot, but the initial of the king."
00:29:44,00:29:47,"You know that the Ministry of Defense spent 20,000 pounds"
00:29:47,00:29:50,trying to prove that ESP existed.
00:29:50,00:29:52,"Only even in the last 20 years, they did that."
00:29:52,00:29:53,Really?
00:29:53,00:29:53,Yes.
00:29:53,00:29:55,Why are they trying to prove that?
00:29:55,00:29:56,"Well, I always think the reason they do it"
00:29:56,00:30:00,"is because they think if it does, we want to be first."
00:30:00,00:30:03,And they think the Russians are probably going into this.
00:30:03,00:30:04,So is everyone else.
00:30:04,00:30:05,We might as well have a go at it.
00:30:05,00:30:07,I could have told them that it didn't.
00:30:07,00:30:08,"In fact, I tried to tell them really hard."
00:30:08,00:30:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:11,00:30:13,"What was strange when they found Richard III,"
00:30:13,00:30:16,"I thought, is we'd actually run on QI a few years ago"
00:30:16,00:30:18,whether Richard had a hunchback.
00:30:18,00:30:20,And we said he didn't.
00:30:20,00:30:22,It was all made up by Shakespeare and people
00:30:22,00:30:25,who wanted to deface him after his death.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"But then when they found him, they"
00:30:26,00:30:28,found that he did have like an arch to his--
00:30:28,00:30:33,"Yes, an S-shaped spine, as what they said."
00:30:33,00:30:36,"But no, I just find that fascinating,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,because I love it when things are found by people
00:30:38,00:30:40,who shouldn't be finding the thing in question.
00:30:40,00:30:42,But convinced they're going to find it.
00:30:42,00:30:43,"I mean, that's the only instance."
00:30:43,00:30:45,Is it maybe something to do with the fact
00:30:45,00:30:47,"that just like you usually do dig up ground,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,"like either it's agricultural ground, so you dig it up,"
00:30:49,00:30:51,or you're like putting buildings into your dig it up.
00:30:51,00:30:53,So car parks don't really need to foundation.
00:30:53,00:30:56,So they're just things that haven't been discovered yet.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Not sure.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"Because yeah, there are quite a lot of discoveries."
00:30:58,00:31:03,"In fact, I think we should ask at some point the question,"
00:31:03,00:31:06,what vital archaeological discovery was made
00:31:06,00:31:10,under a car park in Leicester last year?
00:31:10,00:31:13,I'm going to say that was the body of Rich of the Third last year.
00:31:13,00:31:16,"Oh, James, you fell right into the--"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"No, no, no, no."
00:31:18,00:31:19,"Last year, yeah."
00:31:19,00:31:20,Last year.
00:31:20,00:31:21,"No, no, I did."
00:31:21,00:31:23,"Yeah, another car park in Leicester."
00:31:23,00:31:26,Same team who dug up the Rich of the Third
00:31:26,00:31:28,after psychic women pointed them the right direction.
00:31:28,00:31:30,"I dug up this ancient Roman cemetery,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,which like revealed a whole bunch of stuff
00:31:32,00:31:35,about how Romans used to bury pagans and religious people
00:31:35,00:31:37,and Christians together and--
00:31:37,00:31:39,"Yeah, just revealed this."
00:31:39,00:31:40,"No, the car park, Leicester."
00:31:40,00:31:42,Why don't we just dig up all the car parks in Leicester?
00:31:42,00:31:45,"Yeah, so under that one, that Romans."
00:31:45,00:31:48,Dig up the helicopter zoo and find King Harrel.
00:31:48,00:31:56,"Cool, so that's our show."
