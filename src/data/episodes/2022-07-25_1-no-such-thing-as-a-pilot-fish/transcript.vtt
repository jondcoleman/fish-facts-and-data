00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.360
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.720
 You did no such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.880
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.800
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:28.240
 Hello and welcome to the pilot episode of No Such Thing as a Fish

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 My name is Dan.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 I'm sitting with three other QI elves, James, Andy, and Anna.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.160
 And each week we're going to get around this microphone

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.040
 and share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.920
 So in no particular order, here are the best things

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.920
 we found out this week.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.720
 OK, let's start with fact number one that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.240
 comes from you, James.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.600
 I went this weekend to the Collider Exhibition,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 the Large Hadron Collider Exhibition at the Science Museum.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.160
 OK.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.480
 And I got fat there.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.240
 The Large Hadron Collider was almost turned off.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.520
 I think it was turned off for a short amount of time,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.320
 for what reason?

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.200
 What do you think?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.120
 Because the rewiring needed maintenance.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.800
 We're good maintenance.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.320
 And it's a lot more low-fi than that.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 Apparently they found a piece of baguette in the machinery.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920
 And it made the temperature go up by seven degrees

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.440
 and they had to turn the whole thing off

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.880
 before they found the baguette.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.800
 If you work with a friend, this will happen.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.080
 I've always thrown my baguette into the machine.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.240
 You're actually a pest, sorry.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120
 But what they actually think happened

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.080
 is that a bird somehow dropped it into an event

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.960
 or something like that.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.240
 And it was found there.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.280
 But some of the physicists who were there at the time

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.600
 actually thought that maybe it was a time-traveling bird

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.960
 sent from the future to ask about the experiment.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.160
 Well, he's just pretty cool.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.640
 Maybe the worst thing I've ever made to seek for ever.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.680
 Or when they first saw the baguette, they're like,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.920
 "Whoa, the Higgs boson is way bigger than that."

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.400
 Found it!

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.720
 Yeah, it's here.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.080
 It's all bread-like.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 That's why they turned it off.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.400
 Job done.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.760
 The Higgs baguette is--

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.120
 The Higgs boson is covered in tuna mayonnaise.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.440
 Surely someone's marketing a Higgs baguette now in Paris.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.280
 But there it was.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.120
 There was a guy who wasn't there who broke into CERN.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.320
 He broke in.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.040
 His name was--

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.920
 How would you say this, Andy?

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.040
 Eloy?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.920
 Eloy?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.280
 Eloy at Cole.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.800
 Strangely dressed match.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.240
 Man, he said that he traveled back in time

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.080
 to prevent the LHC from destroying the world.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.560
 So they've had a number of time-traveling--

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.000
 Yeah, well, that was one theory that the reason we hadn't had

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.920
 time-travelers yet was we hadn't invented the Large Hadron

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.760
 Collider, which would presumably then

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.080
 be the machine that would get them back.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.600
 So you can't have time-travelers until you build the machine.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.880
 So that's why we haven't had them in the past.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.520
 Well, here's the final sentence of this story.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.040
 Mr. Cole, as his name was, was taken

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.120
 to a secure mental health facility in Geneva,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.640
 but later disappeared from his cell.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.000
 Police are battled, but not that bothered.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.680
 What a second.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.440
 I should point out that Dad is on David Aikdog.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.200
 Because I just googled it, and that's the first thing

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.760
 that came on, but this is the talkboards.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.280
 It looks like they've lifted this from Crave Docks.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280
 OK.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.800
 Good.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.440
 I don't know if that's any more reputable,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.920
 but--

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.160
 Because there was a bit of worry at the time

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.800
 that the whole universe was going to end, wasn't there?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.440
 Yeah.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.400
 They thought that--

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.720
 because what they were actually doing

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.840
 was making very, very, very tiny black holes.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.680
 And I think in people's minds, they thought,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.440
 well, what if they get--

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.440
 What if they get bigger?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.680
 But I think what had happened, I might be wrong about this,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.040
 because I'm going off memory a little bit.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.600
 But I think this scientist said that there was a chance

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.440
 of the world ending, but it was something like 10,000 billion,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.480
 billion, billion, billion to one chance, which is pretty much

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.680
 the chance of the world ending anyway in that kind of time.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.080
 But I think they didn't help themselves by saying that.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.720
 And some old people here is what the world's going to end.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.800
 I think there was a big switch on day.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.400
 Do you remember?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.160
 It was when the machine was first used to be switched on.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.040
 And the BBC went to a wall-to-wall coverage

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.920
 over-- I had to write about it for private eyes.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.400
 Everyone going crazy about it.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.160
 And when it didn't work for another nine months,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.880
 they couldn't switch.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.800
 Oh, yeah, I remember that.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.440
 That was a slight problem in the world.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.240
 That's-- there was a story in the news this week

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.000
 about the spaceship that had been--

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.160
 Oh, yeah, yeah, there's a lot like that.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.360
 Is it called Atticus?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.880
 Can you check what's the--

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.720
 it's satellite that we sent up that's

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.000
 been asleep for three years.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.240
 And we sort of sent an alarm on it to wake it up yesterday.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.080
 That's it, yeah.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.400
 And so there was a big thing where they're all waiting.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.280
 And you could stream mission control in--

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.320
 was it Russia or maybe, I'm not sure what country it was,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.840
 America?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.240
 You could watch it, what do you mean?

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.080
 You could watch it.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.080
 You could watch the controller.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.920
 They were waiting, because it was going to be switched on.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.240
 And there was an hour window where it didn't come on.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.080
 So they were waiting.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.000
 And then tension started getting high.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.840
 And then--

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.280
 Yeah, so it was actually-- it wasn't too long,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.200
 but yeah, so there was 10 minutes where it was late waking up.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.120
 And it happened to any signals back.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.800
 And then they started to get increasingly tense.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200
 And if you watch the video, which I now have,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.120
 they suddenly start to panic.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.600
 And it all goes really silent.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.640
 And then it was actually 18 minutes late waking up,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.200
 because what they think happened

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.320
 is somehow the satellite put its alarm on snooze.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.920
 And just postpone its wake up call for 18 minutes.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.920
 And then-- which is fair enough, you know?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.200
 If you're going to think for three years,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.360
 you can't be expected to just bounce out of there.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.800
 I think it was Rosetta, wasn't it?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.880
 Rosetta, yeah.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.960
 Rosetta, yes.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.800
 It's a silent--

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.120
 That's incredible, I'm trying.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.240
 Has got an awesome solar system, in fact, how many?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.840
 Yes.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.280
 OK, no, this is going--

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.760
 I know, you haven't heard this yet, so--

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.280
 No, I haven't.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.280
 I'm prepared.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.520
 It's your turn.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.960
 This has raised some controversy in the office,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.360
 but let's go for it.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.760
 In 2007, the largest object in the solar system

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.240
 was-- what do you think, Anna?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.200
 The sun.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.760
 No, it was a comet called comet homes, which was--

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.480
 the comet itself, the main body of it,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.480
 is three kilometers across.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.080
 And it had this extraordinary explosion at the surface.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.280
 And the corona of dust, they call it the comet coma,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.720
 is the name for it, was bigger than the sun.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.640
 It was 1.4 million kilometers.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.080
 Out of here, it was 1.4 million kilometers across, I think.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.440
 And that all counted as part of the body of the comet.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.360
 Yes, it was 1% of the total mass of the comet

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.760
 is a huge dust.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.080
 Because the sun is emptier than we think it is,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.160
 I think that was fair to say.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.680
 Who do you think?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.160
 I mean, it depends on your definition of the sun, really,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.360
 because there's an argument that the sun is actually

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.000
 the size of the solar system, because that's

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.600
 as far as the solar, as you know, the--

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.440
 As long as the solar wind goes all the way out to there,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.960
 there's still articles from the sun

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.800
 that are getting all the way out to Pluto and beyond.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.800
 So there is an argument that we all live inside the sun

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 at the moment.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.040
 Yeah, well, that's true, then the comet thing is not.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.480
 But if the sun is the size that everyone else says it is,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.440
 it's a comet.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.760
 It was bigger, briefly.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.280
 And nothing is only me who says that.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.720
 What's the comet called?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.960
 Comet Holmes, as in show.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.040
 Oh, a comet, OK.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.040
 Big boy.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.720
 That's interesting, Salah.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.680
 They're not just doing this for the naming, really.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.840
 That's what you would have called it.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.880
 That's what I would have called it, I guess,

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.840
 is why I'm not a scientist.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.880
 There's actually a body, Alex only took this up,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.120
 because I can't remember what it's called, which

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.200
 is responsible for the official non-oncature

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.840
 of everything in the solar system.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.680
 And it has these most specific rules

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.800
 that everything has to be called.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.880
 It's called like the internet.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.360
 It's a branch of NASA.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.520
 So for instance, one of its rules

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.200
 is that Martian craters that measure less than 60 kilometers

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.880
 in diameter have to be named after villages of the world

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.160
 with a population smaller than 100,000 people.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.600
 So they have to-- so like, tooting.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.440
 There's a critical tooting, because--

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.120
 It is, though.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.280
 Yeah, there it is.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.280
 It's so pleasing.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.440
 And the other one, and this is, I think,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.120
 was a headline that James saw when he came

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.280
 onto my computer at it, is there

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.840
 is to be no penis on Venus.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.200
 This is-- this is your excuse.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.440
 I saw there is no penis on Venus.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.560
 And now you'll make it up a story.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.960
 And I was hopefully googling in case there was.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.120
 You taste.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.360
 I've been through that.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.200
 That's nothing.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.920
 That's me.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.200
 Oh, guys.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.440
 Better from Mars.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.000
 Better from Mars.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.120
 Women are probably Venus.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.480
 And yet there's no like only male or Mars.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.880
 So you're not allowed to call anything on Venus

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.640
 after anything male.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.440
 So everything on Venus.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.000
 And either the real thing or everything.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.400
 Or the craters or the mountains.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.640
 Because Venus is--

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.240
 I don't know.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.800
 Oh, because Venus was female.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.280
 Venus is female.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.760
 Except this was only introduced in the early '70s.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.520
 And before that, they had named the highest mountain.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.320
 Malpidus.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.960
 Which is called Maxwell Montaise, named

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.480
 after a male physicist.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.480
 But so he's sitting there on Venus, the only guy

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.200
 who has mountains surrounded by thousands

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.280
 and thousands of women.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.640
 And you can't do anything about it.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.880
 Because he's a mountain.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.640
 That's why he's known that as brilliant.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.400
 That is amazing.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.960
 Alpha ladies for the L series.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.960
 Albinadies.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.960
 Yeah.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.520
 That's a hell of a lot of masters.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.520
 Yeah.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.000
 You know any man on Venus?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.520
 Cool.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.200
 OK, well, let's wrap up because we've got stuff to do.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.240
 OK, before we go, I just got to say, if anyone wants

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.200
 to see the Collider exhibition, it's pretty good.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.760
 Go down to the Science Museum.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.000
 On until 6 May, it costs about 10 and so again.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And I highly recommend it.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.520
 And what do you get to see, is it?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.960
 It's just lots of facts about how it works.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.400
 And there's lots of interactive stuff.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.920
 Yeah, and do us a favor.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.840
 Bring a baguette.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840
 Leave it there.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.920
 Take a photo of some baffle science.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.760
 Let's try to work out how we got it there.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.440
 OK, fact number two, Anna, this one's yours.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440
 Yeah.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.920
 So, for the last month of his life, US President James Garfield ate

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.640
 everything through his anus.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.960
 Big claim, Anna.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.080
 I mean, we all get letters from a lot of people.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080
 Yeah.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:01.080
 I mean, I wasn't there, but this is what the doctors tell me.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.040
 No, so James Garfield was, as everyone obviously knows,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.240
 shot in July 1881.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.320
 And he lived for a further 80 days.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.320
 He was shot in the small, in the like,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.040
 small of his back and once in the arm.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.680
 So doctors now say he would have been

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.480
 that our hospital about two or three days later.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.720
 But obviously, because medicine was not as

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.000
 quite as effective as it is now in 1881,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.680
 they just invited like dozens of doctors to his bedside

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.920
 who all prodded around trying to find this bullet.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.600
 They didn't know where the bullet had gone in his body.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.480
 So they gathered around, prodded about, made him worse and worse.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.880
 He's stopped being able to eat.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.920
 And obviously, if you stop being able to consume food in those days,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.720
 they just shoved it up your ass.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.720
 And so that's what they did.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.320
 So does that work?

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.960
 It does not work, no.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.920
 It was widely discredited in the '30s.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.960
 I think you get about an eighth of the nutrition from some of the food.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.800
 Oh, there's some food that you can't absorb at all.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.600
 What I love is the list of foods that he was fed in this morning.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600
 That's brilliant.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.200
 Beef, we are.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.800
 Egg yolks, milk, egg yolks.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.000
 Egg yolks, wait a minute.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.240
 So for the moment, guys, egg yolks was only true for a while.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.960
 So I was reading the doctor at the time, his report on it.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.080
 So yeah, he was fed egg yolks for a bit of time.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.960
 And then all the surgeons complained that it was causing an annoying

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.960
 and offensive flitus.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.560
 And so they ceased beating in the egg yolks.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.720
 And the truth had to be.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.840
 So they stopped it, because it was annoying then.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.600
 Not the other way around.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.320
 Guys, I'd be quite happy with my mouth.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.360
 That's all I'd like for you guys.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.520
 That's the thing as well.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.000
 He wasn't shut in his mouth.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.320
 That's not my--

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.160
 Because you and me have still one time.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.600
 He could've still-- he could've still-- he could've just--

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.920
 He's still tall.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.560
 Yeah, he's still tall.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560
 Yeah.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.760
 The doctors were amazing.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.520
 The main doctor in charge of saving it was called Dr. Willard Bliss,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.520
 with two doctors.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.160
 His first name was Dr. Willard Bliss.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
 The doctor is really tragic.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.080
 You should go on with the lit, because they're different.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.440
 Yeah, what else is there?

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.680
 That's all I know about what he was fed in that time.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.400
 I think maybe that was the only food they were

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.240
 at an intergrinding beef.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.640
 But he was also given whisky and drops of opium

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.640
 and whisky--

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.480
 Whisky up his ass.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.320
 Whisky up his ass?

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.360
 Yeah, because I mean, if you're in that sort of a state,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.920
 I think at least you want a few drums.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.120
 Yeah, it's terrible.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.160
 He was such a talented man that his party

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.440
 was he could write Latin in one hand and greet

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.080
 with the other simultaneously.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.600
 Wow.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.280
 He campaigned for the presidency in more than one language.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.800
 Wow.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.720
 Sometimes he campaigned in English, some places

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.920
 he spoke in German.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920
 He was this eventually--

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.440
 No, I didn't.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440
 I didn't think he did that.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.240
 But he was president for four months.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.760
 And then he was shocked.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.000
 And then he lingered for another three months.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.480
 It's like the matter of what?

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.520
 Like, you could write Greek with your left

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.800
 and land it with your right.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.400
 In the fact, you could eat to your age.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.240
 Well, forever, overshadowed.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.160
 Trump's it all.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.280
 I actually looked up-- because I knew Andy said earlier

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.880
 that you had a list of things that he ate.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.120
 I thought it would be interesting to look up

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.360
 of what his favorite foods were.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.200
 So that--

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.760
 If I was there, I'd be like, I'm going

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.400
 to try and get you a sneaky dish on the side, you know?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.160
 So his favorite food was squirrel soup.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:13.660
 What?

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.160
 Yeah.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.960
 Really?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.280
 And actually, there was a guy called Crook.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.040
 And he really wanted to cook squirrel soup for the president.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.680
 They needed him to be a bit better.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.440
 I think to the point where he was eating again with his mouth.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.160
 That kind of good.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.240
 And they were given permission to shoot squirrels

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.120
 on the grounds of the soldier's homes

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.680
 in order to get the squirrels in order to do it.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.360
 And he loved milk.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.160
 Really loved milk.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.520
 And there was a company called the Adams Express Company

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.640
 from Baltimore.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.520
 And they actually sent a cow to the White House

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.720
 so they could milk it every day so that he could get fresh milk

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.480
 while he was dying.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.640
 Well, he was shocked.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.040
 He was given milk in the manner we've described.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.040
 Yeah.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.040
 Yeah.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.800
 Well, you were saying that Alexander Graham Bell

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.480
 was there while he was dying?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480
 Yes.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.960
 So I mean, I initially thought about phrasing this fact.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.880
 As Alexander Graham Bell actually killed President James

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.760
 Garfield, and then I felt like there might be lawsuits

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.720
 from his family.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.240
 But because they'd lost the bullet and because in his body

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.400
 and because, coincidentally, Alexander Graham Bell

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.280
 had been developing the metal detector at the time,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.720
 they invited him along.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.760
 And he tried to find the bullet in his body.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.880
 But failed on account of the fact that he was on a bed,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.800
 whether on a metal bedsprings, and so

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.120
 they obviously thought he'd been machine-guned.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.360

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.520
 They're everywhere.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.520
 There's something I can do.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.520
 It's just incredible that--

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.320
 I mean, the genius of inventing a metal detector

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.000
 and they're not thinking to remove the massive source

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.840
 of metal, and they think, I'm not incredible.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.080
 I think you imagined, like, quietly Alexander Graham Bell

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.600
 was like, I think the president is a robot.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.560
 That would have been his discovery, OK?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.400
 I'm not sure if James Garfield was a robot.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.760
 He might have been a sea cucumber,

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.240
 because they actually do eat through the renaces.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.720
 Do they?

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.640
 Yeah.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.960
 They found this out quite recently,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.440
 because you know that they breathe through the renaces.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.160
 They pull water in and then push it out

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.680
 and the oxygenated water helps them to breathe.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.240
 And they thought, well, maybe they take in food there as well.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.680
 And they found out that they have a gut in the middle

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.800
 and they eat through the mouth and through the renaces.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.480
 So it comes in from both sides.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480
 That's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.000
 That is cool.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.040
 It's amazing.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.800
 Yeah.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.240
 And can they taste it?

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.320
 Do they have taste buds in the renaces, do you think?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.040
 I don't know if they have taste buds in the renaces.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.720
 Well, James, you found out what else you can taste with,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.400
 didn't you?

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.560
 You can taste with your testicles.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.800
 Well, well, here's the thing.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.800
 You have taste receptors in your testicles.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.600
 No one's quite sure what they're for.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.680
 But you also have smell receptors in your lungs.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.400
 And the reason we do know why they're there,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.480
 because if you get a really terrible smell

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.920
 and your receptors in your lungs can smell it,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.520
 then it'll close up your esophagus

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.000
 and stop anything poisonous from going into your body.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.640
 But as far as I know, no one's found out yet

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.960
 why we have taste receptors in their testicles.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.120
 Maybe someone will tweet me at egg shapes

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.720
 if you know why we can taste with our testicles.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.200
 Let's move on to fact three.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.560
 That is James, your facts.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.480
 So my fact is, in 2013, six people in the US

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.080
 named their child Mushroom.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.640
 I mean, I just love that.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.800
 I love the kind of thing which we do on QI,

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.720
 which you sometimes just get a load of data

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.320
 and mine through it for the funny bits,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.760
 which is where this came from, which

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.240
 is a big list of all the baby names in the American Mushroom.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.960
 I mean, it's what would possess you to--

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.520
 I think this one's quite nice.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.960
 It does sound cool actually.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.000
 Mushroom. Mushroom.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.960
 Hey, mushroom.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.120
 It's sort of--

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.640
 Shroom for sure.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.560
 Is that any fungus?

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.880
 Fungus doesn't sound nice.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.400
 Fungus.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.120
 Because I like that.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.040
 I think it's weird, because I have a mild mushroom phobia.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.520
 I think I know how to do.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.200
 Yeah, I find them like very disgusting things.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.120
 What the hell are you talking about, James?

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.640
 It's just the way that they reproduced with spars

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.240
 and they grow at dead things and stuff.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:09.840
 I just find--

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.760
 I think a lot of people don't.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.920
 Yeah, don't like mushrooms.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.120
 There's something dead about them.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120
 Yeah.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.560
 And it's a weird one that you--

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.160
 I find-- because my friend hates mushrooms as well.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.000
 And if I have a pizza with them, we have to remove them.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.520
 Yeah.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.120
 Well, you know him, Ash, who did the theme tune for our show,

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.480
 and pre-S.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.040
 But you kind of have to respect a hatred of mushroom or a feared

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.800
 mushroom in the same way you respect someone's religious beliefs.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.400

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.080
 I really have to be like, oh, OK, I appreciate them.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.160
 I will remove it from any of the foods

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.520
 that we will have in this house from here on in.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.320
 Yeah, it's true.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.600
 Mushrooms are really hateful.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.760
 Yeah, they've paid it with a passion.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.800
 Oh, really?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.920
 It's a bit like vegetarianism because you're

00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.240
 excluding an entire area of the mushrooms in their own kingdom.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.520
 And the mushrooms are a kingdom, aren't they?

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.200
 Yeah, fungi are a kingdom in the same way

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.560
 that animals and plants are.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.080
 But if you think actually mushrooms are more closely

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.560
 related to animals than they are to plants, are they?

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.400
 Yeah, no.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.520
 Yeah, that's true.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.320

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.200

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.800

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.520

 I'm obsessed with--

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.720
 because I always find them, particularly in pop culture.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.240
 I mean, it's definitely been the rise of the celebrity world

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.760
 that suddenly--

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.440
 it's like celebrities are going, I've

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.760
 called my child mushroom.

 What are you going to do about it?

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.240
 I'm going to say, oh, nothing.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.440
 Good, catch you later.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.600
 Yeah.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.920
 Because my two favorite ones from recent times

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.920
 are, "Dramane Jackson of the Jackson 5"

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:06.040
 has changed his surname from Jackson to Jackson.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.000
 And so he's taken the apostrophe now.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.360
 No, so instead of Jackson with an "o" end at the end,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.760
 it's "u" end.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.120
 So it's Jackson.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.320
 Because he doesn't want to be associated anymore

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.960
 with the Jackson brand.

 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.480

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.600
 was talking about his new album.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.000
 And he announced it as press conference.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.120
 He said, by the way, I have changed my name from here on in.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:35.320
 I want to be now known as "Dramane Jackson," not "Dramane Jackson."

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.480
 And so they asked him, why have you done this?

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.760
 And he said, I don't want to talk about it.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.560
 So we don't know his actual proper reasonings that everyone

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.600
 just thinks that he wants to get away from it.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.480
 I have this big list of American people's names,

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.440
 like baby names from 2013.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.440

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.440

 Darth Vader?

 Five boys called Kestrel, which is quite a nice name.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.880
 Yeah, Kestrel is good.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.760
 They were boys with those names.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.760

 I was reading his autobiography.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.160
 And because remember the time when he was initially

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.200
 being nominated, everyone went on about his name.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.320
 Like, there's a big thing his name.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.240
 And so I'm surprised no one picked up on this.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.280
 His mother's first name was Stanley.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.880
 Stanley Obama, she was called Stand the Man at School.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.640
 Actually, in the older days, obviously,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.440
 names sometimes do change sex.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.560
 So I looked at the 1880 census.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.640
 And there were 13 girls in America called Frank.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.320
 Is it true?

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.560
 Oh, one of them.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560
 Ruth Felt.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.400
 Oh, was it Ruth Felt?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.520
 I had an aunt called Frank.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.240
 One of the American presidents had an aunt called Frank.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.080
 There were also 14 Sessels and 46 John's, the one of our female.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.440
 And in last year in America, there were 31 Johans.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.440
 Because, like, did you want to spell John's name?

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.080
 Oh, I want to spell John's name.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080
 It's a tough word.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.600
 Yeah.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:02.160
 Also, there were 1,436 people called Israel.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.880
 And 64 called Israel.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.680
 Israel.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.920
 Israel, man.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.680
 I also-- I love people who have a name that kind of means

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.400
 that you can do a lot with it, like Mike Love of the Beach Boys.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.880
 So Love, being his surname, he's obviously gone great.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.640
 I can put Love onto everything.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.240
 So he's got four unreleased albums.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.840
 They're really bad.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.960
 So the first album was called First Love.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.520
 Second album was called Second Love.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.240
 Country Love.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:30.760
 Oh, nice.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.520
 He missed a trick there.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.120
 Then there was Looking Back with Love.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.280
 This is great.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.400
 That one was released.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.160
 That one made it.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.960
 So the third unreleased one was Unleash the Love.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.200
 And then this is the best one at all.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.400
 His fourth unreleased album.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.600
 Anyone have a bash?

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.040
 What pun times will he like?

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.440
 Love hurts.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.400
 Oh, that's good.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.240
 Yeah.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.440
 15 Love.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.600
 Oh, nice.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.960
 No, Andy.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.320
 The power of Love?

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.400
 That's good, but no.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.240
 Where is the Love?

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.320
 We're just naming other songs.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.320
 They can't still love the songs we love.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.480
 OK, it was Mike Love, not War.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.720
 I love War.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.160
 We know someone called Diamond Love, don't we?

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.600
 We do know Diamond Love, that's very good.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.000
 Oh, and you had your friends dad.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.440
 That's-- I love this one.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.640
 OK, yeah.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.560
 So this is Jenny Ryan, who's done a lot of work on QI.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.840
 Ryan The Past.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.280
 And her stepfather, I think, is called--

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.880
 he was called James Brown.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.400
 And he got so annoyed with people making jokes about him

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.720
 that he changed his name to Dan Brown.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:42.080
 And then became the most famous author of all time.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.200
 That's so good.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:43.880
 I love that one.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.880
 That's great.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.000
 Fact number four.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.520
 OK, fact number four is--

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.000
 I was talking to this historian the other day on Twitter.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.160
 Because I don't know if you saw on Friday last week on Twitter.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.920
 It just went nuts with people.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.880
 Historians talking about Alfred the Great bones being found.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.600
 Because we haven't found many monarchs, right?

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.360
 Generally.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:09.880
 Yeah.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.400
 Well, we famously found Richard III.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.960
 Richard III about two years ago.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.360
 And so they're really excited because they dug up an area

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.120
 where they saw Alfred the Great was meant to be buried.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.920
 Turns out he wasn't buried there.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.440
 And then they went to a museum storage

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.560
 where they had a bunch of other bones

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.000
 that they assumed to be animal bones.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.800
 And they found his pelvis bone now.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.720
 So we have Alfred the Great's pelvis bone.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.320
 Or do we?

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.560
 They don't quite know.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.600
 Where's the rest of him, if we're not sure about him?

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.520
 We're not sure, but we have a pelvis bone, which feels just

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.800
 really like-- you know all those classic Jesus's grandmother's

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.440
 head and all those relics of the past.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.120
 I have a fact about pelvis bones.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.680
 OK, so there's a department in the Natural History

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.080
 Museum that if you find something weird in your garden

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.280
 or whatever, you can give it to them.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.840
 And they'll tell you what it is.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.960
 And it's usually people who find what they think

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.280
 is like jelly from space or cryptozoology things.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.400
 Jelly from space.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.040
 Well, it's what people think, you know.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.240
 What is it, though?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.280
 OK, that wasn't my fight, but the jelly from space

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.080
 is whenever there is a meter, right?

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.720
 People seem to find this jelly on the floor.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.760
 And there's been for hundreds of years,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.760
 people have thought that the two are to do with each other.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.260
 Yeah.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.860
 Nobody knows what it's from, it's called Star Jelly.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.060
 And nobody really knows what it is, there's lots of theories.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.460
 There's jelly that we don't know what it is.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.980
 I think, yeah.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:35.740
 I've heard of Star Jelly, but I've never researched what it is.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.580
 You know about this mysterious jelly

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.020
 that I've heard about in my thought, well, I'll just leave that be.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.100
 I'm sure a team worker can be curious about everything.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.140
 OK, so as well as getting weird jelly,

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.620
 they also get what people think are dragon heads.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.420
 And whenever they find a dragon head,

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.540
 it is usually the pelvis of a seabird like a puffin.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.100
 Because apparently a puffin's pelvis looks like a dragon's head.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:00.940
 That's great.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.660
 So that's my pelvis for all claims of dragon heads

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.940
 turn out to be pelvis.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.740
 Yeah, the ones that these guys get, yeah.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.020
 Because do you know that this thing about--

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.500
 you find people thought that you would have one-eyed monsters.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.540
 So they're like, what do you call these monsters with one eye?

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.160
 Psychologists.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.660
 Yeah.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.440
 And the theory is that what they actually

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.720
 did was they would find the skulls of elephants.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.800
 And were the elephant skulls, actually.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.600
 They would look like they have a big hole in the middle,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.320
 like it would be one eye hole.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.560
 And that's where the theory sometimes goes wrong.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.800
 Well, the best thing that you've told me

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.960
 that I've been telling everyone for the past two weeks

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.560
 is that the majority of sightings photos taken of semonsters

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.840
 turn out not to be semonsters, but in most cases,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.920
 the penises of gray whales.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.200
 Because they mate at the surface.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.200
 So these giant whales, they always mate at the surface.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.640
 And they always mate in three-sums, two males and a female,

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.640
 which means that there's always one spare penis

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.320
 floating around the surface.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.920
 And it's sticking out of the top of the wall.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.440
 Yeah, if people Google this, if you're at home listening

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.000
 and you Google gray whale penis, you will see it.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.840
 And it doesn't.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.440
 It does.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.280
 I can't believe it.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.280
 That's very important.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:08.960
 But it's very true.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.480
 I've looked at it.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.320
 And the majority of the photos that you will see

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.960
 of people claiming to have caught a semonster in camera,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.600
 they just-- they have it.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.880
 But anyway, so on Twitter, when I was talking

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.840
 to Greg Jenner, Francesca Stavracapolo, all these historians,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.320
 they started off by going, wow, Alfred the Great,

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.720
 an interesting find potentially.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.280
 And then they're all now saying not so much an interesting find.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.440
 Like it probably will turn out not to be.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.200
 But it got me-- I just wanted to look into it

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.520
 because I didn't know much about it.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.840
 And it led me to the story of how Richard III's bones

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.160
 were found recently.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.280
 Yeah, so they were found in a car park in Lester.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.880
 They were found in a car park in Lester.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.240
 So what I didn't know, we all know that exactly.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.360
 It was a very big find.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.640
 What I didn't know is the person who found it,

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.440
 Philip Alangley.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.600
 Does anyone here know about Philip Alangley?

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.640
 So you do change, Anna?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.360
 Do you know that?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:53.880
 OK.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.440
 What would you assume the person who found Richard III's bones

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.200
 does for a profound--

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.880
 You assume she was an archaeologist, although--

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.720
 I have read something about her that tells me she's not,

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.160
 and I was like, I assume you wouldn't ask me if she were.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.120
 You're like--

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.520
 I'm sure I'm going to be a archaeologist.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.840
 Yeah, so she's not an archaeologist.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.680
 She's a screenwriter.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.800
 She's been writing for the last seven years, a story

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.520
 of script about Richard III, and she got involved in research.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.520
 And so she started going to all the places

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.280
 where potentially Richard III was supposed to be buried.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.320
 She went to Lester, and she went to a spot

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.760
 where it was a loose end.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.440
 It didn't look like where they said he might be buried,

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:32.960
 where he was.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.600
 And as she was leaving from effectively a disappointing trip,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.600
 another one over the course of seven years,

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.280
 she saw a car park on the side and got an uncontrollable urge

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.520
 to go inside.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.080
 So she went into the car park, and she was like,

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.320
 I feel like the king is here.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.000
 But she left it.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.520
 She went off.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.400
 She came back a year later.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.440
 She felt the same urge, and she saw on the ground

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:59.560
 a gigantic r handwriting, because the huge r on the floor.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.520
 And she said, that's where he's buried.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.560
 Now, the r is a painted r for reserved on a car park.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.120
 Oh, she's not a crazy person.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.040
 Yeah, so she said it's here.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.000
 No one believed her.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 She raised 34,000 pounds for them to dig it up.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.800
 She got channeled forward to come and film it.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.720
 And they dug in the spot, a rich of the third was there.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.800
 And it was a psychic.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.320
 What was the word that I said to you earlier?

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320
 A pre-sentiment.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.640
 A psychic pre-sentiment.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.480
 She just went, this is where he is.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.040
 But what you don't know is that she's actually

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.240
 be going all over the country digging up holes for 20 years.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.120
 Exactly.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.240
 And he's saying that in our heart.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.920
 Every part of you, so good.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.440
 Does that mean, Dan, that you believe that psychic?

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.240
 No, not at all.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.440
 I just think that's one of the most wonderful--

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.880
 that story could not get any better.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.720
 A giant R, like an X marks the spot, but the initial of the king.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.920
 You know that the Ministry of Defense spent 20,000 pounds

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.360
 trying to prove that ESP existed.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.840
 Only even in the last 20 years, they did that.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.320
 Really?

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:53.840
 Yes.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.160
 Why are they trying to prove that?

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.880
 Well, I always think the reason they do it

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.200
 is because they think if it does, we want to be first.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.680
 And they think the Russians are probably going into this.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.520
 So is everyone else.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.920
 We might as well have a go at it.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.040
 I could have told them that it didn't.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.920
 In fact, I tried to tell them really hard.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.280
 What was strange when they found Richard III,

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.440
 I thought, is we'd actually run on QI a few years ago

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.680
 whether Richard had a hunchback.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.640
 And we said he didn't.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.720
 It was all made up by Shakespeare and people

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.120
 who wanted to deface him after his death.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.440
 But then when they found him, they

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.600
 found that he did have like an arch to his--

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.800
 Yes, an S-shaped spine, as what they said.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.880
 But no, I just find that fascinating,

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.800
 because I love it when things are found by people

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.960
 who shouldn't be finding the thing in question.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.640
 But convinced they're going to find it.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.960
 I mean, that's the only instance.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.760
 Is it maybe something to do with the fact

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.840
 that just like you usually do dig up ground,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.760
 like either it's agricultural ground, so you dig it up,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.760
 or you're like putting buildings into your dig it up.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.920
 So car parks don't really need to foundation.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.440
 So they're just things that haven't been discovered yet.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.040
 Not sure.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.640
 Because yeah, there are quite a lot of discoveries.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.040
 In fact, I think we should ask at some point the question,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.800
 what vital archaeological discovery was made

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.320
 under a car park in Leicester last year?

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.960
 I'm going to say that was the body of Rich of the Third last year.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.000
 Oh, James, you fell right into the--

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.160
 No, no, no, no.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.600
 Last year, yeah.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.800
 Last year.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.600
 No, no, I did.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.880
 Yeah, another car park in Leicester.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.040
 Same team who dug up the Rich of the Third

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.680
 after psychic women pointed them the right direction.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.880
 I dug up this ancient Roman cemetery,

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.320
 which like revealed a whole bunch of stuff

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.920
 about how Romans used to bury pagans and religious people

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.920
 and Christians together and--

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.040
 Yeah, just revealed this.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.200
 No, the car park, Leicester.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.360
 Why don't we just dig up all the car parks in Leicester?

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.800
 Yeah, so under that one, that Romans.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.040
 Dig up the helicopter zoo and find King Harrel.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:56.080
 Cool, so that's our show.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.640
