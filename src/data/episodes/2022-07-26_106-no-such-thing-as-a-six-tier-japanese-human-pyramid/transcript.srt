00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 (Bell)

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 A no-stutch thing is a fish, a weekly podcast.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 This week coming to you live from Bristol.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and please welcome to the stage.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 It's Anit Shazinski, Andy Murray and James Harkin!

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 (Bell)

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 (Bell)

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Starting with me, my fact.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 My fact this week is that the frog whose Latin name means blue frog is actually green.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 (Bell)

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 It's very exciting. This is the Australian green frog.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And basically when it was sent from Australia to England for scientific purposes because of the preservatives and so on inside the glass that it was kept in it turned it blue.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So they named it blue frog.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And then it was not until they saw a living one that they realized, oh actually this thing's green.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 But it is still, its Latin name is still blue frog.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 That's good.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 It might always turn blue when it dies.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I think that it is true because there was a study done wasn't there last year and it was about how certain animals make themselves look certain colors when they don't have the right pigments.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And I think it was looking at birds and the shape of their feathers and how it's actually often about the shape of it, the structure of something and then how it makes the light reflect off it without using pigments.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And it said that that's why the Australian green frog turns blue after death is because I think the shape of it kind of changes and it gets floppy once it dies.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It could also be that all these scientists are colourblind.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 To me it's kind of like a computer game where it's game over.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Just a frog suddenly just living as green just, and it's blue.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It's just a really good way of letting you know that okay that's a dead green frog.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Do you not think?

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Because frogs, okay I was reading about other frogs.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 This is not necessarily the Australian green frog, but I went on a website about frogs and I went to the section of it called frog quently asked questions.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Very, very, very.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And they wanted to know about how much sleep frogs get and the reply on the website was that frogs and toads will sit very still with their eyes closed.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And the assumption is that they are asleep but it is not clear how long they sleep per day. So we don't know they'll just sit looking like they're asleep and we they might just be hanging out.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 But they deny it, they deny it afterwards.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Right on the sleep.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 They're very much like dads in that respect.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So I found out about a frog which changes colour called the more frog and it's brown but during the mating season all the males turn blue.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 It's so that they can tell which ones are males and which ones are females because the males are very enthusiastic and they will just get mounting any frog which looks different to them.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 So they think it's evolved because they're so stupid.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 They can't tell whether they're...

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 What could you tell?

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Going stupid.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 What would you know if you saw two brown frogs?

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 If I were to say, excuse me, I'm leaving brown frogs.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I'm more excited by the term you use, get mounting.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 That's an insight into your private life there.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 There's a tortoise that turns red as it's having sex, isn't there?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 What?

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Yeah, which kind of humans do as well?

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I can't.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 In my experience.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 But I think it turns redder.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I just think, again, very useful because you're like, I'm just going over to see Barry.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Barry, okay, busy.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 You were just...

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 How close do you usually get to people before going, are you guys having, you are having sex?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Hey, I think I put a flag up or something next time.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Jesus.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Wow.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 But that is cool.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 It's really cool.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Sorry.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Did I say it was a tortoise?

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 That's cool.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 It's the golden tortoise beetle.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And it turns red having sex.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And it is.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 You can see where I had trouble there.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Yeah, sexual signaling apparently.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 But I would have thought it turns red as it's having sex.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Apparently it turns red to say, I am ready to make now.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 But I would have thought, by the time you're doing that, you don't really need the signaling anymore.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So there's a frog as well that is red.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And it's often called the tomato frog.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Literally, it's color is meant to warn predators that it's not safe to eat because it is quite toxic.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 But there are lots of frogs on those little tiny Amazonian frogs that were sort of the very, very brightly colored yellow and blue ones.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 They're really toxic.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Right.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Yeah.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And so there's one that Ezra Frog, when it's young, it's black with bright yellow spots.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And it does look poisonous.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 That's something we were recognise as being poisonous.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But when it gets older, it completely transforms and look it up.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It's amazing.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It transforms into this lovely kind of translucent orangey peach color with these big green eyes.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And so it doesn't look toxic anymore.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 But I would want all predators to think I was toxic throughout my life.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It's kind of like saying, you can handle yourself now.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Because what if no one wants to hang out with you anymore?

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Because you look scary.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 You might have others frog-species friends you want to chill out with and they're just asking for you.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 No, no, no.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 We don't want the toxic lad over here.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Okay, good point.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Yeah.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Well, you're still a good point, Anna.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And I think you say it as a reflex.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Okay, green tree frogs.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Yeah.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 They're an interesting species.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And they respond to sounds of other green tree frogs' coals.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 So the males respond to the female coals.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 But they'll also respond to other things that sound a bit like the females.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So they found that they would respond to a washing machine, a popcorn popper,

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 a dog lapping water, cannon fire in a civil war movie,

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 and Scott Joplin, ragtime music.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And they think that's all a female going, yeah, I'm ready to have sex.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 The most optimistic of all species.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 The sound of a cannon firing in a civil war movie.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Either Ulysses-esque ground is just one another battle, or I'm about to get lucky.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Let's get counting.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Do you know something really cool that frogs can do, which they've just found out?

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 No.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 They can urinate out anything that's stuck in their body.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So this was, so this was originally found out

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 because a scientist planted little radio transmitters under their skin

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 because they wanted to track frogs.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And they realized that they'd all, like, they went to find the radio transmitters,

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 and they'd disappear.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 They couldn't track the frogs anymore.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And it turned out that it's because they can slowly transport foreign objects

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 anywhere in their body into their bladder and then get rid of them.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So if they're stabbed or something.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Splinter.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's made a splinter.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Yeah.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Actually, staffish do that as well, I think.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Something in the back of my head says that when they get something stuck inside

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 then they can force it out to the end of their legs,

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 and they can kind of put it out there.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 It's impressive.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 There's an octopus that can, it's called the mimic octopus

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 for reasons that will become obvious if you keep listening.

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 That can change their colour, but can also change their shape.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And they can mimic 15 different species.

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 So they can change their shape by morphing themselves into the shape of sea snakes, lionfish,

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 flatfish, starfish, giant crab, seashells, thing rays, flounders, jellyfish,

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 and enemies, mantis shrimps.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 They can disguise themselves as all of these creatures.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But not even, so not even to the shape and the colour,

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 they can change the texture of their skin to match the texture of the thing they're mimicking.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So if they're mimicking seaweed, their body literally turns into it.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 There's an amazing video, go on YouTube, put in octopus camouflage, maybe seaweed.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And it's insane.

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Very cool.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Where is octopus, man, as a superhero?

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 That is the best superhero.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 What?

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Doctor Octopus.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 It's a superhero movie.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 We need to move on to our next facts.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Does anyone have anything before we do?

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 People can turn blue.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Prove it.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 No, I didn't think it's very rare, but some people have a bad reaction to a colloidal silver,

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 which comes in, I think, like health drinks and tonic drinks.

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And there's a guy, I think he died a couple of years ago, but not from this,

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 just because he was getting older.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 But he was perfectly healthy, except he's completely blue from head to toe.

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Was he an American politician?

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Is that the one you're talking about?

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Oh, no, I think different guy.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Oh, well, there was an American politician who thought the colloidal silver,

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 which is like a drink with silver inside it, or something like that.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And he thought it would kind of solve every problem that he had.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And they kind of did, apart from that he turned blue.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Wow.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Was he Republican or Democrat?

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Because that...

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And also, there was a family in...

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I'm going to say they're in Kentucky, but they were certainly around there somewhere.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And they all turned blue, but that was a genetic thing.

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Wow.

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And they were called the blue fugates.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And they were quite famous in America.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Or the Smurf to their neighbours.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Should we move on to our next action?

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I think we should.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And that is Chazinsky.

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Yes, my fact is that you can surf on mushrooms.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 This is true.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Yeah.

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 What do you mean by that?

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 As in, you're on a surfboard, and there's lots of mushrooms there,

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 and you're going along on the surf.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Oh, you've had some mushrooms, and you think you're surfing.

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 OK, that can happen.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 But this is no time for personal anecdotes.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 No, this is so cool.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 So it's not...

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 There's this company called...

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 It's a co-vative.

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And so the pronunciation is quite difficult.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It's spelled eco-vative, and they say it's the same as a pronunciation of innovative.

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 So it's eco-vative.

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And they've realised that mycelium, which are these kind of threads at the bottom of mushrooms,

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 and of fungus, are likely at like glue.

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And then they can expand it to make a kind of foamy substance,

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 which can make a really good surfboard.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Or in fact, loads of other substances.

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And they have been quoted as saying, mushrooms are the new plastic.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And I believe them.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Wow.

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Yeah.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 It's really cool.

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I think you boil it up, don't you?

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Yeah.

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And then they become kind of a stretchy substance.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Yeah.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But for hundreds of years, they've been making hats in the Transylvania out of mushrooms in this way.

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 No way.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Sounds made up, doesn't it?

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It really does, but it's genuinely true.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Everyone in Transylvania is wearing a mushroom on their head.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Is it?

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 No, it is.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 They're like little peff helmets, but they're made out of mushrooms.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Wow.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Wow.

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Wow.

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So when I started looking into this, scientists are saying that we are entering the age of the fungus.

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 They really think that it's going to take over with...

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Our cars are going to be made of mushrooms.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Our insulation now...

232
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It's like in Mario Kart.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Yeah, insulation.

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 This company makes insulation.

235
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 They make insulation.

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 So they put mushrooms into your walls now.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 They really think that mushrooms are now going to be used in a way that we never realized they could be used before.

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 That is absolutely disgusting.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Well, so James has a phobia against mushrooms.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Because they grow in dead things and they reproduce with spars and they're just horrible.

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And if you guys are going to make a world out of them, I don't want to be in that world.

242
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Well, okay.

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Good luck on the Mars program.

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Actually, that is a thing, isn't it?

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I was reading an interview with a guy who's obsessed with mushrooms, who's like my nemesis.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And he reckons that when humans go to other planets, that they will be kind of taking mushrooms there to terraform it.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Because they can make soil and that kind of...

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 They make soil.

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So many, many, many millions of years ago, the earth was much more mushroom heavy than it was now.

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I think it was before the tree had evolved, or before the vegetating plants and flowers and things like that had evolved.

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 So there were lots of very, very tall, they think up to 24 foot high mushrooms.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And they...

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Some reason...

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Was it the mycelia?

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 They can sort of break down rocks and they make soil.

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Yeah.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So it's thanks to mushrooms, James, that you've got your vegetables, which are not mushrooms.

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 So I reckon you'll like this, because you like coffee, right?

259
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Oh, yeah.

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Mushrooms like coffee.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Okay.

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 So I have something in common.

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 It's not exactly match.com, but...

264
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 There's a problem with soil at the moment.

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 We're depleting the soil much, much faster than we're replenishing it.

266
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And it's genuinely along with global warming.

267
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Scientists are saying it's like the main environmental threat to us.

268
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And so there's this company's decided instead of feeding soil to mushrooms, feed coffee to them.

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And so they're planting mushrooms in it, and they grow really fast, and they love it.

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I found a mushroom which is a bright orange Hawaiian one, which they tested in 2001.

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And it was found to trigger orgasms in women.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Okay, that's one thing we don't have in common.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 (Laughter and applause)

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 But sadly, it was a very small study, and they think it probably doesn't trigger spontaneous orgasms in women.

275
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 So there you go.

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Match.com here we come.

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Yeah.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It was reported in a lot of newspapers, but it seems to be sadly untrue.

279
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Oh.

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 It has a fetid odor.

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So there you go.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That's not your fault.

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 (Laughter and applause)

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It's looking more and more meant to be.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Can I take it to surfing for a bit?

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Yes, please.

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I was looking into famous surfers.

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Okay.

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Because we've spoken about the fact that Agatha Christie before was a surfer, very famously one of the first surfers in England.

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And also, so Mark Twain surfed.

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Did he?

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Yeah, he wasn't a professional, but he did try a few times, which was really exciting, and he really enjoyed it.

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 But Barack Obama, in 2008, went surfing in Hawaii where the mushroom, he's from Hawaii, no?

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Yes, exactly.

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So he went back and he went surfing, and he went surfing on a beach called Sandy Beach Park.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And it was such an event to have him surfing, although I think it turns out he was just potty surfing, so without the board.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But they decided that they wanted to rename the beach after Barack Obama.

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 So they were changing it from Sandy Beach Park to President Barack Obama, Sandy Beach Park.

299
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 We can't lose the Sandy, but it's such a good name.

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And there's too much controversy, so they ended up not giving it to the president.

301
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Really?

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Yeah.

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Well, would you say that you think his main regret over the whole course of his tenure is that that beach was never named after him?

304
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Number two, Guantanamo.

305
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 There is.

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 He wants that name after him.

307
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I found a study about surfing, which is looking into surfers' rectums, literally, looking into them.

308
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 There's a study about antibiotic resistant bacteria and surfers are being asked to volunteer rectal swabs because they swallow a lot of water when they go surfing.

309
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And the water that is around the coast might have antibiotic resistant bacteria in it. We need to study the effects of these bacteria if we're going to defeat them and get better antibiotics, which work.

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So the project is called Beach Bums.

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And it feels a lot like the name happened and then they have to back for me a reason.

312
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 They say send us your rectal swabs. Send us. Oh, so it's not like they're waiting at the shore.

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Presently you mean to the word wipe out.

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Wow, that's incredible.

315
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Yeah, you know that barring one, none of the beach boys ever surfed.

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Famously.

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Famously they hated.

318
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 So Brian Wilson was actually petrified of water.

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 They actually, I can't remember there were two musicians who forced Brian Wilson to surf once because I think everyone used to take the piss out of them quite a lot because I think it was quite a known thing.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Everyone was like, you know, most of your songs about surfing and none of you surf.

321
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 It was Saturday night life.

322
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 No, no, it was Saturday Night Live and I believe it was Dan Acroid and John Belushi.

323
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 That's what it was.

324
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Yeah, they got them to surf and you just basically are watching a man on a beach petrified of water.

325
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And it was on television.

326
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And it was on television.

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Yeah.

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I don't know what the words say swap this ain't us.

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Yeah, surfing US ain't us.

330
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 All right, we need to move on to our next facts.

331
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

332
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

333
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 My fact is that if you're allergic to cats, you're also allergic to lions.

334
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 No, you might think that everyone's allergic to lions.

335
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Yeah, you're not watching an approaching lion going, oh, I'm going to get a cold off the back of the side of my entailer.

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Where's my entailer?

337
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So the main thing that causes it is a thing called dander.

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 So it's these tiny cells made of hair or fur or feathers.

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And it's the things that animals give off.

340
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And humans have dander as well.

341
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I think that must be related to the word dander.

342
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It is dander off. It's the same thing I think.

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Oh, okay.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 So it's a bit complicated.

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 But basically the dander contains this particular protein called fel d1 and cats have it in the skin and in the saliva.

346
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And when they groom, it gets airborne basically.

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And if you're sensitive to it, then you have an allergic reaction.

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And so obviously there haven't been many studies on testing allergic reactions to big cats.

349
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 But there was one in 1990 which tested eight different species, tigers, lions, snow leopards, that kind of thing.

350
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And found there was a link in general, you know, sometimes it's weaker, sometimes stronger, but yeah.

351
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Wow.

352
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Amazing.

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 People have been scientists have made some wild assertions lately about there was a study done at the University of Edinburgh, I think,

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 with the Bronx Zoo which compared the personalities of house cats to the personalities of big cats.

355
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And they tested them on extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness.

356
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And I don't know how they test their questionnaires were sent out or whatever.

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And they found out that they had the same inclination domestic cats as big cats.

358
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 So they had high inclination towards dominance, impulsiveness and neuroticism.

359
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Which then a lot of articles reporting about this said, if they were bigger or you were smaller, your cats would kill you.

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Which I don't know, I think that's a leap.

361
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 But yeah, your cats would kill you.

362
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 If you were a size of a mouse and the shape and the shape of a mouse, fewer of a mouse.

363
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 One of the signs that cats are not the same as big cats and they're subservient to us humans.

364
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And I didn't realise this is that they buried their poo.

365
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So I can't really have never thought about this.

366
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 The fact that cats bury their poo and dogs just shit everywhere is that's their way of saying so a big cat will not bury its poo.

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And that's it marking its territory.

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And that's it saying don't come near this, this is mine.

369
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And the sign of submissiveness in small cats is burying their poo.

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And so saying, it's okay, I'm not marking this territory, you don't need to smell this.

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 This is all yours.

372
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And so they're saying to you, the owner, I buried my poo, you can have this house.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I'm not saying you're burnt.

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So you know that dogs could be allergic to cats?

375
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Yeah, they could be allergic to cat dander.

376
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Wow, dogs can both be allergic to humans, can't they?

377
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Yes.

378
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Yeah.

379
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 They could go to meerkats.

380
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 No way.

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Says who?

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Says Piz Morgan.

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I read it, I was looking at people who are allergic to things and it came up on a...

384
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And Piz Morgan sent a tweet where he was linking to like a really important thing about people who suffer from meerkat allergy.

385
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And he was like as a fellow sufferer of meerkat allergy.

386
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And then RT and then read this link.

387
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Let's all send him a meerkat.

388
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 We can do it.

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Cats and dogs used to be very good friends.

390
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It's very strange that they've developed this antipathy towards each other.

391
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 But 9 million years ago, so in the blink of an eye ago, to some of us.

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Just one of them said something to the other and they could never have got over it.

393
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 A hell.

394
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 We know this because, so we've got, because of archaeology.

395
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So we've got fossils of 9 million years ago of the sabertoothed cats and their dogs, which are a combination of bears and dogs.

396
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 So they've looked at what they would eat and they've looked at the areas that they inhabited.

397
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And it shows that even if they inhabited the same broad area, they'd divvied up between them.

398
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 So they wouldn't hunt animals in the dogs area, bear dogs area, and the bear dogs wouldn't hunt animals in the sabertoothed cats area.

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And they just got along fine.

400
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 They didn't compete at all, which animals usually were.

401
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So they really scared of each other, right?

402
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 But their natural predators aren't there. They're not scared of anything.

403
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Okay.

404
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So on the subject of people being allergic to things, I went on to...

405
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 I continued my search.

406
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And I went to Yahoo Answers, because people often ask questions the best side on the internet.

407
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 This was the question. So my girlfriend is allergic to almost every animal you'd find in a petting zoo.

408
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 If she inhales air that is around a horse, she can be hospitalized.

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Now she loves giraffes.

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Does anyone think she'd be allergic to them too?

411
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I was thinking of surprising her on a birthday with a trip to the local zoo to pet a giraffe.

412
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And the reply, the top rated reply, because that's how it works on Yahoo Answers, the most votes reply.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 If she's allergic to almost every animal I guarantee you, the zoo will contain more than just her ass.

414
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Why don't you do something less stupid?

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 So where did you take her in the end, then?

416
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Sorry.

417
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Just on allergies.

418
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I was looking up hay fever, because I want to know how long it's been around.

419
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Generally allergies just weren't reported until the late 19th century.

420
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 So in the 1870s, food idiosyncrasy was referred to for the first time.

421
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Was I really like?

422
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And that, you know, I'm idiosyncratic about certain foods.

423
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And I guess that's like wheat intolerance or whatever we have today that's made up.

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 If you're listening to this in your celiac, don't listen to Anna.

425
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 What you got is real.

426
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Do you know, just going on celiac, do you know that the first person to realise that celiac came from wheat was Dr Willie Dick?

427
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 It was during the war, and he found that there was a Nazi blockade against bread.

428
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 And everyone started eating potatoes, and they stopped having the problems with their stomachs.

429
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And he realised that was what was causing it, yeah.

430
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 That's amazing.

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And yet, every time he's ever referred to, it's always going to be in the context of people laughing about his name.

432
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Life is cruel.

433
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 But just on hay fever.

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 So, yeah, it was very late.

435
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Given how prevalent it is, and how widespread it is, it was only in 1819 that one doctor who had hay fever decided to investigate what he was going on.

436
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 He spent nine years trying to find fellow sufferers.

437
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 He only found 28 other people in nine years who had it.

438
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 So we don't know why there was obviously much less of it.

439
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 He called it summer Qatar, but eventually it sort of caught on.

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And it became kind of fashionable because it was thought that it was people of higher society who had hay fever.

441
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And so New York heard that all these posh British people were hanging out with hay fever.

442
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 So it became a fashionable thing to do in New York to have hay fever.

443
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And they were referred to as hay fever rights, which became kind of a like a piss-taking or you're trying to be posh kind of term.

444
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And there was a doctor who said that sufferers from hay fever may, however, gather some crumbs of comfort from the fact that disease is almost exclusively to confine to persons of cultivation.

445
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Hence, as already hinted, hour as in Britain's national broclivity to hay fever may be taken as proof of our superiority to other races.

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Whoa!

447
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Absolutely.

448
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Absolutely.

449
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I mean, mad.

450
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You can be allergic to sex. This is a real thing.

451
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 So they tested a thousand women who complained of sort of pain or irritation after sex.

452
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And they found that of those thousand women, 13% were allergic to their partners at Siemens.

453
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 But there was a cure, which involves injecting.

454
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 No, stop it.

455
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 No, because it's exactly what you're thinking.

456
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 So it involves injecting increasingly high sperm samples into the vagina every 20 minutes.

457
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Every 20 minutes.

458
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Wake up.

459
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 No, go ahead.

460
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 What?

461
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But the thing is the cure only works if followed by frequent sexual contact, which is defined by them as two or three times a week.

462
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 So there you go.

463
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 We need to move on soon.

464
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Does anyone have anything before we do?

465
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You can be allergic to euros.

466
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 To what?

467
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You can be allergic to euros, the coins.

468
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 They give off loads of nickel and they tested it on human sweat.

469
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And this is weird. They couldn't test it on people because it only really reacts after about 48 hours in constant contact.

470
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Unless you're constantly touching your money.

471
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 But they found that after 36 hours dunked in artificial human sweat.

472
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 That one year of coin will visibly be eroded.

473
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 But I want to know what is made of artificial human sweat.

474
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 That's true.

475
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I guess salt and water or something.

476
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But yeah, Nicole is covered in allergy.

477
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I'm a human sweat actually.

478
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 You can be allergic to exercise.

479
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 The true thing.

480
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Yeah, and you're allergic to people who are allergic to their own sweat.

481
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Sometimes when they go for a jog and, you know, I'm allergic to exercise, okay?

482
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And one percent of kiwis are allergic to kiwis.

483
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 So that's people from New Zealand allergic to kiwi fruits.

484
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I thought it was the other way around.

485
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Listen, let's move on to our final fact of the night.

486
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And that is James Harkin.

487
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that it's legal in Japan to make a human pyramid higher than five tiers.

488
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 So this is a new law that's just come through.

489
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 There's a thing in Japan called kumitizo, which literally means group body and maneuver.

490
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And it's kind of thing they do in sports days and stuff at school.

491
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And there's lots of different things they do, but one of them is a human pyramid.

492
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And apparently it's incredibly dangerous and people always get injured with it.

493
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 According to the Japan sports council, insurance payments for injuries relating to human pyramids

494
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 have been made in more than 8,000 cases per year since 2011.

495
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 So this is a real major problem in Japan.

496
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 People are just getting really badly injured from human pyramids.

497
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And so they've decided to put a stop to it.

498
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I remember the local politicians in India, if you get a really good human pyramid,

499
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 they give you up to $200,000 for the prize.

500
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Yes, they do.

501
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I'm not sure if I'm being scammed here.

502
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 But again, I say this guys, we could do it.

503
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I should warn you that every, so in the Indian one, every year, a few people are killed.

504
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 The art council really casually said.

505
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And it's like a lot of children climbing up to the top, isn't it?

506
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And so they've cracked down a little bit in India now, I think.

507
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And they've said people have to wear safety harnesses above a certain height.

508
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And the height is capped at 20 feet.

509
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And there was a quote from a participant who's enjoyed this festival for many decades,

510
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 who said, "Sup for all to have killed the fan out of the whole festival."

511
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 We used to just kill the participants, but now they're getting the fun.

512
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 That reminds me of the thing, I think it's in India and also in Pakistan,

513
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 where they did kite flying.

514
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Remember that?

515
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 They did kite flying and they would take the strings for the kites and they put glass on them.

516
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And the idea is that you'd fly it along.

517
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And then when your enemy's kite is going near you as you try and slice it open.

518
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And so the kite would fly away and you'd win the kite.

519
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 It's a bit like conquerist kind of thing.

520
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Yeah, Afghanistan as well, I think.

521
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Yeah, I've got to say, but they banned it, didn't they?

522
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Because people were just getting sliced.

523
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Oh, did they?

524
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Oh, people were getting really badly injured for it.

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Wow.

526
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 What are they doing all the way up there?

527
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Well, the string goes all the way from the ground to their own self.

528
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 So on things that are Japan is cracked down on.

529
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Okay.

530
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 So dancing was illegal in Japan since World War II, wasn't it?

531
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 What?

532
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Sorry, not dancing overall.

533
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Dancing in most night clubs was illegal in Japan.

534
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Oh, really?

535
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And I think it was because clubs have become prostitution hotbeds people believed after World War II.

536
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 And hotbeds is a very good word for what happens with prostitution.

537
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 But no, this is quite interesting.

538
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 So it was dancing with band and night clubs because it was seen as kind of like a like sentious type thing to do.

539
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And then the band was sort of relaxed towards the end of the 20th century.

540
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And then it was really cracked down on in the start of the 21st century because I think there were a lot of scandals happening at the time.

541
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 So everybody's scandals in clubs and people were getting a bit too raunchy.

542
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And so there was a petition signed by 150,000 people in Japan to lift the band.

543
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And I think it's just been lifted.

544
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I don't think it's coming to into action yet.

545
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 But it's just been lifted.

546
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But yeah, you weren't allowed to dance.

547
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 If you would dance in a night club in Japan, you were escorted out of the building.

548
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Wow.

549
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And locked up.

550
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Yeah, they definitely were dancing.

551
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 It was one of those laws where people just kind of let it go because it was gone.

552
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I think until more recently, which is why they signed the petition.

553
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Yeah.

554
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 I almost got kicked out of a night club for being asleep, right?

555
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 But how did they know you were asleep?

556
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Yeah.

557
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 He was just squatting on his haunches with his eyes closed.

558
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Could have been anything.

559
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 No, it was New Year's. It was my first New Year's in London. It was a big club that was just past New Year's.

560
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I got really tired, so I fell asleep on the floor on the dance floor.

561
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 It was a big dance floor that was space for me.

562
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 People could go around.

563
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 They could see a person there.

564
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 It was fine.

565
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 So I just laid down.

566
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 I went to sleep.

567
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And then I got woke up by the security guard.

568
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 He's like, "Hey, you can't sleep in here."

569
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And I literally looked around.

570
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Everyone was snorting coke, doing ease, everything around me.

571
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 And that was fine, but sleeping on the floor of a dance floor.

572
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Yeah, they were sleeping. You always get kicked out of sleeping in night clubs.

573
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 You should know that by now, Dan.

574
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Okay, so are there illegal things in Japan?

575
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Yes, yeah.

576
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Okay, so it's illegal in Japan not to take any holidays from work.

577
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Really?

578
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Or they're about to make it illegal.

579
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Wow.

580
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And that's because of the culture in Japan where people just want to work and work and work.

581
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Because especially with the recession, people think, you know, if I take time off, then I might get fired or whatever.

582
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 And so they're saying you'd mandaterally have to take your holidays, you have to take five days of holiday every year.

583
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Wow.

584
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Yeah.

585
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 It was a huge amount of holidays.

586
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It was like, "Whoa, what, five days?"

587
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 But if you take six, you're fired.

588
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 No, obviously you're supposed to take the right amount.

589
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 But if you take any fewer than five, then that's enough.

590
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Then have fun.

591
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Should we move back to human pyramids quickly?

592
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Yeah, all right, finish.

593
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So the guy who invented the human pyramid was called John Astley.

594
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And he was the son of Philip Astley, who was this huge...

595
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Philip Astley basically invented the circus.

596
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And so the original human pyramid was called the force d'ercule, as in the force of Hercules,

597
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 or the strength of Hercules, because that was what they thought it took to make a human pyramid.

598
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 But my favorite thing about Astley is what his wife's best trick was, because she was a circus performer as well.

599
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 And her best trick, apparently, or one of her tricks, was marching bees across a table.

600
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Yeah.

601
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And she could also ride a horse while wearing a flock of bees.

602
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Swarm of bees.

603
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Swarm of bees.

604
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Swarm of bees.

605
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 This is where I'm at hand.

606
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 The word flock used to mean just a group of anything.

607
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 So they used to say a flock of lions.

608
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Yeah, they used to say a flock of anything.

609
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 So you can have flock of bees?

610
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 She had a flock of bees, and she wore them on her hand as a moth while riding a horse.

611
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Wow.

612
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Who is that?

613
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Yeah.

614
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 It's like a self-fulfilling thing, isn't it, because their hand was presumably looked so repulsive by the end of that day.

615
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 She'd have to wear a moth the next day to conceal it, because it was swollen and bloodied.

616
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And then you've got to keep the bees on forever.

617
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Absolutely.

618
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 So the bees have got a good gig going on.

619
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Wow.

620
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 We should wrap up very soon.

621
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Do we have anything before we go?

622
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Well, just on Japan, Japan health and safety, I was looking into, and there's Tamazoo in Japan, and it wanted to check that it had the right health and safety things in place if an animal escaped.

623
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And so they have snow leopards there.

624
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And so they dressed up a staff member like a snow leopard.

625
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Like, if you remember when you were eight and you got costumes of leopards and lions and stuff, it's like that.

626
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Like a ridiculously unrealistic snow leopard costume.

627
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And he had to run across the park's ground as 70 members of staff tried to capture him using nets, poles and tranquilizer darts.

628
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 tranquilizer darts.

629
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Yeah.

630
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Wow.

631
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 This is the quote.

632
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 It's reported in so many papers.

633
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And you've got to assume that the guy, the zoo park director, was being a little bit tongue-in-cheek when he said it.

634
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 But he said, we focused on making this drill as realistic as possible.

635
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And one of our staff being knocked down injured and then being knocked unconscious and going into cardiac arrest was part of that.

636
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

637
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

638
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000

639
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000

641
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 At X-shaped.

642

 Andy.

643
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Andrew Hunter M. Chazinski.

644
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Thank you so much for listening at home, guys, Bristol.

 Thank you so much for being here tonight.

646
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 That was awesome.

647
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 And, yep, hold the applause.

648
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Yeah, I can see you there.

649
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 And we'll see you again next week.

650
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Good night!

651
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 [Applause]

652
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
