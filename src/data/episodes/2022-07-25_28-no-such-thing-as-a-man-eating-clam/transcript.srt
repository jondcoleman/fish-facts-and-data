1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,160
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 You did not such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,920
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,600
 He says it, right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,080

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,200
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,200
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI Offices in Covent Garden.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,960
 My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with three of the regular elves

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,000
 and it's Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski, and James Harkin.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,880
 And once again, we've gathered around with our favorite four facts

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,680
 from the last week, and here they are, in no particular order.

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,400
 Andy Murray, my fact is that over 100 people used to watch King Louis XIV

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 get up and get dressed every day.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,440
 Did he know they were there?

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,240
 Yes, he did.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,920
 So was it like a window?

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,640
 No, people would come into his bedroom and watch him--

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,520
 Hundreds.

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,880
 It's a ceremony called the Leve as in the French for getting up.

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,320
 And it was kind of to ease the king into the day.

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,360
 That would be quite good if you got up in the morning and brush your teeth

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,800
 and you got a big round for applause.

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,640
 That would really help your day stop.

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,200
 Yeah, and people came to see him while he was having his breakfast.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,640
 So a few people would come in when he was still in bed at eight o'clock.

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,000
 And he would be woken up.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,800
 And his nurse would kiss him, his childhood nurse,

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,560
 and his chamber potter would be removed.

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,760
 And then the ceremony started, which took an hour and a half.

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,160
 And he would have his hands washed in wine.

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,880
 He picked a wig. He was given his slippers and dressing again.

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,320
 His hand washed in wine.

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,680
 Yeah, he washed his hands in wine.

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,400
 Why would you do that?

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,880
 No idea.

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,400
 Stinky hands the whole day.

40
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,120
 Spartans used to wash newborn babies in wine.

41
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,200
 It was one of the first things that happened to them

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,040
 as they got a bucket of wine or washed in them.

43
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,840
 Wow.

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,800
 So sometimes he would just go to the corner and have a wee

45
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,600
 in the chamber pot with no embarrassment or inhibition.

46
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
 Well, he would have done all this broadcast,

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,440
 haven't we?

48
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,120
 How he liked to defecate in public.

49
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,000
 Was that him?

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,440
 Yes, that was him.

51
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,280
 I think like to is an exaggeration.

52
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,000
 No, he liked to.

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,560
 Architects at Versailles suggested that toilet cubicles

54
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,080
 are becoming, you know--

55
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,800
 No, no.

56
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,840
 Alamoids.

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,680
 No, I liked to put him public.

58
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,440
 The really amazing thing is where they dress him.

59
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,720
 So two officials took the sleeves of his night shirt

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,120
 and started to pull it off him.

61
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,320
 While another courtier brought a fresh and pre-warmed shirt

62
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
 to the king.

63
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,800
 And then two other people-- this is four and five--

64
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,360
 had to hold up the king's dressing gown as a curtain.

65
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,000
 So people didn't get a glimpse of--

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,200
 So a quick question.

67
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,320
 Back then, how do you pre-warmed something?

68
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,600
 Do you hold it over an oven?

69
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,120
 Do you--

70
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,320
 I don't even like a fire.

71
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,080
 Or maybe you can warm up ions, can't you?

72
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
 And then you can press the iron out.

73
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,880
 I might be worn by someone for a little while.

74
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,920
 Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

75
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,400
 Because if it was a fire, then you're going to get the wood smell.

76
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,800
 This guy must have been a smelly, a smelly man.

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,000
 What that sounds like is he wakes up

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,080
 and he gets dressed as a walk of shame.

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,320
 Smelling of booze and fire.

80
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,240
 I read something about microbiomes.

81
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
 This is off topic.

82
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,120
 But what it is is if you go into your house,

83
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,800
 you leave microbes everywhere.

84
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,480
 And they're specific to you.

85
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,360
 So my house will have a certain microbiome,

86
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,400
 and then you'll have one that's completely different.

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
 But the interesting thing is, if we went to stay in a hotel,

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,560
 you would only have to be in that hotel for 24 hours

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,000
 before the microbiome of that hotel room

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,480
 is indistinguishable from your house.

91
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
 Wow.

92
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,320
 That's how much they all go from one place to another.

93
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,920
 If any like dogs we could use them to mark our territory,

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,480
 then we'd claim ownership of who we are.

95
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
 Then we might have a bit more of this planet

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,080
 than we already do.

97
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,120
 What are you saying?

98
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,200
 I'm getting sick of the swans taking bits of my land.

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,680
 By right.

100
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,160
 Going back to Louis, I really like the fact

101
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,800
 that so it's part of the Levese ceremony.

102
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,160
 And is it the Couché ceremony when he goes to bed?

103
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,000
 Yeah.

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,240
 That does that not mean--

105
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,760
 Yeah, but Couché just means go to bed.

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,960
 That was a Couché ceremony.

107
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,160
 Yeah, that he obviously had his private chamber

108
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
 where he actually slept, and then he had his bed chamber

109
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,240
 where all of the people used to do all this stuff.

110
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,400
 So he would be woken up in his private chamber at, let's say, 7.30 AM.

111
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,720
 And then escorted to the public chamber,

112
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,160
 which also has a bed in it.

113
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,400
 And have to sit in bed and sort of fake

114
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,880
 that he was being woken up out of bed.

115
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,840
 And then to go back to bed, he had to have this whole Couché ceremony

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,160
 around him.

117
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,600
 They'd take his clothes off, but his night gone on.

118
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,560
 He climbs into bed.

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,440
 They kiss him good night.

120
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,000
 They tell him a little rhyme, like, does a fake snore.

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
 And then he has to get out of the display bed

122
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,120
 and walk down the corridor to his private bed chamber

123
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
 to actually go to sleep.

124
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,280
 And Louis the 15th really didn't like these ceremonies.

125
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,440
 And so he would get up in the morning

126
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,160
 and go hunting for a couple of hours first,

127
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
 and then sneak back in and pretend to get as it's late.

128
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
 That's amazing.

129
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,960
 It sounds like a real hassle.

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
 What does he just want to get downstairs?

131
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
 Yeah, it sounds like a complete pain.

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,840
 Did anyone else get it?

133
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,400
 Was it just specifically him?

134
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,880
 No, his descendants did.

135
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
 It lasted for centuries.

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
 Oh, sorry.

137
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,080
 No, what I mean is, oh, anyone outside of the king.

138
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,960
 What I read is that some of his courtiers

139
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,440
 who came to that ceremony had their own levy ceremonies

140
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,200
 in their own house earlier in the day.

141
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,280
 Oh, my God.

142
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,480
 I'm the dresser of the dresser of the dresser of the dresser

143
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
 of the dresser of the king.

144
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,640
 And it caught on, so it became fashionable

145
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
 with Charles II in England, I think.

146
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,280
 So the French really went for it.

147
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,760
 And then we picked up on it.

148
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,160
 And you used to be able to watch King's eating as well.

149
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
 You used to have public galleries.

150
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,320
 You could walk through.

151
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,240
 I can't remember what she saw in it is,

152
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,960
 but someone calculated that Louis the 14th

153
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
 would have eaten between getting up and going

154
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,360
 to bed 30 different dishes in the course of the day.

155
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
 Just constantly being fed.

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,040
 His life sounds like it sounds like Salvador Dali

157
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,400
 has designed his mind.

158
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,320
 It's a realist nightmare.

159
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,520
 Do you know about the Washer Woman's Rebellion

160
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,440
 in the time of Louis the 14th?

161
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,800
 This was the introduction of chocolate in the cart of Louis.

162
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,160
 And it was a new thing, people were drinking chocolate.

163
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,760
 When the Washer ladies first saw the brown stains

164
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,520
 on the fine white, the mask table napkins,

165
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,080
 they refused to touch them.

166
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,000
 I mean, going on what Anna said about Louis the 14th

167
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
 behavior in the corridors of Versailles.

168
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
 That's true.

169
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
 Probably what?

170
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
 A reasonable assumption, yeah.

171
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,280
 And the other interesting thing about Louis

172
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,280
 the 14th, I always like, is this guy called Ustash Desier.

173
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,720
 So this is a prisoner of Louis.

174
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,840
 He was transferred from prison to prison,

175
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
 all over France for 34 years.

176
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,120
 He had to wear a mask the whole time,

177
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,560
 a black velvet mask.

178
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,360
 He was told that if he said anything

179
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,840
 other than food or water, he was to be killed on the spot.

180
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,400
 And no one knows who he was or anything like that.

181
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,320
 And there's loads of conspiracy theories

182
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,640
 in French history about whether he was Louis twin brother

183
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,720
 or he was the son of the king of England or whatever.

184
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,680
 Hence the man in the Iron Marks,

185
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,240
 the brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio.

186
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,520
 He's that who he is?

187
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,680
 He's the man in the Iron Rask.

188
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,240
 Well, that's the idea of that Dumas had to came from that.

189
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,840
 He popularized champagne, didn't he?

190
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,600
 Louis the him and Dom Perignon got together,

191
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
 decided they loved wine from the champagne region,

192
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,880
 even though it wasn't ever fizzy in his lifetime.

193
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
 That's a real guy, Dom Perignon.

194
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
 He was a monk, yeah.

195
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,240
 Dom Perignon of that.

196
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,440
 That's like not shows being invented by Mr. Nacho.

197
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,080
 Not by a guy called Ignacio.

198
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,840
 Oh, it was not a professional guy, that's good.

199
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,520
 King Louis the 14th probably only liked champagne

200
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,680
 because he thought it got the germs off his hands better.

201
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
 Yeah.

202
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,040
 Well, this is great wine, Dom Perignon.

203
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,480
 I love it.

204
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,400
 He took it as a cure for his gout, which obviously will work.

205
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,200
 No.

206
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,800
 But don't the bane of Dom Perignon's life

207
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
 was the fact he couldn't get these bloody bubbles

208
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,480
 out of champagne well enough.

209
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,280
 So they would try to make it as flat as possible.

210
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,520
 And it was only after Louis died

211
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,840
 that people decided to start drinking it sparkling.

212
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,400
 I have a cool fact about champagne, which is that

213
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,080
 in the days before, tough and glass bottles

214
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,360
 used to explode at the slightest provocation.

215
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,320
 And you had to wear an iron mask to go into the wine

216
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,920
 seller.

217
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,200
 And champagne makers would lose sometimes

218
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,520
 up to a third of their bottles.

219
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,440
 Because obviously, it can be a chain reaction

220
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,880
 if one goes, then all the others around it might go as well.

221
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,760
 So yeah, you see these incredible outfits

222
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,440
 that they had to put on big heavy gloves.

223
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,720
 I was, oh no, someone's ordered champagne again.

224
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
 Yeah, put the radiation suit on.

225
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
 Louis the 14th ruled for so long

226
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,640
 that his successor was his great grandson.

227
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,560
 He outlived his oldest son and his oldest grandson

228
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,600
 for over 72 years.

229
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,360
 I like Louis.

230
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,280
 What else has he done?

231
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,560
 He wasn't a nice guy, particularly.

232
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
 And he was extraordinarily lavish.

233
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,440
 I mean, he robbed his own people and all defunded

234
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,400
 his spending habits.

235
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 And in fact, that's where we get another piece

236
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,520
 of etymology, the word silhouette.

237
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,800
 So that comes from Louis the 14th reign

238
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,040
 because Etienne de Silhouette was the finance minister.

239
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,720
 And so he was the guy who organized attacks the people a lot,

240
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,400
 and especially the rich, so that Louis could

241
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,480
 have expensive habits.

242
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,480
 And you're wondering how the hell we got to the work from here.

243
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,600
 That meant that rich people who used to get their portraits

244
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,560
 painted couldn't afford to do that anymore.

245
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,600
 And their replacement for that was just having

246
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,080
 silhouettes of themselves drawn.

247
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,920
 And it was called silhouettes because it was like,

248
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,680
 it became a by word for on the cheap

249
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
 because we can't afford this anymore.

250
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,840
 Yeah, yeah.

251
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,800
 And so he, as well as there being a man called Dom Perillon,

252
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,520
 there's a man called Silhouette.

253
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,080
 Etienne de Silhouette and Dom Perillon,

254
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,520
 are hanging out with Louis together.

255
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,880
 There's another book that needs to be written.

256
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,920
 Like Burns, Side Burns, and named

257
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
 for a guy called Burns.

258
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
 Yeah.

259
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
 Yeah.

260
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,920
 He was the first head of the NRA Bernside, wasn't he?

261
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,920
 Don't forget Hank Crispy-cream.

262
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,920
 I thought it was Crispy Cream.

263
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,920
 I would have loved that.

264
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
 Anyway, yeah.

265
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 Sorry to derail it with that.

266
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
 There's a man called Silhouette.

267
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
 Yeah, I like that.

268
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
 That's great.

269
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
 And the only image we have of him is a silhouette.

270
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
 Is that right?

271
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
 No.

272
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
 And we can see that.

273
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
 So like you heard me say his name.

274
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
 Stop listening.

275
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
 I'm pretty sure.

276
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,920
 That is exactly what I did.

277
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,920
 OK, time for fact number two, and that is James.

278
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,920
 OK, my fact is that there is an original Picasso

279
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,920
 that no one will ever see because it was eaten by the dog.

280
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
 By the dog.

281
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
 Was this it?

282
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
 In the dog.

283
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
 That was Picasso's jazz friend, the dog.

284
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
 There was a dog called Lump, who was named after the German word for rascal.

285
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,920
 The dog lived with Picasso for six years.

286
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,920
 And one day he drew a picture of a rabbit, which if it was still around now,

287
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
 it'll be worth tens of thousands of pounds.

288
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
 But the dog carried it into the garden and ate it.

289
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
 Because he thought it was an actual rabbit.

290
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
 Because we've all seen Picasso's paintings.

291
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
 And they're not as realistic as that would imply.

292
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
 That's true.

293
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
 That's true.

294
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
 Yeah.

295
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
 Didn't Picasso.

296
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
 Maybe he was a bit of a dodgy character.

297
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
 He was lying about the whole dog thing.

298
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
 He was a bit dodgy.

299
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
 He was purported to have stolen the moon at one point.

300
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
 Wasn't he?

301
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
 Wasn't he the prime suspect?

302
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
 He was definitely interrogated about it.

303
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,920
 And now I think he's the artist with the most works of art stolen of any artist.

304
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,920
 I think there was something like 1,100 works of Picasso, original Picasso's around the world.

305
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
 So if you spot one...

306
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
 All stolen by dogs.

307
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
 Oh, yeah.

308
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,920
 He did burn a lot of his work when he was younger, because he was too cold.

309
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,920
 And too poor for proper heating.

310
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,920
 And he had all these sheets of paper with drawings on and he just burnt them.

311
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
 Oh.

312
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,920
 Do you remember hearing that thing about Picasso?

313
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
 That he had two mistresses and they came to his house and they said,

314
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,920
 "Oh, you have to choose between us."

315
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
 And he said, "No, you'd need to fight it out."

316
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
 And then he just sat there and let them fight.

317
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
 Brilliant.

318
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
 The only man who could get away with that.

319
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
 Wow.

320
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
 And you can hang your clothes up over there.

321
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
 Corner of the room.

322
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,920
 Sotheby's once won a $20 million contract to sell a collection of Picasso's and Van Gogh

323
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
 off they won a game of scissors paper rock.

324
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
 Hold on, sorry.

325
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
 Sotheby's won the game of scissors.

326
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
 I don't understand how...

327
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
 I'll say it again.

328
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,920
 They both got the contract at the same time.

329
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
 They didn't know who was going to get it and so they just did a game of rock paper scissors.

330
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
 All of them.

331
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
 All the staff lining up opposite each other.

332
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
 Mr Sotheby against Mr Christy.

333
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
 Mr Christy.

334
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
 Mr Sotheby won.

335
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,920
 Steinbeck's dog et his first draft of Mice and Men.

336
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
 Really?

337
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
 Yeah, that's happened.

338
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
 Oh, wow.

339
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,920
 Do you know where the rumour of the dog eating one's homework first came from?

340
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
 No.

341
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,920
 Apparently it's from I think it was 1901 and it was in a Welsh village and there was a stand in Vicar.

342
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 And he was reading out his sermons at the end and then he felt like his sermons had been too short

343
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
 and he hadn't prepared enough so he went back into the vestry to talk to one of the clerics afterwards

344
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,920
 and apologized and said he dropped some of it on the way in the dog eight half of his sermon.

345
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 If you are interested in dogs, the Wikipedia list of individual dogs is unbelievably good.

346
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,920
 It is divided into actors, athletes, faithful dogs, working dogs, other heroic dogs.

347
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,920
 Dogs of unusual size, which is divided.

348
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,920
 I kept you not into small dogs, heavy dogs and tall dogs.

349
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
 Also, space dogs is one of them.

350
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
 Okay, yeah, like her and so on.

351
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,920
 Intelligent dogs, notorious dogs, ugly dogs, unique dogs.

352
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
 What's a unique dog?

353
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
 Every dog is unique, Dan.

354
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
 Famed by proxy to a famous list.

355
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
 Yeah, unique dogs.

356
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,920
 Did you see that in the news this week about the Russian biggest lender in Russia?

357
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
 If you get a mortgage with them, you get a free cat.

358
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,920
 Are they lend it to you so that you can be photographed with it in your new home?

359
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,920
 Well, there's supposed to be a thing about good luck in Russia.

360
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,920
 Yeah, if it's quite true, but the first going to house should be a cat.

361
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,920
 Did you know that builders used to wall up cats inside buildings that they were working on?

362
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
 No, I didn't know that.

363
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
 They've been found when you do renovations.

364
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
 You often find a mummified cat in the walls of a property.

365
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
 Why?

366
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
 They also put shoes in, didn't they, in the walls?

367
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
 Yeah.

368
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,920
 They who collect all the times when they've been mentioned and has a big long list online of all the secret shoes that are in.

369
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
 Is that just for fun?

370
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
 Is that some sort of in-builders?

371
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
 Good luck, the superstition.

372
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,920
 The first cat mentioned in an English witch trial wasn't black, it was white and spotty.

373
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
 Was it?

374
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
 Was that bad at the time?

375
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
 Did they show it wasn't a Dalmatian?

376
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
 Well, the reason they...

377
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
 How good were they at identifying?

378
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,920
 Well, the reason they knew it was a witch's cat is because it would talk to her and it was called Satan.

379
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
 I said, "Two obvious clues."

380
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
 Apparently white cats with blue eyes are deaf.

381
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
 Yeah, most of them are, I think.

382
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
 And also almost all tartar shells are female.

383
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
 What?

384
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
 Yeah.

385
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
 It's amazing.

386
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
 Just back to the paintings very quickly.

387
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,920
 There's also a painting that we do have but we're never going to see the proper original of.

388
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,920
 It's the three Bronte sisters sitting in this painting and it was painted by Bramwell, their brother.

389
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
 And it's the only drawing that we have of the Bronte sisters.

390
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,920
 The interesting thing about it is that Bramwell used to be in it.

391
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,920
 He painted himself into the drawing but he lost confidence in himself.

392
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,920
 So he painted over himself by putting a pillar, just this huge pillar, randomly in the painting.

393
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,920
 And it was only when they looked closer at it that you could see, you know...

394
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
 He's peeking out behind it.

395
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, crying bad behind the pillar.

396
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:19,920
 That's a bit like, I think it's Bruegel's painting massacre of the Innocence. It was commissioned by a king but he wanted to make a political point about how inhumane this massacre had been.

397
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,920
 So the painting looked like a beautiful snow scene and there's just piles of snow everywhere and snow just falling down everywhere and children playing.

398
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,920
 And then if you look, they've done x-rays of the paint and if you look behind all the snow, there's countless dead bodies everywhere.

399
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
 Oh, wow.

400
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
 There was the painting that they just found recently.

401
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,920
 They did a restoration on this painting, which was of a beach scene and there was a crowd of people, static-radded area, they didn't know why.

402
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,920
 And then when they restored it, it revealed a beached whale, like a ginormous whale.

403
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,920
 Just laying there, which has obviously come onto the shore.

404
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
 What, and someone had painted over that?

405
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,920
 It was seen as being a bit unfashionable and a bit weird to have a big whale in the paintings.

406
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,920
 On whales, there was a new story recently and apparently this happens quite a lot.

407
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,920
 When you get a big beached whale, it can fill up with gas and it gets like really, really inflated and really tense.

408
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,920
 And then if you slightly prick it, I mean, you've got to kind of prick the whale in order to dispose it.

409
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,920
 It completely explodes and so there's footage of whales that explode their innards all over some videos on YouTube.

410
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
 Some really good, really entertaining videos, yeah.

411
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
 I have the best thing about beached whales.

412
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:31,920
 Well, I've been reading this, but whales' bones are the British Isles by a guy who has spent 30 years traveling around finding whales draw bones in arches and things like that.

413
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
 As gate posts and as umbrella stands and all of these things.

414
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,920
 In 1897, a whale was stranded near Bournemouth and it began to make this terrible smell.

415
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,920
 And according to the newspapers, one summer set found labourer climbed up on top of the body and declared,

416
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,920
 "I've gone 40 miles to see this ear whale and I'm going to walk from his head to his tail."

417
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,920
 He started on his walk, but the carcass said, "For some days, it's been undergoing a softening process."

418
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:04,920
 And the surface giving way, like rotten ice, the adventurous labourer sank into the blubber and was subsequently extricated from his unpleasant surroundings, a sadder, if not a wiser man.

419
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:17,920
 Okay, time for back number three. That's my fact. My fact this week during World War II, the US Navy diving manual contained detailed instructions for what to do if eaten by a giant clam.

420
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,920
 Was this really good? Yeah, dive with dignity.

421
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,920
 You're supposed to have very heavy duty scissors and cut its muscles from inside the mouth.

422
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,920
 I like because it was you who originally found this fact and when I said it to you yesterday, I was like, "Oh, where did you get this back from?"

423
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,920
 You were, "Oh, was a book. What was it called again?" It took you a few seconds, a few beats and you were, "Oh yeah, it's called "Eaten by a giant clam."

424
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
 Did anyone open the book?

425
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,920
 No, it's really interesting.

426
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,920
 But actually, the way to get away from a giant clam is just to pull your hand out because they don't close fully, do they?

427
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
 Yeah, so you can't be eaten by a giant clam.

428
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,920
 There is a crustacean they've found recently. I can't remember what it's called, which its teeth are the hardest known substance that nature produces.

429
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,920
 It's got these black-jotting out teeth. I'll see your teeth, I'll raise you Ray Winston.

430
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:17,920
 We should say, we are a far bigger threat to giant clams than now to us. We've ever fished them horribly and so now they're critically endangered in lots of places.

431
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:25,920
 It's amazing how long they take to grow as well. It takes them 11 months to get to just a couple of inches across and then to get one up to the weight of five pounds, it takes seven years.

432
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,920
 So really big ones that you see on the ocean floor could be 50 years old or 70 or 80.

433
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 I've seen it all.

434
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
 They've seen it all. Well, they've seen a very, very tiny bit of it all.

435
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,920
 The largest giant clams in history can be found under London. Wow.

436
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,920
 Really? Yeah, they're fossils. And now they're still alive.

437
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:52,920
 I know Ceramus, they're called and they can be found in the Cretaceous Galt's Clay underneath London and they were as big as two meters in size.

438
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
 Wow. So the height of a door.

439
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,920
 I think the largest one ever found was in Japan and it weighed 730 pounds, which is about as much as four adult men.

440
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,920
 Which is, it's big enough that you can understand why people slightly thought it was threatening, but it's quite fun to Google.

441
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:16,920
 If you do a Google book search for giant clams and then you refine it to the 19th century, that is quite entertaining because there are a lot of books of popular science, which one of the dangers of being eaten by a giant clam.

442
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:30,920
 Journal of popular science from 1896, which talks about how if you're diving a slack line or pipe may fall into the jaws of a giant clam, which close over it and hold the diver prisoner to his death alone in the dim ocean depths.

443
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,920
 The biggest pearl ever found was inside a giant clam, the pearl of Lao Tsu, and it was found by William Cobb.

444
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,920
 And he claimed that when they found that it was a guy was killed by a giant clam when they were trying to find the, oh yeah, I read that account.

445
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,920
 Yeah, apparently what happened was this guy, he was a direct diver and he went down, grabbed the hold of the pearl, it closed.

446
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,920
 And then he wouldn't let go of the pearl and he stayed there and drowned.

447
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,920
 He knew about the oldest clam ever, unsurprisingly we and you know, because we killed it, because that's what we do.

448
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:10,920
 My group of researchers in Iceland, they fished a load of clams up and it turns out that it was 507 years old when they took him up.

449
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
 He was born in 1499.

450
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
 Isn't that amazing?

451
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
 What would have been happening in 1499?

452
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
 Well, they called it Ming, because that was Ming dynasty China.

453
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,920
 Yeah, Henry VII had been king for a little while, the Battle of Bosworth was a recent memory 1885.

454
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,920
 I mean, you probably didn't have the recent memory of the Battle of Bosworth, but we've got no evidence he actually fought there.

455
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
 That's the thing, true.

456
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,920
 It'd be the one sort of like longevity diary that you've got hold of, it'd just be boring and so dull.

457
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:43,920
 Oh mate, you went through a lot and we've just got filtered, filtered some more water and 396.

458
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,920
 Drew another ring. Yes, 397.

459
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
 Oh, sorry, a female's is wrong, obviously, because they're hemaphrodites, aren't they?

460
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,920
 So they are male and female, but they can't fertilize themselves.

461
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,920
 So they just spurt out their eggs and sperm into the water and they let them find each other.

462
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,920
 But they can eject in one egg ejection, 500 million eggs, which is quite impressive.

463
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
 Whoa, so there's a lot of...

464
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:12,920
 Well, also, 98% of them do start as men as well and then they just transfer into whatever sex they want to.

465
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 A bit later. Leachers do that as well.

466
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,920
 Speaking of sea life, actually, I would urge people to look up blue lobsters.

467
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,920
 So I didn't realise that one in two million lobsters is born bright blue.

468
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 And so this is really exciting for lobster catches when they come across them.

469
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 And they are like properly bright blue and then one in 30 million is bright yellow.

470
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 Which I think is...

471
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 What is that?

472
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
 Or what gives us a genetic... Just a random mutation.

473
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
 Okay, right.

474
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,920
 If you search on the Wikipedia for unique lobsters, you'll find them.

475
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
 Again, massive list for...

476
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,920
 Tall lobsters. Heavy lobsters. Space lobsters.

477
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
 The...

478
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
 Space lobsters.

479
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
 That's a movie I want to know.

480
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
 Yeah.

481
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,920
 The smallest species of giant clam is called the boring clam.

482
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
 That's great.

483
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
 Because it boars into the coral.

484
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
 Oh, this is also cool.

485
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,920
 They found the fossil of not a shellfish from a long time ago.

486
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,920
 But a shark from a long time ago, which they think ate shellfish.

487
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
 Because it had these massive tooth plates, which it probably used to crush.

488
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
 Things like giant clams.

489
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,920
 It was a 10 meter long shark.

490
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
 They found it in Kansas, the fossil of it.

491
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
 Isn't that amazing?

492
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,920
 Just back very quickly to the fact that the Royal Navy did put

493
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
 how to escape a giant clam into their booklet.

494
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
 I do love when you just read stories of silliness.

495
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
 That seems silly to us, but maybe made sense at the time to the people.

496
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,920
 And I've got this story here, which is an old QI fact.

497
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,920
 But it's that in 1993, an army bomb disposal unit was called

498
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,920
 to investigate a suspicious-looking package outside the TA unit in Bristol.

499
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
 They blew it up with a controlled explosion.

500
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,920
 But only to discover that it was a parcel of leaflets explaining how to deal

501
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
 with suspicious packages.

502
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
 Exactly.

503
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
 Yeah.

504
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
 Whoops.

505
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
 Yeah, I like funny labels and unnecessary labels on products.

506
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,920
 Like, I think we talked before about the do not eat the iPod shuffle.

507
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
 Oh, yeah.

508
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
 But there are the good ones.

509
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,920
 There's a packet of screwdrivers, which is sold in America,

510
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,920
 where there's the warning at the top says not to be inserted into penis.

511
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,920
 Which is quite-- No, I don't believe it.

512
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
 I don't believe it.

513
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
 I don't believe it.

514
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 Well, why don't you believe it you think you should?

515
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
 Yeah.

516
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
 Clearly belongs there.

517
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
 And he runs to the bathroom.

518
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,920
 By that logic, almost everything in the world would have that label on it,

519
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
 except possibly medical swabs.

520
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,920
 And even they should have been labeled only sometimes in certain penis.

521
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,920
 We've covered before the Alfred Kinsey, the sexist sort of case.

522
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
 Yes, we have.

523
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
 All right, all right.

524
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,920
 OK, maybe it didn't say on his toothbrush.

525
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,920
 Or maybe as-- where he gripped it, it wore away the do not over time.

526
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
 Hang on, what's this label?

527
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

528
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,920
 OK, time for the final fact of the show and it is edge isn't key.

529
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,920
 My fact is that 100 used to be 120.

530
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
 What do you mean?

531
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 Ah, well, that's a great question, Don.

532
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 I mean that.

533
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
 Well, I mean a couple of things.

534
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:05,920
 So the word 100 drives from an old northward, 100th, which literally meant 120.

535
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,920
 And when people referred to 100 throughout the Middle Ages and up until the 17th century in lot of cases,

536
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,920
 they actually meant 120 because we worked, especially before the 14th century,

537
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,920
 on a duo decimal system or a base 12 system rather than a decimal system as we do now.

538
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
 So everything was divisible by 12.

539
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,920
 Is it true that they said a small 100 when they meant 100?

540
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
 Yeah.

541
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,920
 And they said 100 or a long 100 or a great 100 with 120.

542
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
 For 120, yeah.

543
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
 It's so weird.

544
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,920
 So when you saw the Roman numerals C throughout medieval times, that would usually refer to 120 or 100.

545
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
 But it wasn't actually that regular.

546
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 And so 100 can mean various different things depending on what you're referring to.

547
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,920
 So if you were counting drinking glasses or gunpowder weight, then if you said 100, then that would be 100.

548
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,920
 But if you were counting eggs or pins or fish, if you said 100, that would be 120.

549
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
 But then there were some commodities for which it was neither.

550
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,920
 So apparently in Roxburgshire and Selkukshire, 100 sheep or lambs was actually 106.

551
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
 You're making a hundred.

552
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,920
 And it was 100 for dried fish in some places was actually 160.

553
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,920
 And if you were talking about onions and garlic and you said 100, it was 225.

554
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,920
 So God knows how the hell anyone knew how much they'd order of anything.

555
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,920
 Interestingly, 1,000 comes from exactly the same etymological root as 100.

556
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,920
 So 1,000 literally means a strong 100.

557
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,920
 And again, in medieval times 1,000 was 1,200 usually, because it was a strong 100.

558
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
 It was 10 times 100, which was 120.

559
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,920
 So to be clear, it wasn't, it could be 12 times.

560
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,920
 Yes, so it's not, so I was going to say, to be clear, it wasn't a completely geodesymal system.

561
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
 It was sort of a half and half.

562
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
 So it wasn't all divided by 12.

563
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,920
 I think we've established this was not a system of any kind at all.

564
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
 It didn't have a lot of binding logical rules to it.

565
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,920
 This is why no one got anything done until about 1,800. And then we all sorted out the numbers and we found coal.

566
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
 And then we got over the industrial revolution.

567
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
 There is a tribe in the Amazon.

568
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,920
 It's the Mondurukul tribe.

569
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
 And they only count up to six.

570
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,920
 And as soon as they get up to six, the next number just becomes many.

571
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,920
 So if you're having like a dinner party and it's like how many people are coming?

572
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
 It's as many. It's like cool.

573
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
 I appreciate that, but I need to set out some chairs.

574
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,920
 What's the thing about Chinese use? It's a counting system in China and they use all the bones.

575
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,920
 Each knuckle is worth three things, because I think you have like three lines on your knuckles or something.

576
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
 And they can count up to about a million with that.

577
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
 The venerable bead had a good way of counting.

578
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,920
 He could count to a million by moving his hands up and down his body.

579
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
 Oh yeah, we've heard this all before.

580
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,920
 Excuse every 16 year, but just counting.

581
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:45,920
 His number for 90,000, for instance, was represented by grasping your lines with your left hand with your thumb towards the genitals.

582
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,920
 There's a great one called the Yupno in Papua New Guinea.

583
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
 It's an aboriginal tribe.

584
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,920
 And they have a counting system that goes up to 33.

585
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,920
 But they use their body like the way that we use our fingers to count to 10.

586
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,920
 They go further, but there's a logical kind of step for each one.

587
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,920
 So they count to 10 on their fingers and then their toes take them up to 20.

588
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,920
 Then their ears, eyes, nose and nostrils take them to 27.

589
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,920
 And then their left nipple is 28, right nipple 29, belly button 30.

590
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
 And then like where this is going.

591
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,920
 It heads into man territory, left testicle 31, right testicle 32, penis 33.

592
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,920
 So women just can't count as high?

593
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
 They get up to 27, unfortunately.

594
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
 It's stuck.

595
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
 Well they got nipples.

596
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
 And it's a 30 to 30.

597
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,920
 That'll be fantastic in bingo calling right testicle 32.

598
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,920
 I've just found the fact of the Chinese and counting using their finger joints.

599
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
 So it's not a million that they can get to.

600
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,920
 It is one less than 10 billion.

601
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
 Cool.

602
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,920
 I think the last few things that we've just said come from a book called Alex's Adventures in Numberland.

603
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
 It's by Alex Bellos.

604
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
 And his book is extraordinary.

605
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,920
 I haven't read his new one, but the first one is amazing to drag it back to hundreds for a minute.

606
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,920
 A hundred weight was 112 pounds.

607
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
 Still is?

608
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
 Still is, yeah.

609
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,920
 Yeah, but only after the 15th century before that it was 108 pounds.

610
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
 Oh.

611
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
 The whole thing is a nightmare.

612
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
 Yeah, it really is.

613
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
 Yeah.

614
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,920
 So when we get up to 10, when we're counting up to 10, we think we use the decimal system of counting.

615
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,920
 But if we properly did it, 11 should be one teen and 12 should be two teen.

616
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,920
 But we say 11 and 12 because we used to work on a semi-heat urodesimal system.

617
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
 Oh.

618
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 Also, the number 100 is the sum of the first nine prime numbers.

619
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
 Yeah, that's weird.

620
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,920
 Between two and 23, and all the seven in between, add them up.

621
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
 You got a hundred.

622
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
 Cool.

623
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,920
 The other thing is that if you add up all the numbers on a roulette wheel, they add to 666, which is a nice little fact as well.

624
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,920
 So you were saying that the word 100 came from old Norse, and that's it meant 120.

625
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,920
 We still spoke Norse in the UK until the 18th century.

626
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
 Did we?

627
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
 Wow.

628
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
 We were part of the UK speaking Norse.

629
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
 That was amazing.

630
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,920
 In the 1701, I think it was a censor, so there was certainly a report in 1701.

631
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,920
 And they said there were still a few monoglock Norse speakers who couldn't speak any other language apart from Norse.

632
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
 That is so cool.

633
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:10,920
 Well, the thing is, like, Shetland was belonging to the Norse people for a long time, and they pawned it to Scotland in the 15th century or something like that.

634
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,920
 So theoretically, they could buy it back if they wanted to.

635
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
 Wow.

636
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
 In the Roman army, you know, being decimated.

637
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
 Oh, yeah.

638
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,920
 Is where one in 10 men is killed. What I didn't know before is that it was a punishment for me.

639
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
 You thought it was a treat.

640
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
 The reward.

641
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
 Good news, boys.

642
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
 I thought it happened in war that you lose one man in 10.

643
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
 You say, oh, God, the Legion was decimated yesterday.

644
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
 Terrible result.

645
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
 But no, it's a punishment.

646
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:40,920
 But there was a minor punishment, which is called being centimated, which is where one person in 100 is put to death, and they choose it by lot.

647
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
 And the reason it's a punishment for everyone, isn't it?

648
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,920
 Because one in 10, if you're decimating as a general, is killed by the other nine in 10.

649
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
 So it's a punishment for everyone, I think.

650
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
 So nine people had to stone one of their people to death.

651
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
 Oh, dear.

652
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,920
 You know a word that doesn't exist, but does exist.

653
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
 Zillion.

654
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,920
 It exists, but there's no numerical...

655
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,920
 No, it's just a random, like, when you want to come up with something unfeasibly big.

656
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
 Yeah.

657
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,920
 There used to be a children's magazine called Zillions, and the Wikipedia entry for it just says it existed for several years until 2000,

658
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,920
 when it was folded into its parent magazine, "Consumer Reports".

659
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
 Another amazing.

660
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,920
 Happy 18th birthday. Here's "Consumer Reports".

661
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,920
 Okay, that's it. That's all our facts.

662
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,920
 Thanks so much, everyone, for listening to another episode of our show.

663
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,920
 If you want to get in contact with any of us about the things that we said over the course of this episode,

664
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,920
 you can find us all on Twitter.

665
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
 Andy, you can be got on @AndrewHunterM.
