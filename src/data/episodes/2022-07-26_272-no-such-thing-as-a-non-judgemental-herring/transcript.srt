 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,060
 as a Fish, a Weekly Podcast.

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,440
 This week, coming to you live, from Edinburgh!

 [CHEERING]

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,300
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,820
 I am sitting here with Anacesansky, Andrew Huntson Murray,

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,100
 and James Harkin.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,460
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,460
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,140
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,820
 Andy, my fact is that in 18th century Scotland,

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,380
 people believed that herring would punish people

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,380
 for adultery by leaving the area where the adultery

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,180
 had occurred.

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,420
 [LAUGHTER]

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,140
 This is a joke.

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
 Wait, wait, wait.

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,540
 They're not in the bedroom.

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,060
 They're not in the room, sorry. [LAUGHTER]

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,300
 No. It's disgusting.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,620
 [LAUGHTER]

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,220
 But people at home, that was the amazing herring impression.

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,180
 That was a good grief.

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,860
 I mean, if anything, that would be a relief for the adultery.

28
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,340
 Can this just wouldn't be-- Yeah, it's true.

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,900
 Once the herring flops out, you can really get down to it.

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,060
 And the old saying goes.

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,500
 [LAUGHTER]

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,580
 Well, we got there quite clearly anyway.

33
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,980
 God.

34
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,220
 So this is from a book.

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,620
 It's called Herring Tales by an author called Donald Murray.

36
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,580
 And so this is because herring used to be absolutely

37
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,860
 enormous.

38
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,500
 So in the early 20th century, there were three million barrels

39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,620
 coming into Scotland every single year.

40
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,660
 But the thing is, they're fickle, OK?

41
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,500
 So they would frequently appear in massive numbers

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,220
 in one year.

43
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,460
 And then the next year, they wouldn't be there anymore.

44
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,300
 They'd disappear.

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,940
 And so in 1703, there was an author whose name, genuinely,

46
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,380
 was Martin Martin, and he wrote about this superstition.

47
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,180
 He said, "It is a general observation all

48
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,780
 Scotland over that if a quarrel happened on the coast

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,780
 where herring is caught and that blood be drawn violently,

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,060
 then the herring go away."

51
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,900
 So it was true of violence.

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,780
 And it was also true of adultery.

53
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,500
 Oh, OK.

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,620
 They're very judgmental, famously herring.

55
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,580
 Yeah.

56
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,060
 They do turn up in massive numbers when they do turn up, don't they?

57
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,900
 They really come in a crew.

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,900
 I think we think it could be the largest gathering

59
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,460
 of animals anywhere, herring schools.

60
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,140
 So they gather in groups of up to 250 million.

61
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,140
 They've only quite recently been counted.

62
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,060
 So the schools at the shows will be 40 kilometers wide.

63
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,420
 And we're not totally sure.

64
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,340
 They do have a synchronized spawning.

65
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,780
 They get together at night.

66
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,900
 That's a terrible Olympics event, isn't it?

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,420
 [LAUGHTER]

68
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,740
 That's one at 2 AM.

69
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,180
 [LAUGHTER]

70
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,940
 Yeah, so they do their little dances, and then they spawn.

71
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,860
 They count them.

72
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,180
 Imagine having that job.

73
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,580
 Yeah, it was quite--

74
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,620
 There was using different radar from different ships

75
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,580
 and bouncing it off all of them, I think.

76
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,380
 Computers did it.

77
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,660
 There wasn't a guy who was there making a tally.

78
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,540
 So supposedly, in the 12th century off the coast of Scotland,

79
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,980
 there were so many herring in the water

80
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,180
 that boats would sometimes get stuck in the water.

81
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
 No way.

82
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,300
 Oh, what's that?

83
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,300
 This was a guy called Saxo Grammaticus, who wrote in--

84
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
 [LAUGHTER]

85
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,420
 This is true.

86
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,940
 He was an author.

87
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,140
 He was in 1204.

88
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,500
 He wrote, "The whole sound contains such plentiful shells

89
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,900
 that sometimes boats striking them have difficulty

90
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,140
 in rowing clear and no fishing gear,

91
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,660
 but the hands is needed to take them."

92
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,820
 So you could just reach in and grab a herring.

93
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,060
 Because they're quite thickly packed, aren't they?

94
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,020
 So you know, in some shells of fish,

95
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,300
 you podge a finger and they'll scarper off.

96
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,140
 But herring, I think, because they line up

97
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,660
 where your nose will be lined up with a torso

98
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,060
 of the bloke in front of you.

99
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,060
 So basically, if you can imagine, there are almost no gaps

100
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,700
 between them in a shell, because they're sort of like a jigsaw

101
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,660
 perfectly fit together.

102
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,740
 So it does mean that if you come across them

103
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,180
 and you are fishing, if you're in the middle of that group,

104
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,540
 you cannot move to one side or the other.

105
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,940
 You'll just completely start off.

106
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,460
 Oh, wow.

107
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,140
 So you can just scoop them all right up.

108
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,740
 But Fisher people are very superstitious, aren't they?

109
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,540
 Especially in Scotland, I've found.

110
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,460
 In Scotland, they used to, if they weren't catching fish,

111
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,060
 they thought they would have to show this sea

112
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,300
 what they were trying to do.

113
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,700
 And then the sea would work it out.

114
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,460
 And then it would give them some fish.

115
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,740
 So as a last ditch effort, you would get one of your fellow

116
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,260
 fishermen and throw him into the water and then catch him

117
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,620
 with a rod.

118
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,860
 And then the sea would go, oh, that's what you're trying to do.

119
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
 Really?

120
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,860
 Yeah.

121
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,260
 That is amazing.

122
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,460
 Wow.

123
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,180
 That's like having to take a crap in your cat's cat litter box

124
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,180
 in order to--

125
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,180
 Sam, what?

126
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,580
 He doesn't even have a cat.

127
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,180
 Wait, you know, to be like--

128
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,500
 I understand the principle.

129
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,060
 I'm saying, have you done it?

130
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,580
 Wow.

131
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,580
 No, once.

132
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,900
 This is kind of related to James' thing

133
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,060
 about fishing people, fishermen out of the sea again.

134
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,500
 But this is a related tradition, several hundred years ago,

135
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,980
 which is that it's bad luck to save someone from drowning.

136
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:25,740
 Because that sucks when your job's a lifeguard at the moment.

137
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,220
 Yeah, because the sea needs it sacrifice.

138
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,820
 So if you have picked the work experience fishermen

139
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,220
 to throw into the water, you should check this.

140
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,420
 So people genuinely wouldn't save people

141
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,580
 because they thought it was bad luck?

142
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,420
 I don't know how much it happened.

143
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,940
 Well, it might be that there's one fisherman

144
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,860
 who's been getting on everyone's nerves for a long time.

145
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,860
 But if he falls in, I'm going to--

146
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,660
 Oh, sorry, no.

147
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,860
 There's nothing we can do about it.

148
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,540
 So there is--

149
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,740
 there is another bit of superstition in the Scottish Lowlands

150
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,580
 and that it is, by saying, good morning to someone,

151
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,140
 it's considered bad luck to fishermen.

152
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,260
 And so there are some fishermen apparently

153
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,660
 who would walk down the street.

154
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,100
 And if someone says, good morning to them,

155
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
 they'll go off, fuck sake, and just go home.

156
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,180
 [LAUGHTER]

157
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,940
 I thought it was that you'd go home and start again.

158
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,980
 Oh, and go back and you sort of--

159
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,820
 OK, so you have to press a reset button on the expedition.

160
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,660
 Are the sea-faring Scottish superstitions

161
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,300
 there's in the Hebrides tradition of tossing porridge

162
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,900
 into the sea, which I didn't know about?

163
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
 And this particularly happens on what's

164
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,900
 called big porridge day or great gruel Thursday.

165
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,380
 And I think--

166
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,620
 Big porridge day.

167
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,860
 Big porridge day.

168
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,740
 This is from the 19th century book of customs.

169
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,140
 I don't know if everyone still does it.

170
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,060
 But this is--

171
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,540
 it happened in places like Iona.

172
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,620
 And basically, it was-- you'd make a big dish of porridge with some butter

173
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,140
 and lots of other delicious ingredients.

174
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,460
 And then you overturn the whole thing into the sea.

175
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,220
 And that's thought to attract really valuable seaweed,

176
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,340
 because it seems like a bab swapped to me, seaweed for porridge.

177
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,980
 But they want to eat and cook with seaweed.

178
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,220
 But also, the seaweed is used as a fertiliser, I think, right?

179
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,820
 Fertilizer, yes.

180
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,900
 That'll be it.

181
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,580
 And also, it was on Monday Thursday.

182
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,060
 And so apparently, Monday Thursday was doubly holy in the Hebrides,

183
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,780
 because not only did it have the whole Easter thing,

184
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,500
 but also it was when you did the porridge seaweed swap.

185
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,260
 [LAUGHTER]

186
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,100
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact, very shortly.

187
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,220
 If you work in the herring industry,

188
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,060
 you can develop asthma from all the herring protein in the air.

189
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,820
 So you get a condition which is called herring lung.

190
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,580
 No.

191
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,540
 Yeah, just absolutely microscopic particles of it in the air.

192
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,180
 Well, there used to be a really big thing.

193
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,020
 The herring girls was the sort of collective name

194
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,780
 for the women who processed herring,

195
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,620
 who's a really important job.

196
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,060
 And on a Saturday night, apparently,

197
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,620
 they would have to wash their hair six times

198
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,180
 to get the smell out before they could go out,

199
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,260
 because you're just working in herring

200
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,060
 and gusting herring all week long.

201
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,060
 And did you know it was because of herring

202
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,340
 that probably the most important collection of musical manuscripts

203
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,140
 was saved, herring saved them.

204
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,620
 So this was, after the Second World War,

205
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,900
 there were loads of original Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach manuscripts.

206
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,740
 All the famous ones you've heard of, all the big Beethoven symphonies,

207
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,420
 all the Mozart's and all of them.

208
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,580
 They were moved from the Berlin Museum,

209
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,460
 because people were worried about the fate that might befall them.

210
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,540
 They were moved, and then they were sort of lost,

211
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,780
 as things happened in the war, and they all disappeared.

212
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,220
 And then, in 1973, there was this guy called Dr. Peter Whitehead

213
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,020
 who was working in the Natural History Museum.

214
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,020
 And he was a biologist, and he was just obsessed

215
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,100
 with finding this picture of this herring.

216
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,100
 So he kept on reading in really ancient documents

217
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,540
 about something that was either herring or an anchovy.

218
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,460
 And he couldn't find the original picture

219
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,220
 that they were all referring to to deduce which of those two it was.

220
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,340
 And he was obsessed with this.

221
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,380
 And so he looked all over Europe to find this ancient picture.

222
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,940
 And finally, he ended up in a library and crack off

223
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,380
 going through this massive crate.

224
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,220
 And he was like, oh, my God, I found this 1648 picture,

225
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,460
 and it's definitely a herring.

226
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,700
 I've absolutely nailed it.

227
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,300
 Thank God, by the way, sorry, I don't know who to tell,

228
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,660
 but I've also found all the old manuscripts,

229
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,020
 original manuscripts of Beethoven Mozart.

230
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,180
 [LAUGHTER]

231
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,380
 But have you seen that herring?

232
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,300
 And so we're still herring that music today.

233
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,500
 [APPLAUSE]

234
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,420
 Yep, it deserved a boof.

235
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,620
 All right, it's time for fact number two, and that is James.

236
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,900
 OK, my fact this week is that the most fashionable person

237
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,220
 of the 16th century was an accountant from Germany.

238
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,940
 [LAUGHTER]

239
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,060
 Doesn't it seem likely?

240
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,020
 Well, it is true, I think.

241
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,900
 [LAUGHTER]

242
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,980
 That was an early backtrack.

243
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,380
 No, he was called Matthias Schwarz.

244
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,020
 He was born in 1497, died in 1574.

245
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,740
 And he was a German accountant, but he is most well-known

246
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,500
 for compiling a book called Kleidung's Buchlein,

247
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,420
 or Buchlein, which means Book of Clothes.

248
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,100
 And it's probably the world's first fashion book.

249
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,940
 And he basically took pictures of the drawings

250
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,020
 of every single thing he ever wore for 40 years.

251
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,300
 And he wore unbelievably amazing clothes.

252
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,260
 And he was probably the first person in history

253
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,060
 to be interested in fashion as like a cultural thing,

254
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,100
 rather than just to show off to their friends.

255
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,740
 Yeah, he was, yeah, amazing.

256
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,860
 And he commissioned these watercolors, didn't he?

257
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,460
 So he had artists just come constantly paint him,

258
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,540
 which really pissed me off actually the independent cover

259
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,140
 of this.

260
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,140
 And they kept on talking about it as fashion's first selfies.

261
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,140
 And I would say if you've commissioned a person

262
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,820
 to do a watercolor painting of you,

263
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,580
 there was so many levels on which that was not

264
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,420
 a selfie.

265
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,940
 No, but he-- so what, he backtracked it to his earlier years.

266
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,460
 So he commissioned-- he started it when he was at the age of 23.

267
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,820
 So he worked backwards and got a bunch of those commissioned.

268
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,260
 He also did a nude of himself.

269
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,260
 So in this book, there's a front side nude and a backside nude

270
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,620
 kind of like, you know, those kids books

271
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
 he used to get, where you would put the clothes on for a bit.

272
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,660
 No, we're chartered, Dan.

273
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,180
 We're chartered, you had.

274
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,460
 We're back to the kitty litter, aren't we?

275
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:02,020
 It's sort of like you've got the body, and you can put different clothes

276
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,220
 on them with magnetic strips.

277
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,260
 It's probably a nude 16th century German accountant, though.

278
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:13,260
 I mean, what a world it would be.

279
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,420
 Because his clothes were amazing.

280
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
 They were so cool.

281
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,380
 So it was really interesting, because this

282
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,660
 was a time where there were lots of legal restrictions

283
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,060
 on what you could wear depending on your position in society.

284
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,980
 So you couldn't dress more fancily than your employers.

285
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,340
 But he was the head accountant for the Fugger family,

286
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,860
 who were a very powerful banking family.

287
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,780
 And they were very worried about being seen as too rich.

288
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,020
 So they tried to tone down what they were wearing.

289
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,500
 So they didn't seem too extravagant.

290
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,700
 And so he had to come up with all these clever ways

291
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,220
 of showing off fashionably.

292
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
 So there are these things called pinks, which

293
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,900
 is where you make a tiny slash, just a tiny, tiny cut in fabric.

294
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
 So you can see the color of the fabric beneath.

295
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,060
 And his doublet--

296
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,660
 so that's what that's the sort of upper trousers.

297
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,820
 No, the doublet is like the long-legged shrunken waistcoat thing.

298
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,780
 Sorry, the jacket is doublet.

299
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,500
 It had 4,800 pinks in it, which were all handmade.

300
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,540
 How much doublet was there left after you put

301
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,340
 all those in 800s in it?

302
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,140
 Just very quickly on the Fugger family.

303
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,180
 So the guy, the guy who started it

304
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,300
 was called Jacob Fugger.

305
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,420
 And he was, genuinely, the richest man

306
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,620
 who has ever lived.

307
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,700
 He, if he was the right rich Fugger, wasn't he?

308
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,260
 Yeah, yeah, he was born from nothing.

309
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,540
 His dad and his mother Fugger had no--

310
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,900
 [LAUGHTER]

311
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,700
 Had virtually no hotel pitch.

312
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,980
 They virtually had no money.

313
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,980
 And he built it all in his lifetime.

314
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,860
 And if you took the amount that he had,

315
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,180
 and you translated it into today's money,

316
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,860
 he was worth 400 billion.

317
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,820
 Wait, are we going to get a currency on that?

318
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,860
 Oh, what's this in?

319
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,620
 Yen?

320
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,540
 American Derek.

321
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,860
 [LAUGHTER]

322
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,860
 Sorry, yeah.

323
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,260
 He was the richest man who ever lived.

324
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,860
 But I mean, so he was probably the most fashionable person.

325
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,420
 But the fashion's around this time.

326
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,260
 And Renaissance fashions were quite exciting, weren't they?

327
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,300
 So we had, I think, one of my favorite was the Henin.

328
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,060
 This was a really early fashion.

329
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,700
 This was basically medieval.

330
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,700
 And it was the, if you look at kind of Renaissance

331
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,660
 and pre-Renaissance art, it's that weird steeple

332
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,220
 that women wear on their heads.

333
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,620
 So you know, they wear a massive long cone that

334
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,740
 comes up on something falls off the back of it.

335
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,580
 And they would go up to a meter high.

336
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,860
 And people were criticised for wearing these,

337
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,940
 because they thought they looked really ridiculous, which they did.

338
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,020
 And also, it was kind of a sign of lavishness.

339
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,700
 And I was reading about a friar called Thomas Connect,

340
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,100
 who would give pocket money and pardons

341
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,540
 to any boy who was able to get one of these off a woman's head.

342
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,580
 So he paid these little boys to go and pull down

343
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,940
 these monstrous headdresses and face the woman down.

344
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,300
 In the Italian city of Ovietto, this is also

345
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,500
 during the Renaissance fashion, there were rules

346
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,740
 again about what you could wear.

347
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,340
 So your cleavage as a woman could not descend past a certain point.

348
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,460
 And the way they did it was with the measurement of the hands,

349
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,100
 it was two fingers width below the supra-sternal notch

350
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
 on your chest.

351
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,380
 And that's basically the front of your collarbone here,

352
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,100
 your clavicle there.

353
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,340
 So it's two fingers width.

354
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,540
 I mean, your cleavage is going nowhere near that.

355
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,860
 So one's cleavage is going nowhere near that.

356
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,180
 So it would be very unusual woman who

357
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,860
 had cleavage that went to an inch below her clavicle.

358
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,820
 I mean, is it going to press coming out of your neck?

359
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,580
 There's just on breasts.

360
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,220
 Another thing in the 16th--

361
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,980
 another thing on the 16th century was that there

362
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,940
 was a fashion to just have your top open and breasts out.

363
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,420
 And there's an account from 1593, the French ambassador,

364
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,820
 Andre Horout, described meeting Queen Elizabeth the First,

365
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,100
 and arriving with her having--

366
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,940
 We have naked boobs out.

367
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,300
 Yeah, the Queen Elizabeth the First, yeah.

368
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,060
 She was 65 at the time.

369
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,700
 Was she?

370
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,900
 Yeah.

371
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,660
 This is-- he wrote this in his diary.

372
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,260
 So whether this is true or not, we don't know.

373
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,180
 But he did say that.

374
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,700
 Do you have what he said?

375
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,340
 Yeah, he said, kept the front of her dress open

376
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,060
 so one could see the whole of her bosom.

377
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,460
 Could see all her belly to her navel.

378
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,140
 So it was just an outright open shirt.

379
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,620
 And it was seen, according to his diaries, as less a risque thing

380
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,740
 than a woman showing her ankles at the time.

381
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,060
 Yeah, ankles were pretty bad, disgusting.

382
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,220
 Well, there was actually a fashion in France about 200 years

383
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,780
 after that to have sort of nakedness showing through your outfit.

384
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,020
 So I really didn't know about this.

385
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,380
 But this was in the 1790s, straight after the reign of terror,

386
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,060
 when a lot of the aristocracy had been wiped out and beheaded.

387
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,340
 The aristocracy remained fought back by developing

388
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,980
 these lavish fashions.

389
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,180
 And they were known as the uncroyabla and the merveoes.

390
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,780
 So the men were the Incredibles and the women were the marvellouss.

391
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,900
 And they would sport these ridiculous fashions.

392
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,220
 So they would go around with these giant monocles.

393
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,820
 They'd have rings on all their toes.

394
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,260
 Yeah, probably like the size of your face.

395
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,540
 They wore huge hats with dog ears coming off them.

396
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
 And they pretended to have a lisp.

397
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,140
 And they walked around with hunches,

398
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,820
 because they decided that was a funny thing to do.

399
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,980
 And it was just this weird thing.

400
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,100
 And it was all this comment on you bastards.

401
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,980
 You've like murdered our mates.

402
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,660
 Some of them there was a fashion to brush their hair forward

403
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,420
 and shave off the back a bit of their hair

404
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,060
 as if the guillotine was about to fall.

405
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,260
 And some of them said we're a red necklace to show their red--

406
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,780
 Yeah, like their heads are chopped off.

407
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,700
 But yeah, it was amazing.

408
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,300
 They had these balls, which are called Baldevik team,

409
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,860
 which were balls which only the children or the families

410
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,740
 of people who've been beheaded could attend.

411
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
 But they were super cool.

412
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,460
 They were just promising around the streets of Paris

413
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,220
 in these crazy outfits, saying, fuck you.

414
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,300
 Wow.

415
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,620
 In 1463, England's parliament ruled

416
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,940
 that men were no longer allowed to wear short coats

417
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,180
 that did not cover their penises.

418
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,300
 They said we've had enough of that.

419
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,700
 We've had a great time with the parties over.

420
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,260
 Were they wearing trousers?

421
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,340
 Were they like Donald Duck?

422
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,100
 Was it a--

423
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:09,460
 They kind of were like Donald Duck.

424
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,220
 Wait, so sorry.

425
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,500
 They were naked from the waist down.

426
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,700
 They were not completely naked from the waist down.

427
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,660
 So they had a hoesery?

428
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,540
 They had a hoes.

429
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,020
 But hoes is just tight, really.

430
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,340
 They just had tights that were making it very obvious what

431
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,860
 was where.

432
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,020
 And the jackets kept getting shorter and shorter and shorter.

433
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,180
 And eventually, you could just see lunchbox.

434
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,420
 And the thing was, and that was when

435
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,740
 cob pieces came in as a fashionable thing,

436
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,220
 because they weren't allowed to show their genitals

437
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,980
 or their bulges or whatever.

438
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,500
 And they didn't want to have long coats that covered up.

439
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,180
 They still wanted to have the fashionable ones,

440
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,340
 so they would have the cob pieces instead.

441
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,300
 Really, because I always thought the cob pieces

442
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,820
 the most weird thing that we just accept that people just--

443
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,580
 I thought was to show off your genitals.

444
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,660
 And I think then it became something to draw attention to it,

445
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,580
 and you'd have no Apple one.

446
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,180
 They got bigger and bigger and bigger in the 16th century

447
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,260
 before disappearing completely by the end of the century.

448
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,500
 So this is really weird thing where they get bigger,

449
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,860
 bigger, bigger, bigger, and then suddenly

450
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,060
 smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller.

451
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,180
 I think we can all--

452
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,740
 Well, the reason they think they went out

453
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,260
 is because there was a new thing that came

454
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,700
 in at the end of the 16th century called a "Pee's Cod Belly."

455
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,380
 And what that was, it was like, you kind of stuff stuff

456
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,100
 inside your shirt.

457
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,220
 Imagine you have a shirt here, you stuff it down.

458
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,260
 And then it kind of makes you a little bit fatter,

459
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,180
 but then it goes down to a peak where your genitals are.

460
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,700
 And so they're fighting over the same real estate kind of thing.

461
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,540
 Yes.

462
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,940
 And so they had this kind of thing,

463
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,020
 but it meant there was no space for the cob piece anymore.

464
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,460
 And they were called-- and women wore them as well.

465
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,980
 They were called stomachers.

466
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,580
 And sometimes there would be a fashion

467
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,140
 to wear a bigger stomacher.

468
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,340
 And that would make you look a little bit pregnant.

469
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,060
 And then sometimes not.

470
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,340
 And the reason they were called "Pee's Cod"

471
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,500
 is because they looked a little bit like a pea pod

472
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,060
 because they kind of tapered at the bottom.

473
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,500
 And they were a very potent sexual symbol.

474
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,460
 And this is one of the reasons that the phrase "shelling peas"

475
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,820
 became a euphemism for sex.

476
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,620
 Really?

477
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,540
 You did it?

478
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,060
 It did.

479
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,660
 Well, I mean, it was in the 16th century.

480
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,300
 And some of us haven't moved on.

481
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,860
 But also because pea fields, people

482
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,460
 used to have sex in pea fields as well.

483
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,660
 Of course it is.

484
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,420
 Peas were just very sexy.

485
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,900
 Peas were just very sexy in the 16th century.

486
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,220
 Beds were hard to come by.

487
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,580
 You know that outfit that you see a lot of in medieval depictions

488
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,500
 of gestures and so on.

489
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,180
 It's the two-color outfit that is horizontal--

490
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
 Like a highlight.

491
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,980
 Yes, exactly.

492
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,900
 So yellow on this side, red on this side,

493
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,180
 completely down the middle.

494
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,900
 That is called my party outfit.

495
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,860
 What do you mean?

496
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,780
 Well, no.

497
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,580
 No, we do-- yeah, we've been to a party with you.

498
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,700
 That's what you were, that's great.

499
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,740
 So it's MI, so I guess me, technically, and P-A-R-T-I,

500
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,300
 me party outfits.

501
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,380
 Oh, and is it like, it separates me.

502
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,460
 It parts me.

503
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,500
 No, it's probably Italian or something, but--

504
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,700
 Yeah, but probably an Italian means this parts me.

505
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,380
 No?

506
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,140
 I think-- no, I think it's Jordi, actually.

507
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,140
 [LAUGHTER]

508
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,540
 Where's my party outfit?

509
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,700
 It feels like-- it feels like if we talk about a fashion,

510
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,980
 we have to talk about Bob Rommel, who was the creator of fashion,

511
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,940
 even today.

512
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,620
 So Bob Rommel was the most fashionable man

513
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,620
 at the turn of the 19th century, basically, wasn't he?

514
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,500
 Very early 19th century.

515
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,140
 And he used to take five hours to get dressed each day.

516
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,100
 He polishes boots in-- I know.

517
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,500
 How does he get anything else done?

518
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,940
 Polishes boots in champagne.

519
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,700
 He had three separate hairdressers, one for his temples,

520
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,140
 one for his forehead, and one for the back of his head.

521
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,140
 That's incredible.

522
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,340
 They must have all--

523
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,420
 were they doing it at the same time?

524
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,540
 It's not really like a game of consequences,

525
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,500
 where you do one of them, and then you have to work out

526
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,260
 what they want after that.

527
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,420
 That's really how they match.

528
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,220
 There should be turf war as well,

529
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,300
 between the temples and the top, and then the top and the back.

530
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,820
 Yeah.

531
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,620
 Yeah.

532
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,980
 We've very tense back there.

533
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
 Yeah.

534
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,100
 And you also had separate glove makers.

535
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,740
 So we had a glove maker for the palm, glove maker

536
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,220
 for the fingers, and glove maker for the thumb.

537
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,220
 No.

538
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,740
 You've got to have-- because it's different skills

539
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,060
 making the thumb to making the fingers.

540
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,940
 It's very different.

541
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,300
 Very different, yes.

542
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
 Doesn't feel like it.

543
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,020
 Wow.

544
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,260
 You don't know fashion.

545
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,980
 That's true.

546
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,460
 We're going to have to-- oh, we're going to have to move on,

547
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,300
 basically.

548
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,740
 Well, I should just say, Bob Rommel is the reason

549
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,980
 that you're dressed like you're dressed today, all of you.

550
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,860
 And because everyone looks absurd until he came along,

551
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,100
 they all wore these powdered wigs and these big ruffs

552
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,340
 and frills and colors.

553
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,700
 And he basically said, take all the colors away,

554
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,180
 all the textures, what you want is

555
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,740
 neutrally colored clothes that are cut with precision.

556
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,780
 He banned perfume and jewelry for men.

557
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,100
 And men basically dressed like that today.

558
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,980
 That's why you're all stuck in these.

559
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,020
 Yeah, but then it still took him five hours to get ready.

560
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,580
 He got rid of all that stuff, and he's

561
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,380
 like, but it's still going to take me five hours

562
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,620
 to put on a pair of trousers and a shirt.

563
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,940
 But it was exclusively dating herring ladies

564
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,380
 who are still shampooing for the first time.

565
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,140
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

566
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,300
 And that is Chazinsky.

567
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,260
 My fact is, the North Pole is moving so fast

568
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,860
 that we can't keep up.

569
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,540
 So what?

570
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,860
 The next polar expedition is going to go on indefinitely.

571
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,020
 They're just going to be running after it.

572
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,540
 Chasing it.

573
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,420
 This is a real worry.

574
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,980
 This is the magnetic North Pole we're talking about.

575
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,940
 And specifically, when I say we can't keep up,

576
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,420
 our phones can't keep up, our maps can't keep up.

577
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,340
 So there's this thing called the World Magnetic Model.

578
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,700
 And basically, this is the model that works out where North is.

579
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,820
 And it's updated periodically.

580
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,020
 And it was supposed to be updated, I believe, in 2020.

581
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,140
 And then they had a quick look at where the North Pole

582
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,140
 has got to since 2015 or something, and it was last updated.

583
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,180
 And it's moved so fast.

584
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,660
 They've got to update it now because all of our maps are on.

585
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,540
 And so this is announced by scientists

586
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,300
 at the National Center for Environmental Information.

587
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,620
 And they said, because of unplanned variations

588
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,260
 in the Arctic region, it's fucked.

589
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,420
 If you tried to get to the North Pole--

590
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,220
 Sorry, that's the part of the official press release.

591
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:14,020
 I slipped out of the quote marks without making that clear.

592
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,780
 On the current model, if you tried to fly to the North Pole

593
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,620
 using your phones without the update,

594
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,380
 you'd end up 25 miles away from it.

595
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,220
 Which is quite far.

596
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,660
 Oh, I could walk 25 miles in the Arctic.

597
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,700
 Do we know why it's moved?

598
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,820
 No, we know it's always fluctuated

599
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,260
 because we think it's because there's

600
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,220
 this big molten core of iron in the middle of the earth,

601
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,780
 and it's sloshing around.

602
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,740
 And so that is causing this magnetism to slightly slosh around.

603
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,700
 But we really don't know why it's accelerating so fast.

604
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,180
 So it's suddenly slightly massively speeding up.

605
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,060
 Over 30 years, the rate of distance

606
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,300
 move per year has sped up from 15 kilometers a year.

607
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,420
 It was moving to 55 kilometers a year.

608
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,500
 And no, we don't know why.

609
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,940
 We don't know what's happening in the middle of the earth.

610
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
 It's causing this.

611
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,060
 Just to make it clear, this is not the normal North Pole,

612
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,260
 which is the bit that the earth spins on.

613
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,820
 This is where the magnets go.

614
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,820
 I mean, I don't know who you are to label one normal.

615
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,420
 But yeah, so it's not the geographic North Pole, which is--

616
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,500
 Give it to where your compass will.

617
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,380
 The top of the earth is where your compass is going to be.

618
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,380
 Right, I believe that the magnetic South Pole is not moving.

619
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,580
 It is moving a little bit.

620
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,540
 It's not moving as much.

621
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,100
 Yeah, but it's slowly getting more out of kilter.

622
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,540
 So the opposite of the magnetic North Pole

623
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,060
 is not the magnetic South Pole.

624
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,060
 Yeah.

625
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,260
 So it's crazy.

626
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,340
 I read that.

627
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,780
 So you were saying that they had to redo it and announce it.

628
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,620
 So they finally got all the stuff together,

629
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,020
 all the information about where the magnetic North Pole is.

630
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
 They were about to release the information

631
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,500
 for people who needed it.

632
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,380
 And then suddenly, in America, that government shutdown

633
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,340
 happened.

634
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,740
 And they weren't able to release it.

635
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,060
 So they had to sit in limbo with the updated information

636
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,980
 and anyone who is 25 miles closer to the North Pole

637
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,380
 than they thought was suddenly unable to access it.

638
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:00,900
 Yeah.

639
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,340
 It affected millions of people.

640
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,500
 And I think it's moving towards Russia, isn't it?

641
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,420
 It's currently still in Canadian territory,

642
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,380
 but it's moving up towards Siberia.

643
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,020
 Putin's declaring war on it.

644
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,740
 Well, I read that in 2001, Russian researchers

645
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,980
 made the world's biggest magnet.

646
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,820
 And I'm not saying that that's what caused it.

647
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:29,140
 But they created a 2,800 Tesla magnetic field

648
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,620
 by getting a massive magnet and then

649
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,380
 doing a massive explosion around it.

650
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,620
 So it really pushed it in.

651
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,500
 And this was the biggest magnetism

652
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,060
 that had ever been created on Earth.

653
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
 Wow.

654
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,180
 And I'm not saying it's anything to do with it.

655
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,660
 Well, I didn't know we were in the business of encouraging conspiracy

656
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,700
 theorists.

657
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,300
 But what did he gain from seizing the North Pole, though?

658
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,300
 Santa.

659
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,500
 [LAUGHTER]

660
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,780
 Give me that good bad list.

661
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
 Trump.

662
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,780
 Trump.

663
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:07,900
 So I was looking at sort of the history of the North Pole.

664
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,700
 And people really didn't know what was up there in the past,

665
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,740
 because nobody had been there.

666
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,700
 So this is related to the Hollow Earth theory.

667
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,940
 We're on conspiracy theories.

668
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,340
 So this was proposed by Edmund Halley of Halley's

669
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,020
 comet fame in 1692.

670
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,940
 He suggested the planet was a series of shells

671
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,700
 inside each other, because that would explain

672
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
 anomalous astronomical data, you know,

673
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,500
 when stars appear to move back and forwards.

674
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,900
 So that was his great explanation for it.

675
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,660
 But this theory got taken on by other people.

676
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
 And it evolved.

677
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,580
 And in 1812, there was a war veteran called John--

678
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,100
 I think his name was Simms, S-Y-D-L-M--

679
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,780
 and he wrote that the Earth had massive holes

680
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,900
 at the North and South Pole, and that that was the way

681
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,700
 into the Hollow Earth.

682
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,660
 And that the entire Earth inside, that he called them Simms

683
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,780
 Holes, and he campaigned to launch an expedition

684
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,740
 to the North Pole so that he could go into the Simms Holes

685
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,180
 and explore what was on the inside of the Earth.

686
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,180
 And Congress voted on funding--

687
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,180
 Did they?

688
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,620
 Yeah, I mean, they voted against funding it.

689
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,420
 But Hitler was obsessed with it, wasn't it?

690
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,300
 Hitler-- yeah, he had expeditions.

691
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,620
 I think I'm right in saying this.

692
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,020
 I only know this from reading a tie in Indiana Jones

693
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,180
 book called Indiana Jones in the Hollow Earth.

694
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,140
 But so it's good.

695
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,740
 But in that, Hitler does go exploring

696
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,060
 for the Hollow Earth had actual expeditions.

697
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,900
 Oh, yeah.

698
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,220
 We have to have some basic standards

699
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,340
 of extensible sources.

700
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,300
 But they're written based on history,

701
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,420
 like with the young of the Covenant and the aliens.

702
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,460
 They came back to a young town in his gestor's costume,

703
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,260
 squatting over the catalysts of trade,

704
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,940
 reading Hitler Indiana Jones stories.

705
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,860
 You know, not only is it the North Pole

706
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,340
 that we're sort of losing track of GPS-wise,

707
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
 but Australia as well.

708
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,860
 Whoa.

709
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,060
 Yeah, Australia is a bit--

710
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,380
 Oh, well, never mind.

711
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,580
 [LAUGHTER]

712
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,340
 Australia moves a lot.

713
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,620
 It's shifted by 4.9 feet since 1994.

714
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,460
 That's not a lot.

715
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
 That's not a lot.

716
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,100
 Is it not?

717
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,460
 Well, Australia's massive of four feet is not massive.

718
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,020
 Oh, but for a whole thing to shift that way.

719
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,180
 But you're not going to get to Ez Rock

720
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,260
 and be four feet away, and God can't see it anywhere.

721
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,500
 [LAUGHTER]

722
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,220
 Yeah, good for you.

723
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,260
 But I programmed the boat to stop right

724
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,220
 at the edge of Australia.

725
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,020
 So we're just going to step off the boat off the presumably

726
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,500
 appear that we'll be waiting for us there.

727
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,340
 But there was a bigger problem.

728
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,980
 I don't know if anyone here uses Bing Maps.

729
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,820
 Yes.

730
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
 You use Bing Maps.

731
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,060
 Of course, I don't use Bing Maps.

732
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
 It's on Microsoft.

733
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,100
 It's on Microsoft.

734
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,500
 So unfortunately, it turns out that I can't

735
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,780
 believe you use Bing Maps.

736
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,860
 [LAUGHTER]

737
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,260
 Was genuinely not expecting.

738
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,820
 Sussi calls me some problems in the past, but go on.

739
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,100
 Well, yeah.

740
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,340
 Like, for example, if you were looking for Melbourne,

741
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,540
 because Bing Maps had Melbourne placed off the coast of Japan,

742
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,980
 wow.

743
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,860
 That's not for the same reason as the far feet, though.

744
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,900
 [LAUGHTER]

745
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
 Yeah.

746
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,940
 This explains when we played Australia, Dan,

747
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,620
 you were four feet away every gig.

748
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,780
 You were just off in the wings.

749
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
 And I was in Japan.

750
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
 Yeah.

751
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
 And there it is.

752
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,180
 So here's the weird thing.

753
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,940
 Bing Maps is updated, not completely,

754
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,980
 but a bit, by information via Wikipedia.

755
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,420
 Now, obviously, Wikipedia is often tampered with.

756
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,260
 And in this circumstance, when they did an update,

757
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,900
 they had ingested someone who tampered with where Melbourne was.

758
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,940
 And suddenly, Bing Maps was registering

759
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,900
 off the coast of Japan.

760
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,660
 Well, so Bing isn't the only one, right?

761
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,740
 Apple Maps had serious problems.

762
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,580
 So in 2012, they dropped Google Maps as their provider.

763
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,540
 And they went to Apple.

764
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,180
 And maybe you will remember, there were some serious issues.

765
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,980
 For instance, there was an Australian town called Mildura,

766
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,340
 which was placed 75 kilometers from where it actually was.

767
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,860
 Problem is that it was in Victoria.

768
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,300
 And it was sort of in the bush.

769
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,500
 So there were four separate incidents in the space

770
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,900
 of a week, where groups of travelers went,

771
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,620
 so we're hiking to this town.

772
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,780
 And it ended up 75 kilometers away in the middle

773
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,580
 of the remote Australian bush in 40 degree heat.

774
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,460
 And all had to be rescued.

775
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,860
 Oh, wow.

776
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,100
 Also, if you search for Manchester United Football Club,

777
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,700
 it directed you to Sale United?

778
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:31,420
 I think it's like an under 12's team or something.

779
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,700
 And it's for ages five and above, sorry.

780
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,860
 And it had satellite images that it

781
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,940
 advertised as Apple Maps again.

782
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,580
 But it hadn't worked out to penetrate the clouds.

783
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,300
 So a lot of its satellite images, if you went to look at somewhere,

784
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,860
 it was just you were above the clouds.

785
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,900
 You just saw cloud cover.

786
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,420
 What a weird football team to have a policy of accepting

787
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,540
 anyone above the edge of five.

788
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,020
 You're going to get a very mixed range of abilities, yes?

789
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,260
 Time for the final fact of the show.

790
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,460
 And that is my fact.

791
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,540
 My fact this week is that the British vegetarian movement

792
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,660
 was started 200 years ago by a man called Reverend Calhard.

793
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,260
 Yeah.

794
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,220
 And this was in Salford in England.

795
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,940
 And this was 200 years ago.

796
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,220
 He was the Reverend of this chapel.

797
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,860
 And in January 1809, he stood at the pulpit

798
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,460
 and he made a plea to say to all of his congregation,

799
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,580
 we need to stop eating meat.

800
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,420
 They all agreed.

801
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,340
 And that was the fundamental beginnings

802
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,700
 of vegetarianism in the UK.

803
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,540
 Yeah.

804
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,340
 Wow.

805
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,460
 Calhard.

806
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,420
 Yes, so he said that if God had meant us to eat meat,

807
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,140
 then it would have come to us in an edible form like a fruit.

808
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,820
 So it makes sense.

809
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,660
 Sushi is arguably fine.

810
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,020
 But Calhard, he wrote hymns that were pro-vegetarianism.

811
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:59,820
 So he wrote one hymn called "Little Lamb, who ate thee?"

812
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,860
 That's amazing.

813
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,340
 He wrote another one called "Eaters of flesh."

814
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,940
 "Eaters of flesh, could you decry our food and sacred laws?

815
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,700
 Did you behold the Lamb can die and feel yourself the cause?"

816
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,180
 "Low there, he struggles, hear it moan,

817
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,660
 a stretch beneath the knife."

818
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,540
 I mean, this is pretty tough stuff, isn't it?

819
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,900
 But that is something to rhyme with knife,

820
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,180
 because that's not a good ending to the poem.

821
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,580
 "It's eyes would melt a heart of stone,

822
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,780
 how meek it begs for life."

823
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,940
 Wow.

824
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,780
 This act, because we did all just have quite a big meaty curry

825
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,060
 before we came on stage, and I'm now feeling quite guilty,

826
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,700
 as well as sick.

827
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,060
 I like my thing that I like about this fact.

828
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,460
 Obviously, it's vegetarianism started by a man called Calhard,

829
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
 and I love those little name connections

830
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,060
 when they go anti-the thing that you're talking about.

831
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,500
 And weirdly, the whole setup of vegetarianism

832
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,300
 in that period of the 1800s was completely rife

833
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,740
 with that kind of names that were connected to either animals

834
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
 or meat.

835
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,940
 So the key groups that formed the vegetarian society,

836
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,500
 which eventually got its name in 1847,

837
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,700
 were people who were called the Bible Christian Church,

838
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,620
 which was what he was a part of Calhard.

839
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,820
 You had the Concordium, which was a boarding school,

840
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,220
 and then you had the readers of the Truth Tester Journal.

841
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,380
 So Concordium, which was the high school,

842
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,580
 sorry, the boarding school, in 1837,

843
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,900
 they were located in Ham Common.

844
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,700
 Nice.

845
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,500
 That's where they were.

846
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,980
 And then the Truth Testers, who were the magazine

847
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,060
 that were pushing it, it was taken over,

848
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,740
 the editor ship, by a guy called William Horsel.

849
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,740
 No way.

850
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,900
 Yeah, so you suddenly have Horsen there.

851
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,180
 And then the Truth Testers, they basically,

852
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,780
 they got this other guy who wrote a very important letter,

853
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,260
 who's called William Oldham.

854
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,260
 Wow.

855
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,460
 So then, in 1847,

856
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,100
 in the listeners at home, Dan is pointed,

857
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,060
 and he knows bored behind him with bits of string,

858
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,340
 and connecting everything else to everything else.

859
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:04,100
 And so in 1847, they officially named the Vegetarian Society,

860
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,740
 where William Oldham was the treasurer,

861
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,980
 and Horsel was the elected secretary,

862
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,300
 and that conference that they had to name it was in Ramsgate.

863
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
 Oh.

864
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,340
 It did sound like--

865
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,140
 When you sort of climb out to the end there,

866
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,020
 it did sound like a crazed person.

867
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,380
 Like, we need to call a doctor.

868
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,540
 And by the way, for the people at home,

869
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,100
 he really did climb accidentally under that.

870
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,380
 The herring of fleeing the area, as we speak.

871
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,740
 It's like synchronized spawning on the stage.

872
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,820
 Well, one of the other pioneers was a man called--

873
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,860
 I hate to add to Dan's crackpot theory, William Lamb.

874
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,700
 He was a doctor in 1815.

875
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,700
 He came up with what he called a water and vegetable diet,

876
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,180
 and he said it would cure acne, tuberculosis, scrofula,

877
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,180
 asthma, and lots of other diseases.

878
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,020
 Wow.

879
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,860
 I don't think it did, but it probably would have done a harm.

880
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,620
 If you've got scrofula, give it a go.

881
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,740
 You know, they nearly weren't called vegetarians, vegetarians.

882
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,140
 Oh, well, they're going to be cult.

883
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,300
 So there were lots of potentials.

884
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,100
 Pythagorean?

885
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
 Was one of them, was it?

886
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
 That's true.

887
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
 That's an old one.

888
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
 Pythagoras, supposedly.

889
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,580
 Sorry, I'm actually meeting vegans.

890
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,700
 So vegans were nearly not called vegans.

891
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,460
 So in 1944, there was a member of the vegetarian society

892
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,980
 in London, who was called Donald Watson.

893
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,900
 And he set up a new newspaper for vegans.

894
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,820
 He wanted to go a bit further with the vegetarianism.

895
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,780
 And he asked his readers for suggestions as to alternatives.

896
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,500
 And they came up with things like dairy ban.

897
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,980
 So that would be the noun, I am a dairy ban.

898
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,500
 Or bennervor, instead of omnivore or carnivore,

899
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,380
 a bennervor, someone who eats good things.

900
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,940
 Or boom-or-je.

901
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
 No, nice.

902
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,780
 I'm a boom-or-je.

903
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,580
 So it was a big thing in the 19th century,

904
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,220
 the vegetarian movement.

905
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,020
 It was a big thing in London.

906
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,620
 And there was one vegetarian restaurant in London in 1878.

907
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,380
 And by the 1880s, there were 52.

908
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,460
 So it suddenly took off.

909
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,500
 But the most popular one around this time

910
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,260
 was started by the best real tennis player in the world.

911
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,220
 That's a good word.

912
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,740
 Wow.

913
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,180
 He was a guy called Eustace Miles.

914
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,820
 And he was basically a real tennis--

915
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,700
 so you know, real tennis is sort of like weird indoor royal

916
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,140
 tennis precursor to tennis.

917
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,260
 And he was the world champion, basically,

918
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,460
 from 1898 to 1911.

919
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,900
 He was the best player in the world.

920
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,940
 And he was also obsessed with fad diets.

921
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,340
 And he was a vegetarian.

922
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,340
 And he opened this restaurant that was incredibly popular.

923
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,100
 And it had stuff on the menu, like little acronyms on the menu

924
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,700
 like we have today.

925
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,980
 We have a V for vegetarian.

926
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,940
 He had NN, which meant very nourishing.

927
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,620
 And he also had-- next to many of his items, FU.

928
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,460
 And that meant free from uric acid.

929
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,660
 Oh, obviously.

930
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,940
 I love my meals free from uric acid.

931
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,020
 I always ask free from uric acid.

932
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,820
 It was quite a big thing, because it sort of caused gout.

933
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,860
 But he was a bit weird.

934
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,660
 He wrote an article once about how everyone

935
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,380
 should be able to live on a diet of two plasmon biscuits

936
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,860
 in one lentil a day.

937
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,420
 One lentil?

938
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,380
 Just the one.

939
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,060
 Yeah.

940
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,460
 Don't overdo it.

941
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,420
 Wow.

942
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,460
 You know in Australia, you get kangaterians.

943
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,060
 Oh, yeah.

944
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,460
 I was kind of a kangaterian in Australia.

945
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,260
 Were you?

946
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,380
 OK, so if anyone here doesn't know what that is,

947
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,060
 kangaterian is where you eat purely kangaroo and no other

948
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,580
 meats, and there's an ethical and moral logic

949
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,020
 behind the idea of becoming a kangaterian.

950
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,700
 One is that one of the big problems we have with farming

951
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,900
 cattle is the methane the farts are ruining the ozone layer,

952
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,660
 whereas kangaroos really emit a very, very tiny fraction

953
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,780
 of the amount that it calda.

954
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,740
 So if you started farming them, that

955
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,820
 would be fantastic for the environment.

956
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,380
 Although one of the reasons that also is ethical

957
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,260
 is that they're not farmed, so they're wild.

958
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,460
 There are a whole host of reasons.

959
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,100
 They're a massive pest, aren't they?

960
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,700
 They're a pest, yeah.

961
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,020
 I always think pests as a subjective term, isn't it?

962
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,340
 We're probably a pest of them as much as that.

963
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,980
 Oh, but they're very hard to catch, though,

964
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,180
 because they're always four feet away

965
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,780
 from where you actually thought they were.

966
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,740
 This is a whole theory.

967
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,020
 There's a guy called Jackson Landers, who's written a book,

968
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,500
 proposing that vegetarians who want to be vegetarians

969
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,980
 for planetary reasons, but they like meat,

970
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,900
 he suggested they should only hunt and eat

971
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,300
 invasive species, and he wrote a book

972
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,620
 where he did exactly that.

973
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,660
 So he ate pigeons in New York City, which I think is brave.

974
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,380
 Yeah, there's a whole theory behind it.

975
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,620
 Again, I don't like to be a dickhead here,

976
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,380
 but I always think invasive species

977
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,660
 is a very human term, isn't it?

978
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,340
 Because that implies they have a concept of nationhood,

979
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,060
 which most animals don't.

980
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,740
 So they're like, I'm allowed to be in New York.

981
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,460
 The pigeons, they're not.

982
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,180
 They don't have the kind of strict immigration policies

983
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,180
 that humans have, I think, at time of recording, anyway.

984
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:55,860
 On stigma against vegetarianism, this is a weird thing.

985
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,540
 There was a study by the University of Southampton,

986
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,540
 and it found that men, in particular,

987
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,220
 don't like choosing vegetarian dishes

988
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,140
 when they're with other men, particularly,

989
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,900
 for fear of being ridiculed.

990
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,540
 And this study was a year long.

991
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,900
 It was called man food.

992
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,660
 And the sample was small.

993
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,820
 It was only 22 men, so it was not a comprehensive city-wide thing.

994
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,580
 But basically, even men who don't like meat,

995
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,820
 or men who find it hurts their digestive system,

996
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,220
 or men who've been literally asked to meet,

997
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,540
 eat less meat by their doctor, or see themselves as green,

998
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,780
 they want to eat meat, particularly around male friends,

999
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,500
 because they think it's sort of cool.

1000
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
 It's cool.

1001
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,620
 And presumably, that's Western men.

1002
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,220
 Is men in Southampton?

1003
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,220
 Right.

1004
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,980
 I can't stress enough how small the sample was on this study.

1005
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
 Well, there was a study--

1006
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,660
 It's two football teams in Southampton, isn't it?

1007
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,860
 22, man.

1008
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,940
 Yeah, they had a Gamer football.

1009
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,940
 From the age of five upwards.

1010
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,100
 There was a study done in Canada, which actually

1011
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,340
 showed that you can calm a man down by showing him

1012
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,940
 a picture of a piece of meat.

1013
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,180
 Stop it!

1014
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,340
 No, you can't.

1015
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,860
 Yeah, no, no, that is so stupid.

1016
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,660
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

1017
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,820
 Yeah, McGill University in Canada, and they--

1018
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,820
 What do they do?

1019
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,820
 How do they do it?

1020
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,300
 So they were barfights with a big, laminated steak.

1021
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,540
 Don't worry, let's chill out.

1022
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,220
 If I was a general, I would make all my soldiers carry pictures

1023
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,020
 of meat on their rifles, on the bayonets,

1024
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,340
 to completely neutralise the opposing army.

1025
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,500
 Give it like a kabab, wouldn't it, of the old bayonets?

1026
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,740
 It's such a great idea.

1027
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:48,220
 What it was is that they had 82 men sit down

1028
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,060
 and an actor read out a script to them.

1029
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,220
 And if the actor ever stuffed up, and as the actor was reading,

1030
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,980
 they were looking at different pictures.

1031
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,140
 Every time the actor stuffed up, they

1032
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,260
 were told to send a loud sound to the actor

1033
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,860
 to sort of--

1034
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,660
 as punishment for stuffing up.

1035
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,180
 So they would stuff up, and they would press this button,

1036
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,860
 and there would be levels of loudness.

1037
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,420
 Whenever the actor stuffed up, while they were looking

1038
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,980
 at a piece of meat, they decided to not really give any punishment,

1039
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,500
 whatsoever.

1040
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,700
 OK, so maybe it's more that they're distracted by the meat.

1041
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,580
 No, it's according to--

1042
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,780
 They were calmed by it.

1043
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,100
 I do my best here.

1044
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,540
 [LAUGHTER]

1045
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,340
 What's my study?

1046
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,220
 Are there any speculations as to why?

1047
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,900
 Yes, actually, this is really interesting.

1048
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,860
 It's because the idea that men, once they see meat,

1049
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,300
 and it's in a cook form, it's so they can see the charcoal-grilled,

1050
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,620
 kind of nice--

1051
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,940
 It's a slab of steak.

1052
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,900
 All that's been properly barbecued, someone.

1053
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,620
 But also, they think it's caught.

1054
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,620
 I don't need to go hunting.

1055
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,860
 I don't need to be the man who's going to be aggressive and stuff.

1056
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,900
 I can calmly eat my meal now.

1057
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:58,420
 And again, this is not my study, but you wasted everybody's time with it.

1058
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,460
 [LAUGHTER]

1059
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,380
 So it's reassuring them that they're going to get some meat.

1060
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,060
 They're thinking of meal time with their families.

1061
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,700
 They're thinking, this is a nice image.

1062
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,780
 And yeah, calm down.

1063
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,700
 Is it a pretty picture?

1064
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,660
 For me, man.

1065
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,980
 I got another thing about-- this is about veganism this time.

1066
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,580
 President Eisenhower from America, his great-granddaughter,

1067
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,060
 thinks that veganism is going to help us to contact aliens.

1068
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,740
 Great.

1069
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,740
 This is, actually, this is fractionally more plausible

1070
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,860
 than the last thing you ran up the flagpole.

1071
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,300
 That she said, we have to understand

1072
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,900
 that we are multi-dimensional beings,

1073
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,180
 and based on our frequency perceptions and vibratory levels

1074
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,700
 that we are functioning from, we are going to see different things.

1075
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,220
 So that's her.

1076
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,180
 So that's Eisenhower's great-granddaughter.

1077
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,100
 She thinks that meat holds us down the density of our bodies.

1078
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,660
 And if we want to connect with the higher beings,

1079
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,300
 the vegetables are going to be much lighter.

1080
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,700
 And they think--

1081
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,780
 It's interesting, because some political families

1082
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,700
 you just think, oh, they've got so much power stored in the family.

1083
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,580
 They're just going to be in the front of politics

1084
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,660
 for generations to come.

1085
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,740
 I don't think the Eisenhower family is one of these families.

1086
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,100
 They're never going to elect an idiot to the president of America.

1087
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,180
 They say so they--

1088
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,420
 It's also not super reassuring, what she said.

1089
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,100
 So that implies that if you adopt a vegetarian or a vegan diet,

1090
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,500
 you're just going to float away.

1091
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,660
 That's the implication.

1092
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,260
 It's true.

1093
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,500
 OK, I can't believe we're ending on that, but that is--

1094
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,340
 that is it.

1095
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,540
 That is all of our facts.

1096
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,100
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,980
