00:00:02,00:00:04,[INSTRUMENTAL BELL RINGS]
00:00:04,00:00:07,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:07,00:00:18,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:00:18,00:00:20,"as a Fish, a Weekly Podcast."
00:00:20,00:00:22,"This week, coming to you live, from Edinburgh!"
00:00:22,00:00:23,[CHEERING]
00:00:28,00:00:31,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:31,00:00:34,"I am sitting here with Anacesansky, Andrew Huntson Murray,"
00:00:34,00:00:36,and James Harkin.
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:41,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:41,00:00:46,"And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you."
00:00:46,00:00:49,"Andy, my fact is that in 18th century Scotland,"
00:00:49,00:00:52,people believed that herring would punish people
00:00:52,00:00:56,for adultery by leaving the area where the adultery
00:00:56,00:00:57,had occurred.
00:00:57,00:00:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:00:59,00:01:00,This is a joke.
00:01:00,00:01:01,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:01:01,00:01:02,They're not in the bedroom.
00:01:02,00:01:06,"They're not in the room, sorry. [LAUGHTER]"
00:01:06,00:01:07,No. It's disgusting.
00:01:07,00:01:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:10,00:01:13,"But people at home, that was the amazing herring impression."
00:01:13,00:01:15,That was a good grief.
00:01:15,00:01:17,"I mean, if anything, that would be a relief for the adultery."
00:01:17,00:01:19,"Can this just wouldn't be-- Yeah, it's true."
00:01:19,00:01:21,"Once the herring flops out, you can really get down to it."
00:01:21,00:01:23,And the old saying goes.
00:01:23,00:01:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:26,00:01:28,"Well, we got there quite clearly anyway."
00:01:28,00:01:29,God.
00:01:29,00:01:31,So this is from a book.
00:01:31,00:01:34,It's called Herring Tales by an author called Donald Murray.
00:01:34,00:01:38,And so this is because herring used to be absolutely
00:01:38,00:01:39,enormous.
00:01:39,00:01:42,"So in the early 20th century, there were three million barrels"
00:01:42,00:01:44,coming into Scotland every single year.
00:01:44,00:01:46,"But the thing is, they're fickle, OK?"
00:01:46,00:01:49,So they would frequently appear in massive numbers
00:01:49,00:01:50,in one year.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"And then the next year, they wouldn't be there anymore."
00:01:52,00:01:53,They'd disappear.
00:01:53,00:01:56,"And so in 1703, there was an author whose name, genuinely,"
00:01:56,00:02:02,"was Martin Martin, and he wrote about this superstition."
00:02:02,00:02:04,"He said, ""It is a general observation all"
00:02:04,00:02:06,Scotland over that if a quarrel happened on the coast
00:02:06,00:02:09,"where herring is caught and that blood be drawn violently,"
00:02:09,00:02:11,"then the herring go away."""
00:02:11,00:02:12,So it was true of violence.
00:02:12,00:02:14,And it was also true of adultery.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"Oh, OK."
00:02:16,00:02:18,"They're very judgmental, famously herring."
00:02:18,00:02:19,Yeah.
00:02:19,00:02:23,"They do turn up in massive numbers when they do turn up, don't they?"
00:02:23,00:02:24,They really come in a crew.
00:02:24,00:02:27,I think we think it could be the largest gathering
00:02:27,00:02:30,"of animals anywhere, herring schools."
00:02:30,00:02:34,So they gather in groups of up to 250 million.
00:02:34,00:02:36,They've only quite recently been counted.
00:02:36,00:02:39,So the schools at the shows will be 40 kilometers wide.
00:02:39,00:02:41,And we're not totally sure.
00:02:41,00:02:43,They do have a synchronized spawning.
00:02:43,00:02:44,They get together at night.
00:02:44,00:02:46,"That's a terrible Olympics event, isn't it?"
00:02:46,00:02:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:49,00:02:50,That's one at 2 AM.
00:02:50,00:02:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:53,00:02:56,"Yeah, so they do their little dances, and then they spawn."
00:02:56,00:02:57,They count them.
00:02:57,00:02:59,Imagine having that job.
00:02:59,00:03:00,"Yeah, it was quite--"
00:03:00,00:03:02,There was using different radar from different ships
00:03:02,00:03:04,"and bouncing it off all of them, I think."
00:03:04,00:03:05,Computers did it.
00:03:05,00:03:08,There wasn't a guy who was there making a tally.
00:03:08,00:03:12,"So supposedly, in the 12th century off the coast of Scotland,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,there were so many herring in the water
00:03:14,00:03:18,that boats would sometimes get stuck in the water.
00:03:18,00:03:19,No way.
00:03:19,00:03:20,"Oh, what's that?"
00:03:20,00:03:24,"This was a guy called Saxo Grammaticus, who wrote in--"
00:03:24,00:03:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:25,00:03:26,This is true.
00:03:26,00:03:26,He was an author.
00:03:26,00:03:28,He was in 1204.
00:03:28,00:03:30,"He wrote, ""The whole sound contains such plentiful shells"
00:03:30,00:03:32,that sometimes boats striking them have difficulty
00:03:32,00:03:35,"in rowing clear and no fishing gear,"
00:03:35,00:03:37,"but the hands is needed to take them."""
00:03:37,00:03:39,So you could just reach in and grab a herring.
00:03:39,00:03:43,"Because they're quite thickly packed, aren't they?"
00:03:43,00:03:45,"So you know, in some shells of fish,"
00:03:45,00:03:47,you podge a finger and they'll scarper off.
00:03:47,00:03:49,"But herring, I think, because they line up"
00:03:49,00:03:51,where your nose will be lined up with a torso
00:03:51,00:03:53,of the bloke in front of you.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"So basically, if you can imagine, there are almost no gaps"
00:03:55,00:03:57,"between them in a shell, because they're sort of like a jigsaw"
00:03:57,00:03:58,perfectly fit together.
00:03:58,00:04:00,So it does mean that if you come across them
00:04:00,00:04:03,"and you are fishing, if you're in the middle of that group,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,you cannot move to one side or the other.
00:04:05,00:04:06,You'll just completely start off.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"Oh, wow."
00:04:07,00:04:09,So you can just scoop them all right up.
00:04:09,00:04:13,"But Fisher people are very superstitious, aren't they?"
00:04:13,00:04:15,"Especially in Scotland, I've found."
00:04:15,00:04:19,"In Scotland, they used to, if they weren't catching fish,"
00:04:19,00:04:22,they thought they would have to show this sea
00:04:22,00:04:23,what they were trying to do.
00:04:23,00:04:24,And then the sea would work it out.
00:04:24,00:04:26,And then it would give them some fish.
00:04:26,00:04:29,"So as a last ditch effort, you would get one of your fellow"
00:04:29,00:04:34,fishermen and throw him into the water and then catch him
00:04:34,00:04:35,with a rod.
00:04:35,00:04:38,"And then the sea would go, oh, that's what you're trying to do."
00:04:38,00:04:39,Really?
00:04:39,00:04:40,Yeah.
00:04:40,00:04:42,That is amazing.
00:04:42,00:04:43,Wow.
00:04:43,00:04:47,That's like having to take a crap in your cat's cat litter box
00:04:47,00:04:48,in order to--
00:04:48,00:04:51,"Sam, what?"
00:04:51,00:04:52,He doesn't even have a cat.
00:04:52,00:04:58,"Wait, you know, to be like--"
00:04:58,00:04:59,I understand the principle.
00:04:59,00:05:02,"I'm saying, have you done it?"
00:05:02,00:05:02,Wow.
00:05:02,00:05:05,"No, once."
00:05:05,00:05:08,This is kind of related to James' thing
00:05:08,00:05:12,"about fishing people, fishermen out of the sea again."
00:05:12,00:05:14,"But this is a related tradition, several hundred years ago,"
00:05:14,00:05:16,which is that it's bad luck to save someone from drowning.
00:05:16,00:05:25,Because that sucks when your job's a lifeguard at the moment.
00:05:25,00:05:28,"Yeah, because the sea needs it sacrifice."
00:05:28,00:05:31,So if you have picked the work experience fishermen
00:05:31,00:05:34,"to throw into the water, you should check this."
00:05:34,00:05:36,So people genuinely wouldn't save people
00:05:36,00:05:37,because they thought it was bad luck?
00:05:37,00:05:39,I don't know how much it happened.
00:05:39,00:05:40,"Well, it might be that there's one fisherman"
00:05:40,00:05:42,who's been getting on everyone's nerves for a long time.
00:05:42,00:05:43,"But if he falls in, I'm going to--"
00:05:43,00:05:44,"Oh, sorry, no."
00:05:44,00:05:46,There's nothing we can do about it.
00:05:46,00:05:48,So there is--
00:05:48,00:05:51,there is another bit of superstition in the Scottish Lowlands
00:05:51,00:05:54,"and that it is, by saying, good morning to someone,"
00:05:54,00:05:57,it's considered bad luck to fishermen.
00:05:57,00:05:59,And so there are some fishermen apparently
00:05:59,00:06:00,who would walk down the street.
00:06:00,00:06:02,"And if someone says, good morning to them,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,"they'll go off, fuck sake, and just go home."
00:06:04,00:06:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:06,00:06:08,I thought it was that you'd go home and start again.
00:06:08,00:06:09,"Oh, and go back and you sort of--"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"OK, so you have to press a reset button on the expedition."
00:06:12,00:06:15,Are the sea-faring Scottish superstitions
00:06:15,00:06:19,there's in the Hebrides tradition of tossing porridge
00:06:19,00:06:20,"into the sea, which I didn't know about?"
00:06:20,00:06:22,And this particularly happens on what's
00:06:22,00:06:26,called big porridge day or great gruel Thursday.
00:06:26,00:06:27,And I think--
00:06:27,00:06:28,Big porridge day.
00:06:28,00:06:29,Big porridge day.
00:06:29,00:06:31,This is from the 19th century book of customs.
00:06:31,00:06:34,I don't know if everyone still does it.
00:06:34,00:06:36,But this is--
00:06:36,00:06:37,it happened in places like Iona.
00:06:37,00:06:40,"And basically, it was-- you'd make a big dish of porridge with some butter"
00:06:40,00:06:42,and lots of other delicious ingredients.
00:06:42,00:06:44,And then you overturn the whole thing into the sea.
00:06:44,00:06:47,"And that's thought to attract really valuable seaweed,"
00:06:47,00:06:51,"because it seems like a bab swapped to me, seaweed for porridge."
00:06:51,00:06:53,But they want to eat and cook with seaweed.
00:06:53,00:06:57,"But also, the seaweed is used as a fertiliser, I think, right?"
00:06:57,00:06:58,"Fertilizer, yes."
00:06:58,00:06:59,That'll be it.
00:06:59,00:07:01,"And also, it was on Monday Thursday."
00:07:01,00:07:05,"And so apparently, Monday Thursday was doubly holy in the Hebrides,"
00:07:05,00:07:06,"because not only did it have the whole Easter thing,"
00:07:06,00:07:09,but also it was when you did the porridge seaweed swap.
00:07:09,00:07:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:12,00:07:15,"We're going to have to move on to our next fact, very shortly."
00:07:15,00:07:17,"If you work in the herring industry,"
00:07:17,00:07:22,you can develop asthma from all the herring protein in the air.
00:07:22,00:07:24,So you get a condition which is called herring lung.
00:07:24,00:07:25,No.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"Yeah, just absolutely microscopic particles of it in the air."
00:07:28,00:07:30,"Well, there used to be a really big thing."
00:07:30,00:07:33,The herring girls was the sort of collective name
00:07:33,00:07:34,"for the women who processed herring,"
00:07:34,00:07:36,who's a really important job.
00:07:36,00:07:38,"And on a Saturday night, apparently,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,they would have to wash their hair six times
00:07:40,00:07:43,"to get the smell out before they could go out,"
00:07:43,00:07:44,because you're just working in herring
00:07:44,00:07:46,and gusting herring all week long.
00:07:46,00:07:48,And did you know it was because of herring
00:07:48,00:07:52,that probably the most important collection of musical manuscripts
00:07:52,00:07:55,"was saved, herring saved them."
00:07:55,00:07:57,"So this was, after the Second World War,"
00:07:57,00:08:01,"there were loads of original Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach manuscripts."
00:08:01,00:08:04,"All the famous ones you've heard of, all the big Beethoven symphonies,"
00:08:04,00:08:06,all the Mozart's and all of them.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"They were moved from the Berlin Museum,"
00:08:08,00:08:11,because people were worried about the fate that might befall them.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"They were moved, and then they were sort of lost,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,"as things happened in the war, and they all disappeared."
00:08:15,00:08:19,"And then, in 1973, there was this guy called Dr. Peter Whitehead"
00:08:19,00:08:21,who was working in the Natural History Museum.
00:08:21,00:08:24,"And he was a biologist, and he was just obsessed"
00:08:24,00:08:26,with finding this picture of this herring.
00:08:26,00:08:29,So he kept on reading in really ancient documents
00:08:29,00:08:32,about something that was either herring or an anchovy.
00:08:32,00:08:34,And he couldn't find the original picture
00:08:34,00:08:38,that they were all referring to to deduce which of those two it was.
00:08:38,00:08:39,And he was obsessed with this.
00:08:39,00:08:42,And so he looked all over Europe to find this ancient picture.
00:08:42,00:08:44,"And finally, he ended up in a library and crack off"
00:08:44,00:08:46,going through this massive crate.
00:08:46,00:08:50,"And he was like, oh, my God, I found this 1648 picture,"
00:08:50,00:08:51,and it's definitely a herring.
00:08:51,00:08:52,I've absolutely nailed it.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"Thank God, by the way, sorry, I don't know who to tell,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,"but I've also found all the old manuscripts,"
00:08:57,00:09:00,original manuscripts of Beethoven Mozart.
00:09:00,00:09:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:02,00:09:04,But have you seen that herring?
00:09:04,00:09:07,And so we're still herring that music today.
00:09:07,00:09:09,[APPLAUSE]
00:09:09,00:09:11,"Yep, it deserved a boof."
00:09:11,00:09:15,"All right, it's time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:09:15,00:09:18,"OK, my fact this week is that the most fashionable person"
00:09:18,00:09:22,of the 16th century was an accountant from Germany.
00:09:22,00:09:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:24,00:09:26,Doesn't it seem likely?
00:09:26,00:09:28,"Well, it is true, I think."
00:09:28,00:09:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:30,00:09:32,That was an early backtrack.
00:09:32,00:09:35,"No, he was called Matthias Schwarz."
00:09:35,00:09:39,"He was born in 1497, died in 1574."
00:09:39,00:09:41,"And he was a German accountant, but he is most well-known"
00:09:41,00:09:45,"for compiling a book called Kleidung's Buchlein,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"or Buchlein, which means Book of Clothes."
00:09:48,00:09:51,And it's probably the world's first fashion book.
00:09:51,00:09:54,And he basically took pictures of the drawings
00:09:54,00:09:58,of every single thing he ever wore for 40 years.
00:09:58,00:10:01,And he wore unbelievably amazing clothes.
00:10:01,00:10:03,And he was probably the first person in history
00:10:03,00:10:06,"to be interested in fashion as like a cultural thing,"
00:10:06,00:10:08,rather than just to show off to their friends.
00:10:08,00:10:09,"Yeah, he was, yeah, amazing."
00:10:09,00:10:11,"And he commissioned these watercolors, didn't he?"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"So he had artists just come constantly paint him,"
00:10:15,00:10:17,which really pissed me off actually the independent cover
00:10:17,00:10:18,of this.
00:10:18,00:10:22,And they kept on talking about it as fashion's first selfies.
00:10:22,00:10:25,And I would say if you've commissioned a person
00:10:25,00:10:27,"to do a watercolor painting of you,"
00:10:27,00:10:29,there was so many levels on which that was not
00:10:29,00:10:31,a selfie.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"No, but he-- so what, he backtracked it to his earlier years."
00:10:34,00:10:38,So he commissioned-- he started it when he was at the age of 23.
00:10:38,00:10:40,So he worked backwards and got a bunch of those commissioned.
00:10:40,00:10:43,He also did a nude of himself.
00:10:43,00:10:47,"So in this book, there's a front side nude and a backside nude"
00:10:47,00:10:49,"kind of like, you know, those kids books"
00:10:49,00:10:51,"he used to get, where you would put the clothes on for a bit."
00:10:51,00:10:52,"No, we're chartered, Dan."
00:10:52,00:10:54,"We're chartered, you had."
00:10:54,00:10:56,"We're back to the kitty litter, aren't we?"
00:10:56,00:11:02,"It's sort of like you've got the body, and you can put different clothes"
00:11:02,00:11:03,on them with magnetic strips.
00:11:03,00:11:06,"It's probably a nude 16th century German accountant, though."
00:11:06,00:11:13,"I mean, what a world it would be."
00:11:13,00:11:14,Because his clothes were amazing.
00:11:14,00:11:15,They were so cool.
00:11:15,00:11:17,"So it was really interesting, because this"
00:11:17,00:11:19,was a time where there were lots of legal restrictions
00:11:19,00:11:22,on what you could wear depending on your position in society.
00:11:22,00:11:24,So you couldn't dress more fancily than your employers.
00:11:24,00:11:28,"But he was the head accountant for the Fugger family,"
00:11:28,00:11:30,who were a very powerful banking family.
00:11:30,00:11:33,And they were very worried about being seen as too rich.
00:11:33,00:11:36,So they tried to tone down what they were wearing.
00:11:36,00:11:38,So they didn't seem too extravagant.
00:11:38,00:11:40,And so he had to come up with all these clever ways
00:11:40,00:11:42,of showing off fashionably.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"So there are these things called pinks, which"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"is where you make a tiny slash, just a tiny, tiny cut in fabric."
00:11:47,00:11:49,So you can see the color of the fabric beneath.
00:11:49,00:11:52,And his doublet--
00:11:52,00:11:55,so that's what that's the sort of upper trousers.
00:11:55,00:11:58,"No, the doublet is like the long-legged shrunken waistcoat thing."
00:11:58,00:11:59,"Sorry, the jacket is doublet."
00:11:59,00:12:04,"It had 4,800 pinks in it, which were all handmade."
00:12:04,00:12:06,How much doublet was there left after you put
00:12:06,00:12:08,all those in 800s in it?
00:12:08,00:12:11,Just very quickly on the Fugger family.
00:12:11,00:12:15,"So the guy, the guy who started it"
00:12:15,00:12:17,was called Jacob Fugger.
00:12:17,00:12:21,"And he was, genuinely, the richest man"
00:12:21,00:12:22,who has ever lived.
00:12:22,00:12:24,"He, if he was the right rich Fugger, wasn't he?"
00:12:24,00:12:28,"Yeah, yeah, he was born from nothing."
00:12:28,00:12:31,His dad and his mother Fugger had no--
00:12:31,00:12:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:34,00:12:38,Had virtually no hotel pitch.
00:12:38,00:12:39,They virtually had no money.
00:12:39,00:12:41,And he built it all in his lifetime.
00:12:41,00:12:43,"And if you took the amount that he had,"
00:12:43,00:12:46,"and you translated it into today's money,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,he was worth 400 billion.
00:12:48,00:12:50,"Wait, are we going to get a currency on that?"
00:12:50,00:12:51,"Oh, what's this in?"
00:12:51,00:12:52,Yen?
00:12:52,00:12:53,American Derek.
00:12:53,00:12:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:56,00:12:57,"Sorry, yeah."
00:12:57,00:12:59,He was the richest man who ever lived.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"But I mean, so he was probably the most fashionable person."
00:13:01,00:13:03,But the fashion's around this time.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"And Renaissance fashions were quite exciting, weren't they?"
00:13:06,00:13:10,"So we had, I think, one of my favorite was the Henin."
00:13:10,00:13:12,This was a really early fashion.
00:13:12,00:13:13,This was basically medieval.
00:13:13,00:13:16,"And it was the, if you look at kind of Renaissance"
00:13:16,00:13:18,"and pre-Renaissance art, it's that weird steeple"
00:13:18,00:13:20,that women wear on their heads.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"So you know, they wear a massive long cone that"
00:13:22,00:13:24,comes up on something falls off the back of it.
00:13:24,00:13:26,And they would go up to a meter high.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"And people were criticised for wearing these,"
00:13:28,00:13:30,"because they thought they looked really ridiculous, which they did."
00:13:30,00:13:33,"And also, it was kind of a sign of lavishness."
00:13:33,00:13:35,"And I was reading about a friar called Thomas Connect,"
00:13:35,00:13:38,who would give pocket money and pardons
00:13:38,00:13:41,to any boy who was able to get one of these off a woman's head.
00:13:41,00:13:44,So he paid these little boys to go and pull down
00:13:44,00:13:48,these monstrous headdresses and face the woman down.
00:13:48,00:13:51,"In the Italian city of Ovietto, this is also"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"during the Renaissance fashion, there were rules"
00:13:53,00:13:54,again about what you could wear.
00:13:54,00:13:59,So your cleavage as a woman could not descend past a certain point.
00:13:59,00:14:03,"And the way they did it was with the measurement of the hands,"
00:14:03,00:14:07,it was two fingers width below the supra-sternal notch
00:14:07,00:14:08,on your chest.
00:14:08,00:14:11,"And that's basically the front of your collarbone here,"
00:14:11,00:14:12,your clavicle there.
00:14:12,00:14:13,So it's two fingers width.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"I mean, your cleavage is going nowhere near that."
00:14:15,00:14:18,So one's cleavage is going nowhere near that.
00:14:18,00:14:21,So it would be very unusual woman who
00:14:21,00:14:24,had cleavage that went to an inch below her clavicle.
00:14:24,00:14:28,"I mean, is it going to press coming out of your neck?"
00:14:28,00:14:30,There's just on breasts.
00:14:30,00:14:33,Another thing in the 16th--
00:14:33,00:14:35,another thing on the 16th century was that there
00:14:35,00:14:40,was a fashion to just have your top open and breasts out.
00:14:40,00:14:44,"And there's an account from 1593, the French ambassador,"
00:14:44,00:14:48,"Andre Horout, described meeting Queen Elizabeth the First,"
00:14:48,00:14:51,and arriving with her having--
00:14:51,00:14:52,We have naked boobs out.
00:14:52,00:14:56,"Yeah, the Queen Elizabeth the First, yeah."
00:14:56,00:14:58,She was 65 at the time.
00:14:58,00:14:58,Was she?
00:14:58,00:14:59,Yeah.
00:14:59,00:15:01,This is-- he wrote this in his diary.
00:15:01,00:15:03,"So whether this is true or not, we don't know."
00:15:03,00:15:04,But he did say that.
00:15:04,00:15:05,Do you have what he said?
00:15:05,00:15:08,"Yeah, he said, kept the front of her dress open"
00:15:08,00:15:11,so one could see the whole of her bosom.
00:15:11,00:15:13,Could see all her belly to her navel.
00:15:13,00:15:16,So it was just an outright open shirt.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"And it was seen, according to his diaries, as less a risque thing"
00:15:19,00:15:21,than a woman showing her ankles at the time.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"Yeah, ankles were pretty bad, disgusting."
00:15:25,00:15:29,"Well, there was actually a fashion in France about 200 years"
00:15:29,00:15:32,after that to have sort of nakedness showing through your outfit.
00:15:32,00:15:34,So I really didn't know about this.
00:15:34,00:15:37,"But this was in the 1790s, straight after the reign of terror,"
00:15:37,00:15:41,when a lot of the aristocracy had been wiped out and beheaded.
00:15:41,00:15:44,The aristocracy remained fought back by developing
00:15:44,00:15:45,these lavish fashions.
00:15:45,00:15:49,And they were known as the uncroyabla and the merveoes.
00:15:49,00:15:52,So the men were the Incredibles and the women were the marvellouss.
00:15:52,00:15:54,And they would sport these ridiculous fashions.
00:15:54,00:15:57,So they would go around with these giant monocles.
00:15:57,00:15:58,They'd have rings on all their toes.
00:15:58,00:16:03,"Yeah, probably like the size of your face."
00:16:03,00:16:06,They wore huge hats with dog ears coming off them.
00:16:06,00:16:08,And they pretended to have a lisp.
00:16:08,00:16:10,"And they walked around with hunches,"
00:16:10,00:16:12,because they decided that was a funny thing to do.
00:16:12,00:16:14,And it was just this weird thing.
00:16:14,00:16:17,And it was all this comment on you bastards.
00:16:17,00:16:18,You've like murdered our mates.
00:16:18,00:16:21,Some of them there was a fashion to brush their hair forward
00:16:21,00:16:23,and shave off the back a bit of their hair
00:16:23,00:16:25,as if the guillotine was about to fall.
00:16:25,00:16:29,And some of them said we're a red necklace to show their red--
00:16:29,00:16:30,"Yeah, like their heads are chopped off."
00:16:30,00:16:31,"But yeah, it was amazing."
00:16:31,00:16:34,"They had these balls, which are called Baldevik team,"
00:16:34,00:16:37,which were balls which only the children or the families
00:16:37,00:16:39,of people who've been beheaded could attend.
00:16:39,00:16:40,But they were super cool.
00:16:40,00:16:42,They were just promising around the streets of Paris
00:16:42,00:16:45,"in these crazy outfits, saying, fuck you."
00:16:45,00:16:46,Wow.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"In 1463, England's parliament ruled"
00:16:48,00:16:50,that men were no longer allowed to wear short coats
00:16:50,00:16:54,that did not cover their penises.
00:16:54,00:16:56,They said we've had enough of that.
00:16:56,00:16:59,We've had a great time with the parties over.
00:16:59,00:17:01,Were they wearing trousers?
00:17:01,00:17:02,Were they like Donald Duck?
00:17:02,00:17:03,Was it a--
00:17:03,00:17:09,They kind of were like Donald Duck.
00:17:09,00:17:10,"Wait, so sorry."
00:17:10,00:17:11,They were naked from the waist down.
00:17:11,00:17:12,They were not completely naked from the waist down.
00:17:12,00:17:13,So they had a hoesery?
00:17:13,00:17:14,They had a hoes.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"But hoes is just tight, really."
00:17:17,00:17:19,They just had tights that were making it very obvious what
00:17:19,00:17:19,was where.
00:17:19,00:17:22,And the jackets kept getting shorter and shorter and shorter.
00:17:22,00:17:26,"And eventually, you could just see lunchbox."
00:17:26,00:17:28,"And the thing was, and that was when"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"cob pieces came in as a fashionable thing,"
00:17:30,00:17:33,because they weren't allowed to show their genitals
00:17:33,00:17:34,or their bulges or whatever.
00:17:34,00:17:37,And they didn't want to have long coats that covered up.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"They still wanted to have the fashionable ones,"
00:17:39,00:17:41,so they would have the cob pieces instead.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"Really, because I always thought the cob pieces"
00:17:43,00:17:46,the most weird thing that we just accept that people just--
00:17:46,00:17:48,I thought was to show off your genitals.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"And I think then it became something to draw attention to it,"
00:17:50,00:17:51,and you'd have no Apple one.
00:17:51,00:17:55,They got bigger and bigger and bigger in the 16th century
00:17:55,00:17:58,before disappearing completely by the end of the century.
00:17:58,00:18:00,"So this is really weird thing where they get bigger,"
00:18:00,00:18:01,"bigger, bigger, bigger, and then suddenly"
00:18:01,00:18:04,"smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller."
00:18:04,00:18:05,I think we can all--
00:18:05,00:18:09,"Well, the reason they think they went out"
00:18:09,00:18:11,is because there was a new thing that came
00:18:11,00:18:14,"in at the end of the 16th century called a ""Pee's Cod Belly."""
00:18:14,00:18:17,"And what that was, it was like, you kind of stuff stuff"
00:18:17,00:18:19,inside your shirt.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"Imagine you have a shirt here, you stuff it down."
00:18:21,00:18:24,"And then it kind of makes you a little bit fatter,"
00:18:24,00:18:27,but then it goes down to a peak where your genitals are.
00:18:27,00:18:29,And so they're fighting over the same real estate kind of thing.
00:18:29,00:18:30,Yes.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"And so they had this kind of thing,"
00:18:31,00:18:35,but it meant there was no space for the cob piece anymore.
00:18:35,00:18:36,And they were called-- and women wore them as well.
00:18:36,00:18:37,They were called stomachers.
00:18:37,00:18:39,And sometimes there would be a fashion
00:18:39,00:18:41,to wear a bigger stomacher.
00:18:41,00:18:43,And that would make you look a little bit pregnant.
00:18:43,00:18:45,And then sometimes not.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"And the reason they were called ""Pee's Cod"""
00:18:47,00:18:49,is because they looked a little bit like a pea pod
00:18:49,00:18:52,because they kind of tapered at the bottom.
00:18:52,00:18:55,And they were a very potent sexual symbol.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"And this is one of the reasons that the phrase ""shelling peas"""
00:18:58,00:19:00,became a euphemism for sex.
00:19:00,00:19:01,Really?
00:19:01,00:19:02,You did it?
00:19:02,00:19:03,It did.
00:19:03,00:19:07,"Well, I mean, it was in the 16th century."
00:19:07,00:19:11,And some of us haven't moved on.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"But also because pea fields, people"
00:19:13,00:19:15,used to have sex in pea fields as well.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Of course it is.
00:19:16,00:19:20,Peas were just very sexy.
00:19:20,00:19:22,Peas were just very sexy in the 16th century.
00:19:22,00:19:24,Beds were hard to come by.
00:19:24,00:19:29,You know that outfit that you see a lot of in medieval depictions
00:19:29,00:19:30,of gestures and so on.
00:19:30,00:19:33,It's the two-color outfit that is horizontal--
00:19:33,00:19:34,Like a highlight.
00:19:34,00:19:34,"Yes, exactly."
00:19:34,00:19:36,"So yellow on this side, red on this side,"
00:19:36,00:19:38,completely down the middle.
00:19:38,00:19:41,That is called my party outfit.
00:19:41,00:19:42,What do you mean?
00:19:42,00:19:43,"Well, no."
00:19:43,00:19:45,"No, we do-- yeah, we've been to a party with you."
00:19:45,00:19:47,"That's what you were, that's great."
00:19:47,00:19:52,"So it's MI, so I guess me, technically, and P-A-R-T-I,"
00:19:52,00:19:55,me party outfits.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"Oh, and is it like, it separates me."
00:19:57,00:19:58,It parts me.
00:19:58,00:20:01,"No, it's probably Italian or something, but--"
00:20:01,00:20:05,"Yeah, but probably an Italian means this parts me."
00:20:05,00:20:06,No?
00:20:06,00:20:09,"I think-- no, I think it's Jordi, actually."
00:20:09,00:20:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:14,00:20:16,Where's my party outfit?
00:20:16,00:20:20,"It feels like-- it feels like if we talk about a fashion,"
00:20:20,00:20:24,"we have to talk about Bob Rommel, who was the creator of fashion,"
00:20:24,00:20:25,even today.
00:20:25,00:20:27,So Bob Rommel was the most fashionable man
00:20:27,00:20:30,"at the turn of the 19th century, basically, wasn't he?"
00:20:30,00:20:31,Very early 19th century.
00:20:31,00:20:35,And he used to take five hours to get dressed each day.
00:20:35,00:20:37,He polishes boots in-- I know.
00:20:37,00:20:38,How does he get anything else done?
00:20:38,00:20:39,Polishes boots in champagne.
00:20:39,00:20:43,"He had three separate hairdressers, one for his temples,"
00:20:43,00:20:47,"one for his forehead, and one for the back of his head."
00:20:47,00:20:48,That's incredible.
00:20:48,00:20:49,They must have all--
00:20:49,00:20:51,were they doing it at the same time?
00:20:51,00:20:53,"It's not really like a game of consequences,"
00:20:53,00:20:55,"where you do one of them, and then you have to work out"
00:20:55,00:20:57,what they want after that.
00:20:57,00:20:58,That's really how they match.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"There should be turf war as well,"
00:21:00,00:21:03,"between the temples and the top, and then the top and the back."
00:21:03,00:21:03,Yeah.
00:21:03,00:21:04,Yeah.
00:21:04,00:21:05,We've very tense back there.
00:21:05,00:21:06,Yeah.
00:21:06,00:21:10,And you also had separate glove makers.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"So we had a glove maker for the palm, glove maker"
00:21:12,00:21:14,"for the fingers, and glove maker for the thumb."
00:21:14,00:21:15,No.
00:21:15,00:21:16,You've got to have-- because it's different skills
00:21:16,00:21:18,making the thumb to making the fingers.
00:21:18,00:21:18,It's very different.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"Very different, yes."
00:21:20,00:21:21,Doesn't feel like it.
00:21:21,00:21:22,Wow.
00:21:22,00:21:23,You don't know fashion.
00:21:23,00:21:24,That's true.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"We're going to have to-- oh, we're going to have to move on,"
00:21:26,00:21:27,basically.
00:21:27,00:21:28,"Well, I should just say, Bob Rommel is the reason"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"that you're dressed like you're dressed today, all of you."
00:21:30,00:21:33,"And because everyone looks absurd until he came along,"
00:21:33,00:21:37,they all wore these powdered wigs and these big ruffs
00:21:37,00:21:38,and frills and colors.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"And he basically said, take all the colors away,"
00:21:40,00:21:42,"all the textures, what you want is"
00:21:42,00:21:44,neutrally colored clothes that are cut with precision.
00:21:44,00:21:46,He banned perfume and jewelry for men.
00:21:46,00:21:49,And men basically dressed like that today.
00:21:49,00:21:50,That's why you're all stuck in these.
00:21:50,00:21:54,"Yeah, but then it still took him five hours to get ready."
00:21:54,00:21:55,"He got rid of all that stuff, and he's"
00:21:55,00:21:57,"like, but it's still going to take me five hours"
00:21:57,00:21:59,to put on a pair of trousers and a shirt.
00:21:59,00:22:01,But it was exclusively dating herring ladies
00:22:01,00:22:06,who are still shampooing for the first time.
00:22:06,00:22:09,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:22:09,00:22:11,And that is Chazinsky.
00:22:11,00:22:14,"My fact is, the North Pole is moving so fast"
00:22:14,00:22:15,that we can't keep up.
00:22:15,00:22:16,So what?
00:22:16,00:22:19,The next polar expedition is going to go on indefinitely.
00:22:19,00:22:22,They're just going to be running after it.
00:22:22,00:22:23,Chasing it.
00:22:23,00:22:25,This is a real worry.
00:22:25,00:22:27,This is the magnetic North Pole we're talking about.
00:22:27,00:22:29,"And specifically, when I say we can't keep up,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"our phones can't keep up, our maps can't keep up."
00:22:32,00:22:35,So there's this thing called the World Magnetic Model.
00:22:35,00:22:38,"And basically, this is the model that works out where North is."
00:22:38,00:22:40,And it's updated periodically.
00:22:40,00:22:44,"And it was supposed to be updated, I believe, in 2020."
00:22:44,00:22:46,And then they had a quick look at where the North Pole
00:22:46,00:22:49,"has got to since 2015 or something, and it was last updated."
00:22:49,00:22:50,And it's moved so fast.
00:22:50,00:22:52,They've got to update it now because all of our maps are on.
00:22:52,00:22:54,And so this is announced by scientists
00:22:54,00:22:57,at the National Center for Environmental Information.
00:22:57,00:22:59,"And they said, because of unplanned variations"
00:22:59,00:23:02,"in the Arctic region, it's fucked."
00:23:02,00:23:04,If you tried to get to the North Pole--
00:23:04,00:23:07,"Sorry, that's the part of the official press release."
00:23:07,00:23:14,I slipped out of the quote marks without making that clear.
00:23:14,00:23:16,"On the current model, if you tried to fly to the North Pole"
00:23:16,00:23:18,"using your phones without the update,"
00:23:18,00:23:20,you'd end up 25 miles away from it.
00:23:20,00:23:21,Which is quite far.
00:23:21,00:23:25,"Oh, I could walk 25 miles in the Arctic."
00:23:25,00:23:28,Do we know why it's moved?
00:23:28,00:23:30,"No, we know it's always fluctuated"
00:23:30,00:23:33,because we think it's because there's
00:23:33,00:23:36,"this big molten core of iron in the middle of the earth,"
00:23:36,00:23:37,and it's sloshing around.
00:23:37,00:23:40,And so that is causing this magnetism to slightly slosh around.
00:23:40,00:23:43,But we really don't know why it's accelerating so fast.
00:23:43,00:23:46,So it's suddenly slightly massively speeding up.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"Over 30 years, the rate of distance"
00:23:48,00:23:51,move per year has sped up from 15 kilometers a year.
00:23:51,00:23:54,It was moving to 55 kilometers a year.
00:23:54,00:23:55,"And no, we don't know why."
00:23:55,00:23:56,We don't know what's happening in the middle of the earth.
00:23:56,00:23:57,It's causing this.
00:23:57,00:24:01,"Just to make it clear, this is not the normal North Pole,"
00:24:01,00:24:03,which is the bit that the earth spins on.
00:24:03,00:24:06,This is where the magnets go.
00:24:06,00:24:10,"I mean, I don't know who you are to label one normal."
00:24:10,00:24:14,"But yeah, so it's not the geographic North Pole, which is--"
00:24:14,00:24:15,Give it to where your compass will.
00:24:15,00:24:17,The top of the earth is where your compass is going to be.
00:24:17,00:24:23,"Right, I believe that the magnetic South Pole is not moving."
00:24:23,00:24:24,It is moving a little bit.
00:24:24,00:24:25,It's not moving as much.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"Yeah, but it's slowly getting more out of kilter."
00:24:28,00:24:29,So the opposite of the magnetic North Pole
00:24:29,00:24:31,is not the magnetic South Pole.
00:24:31,00:24:32,Yeah.
00:24:32,00:24:33,So it's crazy.
00:24:33,00:24:34,I read that.
00:24:34,00:24:37,So you were saying that they had to redo it and announce it.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"So they finally got all the stuff together,"
00:24:39,00:24:42,all the information about where the magnetic North Pole is.
00:24:42,00:24:44,They were about to release the information
00:24:44,00:24:45,for people who needed it.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"And then suddenly, in America, that government shutdown"
00:24:48,00:24:49,happened.
00:24:49,00:24:50,And they weren't able to release it.
00:24:50,00:24:54,So they had to sit in limbo with the updated information
00:24:54,00:24:57,and anyone who is 25 miles closer to the North Pole
00:24:57,00:25:00,than they thought was suddenly unable to access it.
00:25:00,00:25:00,Yeah.
00:25:00,00:25:03,It affected millions of people.
00:25:03,00:25:06,"And I think it's moving towards Russia, isn't it?"
00:25:06,00:25:09,"It's currently still in Canadian territory,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,but it's moving up towards Siberia.
00:25:11,00:25:14,Putin's declaring war on it.
00:25:14,00:25:17,"Well, I read that in 2001, Russian researchers"
00:25:17,00:25:19,made the world's biggest magnet.
00:25:19,00:25:23,And I'm not saying that that's what caused it.
00:25:23,00:25:29,"But they created a 2,800 Tesla magnetic field"
00:25:29,00:25:31,by getting a massive magnet and then
00:25:31,00:25:33,doing a massive explosion around it.
00:25:33,00:25:34,So it really pushed it in.
00:25:34,00:25:36,And this was the biggest magnetism
00:25:36,00:25:38,that had ever been created on Earth.
00:25:38,00:25:39,Wow.
00:25:39,00:25:41,And I'm not saying it's anything to do with it.
00:25:41,00:25:43,"Well, I didn't know we were in the business of encouraging conspiracy"
00:25:43,00:25:44,theorists.
00:25:44,00:25:49,"But what did he gain from seizing the North Pole, though?"
00:25:49,00:25:50,Santa.
00:25:50,00:25:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:56,00:25:58,Give me that good bad list.
00:25:58,00:25:59,Trump.
00:25:59,00:26:00,Trump.
00:26:00,00:26:07,So I was looking at sort of the history of the North Pole.
00:26:07,00:26:11,"And people really didn't know what was up there in the past,"
00:26:11,00:26:13,because nobody had been there.
00:26:13,00:26:19,So this is related to the Hollow Earth theory.
00:26:19,00:26:20,We're on conspiracy theories.
00:26:20,00:26:24,So this was proposed by Edmund Halley of Halley's
00:26:24,00:26:27,comet fame in 1692.
00:26:27,00:26:28,He suggested the planet was a series of shells
00:26:28,00:26:31,"inside each other, because that would explain"
00:26:31,00:26:33,"anomalous astronomical data, you know,"
00:26:33,00:26:35,when stars appear to move back and forwards.
00:26:35,00:26:38,So that was his great explanation for it.
00:26:38,00:26:40,But this theory got taken on by other people.
00:26:40,00:26:41,And it evolved.
00:26:41,00:26:44,"And in 1812, there was a war veteran called John--"
00:26:44,00:26:47,"I think his name was Simms, S-Y-D-L-M--"
00:26:47,00:26:49,and he wrote that the Earth had massive holes
00:26:49,00:26:51,"at the North and South Pole, and that that was the way"
00:26:51,00:26:53,into the Hollow Earth.
00:26:53,00:26:56,"And that the entire Earth inside, that he called them Simms"
00:26:56,00:27:00,"Holes, and he campaigned to launch an expedition"
00:27:00,00:27:04,to the North Pole so that he could go into the Simms Holes
00:27:04,00:27:07,and explore what was on the inside of the Earth.
00:27:07,00:27:10,And Congress voted on funding--
00:27:10,00:27:11,Did they?
00:27:11,00:27:13,"Yeah, I mean, they voted against funding it."
00:27:13,00:27:15,"But Hitler was obsessed with it, wasn't it?"
00:27:15,00:27:18,"Hitler-- yeah, he had expeditions."
00:27:18,00:27:19,I think I'm right in saying this.
00:27:19,00:27:22,I only know this from reading a tie in Indiana Jones
00:27:22,00:27:24,book called Indiana Jones in the Hollow Earth.
00:27:24,00:27:26,But so it's good.
00:27:26,00:27:29,"But in that, Hitler does go exploring"
00:27:29,00:27:32,for the Hollow Earth had actual expeditions.
00:27:32,00:27:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:32,00:27:35,We have to have some basic standards
00:27:35,00:27:38,of extensible sources.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"But they're written based on history,"
00:27:40,00:27:44,like with the young of the Covenant and the aliens.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"They came back to a young town in his gestor's costume,"
00:27:47,00:27:49,"squatting over the catalysts of trade,"
00:27:49,00:27:52,reading Hitler Indiana Jones stories.
00:27:52,00:27:54,"You know, not only is it the North Pole"
00:27:54,00:27:57,"that we're sort of losing track of GPS-wise,"
00:27:57,00:27:59,but Australia as well.
00:27:59,00:27:59,Whoa.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"Yeah, Australia is a bit--"
00:28:01,00:28:02,"Oh, well, never mind."
00:28:02,00:28:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:05,00:28:07,Australia moves a lot.
00:28:07,00:28:10,It's shifted by 4.9 feet since 1994.
00:28:10,00:28:11,That's not a lot.
00:28:11,00:28:12,That's not a lot.
00:28:12,00:28:13,Is it not?
00:28:13,00:28:17,"Well, Australia's massive of four feet is not massive."
00:28:17,00:28:21,"Oh, but for a whole thing to shift that way."
00:28:21,00:28:23,But you're not going to get to Ez Rock
00:28:23,00:28:25,"and be four feet away, and God can't see it anywhere."
00:28:25,00:28:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:28,00:28:33,"Yeah, good for you."
00:28:33,00:28:35,But I programmed the boat to stop right
00:28:35,00:28:36,at the edge of Australia.
00:28:36,00:28:39,So we're just going to step off the boat off the presumably
00:28:39,00:28:42,appear that we'll be waiting for us there.
00:28:42,00:28:44,But there was a bigger problem.
00:28:44,00:28:47,I don't know if anyone here uses Bing Maps.
00:28:47,00:28:48,Yes.
00:28:48,00:28:49,You use Bing Maps.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"Of course, I don't use Bing Maps."
00:28:51,00:28:52,It's on Microsoft.
00:28:52,00:28:53,It's on Microsoft.
00:28:53,00:28:56,"So unfortunately, it turns out that I can't"
00:28:56,00:28:57,believe you use Bing Maps.
00:28:57,00:28:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:58,00:29:00,Was genuinely not expecting.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"Sussi calls me some problems in the past, but go on."
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Well, yeah."
00:29:04,00:29:06,"Like, for example, if you were looking for Melbourne,"
00:29:06,00:29:10,"because Bing Maps had Melbourne placed off the coast of Japan,"
00:29:10,00:29:11,wow.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"That's not for the same reason as the far feet, though."
00:29:14,00:29:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:15,00:29:16,Yeah.
00:29:16,00:29:18,"This explains when we played Australia, Dan,"
00:29:18,00:29:21,you were four feet away every gig.
00:29:21,00:29:22,You were just off in the wings.
00:29:22,00:29:23,And I was in Japan.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Yeah.
00:29:24,00:29:25,And there it is.
00:29:25,00:29:27,So here's the weird thing.
00:29:27,00:29:29,"Bing Maps is updated, not completely,"
00:29:29,00:29:32,"but a bit, by information via Wikipedia."
00:29:32,00:29:36,"Now, obviously, Wikipedia is often tampered with."
00:29:36,00:29:39,"And in this circumstance, when they did an update,"
00:29:39,00:29:42,they had ingested someone who tampered with where Melbourne was.
00:29:42,00:29:44,"And suddenly, Bing Maps was registering"
00:29:44,00:29:46,off the coast of Japan.
00:29:46,00:29:48,"Well, so Bing isn't the only one, right?"
00:29:48,00:29:50,Apple Maps had serious problems.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"So in 2012, they dropped Google Maps as their provider."
00:29:53,00:29:54,And they went to Apple.
00:29:54,00:29:57,"And maybe you will remember, there were some serious issues."
00:29:57,00:29:59,"For instance, there was an Australian town called Mildura,"
00:29:59,00:30:03,which was placed 75 kilometers from where it actually was.
00:30:03,00:30:04,Problem is that it was in Victoria.
00:30:04,00:30:06,And it was sort of in the bush.
00:30:06,00:30:08,So there were four separate incidents in the space
00:30:08,00:30:10,"of a week, where groups of travelers went,"
00:30:10,00:30:12,so we're hiking to this town.
00:30:12,00:30:14,And it ended up 75 kilometers away in the middle
00:30:14,00:30:17,of the remote Australian bush in 40 degree heat.
00:30:17,00:30:19,And all had to be rescued.
00:30:19,00:30:20,"Oh, wow."
00:30:20,00:30:23,"Also, if you search for Manchester United Football Club,"
00:30:23,00:30:25,it directed you to Sale United?
00:30:25,00:30:31,I think it's like an under 12's team or something.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"And it's for ages five and above, sorry."
00:30:34,00:30:36,And it had satellite images that it
00:30:36,00:30:38,advertised as Apple Maps again.
00:30:38,00:30:41,But it hadn't worked out to penetrate the clouds.
00:30:41,00:30:44,"So a lot of its satellite images, if you went to look at somewhere,"
00:30:44,00:30:45,it was just you were above the clouds.
00:30:45,00:30:47,You just saw cloud cover.
00:30:47,00:30:50,What a weird football team to have a policy of accepting
00:30:50,00:30:52,anyone above the edge of five.
00:30:52,00:30:57,"You're going to get a very mixed range of abilities, yes?"
00:30:57,00:30:58,Time for the final fact of the show.
00:30:58,00:30:59,And that is my fact.
00:30:59,00:31:03,My fact this week is that the British vegetarian movement
00:31:03,00:31:10,was started 200 years ago by a man called Reverend Calhard.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Yeah.
00:31:11,00:31:14,And this was in Salford in England.
00:31:14,00:31:15,And this was 200 years ago.
00:31:15,00:31:19,He was the Reverend of this chapel.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"And in January 1809, he stood at the pulpit"
00:31:22,00:31:25,"and he made a plea to say to all of his congregation,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,we need to stop eating meat.
00:31:26,00:31:27,They all agreed.
00:31:27,00:31:29,And that was the fundamental beginnings
00:31:29,00:31:31,of vegetarianism in the UK.
00:31:31,00:31:32,Yeah.
00:31:32,00:31:33,Wow.
00:31:33,00:31:35,Calhard.
00:31:35,00:31:38,"Yes, so he said that if God had meant us to eat meat,"
00:31:38,00:31:42,then it would have come to us in an edible form like a fruit.
00:31:42,00:31:43,So it makes sense.
00:31:43,00:31:47,Sushi is arguably fine.
00:31:47,00:31:53,"But Calhard, he wrote hymns that were pro-vegetarianism."
00:31:53,00:31:59,"So he wrote one hymn called ""Little Lamb, who ate thee?"""
00:31:59,00:32:01,That's amazing.
00:32:01,00:32:04,"He wrote another one called ""Eaters of flesh."""
00:32:04,00:32:07,"""Eaters of flesh, could you decry our food and sacred laws?"
00:32:07,00:32:12,"Did you behold the Lamb can die and feel yourself the cause?"""
00:32:12,00:32:15,"""Low there, he struggles, hear it moan,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,"a stretch beneath the knife."""
00:32:17,00:32:20,"I mean, this is pretty tough stuff, isn't it?"
00:32:20,00:32:21,"But that is something to rhyme with knife,"
00:32:21,00:32:24,because that's not a good ending to the poem.
00:32:24,00:32:26,"""It's eyes would melt a heart of stone,"
00:32:26,00:32:28,"how meek it begs for life."""
00:32:28,00:32:29,Wow.
00:32:29,00:32:32,"This act, because we did all just have quite a big meaty curry"
00:32:32,00:32:35,"before we came on stage, and I'm now feeling quite guilty,"
00:32:35,00:32:36,as well as sick.
00:32:36,00:32:40,I like my thing that I like about this fact.
00:32:40,00:32:43,"Obviously, it's vegetarianism started by a man called Calhard,"
00:32:43,00:32:45,and I love those little name connections
00:32:45,00:32:48,when they go anti-the thing that you're talking about.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"And weirdly, the whole setup of vegetarianism"
00:32:51,00:32:55,in that period of the 1800s was completely rife
00:32:55,00:32:58,with that kind of names that were connected to either animals
00:32:58,00:32:59,or meat.
00:32:59,00:33:02,"So the key groups that formed the vegetarian society,"
00:33:02,00:33:06,"which eventually got its name in 1847,"
00:33:06,00:33:08,"were people who were called the Bible Christian Church,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,which was what he was a part of Calhard.
00:33:11,00:33:13,"You had the Concordium, which was a boarding school,"
00:33:13,00:33:16,and then you had the readers of the Truth Tester Journal.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"So Concordium, which was the high school,"
00:33:19,00:33:21,"sorry, the boarding school, in 1837,"
00:33:21,00:33:23,they were located in Ham Common.
00:33:23,00:33:24,Nice.
00:33:24,00:33:25,That's where they were.
00:33:25,00:33:28,"And then the Truth Testers, who were the magazine"
00:33:28,00:33:31,"that were pushing it, it was taken over,"
00:33:31,00:33:34,"the editor ship, by a guy called William Horsel."
00:33:34,00:33:35,No way.
00:33:35,00:33:36,"Yeah, so you suddenly have Horsen there."
00:33:36,00:33:41,"And then the Truth Testers, they basically,"
00:33:41,00:33:44,"they got this other guy who wrote a very important letter,"
00:33:44,00:33:47,who's called William Oldham.
00:33:47,00:33:48,Wow.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"So then, in 1847,"
00:33:50,00:33:53,"in the listeners at home, Dan is pointed,"
00:33:53,00:33:55,"and he knows bored behind him with bits of string,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,and connecting everything else to everything else.
00:33:57,00:34:04,"And so in 1847, they officially named the Vegetarian Society,"
00:34:04,00:34:06,"where William Oldham was the treasurer,"
00:34:06,00:34:09,"and Horsel was the elected secretary,"
00:34:09,00:34:13,and that conference that they had to name it was in Ramsgate.
00:34:13,00:34:14,Oh.
00:34:14,00:34:15,It did sound like--
00:34:15,00:34:17,"When you sort of climb out to the end there,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,it did sound like a crazed person.
00:34:20,00:34:21,"Like, we need to call a doctor."
00:34:21,00:34:22,"And by the way, for the people at home,"
00:34:22,00:34:25,he really did climb accidentally under that.
00:34:25,00:34:27,"The herring of fleeing the area, as we speak."
00:34:27,00:34:31,It's like synchronized spawning on the stage.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"Well, one of the other pioneers was a man called--"
00:34:33,00:34:36,"I hate to add to Dan's crackpot theory, William Lamb."
00:34:36,00:34:38,He was a doctor in 1815.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"He came up with what he called a water and vegetable diet,"
00:34:41,00:34:45,"and he said it would cure acne, tuberculosis, scrofula,"
00:34:45,00:34:47,"asthma, and lots of other diseases."
00:34:47,00:34:48,Wow.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"I don't think it did, but it probably would have done a harm."
00:34:50,00:34:53,"If you've got scrofula, give it a go."
00:34:53,00:34:57,"You know, they nearly weren't called vegetarians, vegetarians."
00:34:57,00:34:59,"Oh, well, they're going to be cult."
00:34:59,00:35:01,So there were lots of potentials.
00:35:01,00:35:02,Pythagorean?
00:35:02,00:35:03,"Was one of them, was it?"
00:35:03,00:35:04,That's true.
00:35:04,00:35:05,That's an old one.
00:35:05,00:35:06,"Pythagoras, supposedly."
00:35:06,00:35:07,"Sorry, I'm actually meeting vegans."
00:35:07,00:35:10,So vegans were nearly not called vegans.
00:35:10,00:35:13,"So in 1944, there was a member of the vegetarian society"
00:35:13,00:35:15,"in London, who was called Donald Watson."
00:35:15,00:35:17,And he set up a new newspaper for vegans.
00:35:17,00:35:20,He wanted to go a bit further with the vegetarianism.
00:35:20,00:35:24,And he asked his readers for suggestions as to alternatives.
00:35:24,00:35:27,And they came up with things like dairy ban.
00:35:27,00:35:29,"So that would be the noun, I am a dairy ban."
00:35:29,00:35:33,"Or bennervor, instead of omnivore or carnivore,"
00:35:33,00:35:35,"a bennervor, someone who eats good things."
00:35:35,00:35:37,Or boom-or-je.
00:35:37,00:35:38,"No, nice."
00:35:38,00:35:40,I'm a boom-or-je.
00:35:40,00:35:42,"So it was a big thing in the 19th century,"
00:35:42,00:35:44,the vegetarian movement.
00:35:44,00:35:46,It was a big thing in London.
00:35:46,00:35:49,And there was one vegetarian restaurant in London in 1878.
00:35:49,00:35:52,"And by the 1880s, there were 52."
00:35:52,00:35:53,So it suddenly took off.
00:35:53,00:35:55,But the most popular one around this time
00:35:55,00:36:00,was started by the best real tennis player in the world.
00:36:00,00:36:01,That's a good word.
00:36:01,00:36:01,Wow.
00:36:01,00:36:03,He was a guy called Eustace Miles.
00:36:03,00:36:05,And he was basically a real tennis--
00:36:05,00:36:08,"so you know, real tennis is sort of like weird indoor royal"
00:36:08,00:36:10,tennis precursor to tennis.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"And he was the world champion, basically,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,from 1898 to 1911.
00:36:14,00:36:15,He was the best player in the world.
00:36:15,00:36:17,And he was also obsessed with fad diets.
00:36:17,00:36:19,And he was a vegetarian.
00:36:19,00:36:22,And he opened this restaurant that was incredibly popular.
00:36:22,00:36:26,"And it had stuff on the menu, like little acronyms on the menu"
00:36:26,00:36:26,like we have today.
00:36:26,00:36:27,We have a V for vegetarian.
00:36:27,00:36:31,"He had NN, which meant very nourishing."
00:36:31,00:36:36,"And he also had-- next to many of his items, FU."
00:36:36,00:36:40,And that meant free from uric acid.
00:36:40,00:36:42,"Oh, obviously."
00:36:42,00:36:44,I love my meals free from uric acid.
00:36:44,00:36:48,I always ask free from uric acid.
00:36:48,00:36:50,"It was quite a big thing, because it sort of caused gout."
00:36:50,00:36:51,But he was a bit weird.
00:36:51,00:36:53,He wrote an article once about how everyone
00:36:53,00:36:56,should be able to live on a diet of two plasmon biscuits
00:36:56,00:36:57,in one lentil a day.
00:36:57,00:36:59,One lentil?
00:36:59,00:37:00,Just the one.
00:37:00,00:37:01,Yeah.
00:37:01,00:37:02,Don't overdo it.
00:37:02,00:37:03,Wow.
00:37:03,00:37:06,"You know in Australia, you get kangaterians."
00:37:06,00:37:07,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:07,00:37:08,I was kind of a kangaterian in Australia.
00:37:08,00:37:09,Were you?
00:37:09,00:37:11,"OK, so if anyone here doesn't know what that is,"
00:37:11,00:37:15,kangaterian is where you eat purely kangaroo and no other
00:37:15,00:37:18,"meats, and there's an ethical and moral logic"
00:37:18,00:37:21,behind the idea of becoming a kangaterian.
00:37:21,00:37:23,One is that one of the big problems we have with farming
00:37:23,00:37:27,"cattle is the methane the farts are ruining the ozone layer,"
00:37:27,00:37:31,"whereas kangaroos really emit a very, very tiny fraction"
00:37:31,00:37:32,of the amount that it calda.
00:37:32,00:37:34,"So if you started farming them, that"
00:37:34,00:37:36,would be fantastic for the environment.
00:37:36,00:37:38,Although one of the reasons that also is ethical
00:37:38,00:37:40,"is that they're not farmed, so they're wild."
00:37:40,00:37:41,There are a whole host of reasons.
00:37:41,00:37:43,"They're a massive pest, aren't they?"
00:37:43,00:37:45,"They're a pest, yeah."
00:37:45,00:37:48,"I always think pests as a subjective term, isn't it?"
00:37:48,00:37:50,We're probably a pest of them as much as that.
00:37:50,00:37:51,"Oh, but they're very hard to catch, though,"
00:37:51,00:37:54,because they're always four feet away
00:37:54,00:37:55,from where you actually thought they were.
00:37:55,00:38:02,This is a whole theory.
00:38:02,00:38:05,"There's a guy called Jackson Landers, who's written a book,"
00:38:05,00:38:08,proposing that vegetarians who want to be vegetarians
00:38:08,00:38:12,"for planetary reasons, but they like meat,"
00:38:12,00:38:14,he suggested they should only hunt and eat
00:38:14,00:38:17,"invasive species, and he wrote a book"
00:38:17,00:38:18,where he did exactly that.
00:38:18,00:38:23,"So he ate pigeons in New York City, which I think is brave."
00:38:23,00:38:27,"Yeah, there's a whole theory behind it."
00:38:27,00:38:29,"Again, I don't like to be a dickhead here,"
00:38:29,00:38:31,but I always think invasive species
00:38:31,00:38:32,"is a very human term, isn't it?"
00:38:32,00:38:35,"Because that implies they have a concept of nationhood,"
00:38:35,00:38:37,which most animals don't.
00:38:37,00:38:39,"So they're like, I'm allowed to be in New York."
00:38:39,00:38:41,"The pigeons, they're not."
00:38:41,00:38:44,They don't have the kind of strict immigration policies
00:38:44,00:38:48,"that humans have, I think, at time of recording, anyway."
00:38:48,00:38:55,"On stigma against vegetarianism, this is a weird thing."
00:38:55,00:38:57,"There was a study by the University of Southampton,"
00:38:57,00:39:00,"and it found that men, in particular,"
00:39:00,00:39:03,don't like choosing vegetarian dishes
00:39:03,00:39:05,"when they're with other men, particularly,"
00:39:05,00:39:06,for fear of being ridiculed.
00:39:06,00:39:08,And this study was a year long.
00:39:08,00:39:11,It was called man food.
00:39:11,00:39:14,And the sample was small.
00:39:14,00:39:18,"It was only 22 men, so it was not a comprehensive city-wide thing."
00:39:18,00:39:23,"But basically, even men who don't like meat,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,"or men who find it hurts their digestive system,"
00:39:25,00:39:28,"or men who've been literally asked to meet,"
00:39:28,00:39:32,"eat less meat by their doctor, or see themselves as green,"
00:39:32,00:39:34,"they want to eat meat, particularly around male friends,"
00:39:34,00:39:37,because they think it's sort of cool.
00:39:37,00:39:38,It's cool.
00:39:38,00:39:41,"And presumably, that's Western men."
00:39:41,00:39:43,Is men in Southampton?
00:39:43,00:39:45,Right.
00:39:45,00:39:48,I can't stress enough how small the sample was on this study.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"Well, there was a study--"
00:39:49,00:39:52,"It's two football teams in Southampton, isn't it?"
00:39:52,00:39:53,"22, man."
00:39:53,00:39:54,"Yeah, they had a Gamer football."
00:39:54,00:39:56,From the age of five upwards.
00:39:56,00:40:01,"There was a study done in Canada, which actually"
00:40:01,00:40:04,showed that you can calm a man down by showing him
00:40:04,00:40:05,a picture of a piece of meat.
00:40:05,00:40:07,Stop it!
00:40:07,00:40:09,"No, you can't."
00:40:09,00:40:11,"Yeah, no, no, that is so stupid."
00:40:11,00:40:13,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:40:13,00:40:16,"Yeah, McGill University in Canada, and they--"
00:40:16,00:40:17,What do they do?
00:40:17,00:40:18,How do they do it?
00:40:18,00:40:23,"So they were barfights with a big, laminated steak."
00:40:23,00:40:26,"Don't worry, let's chill out."
00:40:26,00:40:30,"If I was a general, I would make all my soldiers carry pictures"
00:40:30,00:40:33,"of meat on their rifles, on the bayonets,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,to completely neutralise the opposing army.
00:40:35,00:40:39,"Give it like a kabab, wouldn't it, of the old bayonets?"
00:40:39,00:40:40,It's such a great idea.
00:40:40,00:40:48,What it was is that they had 82 men sit down
00:40:48,00:40:50,and an actor read out a script to them.
00:40:50,00:40:53,"And if the actor ever stuffed up, and as the actor was reading,"
00:40:53,00:40:54,they were looking at different pictures.
00:40:54,00:40:57,"Every time the actor stuffed up, they"
00:40:57,00:41:00,were told to send a loud sound to the actor
00:41:00,00:41:01,to sort of--
00:41:01,00:41:03,as punishment for stuffing up.
00:41:03,00:41:06,"So they would stuff up, and they would press this button,"
00:41:06,00:41:07,and there would be levels of loudness.
00:41:07,00:41:10,"Whenever the actor stuffed up, while they were looking"
00:41:10,00:41:14,"at a piece of meat, they decided to not really give any punishment,"
00:41:14,00:41:15,whatsoever.
00:41:15,00:41:18,"OK, so maybe it's more that they're distracted by the meat."
00:41:18,00:41:21,"No, it's according to--"
00:41:21,00:41:23,They were calmed by it.
00:41:23,00:41:25,I do my best here.
00:41:25,00:41:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:26,00:41:27,What's my study?
00:41:27,00:41:29,Are there any speculations as to why?
00:41:29,00:41:30,"Yes, actually, this is really interesting."
00:41:30,00:41:34,"It's because the idea that men, once they see meat,"
00:41:34,00:41:38,"and it's in a cook form, it's so they can see the charcoal-grilled,"
00:41:38,00:41:39,kind of nice--
00:41:39,00:41:40,It's a slab of steak.
00:41:40,00:41:42,"All that's been properly barbecued, someone."
00:41:42,00:41:44,"But also, they think it's caught."
00:41:44,00:41:45,I don't need to go hunting.
00:41:45,00:41:48,I don't need to be the man who's going to be aggressive and stuff.
00:41:48,00:41:50,I can calmly eat my meal now.
00:41:50,00:41:58,"And again, this is not my study, but you wasted everybody's time with it."
00:41:58,00:42:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:42:01,00:42:05,So it's reassuring them that they're going to get some meat.
00:42:05,00:42:08,They're thinking of meal time with their families.
00:42:08,00:42:09,"They're thinking, this is a nice image."
00:42:09,00:42:10,"And yeah, calm down."
00:42:10,00:42:11,Is it a pretty picture?
00:42:11,00:42:12,"For me, man."
00:42:12,00:42:15,I got another thing about-- this is about veganism this time.
00:42:15,00:42:19,"President Eisenhower from America, his great-granddaughter,"
00:42:19,00:42:23,thinks that veganism is going to help us to contact aliens.
00:42:23,00:42:24,Great.
00:42:24,00:42:27,"This is, actually, this is fractionally more plausible"
00:42:27,00:42:31,than the last thing you ran up the flagpole.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"That she said, we have to understand"
00:42:33,00:42:34,"that we are multi-dimensional beings,"
00:42:34,00:42:38,and based on our frequency perceptions and vibratory levels
00:42:38,00:42:41,"that we are functioning from, we are going to see different things."
00:42:41,00:42:42,So that's her.
00:42:42,00:42:45,So that's Eisenhower's great-granddaughter.
00:42:45,00:42:48,She thinks that meat holds us down the density of our bodies.
00:42:48,00:42:50,"And if we want to connect with the higher beings,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,the vegetables are going to be much lighter.
00:42:52,00:42:52,And they think--
00:42:52,00:42:54,"It's interesting, because some political families"
00:42:54,00:42:57,"you just think, oh, they've got so much power stored in the family."
00:42:57,00:43:00,They're just going to be in the front of politics
00:43:00,00:43:01,for generations to come.
00:43:01,00:43:04,I don't think the Eisenhower family is one of these families.
00:43:04,00:43:07,They're never going to elect an idiot to the president of America.
00:43:07,00:43:09,They say so they--
00:43:09,00:43:11,"It's also not super reassuring, what she said."
00:43:11,00:43:14,"So that implies that if you adopt a vegetarian or a vegan diet,"
00:43:14,00:43:16,you're just going to float away.
00:43:16,00:43:18,That's the implication.
00:43:18,00:43:20,It's true.
00:43:20,00:43:24,"OK, I can't believe we're ending on that, but that is--"
00:43:24,00:43:25,that is it.
00:43:25,00:43:26,That is all of our facts.
