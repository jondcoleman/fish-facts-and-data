00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:18.080
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.060
 as a Fish, a Weekly Podcast.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.440
 This week, coming to you live, from Edinburgh!

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.440
 [CHEERING]

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.300
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.820
 I am sitting here with Anacesansky, Andrew Huntson Murray,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.100
 and James Harkin.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.460
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.820
 Andy, my fact is that in 18th century Scotland,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.380
 people believed that herring would punish people

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 for adultery by leaving the area where the adultery

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.180
 had occurred.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.140
 This is a joke.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.140
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.540
 They're not in the bedroom.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.060
 They're not in the room, sorry. [LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.300
 No. It's disgusting.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.220
 But people at home, that was the amazing herring impression.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.180
 That was a good grief.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.860
 I mean, if anything, that would be a relief for the adultery.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.340
 Can this just wouldn't be-- Yeah, it's true.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.900
 Once the herring flops out, you can really get down to it.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.060
 And the old saying goes.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.580
 Well, we got there quite clearly anyway.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.980
 God.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.220
 So this is from a book.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.620
 It's called Herring Tales by an author called Donald Murray.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.580
 And so this is because herring used to be absolutely

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.860
 enormous.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.500
 So in the early 20th century, there were three million barrels

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.620
 coming into Scotland every single year.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.660
 But the thing is, they're fickle, OK?

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.500
 So they would frequently appear in massive numbers

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.220
 in one year.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460
 And then the next year, they wouldn't be there anymore.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.300
 They'd disappear.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.940
 And so in 1703, there was an author whose name, genuinely,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.380
 was Martin Martin, and he wrote about this superstition.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 He said, "It is a general observation all

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.780
 Scotland over that if a quarrel happened on the coast

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 where herring is caught and that blood be drawn violently,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.060
 then the herring go away."

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.900
 So it was true of violence.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.780
 And it was also true of adultery.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.500
 Oh, OK.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.620
 They're very judgmental, famously herring.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.580
 Yeah.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.060
 They do turn up in massive numbers when they do turn up, don't they?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.900
 They really come in a crew.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.900
 I think we think it could be the largest gathering

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.460
 of animals anywhere, herring schools.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.140
 So they gather in groups of up to 250 million.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140
 They've only quite recently been counted.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.060
 So the schools at the shows will be 40 kilometers wide.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.420
 And we're not totally sure.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.340
 They do have a synchronized spawning.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.780
 They get together at night.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.900
 That's a terrible Olympics event, isn't it?

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.740
 That's one at 2 AM.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.940
 Yeah, so they do their little dances, and then they spawn.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.860
 They count them.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.180
 Imagine having that job.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.580
 Yeah, it was quite--

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.620
 There was using different radar from different ships

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.580
 and bouncing it off all of them, I think.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.380
 Computers did it.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.660
 There wasn't a guy who was there making a tally.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.540
 So supposedly, in the 12th century off the coast of Scotland,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.980
 there were so many herring in the water

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.180
 that boats would sometimes get stuck in the water.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 No way.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.300
 Oh, what's that?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.300
 This was a guy called Saxo Grammaticus, who wrote in--

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.420
 This is true.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.940
 He was an author.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.140
 He was in 1204.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.500
 He wrote, "The whole sound contains such plentiful shells

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.900
 that sometimes boats striking them have difficulty

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140
 in rowing clear and no fishing gear,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.660
 but the hands is needed to take them."

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.820
 So you could just reach in and grab a herring.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.060
 Because they're quite thickly packed, aren't they?

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.020
 So you know, in some shells of fish,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.300
 you podge a finger and they'll scarper off.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.140
 But herring, I think, because they line up

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.660
 where your nose will be lined up with a torso

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.060
 of the bloke in front of you.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.060
 So basically, if you can imagine, there are almost no gaps

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.700
 between them in a shell, because they're sort of like a jigsaw

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.660
 perfectly fit together.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.740
 So it does mean that if you come across them

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.180
 and you are fishing, if you're in the middle of that group,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.540
 you cannot move to one side or the other.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.940
 You'll just completely start off.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.460
 Oh, wow.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.140
 So you can just scoop them all right up.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.740
 But Fisher people are very superstitious, aren't they?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.540
 Especially in Scotland, I've found.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.460
 In Scotland, they used to, if they weren't catching fish,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.060
 they thought they would have to show this sea

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.300
 what they were trying to do.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.700
 And then the sea would work it out.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.460
 And then it would give them some fish.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.740
 So as a last ditch effort, you would get one of your fellow

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.260
 fishermen and throw him into the water and then catch him

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.620
 with a rod.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.860
 And then the sea would go, oh, that's what you're trying to do.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 Really?

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.860
 Yeah.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.260
 That is amazing.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.460
 Wow.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.180
 That's like having to take a crap in your cat's cat litter box

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.180
 in order to--

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.180
 Sam, what?

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.580
 He doesn't even have a cat.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.180
 Wait, you know, to be like--

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.500
 I understand the principle.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.060
 I'm saying, have you done it?

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.580
 Wow.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.580
 No, once.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.900
 This is kind of related to James' thing

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.060
 about fishing people, fishermen out of the sea again.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.500
 But this is a related tradition, several hundred years ago,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.980
 which is that it's bad luck to save someone from drowning.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:25.740
 Because that sucks when your job's a lifeguard at the moment.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.220
 Yeah, because the sea needs it sacrifice.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.820
 So if you have picked the work experience fishermen

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.220
 to throw into the water, you should check this.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.420
 So people genuinely wouldn't save people

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.580
 because they thought it was bad luck?

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.420
 I don't know how much it happened.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.940
 Well, it might be that there's one fisherman

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.860
 who's been getting on everyone's nerves for a long time.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.860
 But if he falls in, I'm going to--

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.660
 Oh, sorry, no.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.860
 There's nothing we can do about it.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.540
 So there is--

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.740
 there is another bit of superstition in the Scottish Lowlands

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.580
 and that it is, by saying, good morning to someone,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.140
 it's considered bad luck to fishermen.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.260
 And so there are some fishermen apparently

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.660
 who would walk down the street.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.100
 And if someone says, good morning to them,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.100
 they'll go off, fuck sake, and just go home.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.940
 I thought it was that you'd go home and start again.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.980
 Oh, and go back and you sort of--

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.820
 OK, so you have to press a reset button on the expedition.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.660
 Are the sea-faring Scottish superstitions

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.300
 there's in the Hebrides tradition of tossing porridge

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.900
 into the sea, which I didn't know about?

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.900
 And this particularly happens on what's

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.900
 called big porridge day or great gruel Thursday.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.380
 And I think--

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.620
 Big porridge day.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.860
 Big porridge day.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.740
 This is from the 19th century book of customs.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.140
 I don't know if everyone still does it.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.060
 But this is--

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.540
 it happened in places like Iona.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.620
 And basically, it was-- you'd make a big dish of porridge with some butter

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.140
 and lots of other delicious ingredients.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.460
 And then you overturn the whole thing into the sea.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.220
 And that's thought to attract really valuable seaweed,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.340
 because it seems like a bab swapped to me, seaweed for porridge.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.980
 But they want to eat and cook with seaweed.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.220
 But also, the seaweed is used as a fertiliser, I think, right?

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.820
 Fertilizer, yes.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.900
 That'll be it.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.580
 And also, it was on Monday Thursday.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.060
 And so apparently, Monday Thursday was doubly holy in the Hebrides,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.780
 because not only did it have the whole Easter thing,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.500
 but also it was when you did the porridge seaweed swap.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.100
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact, very shortly.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.220
 If you work in the herring industry,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.060
 you can develop asthma from all the herring protein in the air.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.820
 So you get a condition which is called herring lung.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.580
 No.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.540
 Yeah, just absolutely microscopic particles of it in the air.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.180
 Well, there used to be a really big thing.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.020
 The herring girls was the sort of collective name

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.780
 for the women who processed herring,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.620
 who's a really important job.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.060
 And on a Saturday night, apparently,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.620
 they would have to wash their hair six times

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.180
 to get the smell out before they could go out,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.260
 because you're just working in herring

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.060
 and gusting herring all week long.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.060
 And did you know it was because of herring

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.340
 that probably the most important collection of musical manuscripts

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.140
 was saved, herring saved them.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.620
 So this was, after the Second World War,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.900
 there were loads of original Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach manuscripts.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.740
 All the famous ones you've heard of, all the big Beethoven symphonies,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.420
 all the Mozart's and all of them.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.580
 They were moved from the Berlin Museum,

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.460
 because people were worried about the fate that might befall them.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.540
 They were moved, and then they were sort of lost,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.780
 as things happened in the war, and they all disappeared.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.220
 And then, in 1973, there was this guy called Dr. Peter Whitehead

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.020
 who was working in the Natural History Museum.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.020
 And he was a biologist, and he was just obsessed

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.100
 with finding this picture of this herring.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.100
 So he kept on reading in really ancient documents

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.540
 about something that was either herring or an anchovy.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.460
 And he couldn't find the original picture

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.220
 that they were all referring to to deduce which of those two it was.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.340
 And he was obsessed with this.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.380
 And so he looked all over Europe to find this ancient picture.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.940
 And finally, he ended up in a library and crack off

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.380
 going through this massive crate.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.220
 And he was like, oh, my God, I found this 1648 picture,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.460
 and it's definitely a herring.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.700
 I've absolutely nailed it.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.300
 Thank God, by the way, sorry, I don't know who to tell,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.660
 but I've also found all the old manuscripts,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.020
 original manuscripts of Beethoven Mozart.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.380
 But have you seen that herring?

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.300
 And so we're still herring that music today.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.500
 [APPLAUSE]

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.420
 Yep, it deserved a boof.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.620
 All right, it's time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.900
 OK, my fact this week is that the most fashionable person

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.220
 of the 16th century was an accountant from Germany.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.940
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.060
 Doesn't it seem likely?

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.020
 Well, it is true, I think.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.980
 That was an early backtrack.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.380
 No, he was called Matthias Schwarz.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.020
 He was born in 1497, died in 1574.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.740
 And he was a German accountant, but he is most well-known

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.500
 for compiling a book called Kleidung's Buchlein,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.420
 or Buchlein, which means Book of Clothes.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.100
 And it's probably the world's first fashion book.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.940
 And he basically took pictures of the drawings

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.020
 of every single thing he ever wore for 40 years.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.300
 And he wore unbelievably amazing clothes.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.260
 And he was probably the first person in history

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.060
 to be interested in fashion as like a cultural thing,

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.100
 rather than just to show off to their friends.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.740
 Yeah, he was, yeah, amazing.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.860
 And he commissioned these watercolors, didn't he?

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.460
 So he had artists just come constantly paint him,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.540
 which really pissed me off actually the independent cover

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.140
 of this.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.140
 And they kept on talking about it as fashion's first selfies.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.140
 And I would say if you've commissioned a person

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.820
 to do a watercolor painting of you,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.580
 there was so many levels on which that was not

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.420
 a selfie.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.940
 No, but he-- so what, he backtracked it to his earlier years.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.460
 So he commissioned-- he started it when he was at the age of 23.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.820
 So he worked backwards and got a bunch of those commissioned.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.260
 He also did a nude of himself.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.260
 So in this book, there's a front side nude and a backside nude

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.620
 kind of like, you know, those kids books

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.620
 he used to get, where you would put the clothes on for a bit.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.660
 No, we're chartered, Dan.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.180
 We're chartered, you had.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.460
 We're back to the kitty litter, aren't we?

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:02.020
 It's sort of like you've got the body, and you can put different clothes

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.220
 on them with magnetic strips.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.260
 It's probably a nude 16th century German accountant, though.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:13.260
 I mean, what a world it would be.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.420
 Because his clothes were amazing.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.420
 They were so cool.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.380
 So it was really interesting, because this

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.660
 was a time where there were lots of legal restrictions

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.060
 on what you could wear depending on your position in society.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.980
 So you couldn't dress more fancily than your employers.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.340
 But he was the head accountant for the Fugger family,

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.860
 who were a very powerful banking family.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.780
 And they were very worried about being seen as too rich.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.020
 So they tried to tone down what they were wearing.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.500
 So they didn't seem too extravagant.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.700
 And so he had to come up with all these clever ways

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.220
 of showing off fashionably.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.220
 So there are these things called pinks, which

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.900
 is where you make a tiny slash, just a tiny, tiny cut in fabric.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.900
 So you can see the color of the fabric beneath.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.060
 And his doublet--

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.660
 so that's what that's the sort of upper trousers.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.820
 No, the doublet is like the long-legged shrunken waistcoat thing.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.780
 Sorry, the jacket is doublet.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.500
 It had 4,800 pinks in it, which were all handmade.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.540
 How much doublet was there left after you put

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.340
 all those in 800s in it?

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.140
 Just very quickly on the Fugger family.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.180
 So the guy, the guy who started it

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.300
 was called Jacob Fugger.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.420
 And he was, genuinely, the richest man

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.620
 who has ever lived.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.700
 He, if he was the right rich Fugger, wasn't he?

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.260
 Yeah, yeah, he was born from nothing.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.540
 His dad and his mother Fugger had no--

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.700
 Had virtually no hotel pitch.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.980
 They virtually had no money.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.980
 And he built it all in his lifetime.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.860
 And if you took the amount that he had,

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.180
 and you translated it into today's money,

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.860
 he was worth 400 billion.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.820
 Wait, are we going to get a currency on that?

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.860
 Oh, what's this in?

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.620
 Yen?

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.540
 American Derek.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.860
 Sorry, yeah.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.260
 He was the richest man who ever lived.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.860
 But I mean, so he was probably the most fashionable person.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.420
 But the fashion's around this time.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.260
 And Renaissance fashions were quite exciting, weren't they?

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.300
 So we had, I think, one of my favorite was the Henin.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.060
 This was a really early fashion.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.700
 This was basically medieval.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.700
 And it was the, if you look at kind of Renaissance

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.660
 and pre-Renaissance art, it's that weird steeple

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.220
 that women wear on their heads.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.620
 So you know, they wear a massive long cone that

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.740
 comes up on something falls off the back of it.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.580
 And they would go up to a meter high.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.860
 And people were criticised for wearing these,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.940
 because they thought they looked really ridiculous, which they did.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.020
 And also, it was kind of a sign of lavishness.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.700
 And I was reading about a friar called Thomas Connect,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.100
 who would give pocket money and pardons

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.540
 to any boy who was able to get one of these off a woman's head.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.580
 So he paid these little boys to go and pull down

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.940
 these monstrous headdresses and face the woman down.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.300
 In the Italian city of Ovietto, this is also

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.500
 during the Renaissance fashion, there were rules

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.740
 again about what you could wear.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.340
 So your cleavage as a woman could not descend past a certain point.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.460
 And the way they did it was with the measurement of the hands,

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.100
 it was two fingers width below the supra-sternal notch

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.100
 on your chest.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.380
 And that's basically the front of your collarbone here,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.100
 your clavicle there.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.340
 So it's two fingers width.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.540
 I mean, your cleavage is going nowhere near that.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.860
 So one's cleavage is going nowhere near that.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.180
 So it would be very unusual woman who

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.860
 had cleavage that went to an inch below her clavicle.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.820
 I mean, is it going to press coming out of your neck?

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.580
 There's just on breasts.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.220
 Another thing in the 16th--

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.980
 another thing on the 16th century was that there

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.940
 was a fashion to just have your top open and breasts out.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.420
 And there's an account from 1593, the French ambassador,

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.820
 Andre Horout, described meeting Queen Elizabeth the First,

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.100
 and arriving with her having--

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.940
 We have naked boobs out.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.300
 Yeah, the Queen Elizabeth the First, yeah.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.060
 She was 65 at the time.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:58.700
 Was she?

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.900
 Yeah.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.660
 This is-- he wrote this in his diary.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.260
 So whether this is true or not, we don't know.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.180
 But he did say that.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.700
 Do you have what he said?

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.340
 Yeah, he said, kept the front of her dress open

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.060
 so one could see the whole of her bosom.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.460
 Could see all her belly to her navel.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.140
 So it was just an outright open shirt.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.620
 And it was seen, according to his diaries, as less a risque thing

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.740
 than a woman showing her ankles at the time.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.060
 Yeah, ankles were pretty bad, disgusting.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.220
 Well, there was actually a fashion in France about 200 years

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.780
 after that to have sort of nakedness showing through your outfit.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.020
 So I really didn't know about this.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.380
 But this was in the 1790s, straight after the reign of terror,

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.060
 when a lot of the aristocracy had been wiped out and beheaded.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.340
 The aristocracy remained fought back by developing

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.980
 these lavish fashions.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.180
 And they were known as the uncroyabla and the merveoes.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.780
 So the men were the Incredibles and the women were the marvellouss.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.900
 And they would sport these ridiculous fashions.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.220
 So they would go around with these giant monocles.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.820
 They'd have rings on all their toes.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.260
 Yeah, probably like the size of your face.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.540
 They wore huge hats with dog ears coming off them.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.540
 And they pretended to have a lisp.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.140
 And they walked around with hunches,

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.820
 because they decided that was a funny thing to do.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.980
 And it was just this weird thing.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.100
 And it was all this comment on you bastards.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.980
 You've like murdered our mates.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.660
 Some of them there was a fashion to brush their hair forward

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.420
 and shave off the back a bit of their hair

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.060
 as if the guillotine was about to fall.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.260
 And some of them said we're a red necklace to show their red--

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.780
 Yeah, like their heads are chopped off.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.700
 But yeah, it was amazing.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.300
 They had these balls, which are called Baldevik team,

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.860
 which were balls which only the children or the families

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.740
 of people who've been beheaded could attend.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.740
 But they were super cool.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.460
 They were just promising around the streets of Paris

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.220
 in these crazy outfits, saying, fuck you.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.300
 Wow.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.620
 In 1463, England's parliament ruled

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.940
 that men were no longer allowed to wear short coats

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.180
 that did not cover their penises.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.300
 They said we've had enough of that.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.700
 We've had a great time with the parties over.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.260
 Were they wearing trousers?

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.340
 Were they like Donald Duck?

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.100
 Was it a--

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:09.460
 They kind of were like Donald Duck.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.220
 Wait, so sorry.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.500
 They were naked from the waist down.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.700
 They were not completely naked from the waist down.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.660
 So they had a hoesery?

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.540
 They had a hoes.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.020
 But hoes is just tight, really.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.340
 They just had tights that were making it very obvious what

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:19.860
 was where.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.020
 And the jackets kept getting shorter and shorter and shorter.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.180
 And eventually, you could just see lunchbox.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.420
 And the thing was, and that was when

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.740
 cob pieces came in as a fashionable thing,

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.220
 because they weren't allowed to show their genitals

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.980
 or their bulges or whatever.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.500
 And they didn't want to have long coats that covered up.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.180
 They still wanted to have the fashionable ones,

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.340
 so they would have the cob pieces instead.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.300
 Really, because I always thought the cob pieces

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.820
 the most weird thing that we just accept that people just--

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.580
 I thought was to show off your genitals.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.660
 And I think then it became something to draw attention to it,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.580
 and you'd have no Apple one.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.180
 They got bigger and bigger and bigger in the 16th century

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.260
 before disappearing completely by the end of the century.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.500
 So this is really weird thing where they get bigger,

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.860
 bigger, bigger, bigger, and then suddenly

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.060
 smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.180
 I think we can all--

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.740
 Well, the reason they think they went out

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.260
 is because there was a new thing that came

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.700
 in at the end of the 16th century called a "Pee's Cod Belly."

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.380
 And what that was, it was like, you kind of stuff stuff

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.100
 inside your shirt.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.220
 Imagine you have a shirt here, you stuff it down.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.260
 And then it kind of makes you a little bit fatter,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.180
 but then it goes down to a peak where your genitals are.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.700
 And so they're fighting over the same real estate kind of thing.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.540
 Yes.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.940
 And so they had this kind of thing,

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.020
 but it meant there was no space for the cob piece anymore.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.460
 And they were called-- and women wore them as well.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.980
 They were called stomachers.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.580
 And sometimes there would be a fashion

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.140
 to wear a bigger stomacher.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.340
 And that would make you look a little bit pregnant.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.060
 And then sometimes not.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.340
 And the reason they were called "Pee's Cod"

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.500
 is because they looked a little bit like a pea pod

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.060
 because they kind of tapered at the bottom.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.500
 And they were a very potent sexual symbol.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.460
 And this is one of the reasons that the phrase "shelling peas"

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.820
 became a euphemism for sex.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.620
 Really?

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.540
 You did it?

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.060
 It did.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.660
 Well, I mean, it was in the 16th century.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.300
 And some of us haven't moved on.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.860
 But also because pea fields, people

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.460
 used to have sex in pea fields as well.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.660
 Of course it is.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.420
 Peas were just very sexy.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.900
 Peas were just very sexy in the 16th century.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.220
 Beds were hard to come by.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:29.580
 You know that outfit that you see a lot of in medieval depictions

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.500
 of gestures and so on.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.180
 It's the two-color outfit that is horizontal--

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.180
 Like a highlight.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:34.980
 Yes, exactly.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.900
 So yellow on this side, red on this side,

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.180
 completely down the middle.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.900
 That is called my party outfit.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.860
 What do you mean?

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.780
 Well, no.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.580
 No, we do-- yeah, we've been to a party with you.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.700
 That's what you were, that's great.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.740
 So it's MI, so I guess me, technically, and P-A-R-T-I,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.300
 me party outfits.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.380
 Oh, and is it like, it separates me.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.460
 It parts me.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.500
 No, it's probably Italian or something, but--

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.700
 Yeah, but probably an Italian means this parts me.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.380
 No?

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.140
 I think-- no, I think it's Jordi, actually.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:14.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.540
 Where's my party outfit?

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.700
 It feels like-- it feels like if we talk about a fashion,

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.980
 we have to talk about Bob Rommel, who was the creator of fashion,

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.940
 even today.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.620
 So Bob Rommel was the most fashionable man

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.620
 at the turn of the 19th century, basically, wasn't he?

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.500
 Very early 19th century.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.140
 And he used to take five hours to get dressed each day.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.100
 He polishes boots in-- I know.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.500
 How does he get anything else done?

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.940
 Polishes boots in champagne.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.700
 He had three separate hairdressers, one for his temples,

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.140
 one for his forehead, and one for the back of his head.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.140
 That's incredible.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.340
 They must have all--

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.420
 were they doing it at the same time?

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.540
 It's not really like a game of consequences,

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.500
 where you do one of them, and then you have to work out

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.260
 what they want after that.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.420
 That's really how they match.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.220
 There should be turf war as well,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.300
 between the temples and the top, and then the top and the back.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:03.820
 Yeah.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.620
 Yeah.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.980
 We've very tense back there.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.980
 Yeah.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.100
 And you also had separate glove makers.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.740
 So we had a glove maker for the palm, glove maker

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.220
 for the fingers, and glove maker for the thumb.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.220
 No.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.740
 You've got to have-- because it's different skills

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.060
 making the thumb to making the fingers.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.940
 It's very different.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.300
 Very different, yes.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.300
 Doesn't feel like it.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.020
 Wow.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.260
 You don't know fashion.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.980
 That's true.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.460
 We're going to have to-- oh, we're going to have to move on,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.300
 basically.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.740
 Well, I should just say, Bob Rommel is the reason

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.980
 that you're dressed like you're dressed today, all of you.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.860
 And because everyone looks absurd until he came along,

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.100
 they all wore these powdered wigs and these big ruffs

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.340
 and frills and colors.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.700
 And he basically said, take all the colors away,

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.180
 all the textures, what you want is

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.740
 neutrally colored clothes that are cut with precision.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.780
 He banned perfume and jewelry for men.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.100
 And men basically dressed like that today.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.980
 That's why you're all stuck in these.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.020
 Yeah, but then it still took him five hours to get ready.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.580
 He got rid of all that stuff, and he's

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.380
 like, but it's still going to take me five hours

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.620
 to put on a pair of trousers and a shirt.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.940
 But it was exclusively dating herring ladies

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.380
 who are still shampooing for the first time.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.140
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.300
 And that is Chazinsky.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.260
 My fact is, the North Pole is moving so fast

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.860
 that we can't keep up.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.540
 So what?

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.860
 The next polar expedition is going to go on indefinitely.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.020
 They're just going to be running after it.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.540
 Chasing it.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.420
 This is a real worry.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.980
 This is the magnetic North Pole we're talking about.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.940
 And specifically, when I say we can't keep up,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.420
 our phones can't keep up, our maps can't keep up.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.340
 So there's this thing called the World Magnetic Model.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.700
 And basically, this is the model that works out where North is.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.820
 And it's updated periodically.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.020
 And it was supposed to be updated, I believe, in 2020.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.140
 And then they had a quick look at where the North Pole

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.140
 has got to since 2015 or something, and it was last updated.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.180
 And it's moved so fast.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.660
 They've got to update it now because all of our maps are on.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.540
 And so this is announced by scientists

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.300
 at the National Center for Environmental Information.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.620
 And they said, because of unplanned variations

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.260
 in the Arctic region, it's fucked.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.420
 If you tried to get to the North Pole--

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.220
 Sorry, that's the part of the official press release.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:14.020
 I slipped out of the quote marks without making that clear.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.780
 On the current model, if you tried to fly to the North Pole

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.620
 using your phones without the update,

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.380
 you'd end up 25 miles away from it.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.220
 Which is quite far.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.660
 Oh, I could walk 25 miles in the Arctic.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.700
 Do we know why it's moved?

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.820
 No, we know it's always fluctuated

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.260
 because we think it's because there's

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.220
 this big molten core of iron in the middle of the earth,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.780
 and it's sloshing around.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.740
 And so that is causing this magnetism to slightly slosh around.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.700
 But we really don't know why it's accelerating so fast.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.180
 So it's suddenly slightly massively speeding up.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.060
 Over 30 years, the rate of distance

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.300
 move per year has sped up from 15 kilometers a year.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.420
 It was moving to 55 kilometers a year.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.500
 And no, we don't know why.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.940
 We don't know what's happening in the middle of the earth.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.940
 It's causing this.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.060
 Just to make it clear, this is not the normal North Pole,

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.260
 which is the bit that the earth spins on.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.820
 This is where the magnets go.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.820
 I mean, I don't know who you are to label one normal.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.420
 But yeah, so it's not the geographic North Pole, which is--

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.500
 Give it to where your compass will.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.380
 The top of the earth is where your compass is going to be.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:23.380
 Right, I believe that the magnetic South Pole is not moving.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.580
 It is moving a little bit.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.540
 It's not moving as much.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.100
 Yeah, but it's slowly getting more out of kilter.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.540
 So the opposite of the magnetic North Pole

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.060
 is not the magnetic South Pole.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.060
 Yeah.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.260
 So it's crazy.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.340
 I read that.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.780
 So you were saying that they had to redo it and announce it.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.620
 So they finally got all the stuff together,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.020
 all the information about where the magnetic North Pole is.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.020
 They were about to release the information

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.500
 for people who needed it.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.380
 And then suddenly, in America, that government shutdown

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.340
 happened.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.740
 And they weren't able to release it.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.060
 So they had to sit in limbo with the updated information

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.980
 and anyone who is 25 miles closer to the North Pole

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.380
 than they thought was suddenly unable to access it.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:00.900
 Yeah.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.340
 It affected millions of people.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.500
 And I think it's moving towards Russia, isn't it?

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.420
 It's currently still in Canadian territory,

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.380
 but it's moving up towards Siberia.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.020
 Putin's declaring war on it.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.740
 Well, I read that in 2001, Russian researchers

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.980
 made the world's biggest magnet.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.820
 And I'm not saying that that's what caused it.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:29.140
 But they created a 2,800 Tesla magnetic field

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.620
 by getting a massive magnet and then

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.380
 doing a massive explosion around it.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.620
 So it really pushed it in.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.500
 And this was the biggest magnetism

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.060
 that had ever been created on Earth.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.060
 Wow.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.180
 And I'm not saying it's anything to do with it.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.660
 Well, I didn't know we were in the business of encouraging conspiracy

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.700
 theorists.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.300
 But what did he gain from seizing the North Pole, though?

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.300
 Santa.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:56.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.780
 Give me that good bad list.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:25:59.780
 Trump.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.780
 Trump.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:07.900
 So I was looking at sort of the history of the North Pole.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.700
 And people really didn't know what was up there in the past,

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.740
 because nobody had been there.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:19.700
 So this is related to the Hollow Earth theory.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.940
 We're on conspiracy theories.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.340
 So this was proposed by Edmund Halley of Halley's

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.020
 comet fame in 1692.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.940
 He suggested the planet was a series of shells

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.700
 inside each other, because that would explain

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.700
 anomalous astronomical data, you know,

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.500
 when stars appear to move back and forwards.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.900
 So that was his great explanation for it.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.660
 But this theory got taken on by other people.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.660
 And it evolved.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.580
 And in 1812, there was a war veteran called John--

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.100
 I think his name was Simms, S-Y-D-L-M--

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.780
 and he wrote that the Earth had massive holes

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.900
 at the North and South Pole, and that that was the way

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.700
 into the Hollow Earth.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.660
 And that the entire Earth inside, that he called them Simms

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.780
 Holes, and he campaigned to launch an expedition

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.740
 to the North Pole so that he could go into the Simms Holes

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.180
 and explore what was on the inside of the Earth.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.180
 And Congress voted on funding--

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.180
 Did they?

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.620
 Yeah, I mean, they voted against funding it.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.420
 But Hitler was obsessed with it, wasn't it?

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.300
 Hitler-- yeah, he had expeditions.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.620
 I think I'm right in saying this.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.020
 I only know this from reading a tie in Indiana Jones

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.180
 book called Indiana Jones in the Hollow Earth.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.140
 But so it's good.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.740
 But in that, Hitler does go exploring

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.060
 for the Hollow Earth had actual expeditions.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.220
 We have to have some basic standards

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.340
 of extensible sources.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.300
 But they're written based on history,

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.420
 like with the young of the Covenant and the aliens.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.460
 They came back to a young town in his gestor's costume,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.260
 squatting over the catalysts of trade,

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.940
 reading Hitler Indiana Jones stories.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.860
 You know, not only is it the North Pole

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.340
 that we're sort of losing track of GPS-wise,

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.340
 but Australia as well.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:27:59.860
 Whoa.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.060
 Yeah, Australia is a bit--

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.380
 Oh, well, never mind.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.340
 Australia moves a lot.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.620
 It's shifted by 4.9 feet since 1994.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.460
 That's not a lot.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.460
 That's not a lot.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.100
 Is it not?

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.460
 Well, Australia's massive of four feet is not massive.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.020
 Oh, but for a whole thing to shift that way.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.180
 But you're not going to get to Ez Rock

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.260
 and be four feet away, and God can't see it anywhere.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:33.220
 Yeah, good for you.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.260
 But I programmed the boat to stop right

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.220
 at the edge of Australia.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.020
 So we're just going to step off the boat off the presumably

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.500
 appear that we'll be waiting for us there.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.340
 But there was a bigger problem.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.980
 I don't know if anyone here uses Bing Maps.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.820
 Yes.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.820
 You use Bing Maps.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.060
 Of course, I don't use Bing Maps.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.060
 It's on Microsoft.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.100
 It's on Microsoft.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.500
 So unfortunately, it turns out that I can't

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.780
 believe you use Bing Maps.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.260
 Was genuinely not expecting.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.820
 Sussi calls me some problems in the past, but go on.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.100
 Well, yeah.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.340
 Like, for example, if you were looking for Melbourne,

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.540
 because Bing Maps had Melbourne placed off the coast of Japan,

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.980
 wow.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.860
 That's not for the same reason as the far feet, though.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.900
 Yeah.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.940
 This explains when we played Australia, Dan,

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.620
 you were four feet away every gig.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.780
 You were just off in the wings.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.780
 And I was in Japan.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.780
 Yeah.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.780
 And there it is.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.180
 So here's the weird thing.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.940
 Bing Maps is updated, not completely,

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.980
 but a bit, by information via Wikipedia.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.420
 Now, obviously, Wikipedia is often tampered with.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.260
 And in this circumstance, when they did an update,

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.900
 they had ingested someone who tampered with where Melbourne was.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.940
 And suddenly, Bing Maps was registering

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.900
 off the coast of Japan.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.660
 Well, so Bing isn't the only one, right?

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.740
 Apple Maps had serious problems.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.580
 So in 2012, they dropped Google Maps as their provider.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.540
 And they went to Apple.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.180
 And maybe you will remember, there were some serious issues.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.980
 For instance, there was an Australian town called Mildura,

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.340
 which was placed 75 kilometers from where it actually was.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.860
 Problem is that it was in Victoria.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.300
 And it was sort of in the bush.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.500
 So there were four separate incidents in the space

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.900
 of a week, where groups of travelers went,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.620
 so we're hiking to this town.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.780
 And it ended up 75 kilometers away in the middle

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.580
 of the remote Australian bush in 40 degree heat.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.460
 And all had to be rescued.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.860
 Oh, wow.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.100
 Also, if you search for Manchester United Football Club,

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.700
 it directed you to Sale United?

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:31.420
 I think it's like an under 12's team or something.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.700
 And it's for ages five and above, sorry.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.860
 And it had satellite images that it

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.940
 advertised as Apple Maps again.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.580
 But it hadn't worked out to penetrate the clouds.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.300
 So a lot of its satellite images, if you went to look at somewhere,

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.860
 it was just you were above the clouds.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.900
 You just saw cloud cover.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.420
 What a weird football team to have a policy of accepting

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.540
 anyone above the edge of five.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.020
 You're going to get a very mixed range of abilities, yes?

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.260
 Time for the final fact of the show.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.460
 And that is my fact.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.540
 My fact this week is that the British vegetarian movement

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:10.660
 was started 200 years ago by a man called Reverend Calhard.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.260
 Yeah.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.220
 And this was in Salford in England.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.940
 And this was 200 years ago.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.220
 He was the Reverend of this chapel.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.860
 And in January 1809, he stood at the pulpit

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.460
 and he made a plea to say to all of his congregation,

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.580
 we need to stop eating meat.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.420
 They all agreed.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.340
 And that was the fundamental beginnings

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.700
 of vegetarianism in the UK.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.540
 Yeah.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.340
 Wow.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.460
 Calhard.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.420
 Yes, so he said that if God had meant us to eat meat,

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.140
 then it would have come to us in an edible form like a fruit.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.820
 So it makes sense.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.660
 Sushi is arguably fine.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:53.020
 But Calhard, he wrote hymns that were pro-vegetarianism.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:59.820
 So he wrote one hymn called "Little Lamb, who ate thee?"

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.860
 That's amazing.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.340
 He wrote another one called "Eaters of flesh."

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.940
 "Eaters of flesh, could you decry our food and sacred laws?

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:12.700
 Did you behold the Lamb can die and feel yourself the cause?"

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.180
 "Low there, he struggles, hear it moan,

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.660
 a stretch beneath the knife."

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.540
 I mean, this is pretty tough stuff, isn't it?

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.900
 But that is something to rhyme with knife,

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.180
 because that's not a good ending to the poem.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.580
 "It's eyes would melt a heart of stone,

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.780
 how meek it begs for life."

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.940
 Wow.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.780
 This act, because we did all just have quite a big meaty curry

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.060
 before we came on stage, and I'm now feeling quite guilty,

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.700
 as well as sick.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.060
 I like my thing that I like about this fact.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.460
 Obviously, it's vegetarianism started by a man called Calhard,

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.460
 and I love those little name connections

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.060
 when they go anti-the thing that you're talking about.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.500
 And weirdly, the whole setup of vegetarianism

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.300
 in that period of the 1800s was completely rife

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.740
 with that kind of names that were connected to either animals

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.740
 or meat.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.940
 So the key groups that formed the vegetarian society,

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.500
 which eventually got its name in 1847,

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.700
 were people who were called the Bible Christian Church,

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.620
 which was what he was a part of Calhard.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.820
 You had the Concordium, which was a boarding school,

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.220
 and then you had the readers of the Truth Tester Journal.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.380
 So Concordium, which was the high school,

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.580
 sorry, the boarding school, in 1837,

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.900
 they were located in Ham Common.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.700
 Nice.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.500
 That's where they were.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.980
 And then the Truth Testers, who were the magazine

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.060
 that were pushing it, it was taken over,

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.740
 the editor ship, by a guy called William Horsel.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.740
 No way.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.900
 Yeah, so you suddenly have Horsen there.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.180
 And then the Truth Testers, they basically,

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.780
 they got this other guy who wrote a very important letter,

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.260
 who's called William Oldham.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.260
 Wow.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.460
 So then, in 1847,

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.100
 in the listeners at home, Dan is pointed,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.060
 and he knows bored behind him with bits of string,

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.340
 and connecting everything else to everything else.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:04.100
 And so in 1847, they officially named the Vegetarian Society,

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.740
 where William Oldham was the treasurer,

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.980
 and Horsel was the elected secretary,

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.300
 and that conference that they had to name it was in Ramsgate.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.300
 Oh.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.340
 It did sound like--

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.140
 When you sort of climb out to the end there,

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.020
 it did sound like a crazed person.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.380
 Like, we need to call a doctor.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.540
 And by the way, for the people at home,

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.100
 he really did climb accidentally under that.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.380
 The herring of fleeing the area, as we speak.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.740
 It's like synchronized spawning on the stage.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.820
 Well, one of the other pioneers was a man called--

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.860
 I hate to add to Dan's crackpot theory, William Lamb.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.700
 He was a doctor in 1815.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.700
 He came up with what he called a water and vegetable diet,

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.180
 and he said it would cure acne, tuberculosis, scrofula,

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.180
 asthma, and lots of other diseases.

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.020
 Wow.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.860
 I don't think it did, but it probably would have done a harm.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.620
 If you've got scrofula, give it a go.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.740
 You know, they nearly weren't called vegetarians, vegetarians.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.140
 Oh, well, they're going to be cult.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.300
 So there were lots of potentials.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.100
 Pythagorean?

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.100
 Was one of them, was it?

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.100
 That's true.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.100
 That's an old one.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.100
 Pythagoras, supposedly.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.580
 Sorry, I'm actually meeting vegans.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.700
 So vegans were nearly not called vegans.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.460
 So in 1944, there was a member of the vegetarian society

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.980
 in London, who was called Donald Watson.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.900
 And he set up a new newspaper for vegans.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.820
 He wanted to go a bit further with the vegetarianism.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.780
 And he asked his readers for suggestions as to alternatives.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.500
 And they came up with things like dairy ban.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.980
 So that would be the noun, I am a dairy ban.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.500
 Or bennervor, instead of omnivore or carnivore,

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.380
 a bennervor, someone who eats good things.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.940
 Or boom-or-je.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.940
 No, nice.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.780
 I'm a boom-or-je.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.580
 So it was a big thing in the 19th century,

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.220
 the vegetarian movement.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.020
 It was a big thing in London.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.620
 And there was one vegetarian restaurant in London in 1878.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.380
 And by the 1880s, there were 52.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.460
 So it suddenly took off.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.500
 But the most popular one around this time

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.260
 was started by the best real tennis player in the world.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.220
 That's a good word.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:01.740
 Wow.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.180
 He was a guy called Eustace Miles.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.820
 And he was basically a real tennis--

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.700
 so you know, real tennis is sort of like weird indoor royal

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.140
 tennis precursor to tennis.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.260
 And he was the world champion, basically,

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.460
 from 1898 to 1911.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.900
 He was the best player in the world.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.940
 And he was also obsessed with fad diets.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.340
 And he was a vegetarian.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.340
 And he opened this restaurant that was incredibly popular.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.100
 And it had stuff on the menu, like little acronyms on the menu

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.700
 like we have today.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.980
 We have a V for vegetarian.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.940
 He had NN, which meant very nourishing.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.620
 And he also had-- next to many of his items, FU.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.460
 And that meant free from uric acid.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.660
 Oh, obviously.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.940
 I love my meals free from uric acid.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.020
 I always ask free from uric acid.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.820
 It was quite a big thing, because it sort of caused gout.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.860
 But he was a bit weird.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.660
 He wrote an article once about how everyone

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.380
 should be able to live on a diet of two plasmon biscuits

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.860
 in one lentil a day.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.420
 One lentil?

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.380
 Just the one.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.060
 Yeah.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.460
 Don't overdo it.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.420
 Wow.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.460
 You know in Australia, you get kangaterians.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.460
 I was kind of a kangaterian in Australia.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.260
 Were you?

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.380
 OK, so if anyone here doesn't know what that is,

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.060
 kangaterian is where you eat purely kangaroo and no other

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.580
 meats, and there's an ethical and moral logic

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.020
 behind the idea of becoming a kangaterian.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.700
 One is that one of the big problems we have with farming

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.900
 cattle is the methane the farts are ruining the ozone layer,

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.660
 whereas kangaroos really emit a very, very tiny fraction

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.780
 of the amount that it calda.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.740
 So if you started farming them, that

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.820
 would be fantastic for the environment.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.380
 Although one of the reasons that also is ethical

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.260
 is that they're not farmed, so they're wild.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.460
 There are a whole host of reasons.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.100
 They're a massive pest, aren't they?

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.700
 They're a pest, yeah.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.020
 I always think pests as a subjective term, isn't it?

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.340
 We're probably a pest of them as much as that.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.980
 Oh, but they're very hard to catch, though,

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.180
 because they're always four feet away

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.780
 from where you actually thought they were.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:02.740
 This is a whole theory.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.020
 There's a guy called Jackson Landers, who's written a book,

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.500
 proposing that vegetarians who want to be vegetarians

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.980
 for planetary reasons, but they like meat,

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.900
 he suggested they should only hunt and eat

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.300
 invasive species, and he wrote a book

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.620
 where he did exactly that.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:23.660
 So he ate pigeons in New York City, which I think is brave.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.380
 Yeah, there's a whole theory behind it.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.620
 Again, I don't like to be a dickhead here,

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.380
 but I always think invasive species

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.660
 is a very human term, isn't it?

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.340
 Because that implies they have a concept of nationhood,

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.060
 which most animals don't.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.740
 So they're like, I'm allowed to be in New York.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.460
 The pigeons, they're not.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.180
 They don't have the kind of strict immigration policies

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.180
 that humans have, I think, at time of recording, anyway.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:55.860
 On stigma against vegetarianism, this is a weird thing.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.540
 There was a study by the University of Southampton,

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.540
 and it found that men, in particular,

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.220
 don't like choosing vegetarian dishes

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.140
 when they're with other men, particularly,

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.900
 for fear of being ridiculed.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.540
 And this study was a year long.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.900
 It was called man food.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.660
 And the sample was small.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.820
 It was only 22 men, so it was not a comprehensive city-wide thing.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.580
 But basically, even men who don't like meat,

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.820
 or men who find it hurts their digestive system,

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.220
 or men who've been literally asked to meet,

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:32.540
 eat less meat by their doctor, or see themselves as green,

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.780
 they want to eat meat, particularly around male friends,

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.500
 because they think it's sort of cool.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.500
 It's cool.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.620
 And presumably, that's Western men.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.220
 Is men in Southampton?

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.220
 Right.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.980
 I can't stress enough how small the sample was on this study.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.980
 Well, there was a study--

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.660
 It's two football teams in Southampton, isn't it?

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:53.860
 22, man.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.940
 Yeah, they had a Gamer football.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.940
 From the age of five upwards.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.100
 There was a study done in Canada, which actually

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.340
 showed that you can calm a man down by showing him

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.940
 a picture of a piece of meat.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.180
 Stop it!

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.340
 No, you can't.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.860
 Yeah, no, no, that is so stupid.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.660
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.820
 Yeah, McGill University in Canada, and they--

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.820
 What do they do?

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.820
 How do they do it?

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:23.300
 So they were barfights with a big, laminated steak.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.540
 Don't worry, let's chill out.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.220
 If I was a general, I would make all my soldiers carry pictures

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.020
 of meat on their rifles, on the bayonets,

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.340
 to completely neutralise the opposing army.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.500
 Give it like a kabab, wouldn't it, of the old bayonets?

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.740
 It's such a great idea.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:48.220
 What it was is that they had 82 men sit down

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.060
 and an actor read out a script to them.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.220
 And if the actor ever stuffed up, and as the actor was reading,

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.980
 they were looking at different pictures.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.140
 Every time the actor stuffed up, they

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.260
 were told to send a loud sound to the actor

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.860
 to sort of--

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.660
 as punishment for stuffing up.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.180
 So they would stuff up, and they would press this button,

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.860
 and there would be levels of loudness.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.420
 Whenever the actor stuffed up, while they were looking

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:14.980
 at a piece of meat, they decided to not really give any punishment,

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.500
 whatsoever.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.700
 OK, so maybe it's more that they're distracted by the meat.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.580
 No, it's according to--

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.780
 They were calmed by it.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.100
 I do my best here.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.340
 What's my study?

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.220
 Are there any speculations as to why?

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.900
 Yes, actually, this is really interesting.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.860
 It's because the idea that men, once they see meat,

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.300
 and it's in a cook form, it's so they can see the charcoal-grilled,

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.620
 kind of nice--

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.940
 It's a slab of steak.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.900
 All that's been properly barbecued, someone.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.620
 But also, they think it's caught.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.620
 I don't need to go hunting.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.860
 I don't need to be the man who's going to be aggressive and stuff.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.900
 I can calmly eat my meal now.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:58.420
 And again, this is not my study, but you wasted everybody's time with it.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:05.380
 So it's reassuring them that they're going to get some meat.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.060
 They're thinking of meal time with their families.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.700
 They're thinking, this is a nice image.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.780
 And yeah, calm down.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:11.700
 Is it a pretty picture?

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.660
 For me, man.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.980
 I got another thing about-- this is about veganism this time.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.580
 President Eisenhower from America, his great-granddaughter,

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:23.060
 thinks that veganism is going to help us to contact aliens.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.740
 Great.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.740
 This is, actually, this is fractionally more plausible

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.860
 than the last thing you ran up the flagpole.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.300
 That she said, we have to understand

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.900
 that we are multi-dimensional beings,

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.180
 and based on our frequency perceptions and vibratory levels

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.700
 that we are functioning from, we are going to see different things.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.220
 So that's her.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.180
 So that's Eisenhower's great-granddaughter.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.100
 She thinks that meat holds us down the density of our bodies.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.660
 And if we want to connect with the higher beings,

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.300
 the vegetables are going to be much lighter.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:52.700
 And they think--

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.780
 It's interesting, because some political families

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.700
 you just think, oh, they've got so much power stored in the family.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.580
 They're just going to be in the front of politics

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.660
 for generations to come.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.740
 I don't think the Eisenhower family is one of these families.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.100
 They're never going to elect an idiot to the president of America.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.180
 They say so they--

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.420
 It's also not super reassuring, what she said.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.100
 So that implies that if you adopt a vegetarian or a vegan diet,

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.500
 you're just going to float away.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.660
 That's the implication.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.260
 It's true.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.500
 OK, I can't believe we're ending on that, but that is--

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.340
 that is it.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.540
 That is all of our facts.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.100
