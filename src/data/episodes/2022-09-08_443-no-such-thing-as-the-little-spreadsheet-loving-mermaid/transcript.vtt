00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.680
 - Hello and welcome to another episode.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.180
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.440
 this week coming to you live from Aberdeen.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.760
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter, Murray Anna Tyshensky

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.960
 and James Harkin.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.360
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.080
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.080
 - My fact is that in America,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.280
 you can watch televised Microsoft Excel competitions.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.040
 (audience laughs)

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 - You can do a lot of things in America.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.120
 - Yeah. - Doesn't mean you should.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 - It's the newfound land, I'm so excited.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.760
 (laughs)

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.880
 This is a thing called Microsoft Excel eSports,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.120
 and it's been on, I think it's been on a couple of years.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.240
 It was definitely on this year, it was on ESPN,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.880
 which is a sports TV network.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.140
 And it's called the Excel All Star Battle.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440
 And it was organized by a group called

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.360
 the Financial Modeling World Cup.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.960
 And there is a slight caveat here.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.480
 It was organized as part of something called the Occhi,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.720
 which was a 24 hour celebration

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.520
 of the stupidest imaginable sports.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.760
 However, that included corgi racing,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.360
 stone skipping, a number of other dumb stuff.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.600
 But it did happen, it was a televised thing.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.080
 There were commentators who were Excel pros.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.360
 The aim of the game, basically they had a problem

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.880
 setting up this as a sporting competition,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.040
 because as some of you will have noticed,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.720
 Microsoft Excel, not a game.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 It's fun, but it's not a game.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.960
 And so they had to invent ways of competing at Excel.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 So one of the challenges was to create

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.640
 a yacht regatta game on Excel,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.000
 which included a wind speed simulation

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.480
 and directional vectors and things like that.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.280
 - I think another one of the contests,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.920
 they call Excel golf even more tedious than it already is.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.560
 (laughing)

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.200
 But I think that that's all about getting to your answer

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.120
 in the shortest possible amount of time.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.680
 And that's kind of what golf is about, right?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.260
 Make the game go by as quickly as possible

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.080
 by doing it in the fewest shots so you can get to the bar.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.920
 - Oh, okay, right.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800
 See, I think it sounds, I'm with Andy.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.920
 I think it sounds really exciting.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.600
 I was reading about the commentators.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.480
 So they have commentators who watch

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.320
 as the Excel spreadsheets are being made.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.160
 - About Bill Jelen?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.800
 - Bill Jelen, AKA Mr. Excel.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.080
 And he, he's just like, he's,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.480
 so like some of the transcript is sort of them going,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.320
 "Oh my God, look what they're doing.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.160
 "Oh my God, they're going for it."

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.000
 And then there was this one that goes,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.560
 "Oh no, the F1 key, the dreaded F1 key."

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.160
 (laughing)

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
 And basically the F1 key brings up some help for,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.640
 "Do you need help on your Excel?"

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.920
 And it's a key, I think you told us before,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.280
 it's a key that's hated by Excel spreadsheet people.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.640
 They actually take it out of the keyboard.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.440
 It's so hated amongst members.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.840
 - I thought they didn't hate it.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.760
 It was the, it helps you do a load of the functions.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.480
 But actually, if you're really good at knowing

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.240
 all the shortcuts, you don't need it.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.760
 So they take it off the keyboard as a kind of pride.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.120
 It's like, I don't know what a good example would be,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.360
 taking the head off your golf club to show.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.200
 (laughing)

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.040
 I'm so good at golf.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.880
 - You're so good.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.440
 - I can do it just with the stick bit.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.840
 - Do you think anyone ever says,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.880
 when they're asked, "What sports do you like to watch?"

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.880
 They just say F1 and leave it at that.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.720
 (laughing)

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.280
 They're not pros any further.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.780
 - I was reading about a famous Excel sportsman,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.600
 called Dermot Early, he's Irish.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.080
 And there was an interview with him.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.400
 And basically he got into competitive excelling

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.320
 because he was really popular at work

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.800
 because he was the only guy who knew how to use Excel.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.960
 And people, I bet a lot of us here know about that,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.160
 going into the office,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.200
 been the only one who knows how to use a spreadsheet

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.040
 and just people kept coming up to him.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.360
 And so they asked him, "Does Excel make you popular?"

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.400
 And he said, "Yeah, it made me popular with my peers

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.760
 "and with people at work."

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.480
 And they said, "Do you get any fan mail?"

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.880
 And he said, "Yes, I do."

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.640
 Well, I get a lot of LinkedIn connection requests.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.880
 (laughing)

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.920
 - I think they're rock stars.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.840
 Just back to Bill Jelen for a second.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.040
 Reading about his life, he goes around the world

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.240
 giving talks, he's a hugely popular guy

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.320
 within the Excel world.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.160
 He's written 60s--

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.360
 - It's an important caveat, isn't it?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.160
 I'm a hugely popular guy within the Excel world.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.480
 (laughing)

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.200
 - He's written 67 books on Excel.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.880
 He's got a list on his website as well

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.720
 about the cool things that he's done

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.160
 so that when you read it and you know Excel,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.680
 you're like, "Oh my God, this guy's amazing."

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.280
 So check out his list of his awesomeness.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.920
 He helped a client in Australia

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.120
 cut a 40 hour a month task into a four minute process.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.600
 That's pretty crazy.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.840
 - He was immediately fired.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.680
 - Yeah.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.000
 - Look at this, spent 14 minutes with a seminar attendee

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.400
 in Trinidad to reduce a three day task

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.400
 to a two minute process.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.240
 - Yeah, wow.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.600
 - Yeah, and then this is randomly thrown in there.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.480
 Once won $1,000 for stopping an electric fan

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.880
 with his tongue at a local stupid human tricks competition.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.400
 (laughing)

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.600
 - Say $1,000.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.560
 - $1,000.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.240
 - That's quite a low sum of money for an event

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.280
 where there's a non-zero chance you'll lose your tongue.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.120
 - Very true.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.640
 - You might insure your tongue before you go to the event.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.480
 - For $2,000.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.160
 - Win, win.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.280
 - Then if, so even if you lose it, you get $3,000.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.080
 If you stop the fan, you get $3,000.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.920
 - I don't know.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.040
 - I haven't thought this through.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.680
 - If you stop the fan, but you lose your tongue

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.240
 in the process, you get $3,000.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.080
 - You need a spreadsheet to work it out.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.720
 And that's why, it sounds great.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.880
 (laughing)

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.360
 Thank you.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.280
 - They could have shortened that bit that Andy just said,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.880
 which felt like about three days to just two minutes.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.000
 (laughing)

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.440
 - You guys, I'm sure, came across the European

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.440
 Spreadsheet Risks Group in your research for this.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.400
 What a bunch of heroes.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.240
 - What do they do?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.600
 - They, their whole raison d'etre

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.720
 is to warn business leaders about the risks of spreadsheets.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.560
 - Okay.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.600
 - So there are millions of problems

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.200
 which rise if a spreadsheet is bad,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.760
 or if there's human error, or anything.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.480
 You know, lost revenue, fraud, systematic failures,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.040
 people taking three days over something,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.520
 they should take two minutes, all of it.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520
 And they have an annual conference to network

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.560
 and discuss spreadsheet risk.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.920
 And they have a page on their website

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.200
 which is called Horror Stories.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.640
 - Oh, yeah.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.920
 - I'll give us one.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.760
 (laughing)

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.440
 - I'll do the crackling fire, as you tell it.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.380
 - It was a dark and stormy night.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.640
 (laughing)

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.880
 - That's Hollywood bought the rights

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.080
 to any of the Horror Stories.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.640
 - I know, they haven't.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.400
 - They can be really dangerous, though.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.360
 - You know, in seriousness, the dangers of spreadsheets

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.960
 led to austerity, which I think,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.560
 I mean, it's, probably may have read about this,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.840
 but important to remember that whole period of shit

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.000
 that we all went through, about 12 years ago.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.880
 - Yeah, glad things, glad things picked up after that.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.760
 (laughing)

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.080
 Oh, we're not like to be in a timeline

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.960
 where things just got worse and worse and worse.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.800
 (laughing)

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.140
 - So that was all based on this Harvard paper.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.080
 So the reason that George Osborne and David Cameron

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.320
 launched austerity was because of this Harvard paper

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.080
 that did a bunch of calculations, which showed that,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.360
 I think, if your debt was exceeding 90% of your GDP,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.880
 then your economy would shrink.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.320
 And so they said, okay, the economy's gonna shrink

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.880
 if we don't launch austerity.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.640
 Actually, it had been done on a spreadsheet,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.560
 and a bunch of rows of data had been missed out,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.680
 which, if they'd been included,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.680
 would have shown that the economy wouldn't shrink,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.200
 didn't need austerity at all,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.600
 all for nothing, sorry to be a downer.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.960
 But--

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.920
 - I mean, was the reason they did it really the spreadsheet?

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.400
 Or were they looking for an excuse and found this paper?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.680
 (laughing)

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.680
 - George Osborne deleting those rows

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.840
 in the middle of the night.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.240
 (laughing)

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.600
 - That was, I think, mentioned by this group, wasn't it,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.680
 that Andy was talking about.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.240
 And another one was MI5.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.480
 They had a spreadsheet of a load of phone numbers

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.320
 that they should bug.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.840
 But unfortunately, the spreadsheet cut off

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.440
 the last three digits and turned them to 0, 0, 0.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.120
 And so they started bugging people

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.520
 that were completely the wrong number.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.880
 - Oh, wow. - Oh, my God.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.200
 - That's so funny.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.040
 - Incredible.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.520
 - Oh, they must have got themselves in such knots,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.680
 listening to the conversations

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.320
 about what we're having for dinner tonight.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.160
 (laughing)

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.000
 I think that means there's gonna be a weapons drop

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 in Kazakhstan? - Yeah.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.040
 - 0, 0, 0 is also literally the non-spy, isn't it?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.680
 'Cause every number up is-- - 007, 006, 005.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.040
 - The worst spy. - The worst spy.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.040
 - I read in an article where they interviewed

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.920
 Dan Bricklin, who invented the spreadsheet.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.880
 - Oh.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.840
 - Apparently, when he invented it,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.480
 people thought that people who were using it

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.040
 had magical powers, 'cause this is what he said.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.880
 - Cool.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.720
 - Because they could do these jobs

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.240
 so much quicker than anyone else.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.080
 - Yeah.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.640
 - But he said that not everyone quite understood

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.240
 what they did, so some people thought

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.280
 that it was just a way of showing numbers

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.640
 and didn't realize that they had ways

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.000
 of doing calculations and stuff as well.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.280
 And so, according to this guy,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.160
 some people would have the spreadsheet

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.880
 and then would glue a calculator

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.920
 to the side of their keyboard

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.040
 so that they could do the calculations at the same time.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.280
 - Have you guys heard of Paul McKenna, the hypnotist?

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.240
 - Yeah, of course, of course.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.040
 - So, Paul McKenna decided who he should marry

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.520
 with the spreadsheet.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.320
 - As in, he wrote down the, like, pluses and minuses and--

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.560
 - Well, he was, at a time in his life when he was,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.600
 he was going out with, he was dating

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.040
 and he would go on dates with lots of women

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.400
 and he then realized, oh, I don't think

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.480
 I'm looking for the right thing

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.480
 or he wasn't finding the right person.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.520
 - Yeah.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.080
 - And a friend pointed out, you're not happy.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.920
 You're going on all these dates

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.640
 but you're really not happy with how your romantic life is.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.640
 Why didn't you make a spreadsheet

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.240
 to find out who you really love?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.000
 And he did so, and he found out

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.240
 that it was his long-term personal assistant, Kate, who--

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.560
 - Who was also the person who did all his IT.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.320
 (laughing)

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.840
 - Yeah, no, I know that, I mean, I did--

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.680
 - I mean, it sounds like he's being Paul McKenna, doesn't it?

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.960
 - Yeah, it does.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.800
 - Yeah.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.200
 - Wow, did he marry her?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.040
 - Yeah.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.880
 - He did?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.720
 - Yeah.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.560
 - Okay.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.400
 (laughing)

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.360
 Good to know how that worked out.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.120
 But well, have you guys heard of less famous

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.720
 but Ariel Fishman?

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.560
 - No.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.880
 - Ariel Fishman has--

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.560
 - Ariel Fishman, sounds like someone

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.400
 from The Little Mermaid to me.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.240
 - It does, doesn't it?

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.080
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.480
 - It does, isn't Ariel the mermaid?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.800
 - Ariel is the mermaid, and she's a fish woman, yeah.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.720
 - Yeah, so this is her brother.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.560
 - Brother, yeah.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.400
 (laughing)

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.120
 - And he has the largest collection

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.520
 of spreadsheet software in the world.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.960
 He's been collecting it since its early days.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.160
 James, you look so excited by this.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.680
 - We don't need to ask if he's married.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.000
 (laughing)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.840
 - So he's got--

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.680
 - That's me, that's me.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.240
 - Over 800 individual unique bits of Excel

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.680
 and other companies.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.520
 'Cause back in the day--

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.360
 - That's pretty cool.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.840
 - When spreadsheets started, there was a boom.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.800
 Companies were trying to get involved in it.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.360
 Boeing even started their own spreadsheet software,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.480
 but they lost out to Excel and Microsoft.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.280
 And so he's got a collection

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.720
 of 800 unique pieces of software.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.560
 He's been collecting it for many, many years.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.880
 And apparently there's one, kind of like the Holy Grail,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.800
 the missing thing that he's been trying to get his hands on.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.040
 This is a bit of an old article.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.120
 Possibly he's got it now.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.800
 But Excel 2001 for the Mac

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.320
 is the one thing that he can't get his hands on.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.160
 - Oh.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.400
 - So if anyone has it out there listening

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.880
 or in the audience here in Aberdeen,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.760
 you're sitting on gold.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.600
 You're sitting on precious, precious gold.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.760
 - Wow. - My God.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.000
 - And Ariel Fishman would like to hear from you.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.600
 (laughing)

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.440
 - Do wrap it in plastic before you send it to him.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.760
 'Cause obviously he lives under the waves.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.040
 - And, yeah.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.880
 - Yeah.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.440
 Oh wow, and Ariel collects things, doesn't she, as well?

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.280
 - She does. - She does.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.360
 - Imagine what a boring film that would have been

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.480
 if what she collected was versions of Excel.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.640
 - I've got spreadsheets and we're dusted.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.600
 - Under the sea, and when I say sea, I mean column sea.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.840
 (laughing)

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:59.400
 - It is time for fact number two.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.000
 And that is Anna.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 - My fact this week is that in 1966,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.920
 the World Chicken Congress happened in Kiev.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.800
 (laughing)

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.640
 - Super.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.900
 (laughing)

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.120
 - I know basically nothing else about it.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.680
 And it's, look, if we're being really pedantic,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.600
 it's the World Poultry Congress.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.320
 But potato batata, right?

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.800
 - Well, I think that's quite important

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.080
 because in 2019, 2004, and 2001,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.820
 the World Poultry Congress was in Turkey.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.400
 - Oh, brilliant. - Oh.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.240
 - Yeah.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.920
 - And in 2017, and 2003, it was in Northwest France,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.240
 30 miles from the city of Brest.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.200
 - Nice. - Super.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.680
 - What a shame that the city of Peking changed its name.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.720
 - Yes. - Traditionally, yeah, yeah.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.840
 - Not for the people of China who were going to be out

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.880
 from under the yoke of, but yeah, not for the pun.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.960
 - I think if you told them the reason to keep it,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.720
 they might have, right?

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.920
 - It does sound like a wild, it sounds really fun.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.120
 It sounds like a good place to get.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.700
 - Do you think? - Oh, well, I think so, yeah, yeah.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.920
 - What would you rather attend?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.800
 The World Excel Championships or the World Poultry Congress,

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.920
 1966? - I couldn't choose.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.760
 I couldn't choose.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.600
 I'd tear myself in two.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.880
 - If they're on the same day, that'd be tough, wouldn't it?

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.840
 - Well, just they've got interesting sounding papers

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.980
 and sessions.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.000
 So this year, papers have included recent advances

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.520
 in ostrich farming.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.120
 Wow, yeah, ostrich is a poultry too.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.120
 That's interesting.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.560
 (laughing)

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.320
 - Can I just point out for the list of her?

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.760
 Andy went, "Wow, yeah, right,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.240
 "before anyone in the audience made any noise."

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.640
 - I think I'd heard a collective intake of breath.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.920
 Recent advances in duck nutrition.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.800
 Okay, that's weaker.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.520
 That is definitely weaker.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.680
 And mechanisms of regulation of the sperm

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.480
 acrosome response in chickens.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.680
 The role of membrane rafts.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.960
 (groaning)

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.800
 - Wow.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.600
 - I've always wondered what their role was.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.080
 - Yeah, so some questions to the one before.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.280
 You're at the conference, but, uh-oh,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.800
 all three of those talks are happening

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.760
 on different stages at the same time.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.040
 (laughing)

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.840
 - I'll go to ostrich farming, I think.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.680
 - Oh, wow.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.880
 - Advanced advances in ostrich farming.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.640
 I just don't think I'd understand that one.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.200
 I was clinging on as I read it out.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.520
 (laughing)

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.120
 - In the 1966 one, all the papers had to be presented.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.080
 So you had to present a paper that was about 2,500 words

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.400
 and then you read it out to a scintillated audience.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.000
 And they all had to be typed up

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.640
 in English, French, Russian, and German.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.160
 And you'd have to type it up, you know.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.480
 Yourself, individually.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.080
 And there was just a thing in the bump

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.640
 that they sent out for it that said,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.080
 "Should the author have any difficulty translating

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.040
 the paper into Russian in case the author struggles,

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.280
 the organizing committee provides it free of charge."

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.640
 But, which implies that the others,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.840
 you've just got to be trilingual,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.200
 as well as being a poultry bro.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.360
 - Is it English, French, and German?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.200
 - Yeah.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.040
 - That's a challenge, yeah.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.880
 - Wow.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.720
 - It is, but yeah.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.680
 The World Poultry Congress is a big deal.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.920
 - One interesting thing about poultry farming, right,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.440
 is that some people think that we are currently

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.000
 in the geological age of the chicken.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.840
 - Ah!

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.040
 - And the reason being that we eat as a species,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.800
 so many chickens, and we farm so many of them.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.200
 And because when we finish with them,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.680
 their bones often go into landfill,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.960
 they'll be left for long, long periods.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.000
 And so in thousands and hundreds of thousands of years time,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.960
 they'll just find loads and loads of chicken bones everywhere

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.440
 and just assume that this was some kind of chicken culture.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.280
 - They were in charge.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.120
 - Oh my God.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.560
 - All the buildings that were there were built by chickens.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.400
 - I guess I'll think that.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.960
 - And they'll all be wiped out of history,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.560
 and it's just, wow, that's so exciting.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.240
 - Oh, the only other conclusion you can take

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.120
 is that the dinosaurs weren't the biggest thing at the time,

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.600
 just people were eating a lot of them.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.640
 - Yes.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.920
 - There was something bigger that was eating all of them.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.480
 - That's such a great point.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.680
 Up until, I think it was the Second World War,

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.520
 we didn't really eat chicken that much.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.760
 It was really expensive to produce them.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.000
 You would eat, this is, the story I read

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.160
 was more to do with America,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.240
 so it was about the production and how much it would cost.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.520
 And then there was a competition run

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.480
 called the Chicken of Tomorrow.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.200
 And the Chicken of Tomorrow competition was,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.360
 every farmer was invited to come and present their chicken.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.040
 They sent in the eggs, so they didn't even bring a chicken.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.600
 So they just sent the eggs,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.800
 and then the eggs were incubated and they hatched.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.280
 And then they looked after these eggs

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.280
 and they watched what kind of chickens were yielded

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.880
 and how meaty they were

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.480
 and how quickly they could produce eggs and so on.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.840
 And they were trying to find a chicken

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.160
 that they could then mass farm and produce

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.880
 so that all of America could basically

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.440
 eat chicken as a standard meal.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.160
 - The chickens we're eating now are basically,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.080
 they are the descendants of the Chickens of Tomorrow.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.800
 - Yeah, of this one competition.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.720
 - The Chickens of today are the Chickens...

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.880
 - The Chickens of Tomorrow.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.560
 - It's like back to the future, but they're chickens.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.160
 - It sounds absolutely bananas.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
 So there were 40 finalists in this competition,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.480
 and you had to submit 720 eggs as an individual farmer.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.920
 And then they were, as Dan says,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.440
 they were raised in controlled conditions.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.400
 They were all fed the same thing.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.840
 And then after 12 weeks,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.520
 the survivors were slaughtered and judged.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.680
 So it sounds like it was really fun.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.520
 - Gosh, that's like, Miss World was like that, isn't it?

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.880
 - What is weird that you mentioned beauty queens, James,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.960
 because as part of the celebrations,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.760
 the jamboree to celebrate the offing

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.080
 of however many thousands of the surviving chickens,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.720
 they had dances, they had a parade, they had a rodeo,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.640
 and they also had a chicken of Tomorrow Queen,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.560
 who was a beauty queen who would go around

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.920
 promoting the chicken of Tomorrow.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.760
 - Oh, a human.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.520
 - Yeah, a human.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.600
 - She was called Nancy McGee, which is a good name, I think,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.960
 for the Chickens of Tomorrow Queen.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.080
 And she was like, we've talked about industry queens

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.160
 in the middle of the century.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.800
 They were there to promote the industry.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.600
 - Well, we talked about Marilyn Monroe ages ago,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.800
 being the asparagus queen of--

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.880
 - Or us, Chiltrope.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.240
 - Oh, sorry, was it? - Or us, Chiltrope.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.080
 - Oh, sorry, was it? - Oh, yeah.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.920
 - I'm sorry.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.840
 - Can you idiot?

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.280
 (laughing)

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.360
 - Do we know anything more about Nancy McGee, though?

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.680
 - I don't know, I mean, she might still be alive.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.200
 She was about 18 at the time she won.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.960
 That was 1948. - Yeah, right.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.520
 - I know that she didn't have as big a Chicken of Tomorrow

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.240
 career as the person who came after her.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.240
 So it was so successful, Chicken of Tomorrow, 1948,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.880
 I think it was, that they had another one in 1951.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.760
 And there's a huge star, Joan Walters of Arkansas,

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.160
 was the queen of Chicken of Tomorrow contest, 1951.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.200
 She was a big celeb.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.040
 - Was she?

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.800
 - Well, in a very small part of America.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.640
 Yeah.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.920
 - Okay, wow.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.760
 - But no, we don't.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.000
 All I know about the contest is also

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.560
 when they sent their 720 eggs,

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.000
 'cause they had to be really carefully timed,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.120
 'cause you've got to start incubating them

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.040
 at precisely the right time.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.120
 They had to be loaded onto trains

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.800
 that were specifically timed to take the eggs

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.720
 and get them to the place where they were gonna be

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.640
 incubated at the perfect moment for them, you know,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.040
 to be put under heat.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.320
 So special egg trains.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.440
 - Speaking of eggs, by the way,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.840
 the National Egg Collection of 1914,

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.000
 I don't know if you came across that.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.120
 - No. - It's pretty amazing.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.120
 And I can tell that you did.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.360
 The idea of this was, it was during the war,

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.880
 and what you would do is you would collect some eggs

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.200
 and you would send them over to France

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.520
 for recovering soldiers or people on the front line.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.520
 Their aim was to get 20,000 eggs a week over to France.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.680
 And in the week of the 16th to the 23rd of August that year,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.680
 they managed 1,030,380 eggs that they sent over.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.640
 It's insane.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.680
 - Were they intact though?

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.600
 Were they like, can you use bubble wrap next time?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.320
 - I think it was a massive omelet, they said.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.320
 No, it's bizarre, because think of the one fragile,

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.160
 precious thing you don't want to send into a war zone,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.680
 an egg with its little shell.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.120
 - The problem was they put them all in one massive basket.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.880
 - It does sound incredibly sweet.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.720
 - It's incredible, it's so cool.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.920
 - Because there was this theory that eggs were so nutritious,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.200
 they were the best thing for, you know,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.720
 our boys over in northern France,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.600
 and there were lots of protein,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.880
 and they were great for recovery.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.960
 And children would write their names and addresses

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.680
 on the eggs, and sometimes soldiers

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.920
 who were given the eggs would write back to the children and...

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.360
 - On what? Another egg?

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.320
 - No, fake, well, no.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.560
 - On a sausage?

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.720
 - Just on a bit of paper.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.200
 But by August 1916,

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.280
 they got through 22 million eggs in total.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.120
 - It's so amazing.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.960
 - It's bananas.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960
 - You could put like little messages as well

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.160
 as your name and address, couldn't you,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.120
 and they called them egograms.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.800
 - Oh, that's great, so good.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.080
 If you're a chicken farmer,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.600
 sometimes your chickens will try and overthrow you,

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.840
 and you have to resist.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.680
 - What?

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.520
 - This is true.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.480
 So, it's...

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.880
 - Have you recently read Animal Farm?

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.720
 - Yeah.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.400
 - No, you're thinking here.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.480
 - No, so, you know, the pecking order is a real thing.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.320
 - Yeah.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.760
 - Actual hierarchies in chicken societies,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.640
 and some cockerels will try to challenge the pecking order

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.240
 and start pecking you, the farmer,

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.560
 and you have to, you have two methods at that point

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.320
 to kind of reassert your dominance over the whole barn

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.680
 or the whole flock or whatever it is.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.320
 So, method one is to put on thick leather gloves,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.920
 and you just pin the aggressive rooster to the ground.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.280
 Every time it comes at you, you just say, "No, stop.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.040
 "Chill out, I'm the captain now."

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.040
 And you just do that, and eventually it just gets

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.160
 the message and it's like, "Okay, I submit."

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.200
 You know, the other option is to kill and eat that rooster.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.160
 (laughing)

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.520
 Do you have to eat it in front of all the other chickens?

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.680
 - I say so.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.520
 - Oh, no.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.800
 - Let this be a lesson to you all.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.080
 - So, but you said there's only two ways to stop this, right?

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.200
 So, have there been situations where neither method

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.600
 has been deployed and a whole farm is now being run

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.680
 by a chicken with some dead farmer?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.800
 You've seen those signs, you know,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.760
 pick your own humans at the side of the motorway.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.520
 - You know, that and Matthews?

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.000
 - 10 chickens in an overcoat.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.240
 (laughing)

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.400
 - And do you know what fart eggs are?

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.480
 - Ah, fart eggs. - Ah, fart eggs.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.000
 - No. - Or cock eggs,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.880
 they're the same thing, or wind eggs.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.560
 They've got lots of names for this one thing,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.400
 and they're tiny, tiny eggs.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.200
 But I didn't know that hens did this.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.800
 They sometimes get laid by completely ordinary hens,

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.680
 and it's often when they're just learning how to lay,

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.360
 I think, and they haven't got it quite right.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.400
 - Just a, just a-- - Just a mini egg is a,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.440
 it's like a mini egg, compared to--

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.280
 (laughing)

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.320
 - It's incredible they get so many of them every year.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.720
 (laughing)

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.120
 And they have to pump the chocolate, yeah, yeah.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.000
 - Yeah, then they get the chocolate right inside.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.240
 - But do they fart them out?

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.520
 Is it like a cough, where it's like,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.880
 "Oh, God, there's an egg?"

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.920
 (laughing)

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.040
 I don't know what the process is,

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.560
 but it's not, it's not the passing of wind that causes it.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.400
 - Okay. - It's just,

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.480
 I guess it's just called that,

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.520
 because it's like an accidental whoopsy,

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.080
 I've laid a useless egg.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.120
 Although sometimes very good for dieting, I'd imagine,

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.800
 because they're often without any yolk.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.080
 They're all white.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.880
 They're on a diet. - Oh, good for making a meringue.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.480
 - Very good for meringue. - Great for meringues.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.920
 - A tiny meringue.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.000
 (laughing)

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.520
 And they used to be, if you do have a cock egg,

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.040
 or a fart egg, there is, well, there's a myth

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.720
 that it used to be produced by a cockatrice,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.240
 a mythical serpent,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.840
 and that the only way to get rid of the curse

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.480
 that would be on you is to,

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.800
 'cause it could kill you with an evil stare,

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.560
 is by throwing the egg over the house

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.480
 and smashing it in the field next door.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.880
 So you've got to get rid of that egg.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.400
 - Or you can just kill and eat the cockatrice.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.840
 That also works. - Yeah.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.840
 - Can I quickly ask a very stupid question?

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.360
 I just realized I don't know about this egg.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.160
 So these are tiny, tiny eggs.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.280
 - Yes. - From a chicken

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.640
 that would usually have big eggs, right?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.480
 - Well, normal sized eggs.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.880
 - Normal sized eggs.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.560
 So when an egg is growing inside,

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.360
 I always assumed that it would sort of,

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.880
 it was the size it was always gonna be,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.160
 and it sort of forms a shape and congeals and stuff.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.720
 Do eggs start as tiny little eggs

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.280
 and slowly like expand like a balloon?

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.840
 - No, they definitely don't do that.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.160
 - Okay. - I think so.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.080
 (laughing)

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.560
 - I think you need to go to next year's World Poultry Company.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.800
 (laughing)

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.120
 Just very quickly, before we move on.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.680
 - Yeah. - On chicken kievs,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.120
 or chicken kievs. - Yep.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.360
 - We obviously often call them these days.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.160
 Invented possibly in Ukraine, possibly in Russia,

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.040
 possibly in France, we're not really sure.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.960
 I think invented in Britain.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.800
 Because the modern chicken kiev,

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.720
 like the old ones were basically buttery

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.880
 and with herbs and stuff.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.400
 And if you go to Russia and Ukraine,

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.400
 that's kind of what you get most of the time.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.280
 Modern ones with garlic in,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.600
 probably invented by a woman called Cathy Chapman in 1979,

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.440
 who was working for Marks & Spencer.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.320
 And this was the first ever chilled, ready meal,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.840
 which she invented.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.400
 And when she invented it,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.240
 the guy at Marks & Spencer, who was in charge,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.240
 was like, I don't like garlic,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.200
 so no one else likes garlic.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.560
 We're not gonna make them.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.560
 And she was like, no, no, I tell you, tell you,

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.160
 like garlic is the next big thing.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.680
 Honestly, it's gonna be huge.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.080
 And within about two years,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.440
 M&S had to set up a whole new factory

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.360
 just to make chicken kievs.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.160
 - Oh, wow. - Amazing.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.840
 - That's so cool. - Rocket.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.000
 - A applause, a applause for that woman who we thought.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.360
 - Can I do one more really quick? - Okay, very quickly.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.760
 - The USA has a secret stock of chicken farms,

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.720
 which are guarded.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.200
 And no one is allowed to know where they are,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.480
 apart from the people who work there.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.280
 So this is because they make,

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.560
 they truck them to, again, secret facilities,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.880
 the eggs that are laid there.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.000
 The eggs are cracked open and used to make, any guesses?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.960
 - Omelettes. - Something we've all had for of

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.720
 in the last year?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.080
 - Pandemics. - Pandemics.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.560
 - Vaccines. - Vaccines, thank you.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.920
 Thank you for the sensible suggestion.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.560
 James.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.120
 Yeah, each egg produces one vaccine.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.840
 They sort of inject the virus,

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.920
 the virus strain they're looking for, into an egg,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.200
 and they incubate it for a few days,

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.320
 and then they harvest the virusy goo,

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.160
 and then they kill off the virus,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.680
 and then they use that to make a vaccine.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.680
 And the US government gets through 100 million eggs every year,

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.960
 and the farms that lay them are secret.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.400
 You're not allowed to know. They're kind of national security.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.680
 - Wow. - Egg farms.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.720
 What then happens with that egg? Sorry.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.840
 - It's done. It's done its job. - It's finished.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.560
 It's not cooked.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.760
 It's been used in a very serious, complicated medical prison.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.280
 I'm wondering if you could secretly vaccinate a whole country

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.720
 by just giving them eggs.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.880
 - Oh! - Oh!

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.920
 And there's your Dan Brown novel, I guess.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.240
 [laughter]

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.080
 [upbeat music]

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.680
 Okay, I do need to move us on to our next fact.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.400
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.800
 Okay, my fact this week is that in the 18th century,

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.400
 a Worcestershire man called John Tallis

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.640
 stayed in bed for 30 years with a peg on his nose

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.360
 because he thought fresh air was dangerous.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.720
 [laughter]

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.840
 - He sounds like a very strange guy. - He is, rather.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.960
 This was a review of a book called "The Georgians"

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.120
 by Penelope J. Corfield.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.280
 And this was a report in a magazine called "Gentlemen's Magazine"

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.560
 and they were talking about this guy who lived

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.440
 in a place called Burkut near Solihull.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.520
 And throughout this whole time, he didn't see anyone, basically.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.400
 He had hardly any visitors.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.840
 Basically, the only people he ever saw were his servants

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.360
 who would change his bed once a year.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.640
 - Is that... - I'm not sure they were changing

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.160
 the bed sheets once a year. - No, they were changing the whole bed.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.160
 - I believe it was the whole bed. - That's quite good.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.720
 It was a mixture, so occasionally they would change the sheets.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.560
 So if they changed the sheets, he would roll onto one side of the bed

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.280
 and they would undo it, and then he would roll back onto the other.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.640
 They undo and slip it on, like on those table tricks.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.480
 So he'd go, "Hula!" And nothing leaves, right?

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.160
 And then the other thing was, if they were changing the full bed,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.960
 they would wheel in another bed and he would sort of tumble

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.320
 into the new bed and then they would remove the old bed.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.080
 - Were they making the call based on how disgusting the bed was?

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.280
 Was it, like, on the 1st of January, we're going to come round,

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.040
 are we going to see if you just need a change of sheets

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.680
 or if it's a full new bed that you need again? Was it that?

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.720
 Probably once a year for the full bed, and then incremental changes?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.520
 - I think that's right, yeah. - You can estimate how gross it's going to be

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.520
 without fully checking it.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.400
 - After 20 years, I imagine you'll have some data to work with, yeah.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.840
 - If you've got a spreadsheet. - Yeah, exactly.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.640
 - So why did he refuse to get out of bed?

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.840
 The fresh air thing, fine, he doesn't want to go outside,

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.720
 but I just, like, stand up and let them take the sheets off.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.960
 - Is that just... - I guess so, yeah.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.000
 - Well, I mean, it's lazy. - He's been in bed for a while.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.400
 - It's hard to get out of bed, isn't it? - I know, I've been there.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.320
 - He didn't want his... Like, he didn't want any fresh air in the room,

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.960
 so he had, like, just one window in the room with glass,

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.560
 which was three times thicker than any other glass you could get at that time.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.080
 I think just three panes.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.120
 And his head was covered in more than 100 yards of flannel.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.040
 - 100 yards? - What?

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.960
 - Yeah, no. - And it, like, a mummy?

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.960
 Like this.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.120
 - They said it was as large as a large beehive.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.680
 - Wow. - Oh, thank you so much for that.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.320
 - That really puts it into context for me. - That was the quote from the day.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.760
 - No wonder he didn't leave the room. He wouldn't have been able to fit out the door.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.280
 - 100... - Exactly. - A massive beehive on his head.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.440
 - I know why he was in bed. - Why?

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.320
 - He was cursed by a woman. - Oh.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.280
 - Yeah, so he was... - Classic.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.120
 You've made it sound quite sexy being...

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.080
 - Well, I just think he went to bed. - Cursed by a woman.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.400
 So he caught her stealing part of his fencing,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.480
 and he ordered her to put it down.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.080
 He said, "Put those sticks down."

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.640
 And she said, "A curse on you."

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.320
 And she condemned him to remain cold and to never feel the warmth of a fire.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.280
 And that's what happened, because he made it happen.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.000
 - So did he say he thought that's why he was in this situation?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.320
 - Well, that's the story. I mean, there's a lot of story in the story.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.360
 - Oh, but that's not his story. - Sorry.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.120
 - That's not his story as to why he was in bed.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.000
 He wasn't like, "I've been cursed by this woman."

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.800
 - Oh, that's his story. - That was his story.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.040
 - I've been cursed. Yeah, yeah. - Oh, okay.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.160
 - And you're saying you believe him? - Absolutely.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.480
 - Okay. - Yeah.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.800
 - Right. - If you believe in a curse, then you have been cursed.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.960
 - Exactly. It's all psychological, if you believe in it.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.760
 - But then it explains what was confusing me,

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.960
 which was what was his explanation for the fact that everyone else

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.120
 wasn't dropping dead, who was in the outside world.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.280
 But was it just him who was going to die at the Fresh Air?

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.000
 - Yeah, it's very rarely I curse you on, by the way, everyone else.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.960
 - For that? - It takes the thing out of the curse

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.040
 if it's a universal thing.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.440
 - Well, because James said, "Because Fresh Air was dangerous,"

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.320
 which it was, but not universally, right?

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.320
 It's like if you're allergic to prawns.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.560
 Prawns are dangerous. - That's true.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.520
 - You know. - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.320
 - That makes sense. - Well, he must have seen other people

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.960
 who could go outside and get him new beds,

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.240
 so it clearly wasn't as dangerous for everybody.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.120
 - Unless the servants were coming in and going,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.720
 it's still, they're dropping dead outside like flies, yeah?

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.120
 - I think there was a rule that they weren't allowed to mention

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.280
 what was going on. They couldn't bring up the whole,

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.400
 like, "Why don't you just come out now?"

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.560
 You know, they just sort of let it happen.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.720
 - Well, no one kind of intervened.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.760
 He clearly was suffering from what we call hypochondria now.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.960
 - Yeah, except it was a curse.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.840
 (laughter)

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.760
 - Yeah, but that's probably how he would have rationalised

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.400
 his hypochondria at the time.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.560
 Oh, I can't come out, I've been cursed, sorry.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.320
 - You've obviously never been cursed.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.560
 I feel like it.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.680
 - Supposedly as well, like James, you're a fact saying

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.680
 that he had a peg on his nose and there's a few other accounts

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.440
 where he would put a cork up each nostril as well,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.760
 which just sounds fun, I think.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.280
 - 'Cause you'd imagine whenever he sneezed, he just went...

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.520
 (laughter)

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.120
 - Oh, dear. - Yeah.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.240
 Great guy, great guy, John Talis.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.560
 - Yeah. - Was he?

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.960
 - Outside of the curse thing.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.280
 - Just, no, just committing to a curse, you know, kind of.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.680
 A lot of us are going to lead lives

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.760
 that don't get talked about in 100 years from now.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.320
 John Talis, here we are in Aberdeen on stage,

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.280
 talking about a guy, put a peg on his nose.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.040
 - Rolled over his... - Beehive on his head.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.600
 - Beehive on his head, large beehive.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.440
 - Large beehive.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.800
 - I read about a woman from Taunton.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.360
 This was supposedly written in the British Medical Journal.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.800
 I couldn't find it in the BMJ,

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.760
 but it's written in lots of newspaper reports

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.000
 where they say it was in the BMJ.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.440
 Anyway, her doctor, Peter Rowe, in 1978,

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.600
 said that she stayed in bed for 40 years

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.880
 because a doctor once told her to not get up

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.120
 until he came back and he never came back.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.520
 - Oh, no! (laughter)

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.080
 - And was that doctor, like, on his deathbed some years later

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.480
 and just his last words were, "Oh!"

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.960
 (laughter)

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.240
 - I knew he went back.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.960
 - But we all know that feeling

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.640
 where you commit just a bit too long

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.080
 and then you think, "Well, I can't quit now,"

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.800
 and then it just kind of gets a bit ridiculous.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.120
 - Yeah, I've seen you stand up.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.080
 - Yeah, my career is. (laughter)

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.400
 - Speaking of lying in bed for a very long time,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.840
 this is a different kind of lying in bed for a very long time,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.000
 lying on a bed of nails.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.840
 - Oh, very good.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.520
 - Yeah, so the records are quite interesting.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.520
 The female record for lying on a bed of nails is 30 hours, okay?

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.440
 By a woman called Miranda, Queen of the Fakirs.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.280
 - Queen of the Fakirs.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.520
 - Wow, nominative determinism.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.840
 (laughter)

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.680
 - Fakir.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.520
 - Fakir, so?

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.360
 - Okay.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.440
 - Kind of, come on.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.520
 (laughter)

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.360
 Come on, mate.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.200
 There's kind of,

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.200
 (laughter)

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.080
 kind of far-eastern mystic is a Fakir, you know?

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.920
 Yeah.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.760
 - Sorry.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.680
 - That's all right.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.960
 So anyway, Miranda, Queen of the Fakirs has the,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.320
 sorry, I'm sorry for telling you off.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.200
 (laughter)

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.040
 I really am.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.200
 So anyway, female record,

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.000
 Miranda, Queen of the Fakirs.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.840
 Male record, held by a man called Ken Owen.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.840
 And it's just a...

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.120
 (laughter)

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.960
 - Ken Owen.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.720
 (laughter)

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.600
 - But his record is 300 hours, compared with 30.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.400
 And it was broken in 1986.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.080
 - I mean, doesn't that just tell you women have things to do?

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.920
 (laughter)

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.320
 - Well, well, no, no, no, because no, well,

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.280
 to be fair to him, Ken was on holiday.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.040
 And this was in 1986.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:04.880
 - And it's...

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.240
 - Someone had taken all of the loungers

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.080
 and he's like, "Oh."

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.800
 (laughter)

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.760
 - No, so it's written, it's on the Guinness website,

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.840
 but it's not, it's only in newspapers from the time.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.960
 And he was, he traveled across Wales

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.720
 on a fortnight's holiday and wherever he went,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.880
 he would lie down for, you know, 10 hours at a time.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.720
 It was cumulative.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.480
 - Oh, it wasn't icy, it wasn't consecutive.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.040
 That is cheating.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.960
 - Yeah, maybe.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.040
 Well, he also, he did other things while he was doing it.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.400
 I think it was maybe a martial arts guy.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.240
 He had 26 concrete blocks piled on his chest

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.880
 and then smashed by his friends.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.720
 - Okay.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.520
 - It's that while he was lying on the nails, yeah.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.560
 They do do that sometimes.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.720
 - Yeah, I think it was, yeah.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.560
 And he said, "The good news was,

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.240
 the longer you lie on the bed of nails,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.960
 the more the nails gradually rust due to your sweat."

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.800
 So...

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.640
 - Oh, what does that do to it?

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.480
 - Is that good?

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.640
 - He said, "Well, by the time I finish,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.400
 my bed should, in theory, feel as flat as a snooker table."

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.880
 (laughter)

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.880
 - So it's just a very long and aware filing down your nails.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.680
 Although you don't want to file those kind of nails.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.520
 - No.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.360
 - I've become confused.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.320
 - Yeah.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.160
 - Anyway.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.000
 - Do you know the person who has been asleep

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.760
 for the longest amount of time,

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.280
 according to newspapers at the time,

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.040
 was someone who was hypnotised.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.040
 So I think asleep under hypnosis.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.440
 I was hypnotised by a hypnotist called Peter Powers.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.640
 You guys heard of Peter Powers?

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.720
 - I think he was a deal in the 80s and 90s.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.120
 He hypnotised a man in a Liverpool shop window.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.360
 I don't know if the man asked for it

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.200
 or if he was just looking for...

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.680
 - Was that not a man? - Traumaticus.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.160
 (laughter)

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.640
 - Well, he's still asleep.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.480
 (laughter)

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.240
 - Well, he doesn't seem to have a head.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.360
 (laughter)

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.600
 - Someone keeps him up with the latest fashion.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.160
 (laughter)

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.480
 Every week.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.960
 - Guys, you've blown it absolutely wide open.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.520
 He's a big old cheat.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.800
 No, he slept apparently for eight continuous days.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.640
 - Okay.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.080
 - Except that he was woken every few hours

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.400
 to go to the loo and drink water.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.640
 But he was woken but was still in a hypnotic state.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.000
 So apparently it counts.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.120
 But Peter Powers recorded a tape of himself

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.320
 that he gave to the medical team

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.800
 who were monitoring this bloke all the time.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.440
 That was if saying like,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.240
 if Peter Powers got killed in a mysterious accident,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.800
 then they were to turn on this tape of him

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.920
 and it would get him out of his hypnotic state.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.040
 Because otherwise he'd be asleep forever.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.160
 - Oh, wow. - Yeah.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.720
 - That's sensible.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.560
 - It's good health and safety.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.880
 - It's responsible hypnotism.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.080
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:24.920
 Good on him.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.880
 - The country of Montenegro has a lying down champion,

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.920
 an annual championship in lying down,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.840
 yet to be televised on ESPN.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.680
 Big mistake.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.800
 I had never heard this before.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.440
 Supposedly there is a widespread national stereotype,

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.920
 internal stereotype of laziness in Montenegro.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.760
 - Is that right?

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.080
 - People are very relaxed.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.240
 They like to take it easy.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.400
 And this year's winner won after 60 hours

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.280
 and said, "I didn't even warm up."

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.200
 And it's, you know,

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.720
 lots of foreigners have entered over the years.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.560
 It's been going on.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.440
 Only Montenegroans have ever won.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.280
 So yeah.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.040
 And I found an old Montenegroan joke,

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:58.960
 if you'd like to hear it.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.360
 - I'd love to 'cause I got to Montenegro quite a lot.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.200
 - Right.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.240
 Well, this is, it can't be that old

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.520
 'cause it features Steven Spielberg.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.360
 So...

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.200
 - Yeah.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.040
 He's been around a while.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.880
 - He's been around a while.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.720
 Steven Spielberg's shooting a movie in Montenegro

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.920
 and he invites a load of locals

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.200
 to audition to be extras, right?

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.040
 - Yeah.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.320
 - And he hires two Montenegroan guys

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.640
 and he explains to them their task for this movie

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.920
 is just to lie under a tree.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.400
 It's all you have to do, lie under a tree.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.040
 And they work for two days

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.360
 while they're shooting this scene around them.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.400
 - I wonder what movie that was.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.240
 - I don't know.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.080
 - It would probably be...

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.920
 - Yeah.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.760
 - Okay, I'm sorry.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.600
 (audience laughing)

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.880
 - On the third day, Spielberg tells them

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.120
 that for the new scene they're shooting,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.720
 they have to move to another tree.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.800
 And one of the guys replies,

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.400
 "Mr. Spielberg, we're actors, not stuntmen."

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.680
 (audience laughing)

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.000
 - That's quite a nice joke.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.840
 - It's a good joke.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.680
 - Yeah.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.520
 - I like it.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.320
 - We're gonna have to move on in a sec, by the way.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.040
 Unless you work out what movie that's from.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.640
 (audience laughing)

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.040
 - I've got one more kind of slightly eccentric person

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.480
 from the 18th century if we have time.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.320
 - Go for it, yeah, yeah.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.160
 - This guy called Henry Cope

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.280
 and he was known as the Green Man of Brighton

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.200
 because he always dressed in green pantaloons

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.320
 with a green waistcoat, a green frock, a green cravat.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.920
 He dyed his hair green and his whiskers

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.600
 and his eyebrows green.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.320
 He would always eat nothing but green food,

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.080
 green fruits and green vegetables.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.520
 He had his apartment painted green

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.600
 and he had it furnished with a green sofa,

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.280
 green chairs, green table, a green bed and green curtains.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.360
 He always walked around with a green silk handkerchief

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.640
 and he had green buttons on his coat

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.880
 and he walked around also with a green poodle.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.560
 - I'm waiting for you to say his shoes were always red.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.920
 (audience laughing)

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.000
 - There's no line there, I guess.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.640
 Apart from maybe like Eiffel 65 or colorblind

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.920
 and they were right about this guy, I don't know.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.080
 But apparently he'd lost his wits over love

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.200
 for a beautiful woman and decided to wear green forever.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.040
 - Right.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:52.880
 - That'll get her back.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.880
 (audience laughing)

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.680
 - How's a woman, trust me.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.360
 - Every time he passes, "Ah, the one I let go."

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.840
 - Meanwhile, she's looking out of her window at her field,

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.920
 can't see him at all.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.840
 (audience laughing)

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.000
 Doesn't realize he's passing.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.800
 - If only he'd come to see me once, I'd marry him.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.400
 (upbeat music)

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:20.360
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.760
 and that is my fact.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.200
 My fact this week is that according to Cameroonian folklore,

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.600
 the best way to beat a chimpanzee in a fight

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.160
 is to pretend to stab yourself with your weapon

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.640
 and then throw it at them.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.240
 The chimpanzee will then imitate what you did

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.080
 and fatally stab itself.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.720
 (audience laughing)

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.920
 Fight over.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.600
 So as I say, this is folklore.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.440
 I found this in an academic book

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.640
 called "Primates of Geshakar"

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.840
 and it was edited by someone

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.200
 that I've worked with in the past.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.480
 So has James, a primatologist called Volka Sumer.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.920
 And the idea is that the mimicry abilities

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.280
 of the chimpanzee is such that they will think

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.240
 that that's part of how the processes

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.680
 of chucking these things back.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.000
 So they were finding that when they were throwing

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.920
 these spears at chimpanzees,

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.640
 which was their chosen weapon to kill them,

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.000
 they would imitate it and pick it back

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.320
 and people could get hurt.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.000
 So the hunter would be hunted

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.880
 by the spear being thrown back.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.400
 So they introduced this idea.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.400
 What if we pretended to stab ourselves

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.640
 and that hence is what happened with the chimpanzees?

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.520
 - But presumably they didn't actually do it.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.360
 - Well, it's folklore.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.640
 So it's sort of like, it's told as if it did happen,

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.440
 but I don't think there's any actual evidence.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.880
 - It will be based presumably on the cliche

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.680
 that they are good mimics and so--

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.960
 - Like the monkey people, right?

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.480
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.640
 - Volka Sumer, have we ever mentioned him before?

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.040
 - I don't think we have.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.880
 - Correct me if I'm wrong,

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.720
 'cause I'm going off memory,

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.360
 but I think his main thing was

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.200
 they wanted to know how many ants some apes were eating

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.320
 and they didn't know how many they'd been eating,

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.000
 but the only bit of evidence they had

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.520
 was looking through the feces

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.880
 and seeing how many like bits of dead ant the were, right?

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.280
 But that doesn't really tell you

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.280
 how much has kind of been absorbed into the body.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.320
 And so he got all of his research students

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.680
 to eat a load of ants and then save their poo.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.040
 And then they all had to check through all of their poos

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.160
 to see how many bits of ants came out

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.320
 because we have a similar digestion system to the apes

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.720
 and that would be able to tell us

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.880
 how many ants were eaten by the ants.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.320
 - So you'd eat the ant, it would just be the head

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.040
 and it was roughly, for every 10 ants,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.280
 one ant head would come out is what he found.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.760
 And it was a cultural thing,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.760
 it was like the group that identified by this one thing.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.120
 - Oh, like it was one group of--

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.000
 - It's a cultural marker, basically.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.920
 - It's a cultural marker, exactly.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.760
 - Yeah.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.840
 - They're very nice guys, chimpanzees.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.920
 Most of the time, yes, you're giving me a funny look

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.960
 'cause they also do have quite high murder rates.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.960
 (laughing)

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.880
 But I think their murder rate is the same as Tijuana

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.400
 in the center of the drug wars in Mexico,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.120
 which I know doesn't reflect very well on them.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.920
 They are the only other species aside from humans

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.640
 who sort of plot to kill each other,

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.080
 but they generally avoid it

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.000
 and they are really good in other ways.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.280
 So for instance, they're much fairer than human beings.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.000
 Not like Snow White is the fairest of them all.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.160
 Like they have inequity aversion, they hate unfairness.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.000
 - Oh really?

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.080
 - So there are various studies

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.440
 that have been done with other monkeys

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.420
 where like if you give one monkey a grape

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.720
 and then you give another monkey a bit of lettuce,

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.760
 then the monkey with the lettuce stops eating it really soon

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.840
 because they're too jealous of the guy with the grape.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.000
 Even though if they hadn't seen the bloat with the grape,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.640
 they would have eaten the lettuce very happily.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.200
 So that happens with monkeys and other animals

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.120
 'cause they've got a real sense of fairness like we have.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.800
 Like that's so unfair, how come he gets a grape?

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.680
 But chimps do it on behalf of each other.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.240
 So there've been experiments where if you give one chimp a grape

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.600
 but you don't give her friend a grape,

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.240
 then she won't eat that grape

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.640
 until her mate's been given one.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.960
 - They're unionized.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.960
 (laughing)

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.800
 - Yeah, people are really--

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.640
 - That's amazing, that's really cool.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.040
 - I mean, chimps research was so controversial.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.760
 - I mean, if you gave me and Dan a grape.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.600
 - I know.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.480
 - Sorry, if you gave me a grape and not Dan,

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.600
 there would soon be no grapes around

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.200
 where I'd just quickly eat the grape and hope

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.480
 Dan hadn't noticed that I'd be given a grape.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.920
 - You're less evolved than a chimp.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.760
 - Apparently so.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.800
 (laughing)

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.000
 - That is, like that was at Franz de Valle says,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.040
 "They're more fair than us, certainly than you,

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.040
 "but even than all of us."

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.280
 And actually he was saying when this was so controversial,

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.040
 this was coming out, the idea in the late 20th century

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.480
 that all these human traits actually existed

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.640
 in chimps as well.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.960
 And Franz de Valle said that when they came up

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.200
 with the conclusion that chimps have this innate sense

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.760
 of fairness, a philosopher wrote to him saying,

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.680
 "It's completely impossible that any animal

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.840
 "has a sense of fairness because fairness was invented

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.360
 "in the French Revolution."

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.600
 (laughing)

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:50.840
 - Franz de Valle, he was like, he's one of the main writers

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.280
 on chimps and bonobos as well, right?

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.160
 And I read some of his writings on both of those things.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.120
 And he was writing about a zookeeper

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.880
 who'd worked with chimpanzees.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.040
 And then he started working with bonobos.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.360
 And bonobos, I don't know if you know,

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.520
 I think they're our closest relatives, right?

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.800
 They're very sexual animals.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.080
 They are very touchy-feely, all that kind of stuff.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.720
 This zookeeper had only worked with chimps before.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.240
 And so he went up to this bonobo for the first time

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.960
 and went to give him a little kiss.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.080
 And the bonobo stuck his tongue down his throat.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.320
 (laughing)

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.160
 - That's amazing.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.960
 - And it turns out they French kiss bonobos.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.800
 - Oh, really?

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.320
 They French kiss humans?

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.440
 - Well, generally each other,

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.320
 but if you get close enough.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.480
 - Wow.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.320
 - Un-fussy.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.160
 - What a good fact.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.160
 - That's so good.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.680
 - That was also controversial.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.160
 'Cause people, again, Franz de Waal was saying,

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.520
 when the whole thing that bonobos--

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.960
 - Stocking was invented by the French

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.840
 during the French Revolution.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.080
 That's why we call it the French Kiss.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.320
 - Yes.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.120
 - There was this big thing came out that bonobos

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.400
 are just rampantly shagging all the time,

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.480
 like regardless of gender, practically species.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.360
 And Franz de Waal wanted to publish

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.440
 his big coffee table book on it.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.760
 And it wouldn't get published

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.120
 by National Geographic in America.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.800
 I think this was in the '70s or the '80s.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.760
 Because basically it was too rude.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.320
 And they said, "This is too raunchy."

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.080
 And so he had to go to Germany to get it published,

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.560
 where, obviously, they said, "Please!"

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.400
 - That's very funny.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.720
 - And they put a picture of shagging bonobos

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.560
 on the front cover.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.400
 - That's so cool.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.760
 - As part of this research of this fact,

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.680
 I was Googling chimpanzees.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.520
 - Makes sense.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.360
 - Yeah.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.520
 - It checks out.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.880
 But I Googled chimpanzees.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.600
 And you know, it quickly comes up with

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.600
 people also ask on Google.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.440
 - Okay, yeah.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.560
 - And I hadn't been searching for anything,

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.920
 any unusual terms or anything like that.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.760
 - Sure you weren't.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.640
 - It was like chimpanzee rituals

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.600
 or whatever I'd searched for.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.440
 Anyway, one of the main,

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.000
 like this presented it to,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:46.840
 I can't stress,

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:51.840
 I hadn't done anything to deserve this suggestion from Google.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.640
 One of the main questions for Google on chimpanzees,

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.920
 people also ask,

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.200
 "What happens if human sperm gets in a chimpanzee?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.320
 "Get in."

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.160
 - Yes.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.080
 - Sorry, you know when you let me your computer last week.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.920
 - That's what genuinely,

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.040
 I was very shocked that that came up.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.080
 - Well, it's a big question.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.320
 - It's not a big question.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.160
 - It is.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.720
 Is there possible to have a hybrid species

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.040
 between like a lot of people?

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.320
 (audience laughing)

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.240
 - There was that Soviet guy,

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.080
 wasn't there?

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.040
 We probably mentioned him before.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.880
 - Yeah.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.600
 - He tried to sort of do a hybrid between.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.600
 - A humanzi, it's called.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.920
 - Well, I think we have solved the mystery

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.320
 of why your computer was defaulting to that.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.200
 I think you've got to stop learning it to Dan.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.800
 - What was the answer though?

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.760
 - I didn't click on it.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.360
 - Oh, you, you wimp.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.200
 - What are you...

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.040
 (audience laughing)

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:42.880
 - A humanzi.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.360
 - Call yourself a researcher.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.600
 - I don't like humanzi.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.440
 - You don't like it?

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.600
 - I go with chump.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.840
 (audience laughing)

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.680
 - Nice.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.120
 - The harm of human and the chump of chump.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.920
 - That's, yeah, I actually worked that out.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.760
 What do you say?

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.000
 (audience laughing)

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.360
 - But they make nests.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.120
 This is a thing that should be more spoken about.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.200
 They make nests every night.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.040
 - Yeah.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.880
 - Birds make nests.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.960
 I don't think of any other animals

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.320
 that make nests apart from birds.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.320
 - That's what the thought is.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.880
 That's how we got pubic lice.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.240
 Is through sleeping in the nests

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.400
 of gorillas and chimpanzees and so on.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.960
 - Wasps.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:14.880
 Sorry.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.760
 Wasps make nests.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.600
 - Ah.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.440
 - Wasps make nests.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.280
 Great one.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.100
 Birds, bees. - Sorry, Dan.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:20.940
 - Sorry, someone said.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:21.760
 - Bees.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.600
 - Bees don't make nests.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.420
 - I work with them beehive.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.260
 - Bees don't make nests.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.600
 - Yeah, some of them do, I reckon.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.440
 - Some do.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.000
 - Oh, some solitary bees, yeah.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.360
 - Actually, the vast majority of bees are solitary.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.800
 - Right, the vast majority of bees.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.520
 - Wasps, birds, and chimpanzees.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.440
 It's still interesting.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.960
 But they, so this is the interesting thing.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.880
 Their beds are extremely clean,

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.400
 and they also reuse them.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.240
 This is amazing.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.800
 As they travel, 'cause they're often moving,

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.840
 they make new beds every night.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.400
 They will reuse their beds within six months,

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.240
 and they will leave the foundations in place

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.120
 to build on when they return.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:52.960
 - Face mark.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.800
 And yet, pubic lice, Dan.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.440
 - We get, no, because they also poo in their beds,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.440
 which is part of the reason that they move around.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.160
 So they use it as a toilet.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.960
 So why would you sleep in your toilet

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.800
 after you've used it?

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.160
 So they migrate every day.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.440
 - Very slow learners.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.280
 Just every morning, "Oh, fuck, I pooed in my bed again.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.800
 "I'm gonna have to move."

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.920
 - Get the servants to wheel it, a new one.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.520
 Yeah, over you go.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:21.200
 - But yeah, and then, so, early human, early man,

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.080
 I don't even know if necessarily it was the point

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.200
 where we were necessarily homo sapien.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.760
 It was proto man, let's say, would see these empty nests

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.440
 and go, "Great, I've got a bed for the night."

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.800
 So we would sort of be walking behind the chimps

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.440
 and gorillas to find bedding for the evening.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.280
 And little bits of pubic lice would be hanging around in there,

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.640
 and that's where we'd catch them from.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.680
 - Wow.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.960
 - So that's what you Google,

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.720
 how do people get pubic lice?

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.560
 - Yeah.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.880
 - Great news, darling.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.280
 - Unfortunately, a little bit of sperm did get in.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.120
 - Oh, God.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.680
 - The show of voices, Aberdeen,

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.960
 how many people think they could beat a chimpanzee in a fight?

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.240
 - Let's do it.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.200
 - Well, the stereotypes of Scotland is not what I thought.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.440
 (laughing)

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.720
 - That's class go. - Class go, yeah.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.640
 - We're going there tomorrow, I think,

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.040
 and we'll tell them you said that.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.280
 (laughing)

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.520
 - There was a famous study that we've actually mentioned

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.840
 once or twice, and they found that 38% of men thought

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.480
 that they could beat a chimpanzee in a fight.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.800
 - 38!

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.600
 - Now there was some studies done in the 1920s

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.840
 about how strong chimpanzees are,

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.640
 and they found one chimpanzee called Suzette,

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.560
 who could do a one-handed pull of 1,260 pounds.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.320
 - Wow.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.040
 - Okay, it was during a fit of passion,

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.680
 so it wasn't normally how she would do it,

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.880
 but they kind of, they gave them things to pull

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.720
 and they did that.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.280
 Now, there is a very recent study from this year

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.920
 that has looked at all those old ones,

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.600
 and reckon that they were properly exaggerated.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.640
 And actually, chimpanzees aren't as strong as we think.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.840
 They're actually much closer to humans,

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.600
 and they reckon that the average chimpanzee

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:13.160
 has a differential of about 1.5 times the average human.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.920
 And so if you actually plot those graphs

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.040
 of the stronger humans and the weaker chimpanzees,

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.120
 actually, it's not much.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.240
 It's like in the 20% or 20 or 30%.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.080
 So actually, 38% of men saying that could actually be right.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:27.920
 - Really?

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.520
 - That's incredible, wow.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.600
 But chimpanzees will sort of just rip your ear off,

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.800
 as in they don't fight nice.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.840
 I don't think even if I was stronger than a chimpanzee,

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.880
 which I'm definitely not saying I am,

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.280
 I would be willing to go for the, go for it.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.880
 - Yeah, well, that's true.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.200
 I suppose they might fight in a different way than us.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.640
 - Would you, your tactic would be just complaining

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.000
 to the umpire constantly.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 (laughing)

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.440
 - Breath, breath.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.280
 The ear thing, come on.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.560
 - Andy wins with a technicality collector ripped off.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.160
 - Queensbury rules are not being observed here.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.400
 (laughing)

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.320
 We're gonna have to wrap up in a sec, guys.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.080
 - Well, did you know that chimps drink responsibly?

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:05.920
 - Cool.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.680
 - Yeah, they do drink, but never to excess.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.560
 - And it's mostly PG tips.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.160
 (laughing)

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.160
 - This was, they found this out in Guinea,

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.240
 'cause humans harvest us.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.560
 We harvest and ferment stuff from trees

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.560
 and they were harvesting sugary sap from raffia palms

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.600
 and fermenting it.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.480
 And they found that when they allowed it to ferment,

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.240
 they'd leave it in little cups jammed into the tree.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.520
 Then chimps would come and they'd fold up leaves

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.040
 and they'd dip them in, use them as sponges,

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.120
 and then they'd drink it.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.600
 But in their drinking sessions,

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.800
 they would dip about nine times,

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.480
 which would amount to a beer of about 3.1% alcohol.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.320
 (laughing)

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.160
 - And then they'd stop.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.120
 - And then they've had enough.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.680
 That's it, home from the pub.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.080
 - Well, it means they can drive back, doesn't it?

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.920
 (laughing)

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.320
 - I was reading about a chimp from Aberdeen.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.160
 - Oh.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.760
 - Yeah, you guys know Hazelhead Park?

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.080
 - Yes.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.120
 - They sure do.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.520
 That means, at least I got the right Aberdeen.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.760
 (laughing)

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.080
 Otherwise, I don't know where this would have gone.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.360
 But in the '60s and '70s,

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.520
 you had a zoo in Hazelhead Park.

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.840
 It's not there anymore.

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.480
 And they had a chimp called Humphrey.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.920
 And while they were building the zoo,

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.920
 Humphrey lived with one of the owners

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.920
 or one of the people who was kind of paying for it.

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.280
 And they kept him in a nappy so that he didn't poo everywhere.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.720
 And then one day they went out

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.280
 and they kept him in like a cage, a large cage,

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.720
 but they kept him in a cage.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.640
 And he managed to break out of the cage.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.320
 And they found him, he'd broken into the larder,

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.120
 and they found him in an easy chair

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.760
 with a lump of cake in one hand

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.400
 and a chocolate biscuit in the other.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.660
 (laughing)

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:52.080
 (upbeat music)

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.200
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.960

 Did I just say that?

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.680
 I said, why did I just say the same thing?

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.000
 - He's glitching, he's glitching.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:25.840
 Get the hammer.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.040
 (laughing)

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.200
 - Bring the chimp on.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.280
 - There's also a link to our new membership club,

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.760
 Club Fish, very exciting.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.440
 It's a land that has no adverts.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.520
 It's very, very cool.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.320
 Check it out, as well as extra shows

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.680
 that we've been putting up there behind the scenes stuff

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.120
 to just head to NoSuchThingAsAfish.com for that.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.800
 Outside of that, just want to quickly say,

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.240
 thank you so much, Aberdeen, that was so much fun.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.480
 We will be back again for everyone listening at home.

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.800
 Thank you so much.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.040
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.000
 We'll see you then.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:54.840
 Goodbye!

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.420
 (upbeat music)

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.420
 (audience cheering)

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.440
 (upbeat music)

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.440
 (audience cheering)

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.020
 (upbeat music)
