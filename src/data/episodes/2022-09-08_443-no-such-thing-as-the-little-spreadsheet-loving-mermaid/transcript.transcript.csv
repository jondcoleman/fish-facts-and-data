00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another episode.
00:00:14,00:00:18,"No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:18,00:00:21,this week coming to you live from Aberdeen.
00:00:21,00:00:27,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:27,00:00:30,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter, Murray Anna Tyshensky"
00:00:30,00:00:31,and James Harkin.
00:00:31,00:00:34,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:34,00:00:37,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:37,00:00:41,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:41,00:00:45,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:45,00:00:47,"- My fact is that in America,"
00:00:47,00:00:51,you can watch televised Microsoft Excel competitions.
00:00:51,00:00:53,(audience laughs)
00:00:53,00:00:54,- You can do a lot of things in America.
00:00:54,00:00:56,- Yeah. - Doesn't mean you should.
00:00:56,00:00:58,"- It's the newfound land, I'm so excited."
00:00:58,00:00:59,(laughs)
00:00:59,00:01:02,"This is a thing called Microsoft Excel eSports,"
00:01:02,00:01:06,"and it's been on, I think it's been on a couple of years."
00:01:06,00:01:08,"It was definitely on this year, it was on ESPN,"
00:01:08,00:01:09,which is a sports TV network.
00:01:09,00:01:13,And it's called the Excel All Star Battle.
00:01:13,00:01:15,And it was organized by a group called
00:01:15,00:01:17,the Financial Modeling World Cup.
00:01:17,00:01:20,And there is a slight caveat here.
00:01:20,00:01:23,"It was organized as part of something called the Occhi,"
00:01:23,00:01:24,which was a 24 hour celebration
00:01:24,00:01:26,of the stupidest imaginable sports.
00:01:26,00:01:29,"However, that included corgi racing,"
00:01:29,00:01:32,"stone skipping, a number of other dumb stuff."
00:01:32,00:01:34,"But it did happen, it was a televised thing."
00:01:34,00:01:37,There were commentators who were Excel pros.
00:01:37,00:01:39,"The aim of the game, basically they had a problem"
00:01:39,00:01:40,"setting up this as a sporting competition,"
00:01:40,00:01:43,"because as some of you will have noticed,"
00:01:43,00:01:44,"Microsoft Excel, not a game."
00:01:44,00:01:47,"It's fun, but it's not a game."
00:01:47,00:01:51,And so they had to invent ways of competing at Excel.
00:01:51,00:01:53,So one of the challenges was to create
00:01:53,00:01:56,"a yacht regatta game on Excel,"
00:01:56,00:01:59,which included a wind speed simulation
00:01:59,00:02:01,and directional vectors and things like that.
00:02:01,00:02:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:02,00:02:04,"- I think another one of the contests,"
00:02:04,00:02:08,they call Excel golf even more tedious than it already is.
00:02:08,00:02:10,(laughing)
00:02:10,00:02:14,But I think that that's all about getting to your answer
00:02:14,00:02:16,in the shortest possible amount of time.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"And that's kind of what golf is about, right?"
00:02:17,00:02:19,Make the game go by as quickly as possible
00:02:19,00:02:21,by doing it in the fewest shots so you can get to the bar.
00:02:21,00:02:21,"- Oh, okay, right."
00:02:21,00:02:23,"See, I think it sounds, I'm with Andy."
00:02:23,00:02:25,I think it sounds really exciting.
00:02:25,00:02:27,I was reading about the commentators.
00:02:27,00:02:29,So they have commentators who watch
00:02:29,00:02:31,as the Excel spreadsheets are being made.
00:02:31,00:02:32,- About Bill Jelen?
00:02:32,00:02:34,"- Bill Jelen, AKA Mr. Excel."
00:02:34,00:02:37,"And he, he's just like, he's,"
00:02:37,00:02:39,"so like some of the transcript is sort of them going,"
00:02:39,00:02:40,"""Oh my God, look what they're doing."
00:02:40,00:02:41,"""Oh my God, they're going for it."""
00:02:41,00:02:42,"And then there was this one that goes,"
00:02:42,00:02:45,"""Oh no, the F1 key, the dreaded F1 key."""
00:02:45,00:02:47,(laughing)
00:02:47,00:02:50,"And basically the F1 key brings up some help for,"
00:02:50,00:02:51,"""Do you need help on your Excel?"""
00:02:51,00:02:53,"And it's a key, I think you told us before,"
00:02:53,00:02:57,it's a key that's hated by Excel spreadsheet people.
00:02:57,00:02:59,They actually take it out of the keyboard.
00:02:59,00:03:01,It's so hated amongst members.
00:03:01,00:03:02,- I thought they didn't hate it.
00:03:02,00:03:05,"It was the, it helps you do a load of the functions."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"But actually, if you're really good at knowing"
00:03:07,00:03:09,"all the shortcuts, you don't need it."
00:03:09,00:03:11,So they take it off the keyboard as a kind of pride.
00:03:11,00:03:14,"It's like, I don't know what a good example would be,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,taking the head off your golf club to show.
00:03:16,00:03:17,(laughing)
00:03:17,00:03:18,I'm so good at golf.
00:03:18,00:03:18,- You're so good.
00:03:18,00:03:22,- I can do it just with the stick bit.
00:03:22,00:03:23,"- Do you think anyone ever says,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"when they're asked, ""What sports do you like to watch?"""
00:03:25,00:03:27,They just say F1 and leave it at that.
00:03:27,00:03:28,(laughing)
00:03:28,00:03:30,They're not pros any further.
00:03:30,00:03:35,"- I was reading about a famous Excel sportsman,"
00:03:35,00:03:38,"called Dermot Early, he's Irish."
00:03:38,00:03:40,And there was an interview with him.
00:03:40,00:03:44,And basically he got into competitive excelling
00:03:44,00:03:46,because he was really popular at work
00:03:46,00:03:48,because he was the only guy who knew how to use Excel.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"And people, I bet a lot of us here know about that,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,"going into the office,"
00:03:53,00:03:55,been the only one who knows how to use a spreadsheet
00:03:55,00:03:57,and just people kept coming up to him.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"And so they asked him, ""Does Excel make you popular?"""
00:03:59,00:04:01,"And he said, ""Yeah, it made me popular with my peers"
00:04:01,00:04:02,"""and with people at work."""
00:04:02,00:04:05,"And they said, ""Do you get any fan mail?"""
00:04:05,00:04:06,"And he said, ""Yes, I do."""
00:04:06,00:04:09,"Well, I get a lot of LinkedIn connection requests."
00:04:09,00:04:11,(laughing)
00:04:11,00:04:14,- I think they're rock stars.
00:04:14,00:04:16,Just back to Bill Jelen for a second.
00:04:16,00:04:19,"Reading about his life, he goes around the world"
00:04:19,00:04:21,"giving talks, he's a hugely popular guy"
00:04:21,00:04:22,within the Excel world.
00:04:22,00:04:23,He's written 60s--
00:04:23,00:04:24,"- It's an important caveat, isn't it?"
00:04:24,00:04:27,I'm a hugely popular guy within the Excel world.
00:04:27,00:04:28,(laughing)
00:04:28,00:04:31,- He's written 67 books on Excel.
00:04:31,00:04:32,He's got a list on his website as well
00:04:32,00:04:34,about the cool things that he's done
00:04:34,00:04:36,"so that when you read it and you know Excel,"
00:04:36,00:04:37,"you're like, ""Oh my God, this guy's amazing."""
00:04:37,00:04:40,So check out his list of his awesomeness.
00:04:40,00:04:41,He helped a client in Australia
00:04:41,00:04:46,cut a 40 hour a month task into a four minute process.
00:04:46,00:04:47,That's pretty crazy.
00:04:47,00:04:48,- He was immediately fired.
00:04:48,00:04:49,- Yeah.
00:04:49,00:04:53,"- Look at this, spent 14 minutes with a seminar attendee"
00:04:53,00:04:55,in Trinidad to reduce a three day task
00:04:55,00:04:57,to a two minute process.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"- Yeah, wow."
00:04:58,00:05:00,"- Yeah, and then this is randomly thrown in there."
00:05:00,00:05:03,"Once won $1,000 for stopping an electric fan"
00:05:03,00:05:07,with his tongue at a local stupid human tricks competition.
00:05:07,00:05:09,(laughing)
00:05:09,00:05:10,"- Say $1,000."
00:05:10,00:05:11,"- $1,000."
00:05:11,00:05:15,- That's quite a low sum of money for an event
00:05:15,00:05:18,where there's a non-zero chance you'll lose your tongue.
00:05:18,00:05:19,- Very true.
00:05:19,00:05:21,- You might insure your tongue before you go to the event.
00:05:21,00:05:22,"- For $2,000."
00:05:22,00:05:23,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:05:23,00:05:24,"- Win, win."
00:05:24,00:05:28,"- Then if, so even if you lose it, you get $3,000."
00:05:28,00:05:30,"If you stop the fan, you get $3,000."
00:05:30,00:05:30,- I don't know.
00:05:30,00:05:32,- I haven't thought this through.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"- If you stop the fan, but you lose your tongue"
00:05:34,00:05:37,"in the process, you get $3,000."
00:05:37,00:05:39,- You need a spreadsheet to work it out.
00:05:39,00:05:40,"And that's why, it sounds great."
00:05:40,00:05:41,(laughing)
00:05:41,00:05:43,Thank you.
00:05:43,00:05:46,"- They could have shortened that bit that Andy just said,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,which felt like about three days to just two minutes.
00:05:48,00:05:52,(laughing)
00:05:52,00:05:54,"- You guys, I'm sure, came across the European"
00:05:54,00:05:57,Spreadsheet Risks Group in your research for this.
00:05:57,00:05:58,What a bunch of heroes.
00:05:58,00:05:59,- What do they do?
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- They, their whole raison d'etre"
00:06:01,00:06:04,is to warn business leaders about the risks of spreadsheets.
00:06:04,00:06:05,- Okay.
00:06:05,00:06:07,- So there are millions of problems
00:06:07,00:06:09,"which rise if a spreadsheet is bad,"
00:06:09,00:06:11,"or if there's human error, or anything."
00:06:11,00:06:14,"You know, lost revenue, fraud, systematic failures,"
00:06:14,00:06:16,"people taking three days over something,"
00:06:16,00:06:17,"they should take two minutes, all of it."
00:06:17,00:06:19,And they have an annual conference to network
00:06:19,00:06:21,and discuss spreadsheet risk.
00:06:21,00:06:22,And they have a page on their website
00:06:22,00:06:25,which is called Horror Stories.
00:06:25,00:06:26,"- Oh, yeah."
00:06:26,00:06:27,- I'll give us one.
00:06:27,00:06:28,(laughing)
00:06:28,00:06:31,"- I'll do the crackling fire, as you tell it."
00:06:31,00:06:33,- It was a dark and stormy night.
00:06:33,00:06:35,(laughing)
00:06:35,00:06:36,- That's Hollywood bought the rights
00:06:36,00:06:38,to any of the Horror Stories.
00:06:38,00:06:39,"- I know, they haven't."
00:06:39,00:06:41,"- They can be really dangerous, though."
00:06:41,00:06:44,"- You know, in seriousness, the dangers of spreadsheets"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"led to austerity, which I think,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"I mean, it's, probably may have read about this,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,but important to remember that whole period of shit
00:06:51,00:06:54,"that we all went through, about 12 years ago."
00:06:54,00:06:56,"- Yeah, glad things, glad things picked up after that."
00:06:56,00:06:57,(laughing)
00:06:57,00:07:00,"Oh, we're not like to be in a timeline"
00:07:00,00:07:01,where things just got worse and worse and worse.
00:07:01,00:07:03,(laughing)
00:07:03,00:07:06,- So that was all based on this Harvard paper.
00:07:06,00:07:08,So the reason that George Osborne and David Cameron
00:07:08,00:07:10,launched austerity was because of this Harvard paper
00:07:10,00:07:13,"that did a bunch of calculations, which showed that,"
00:07:13,00:07:17,"I think, if your debt was exceeding 90% of your GDP,"
00:07:17,00:07:18,then your economy would shrink.
00:07:18,00:07:21,"And so they said, okay, the economy's gonna shrink"
00:07:21,00:07:22,if we don't launch austerity.
00:07:22,00:07:24,"Actually, it had been done on a spreadsheet,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"and a bunch of rows of data had been missed out,"
00:07:26,00:07:27,"which, if they'd been included,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,"would have shown that the economy wouldn't shrink,"
00:07:29,00:07:31,"didn't need austerity at all,"
00:07:31,00:07:33,"all for nothing, sorry to be a downer."
00:07:33,00:07:35,But--
00:07:35,00:07:38,"- I mean, was the reason they did it really the spreadsheet?"
00:07:38,00:07:41,Or were they looking for an excuse and found this paper?
00:07:41,00:07:42,(laughing)
00:07:42,00:07:44,- George Osborne deleting those rows
00:07:44,00:07:45,in the middle of the night.
00:07:45,00:07:47,(laughing)
00:07:47,00:07:49,"- That was, I think, mentioned by this group, wasn't it,"
00:07:49,00:07:50,that Andy was talking about.
00:07:50,00:07:53,And another one was MI5.
00:07:53,00:07:55,They had a spreadsheet of a load of phone numbers
00:07:55,00:07:57,that they should bug.
00:07:57,00:07:59,"But unfortunately, the spreadsheet cut off"
00:07:59,00:08:03,"the last three digits and turned them to 0, 0, 0."
00:08:03,00:08:05,And so they started bugging people
00:08:05,00:08:06,that were completely the wrong number.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"- Oh, wow. - Oh, my God."
00:08:08,00:08:10,- That's so funny.
00:08:10,00:08:11,- Incredible.
00:08:11,00:08:12,"- Oh, they must have got themselves in such knots,"
00:08:12,00:08:13,listening to the conversations
00:08:13,00:08:15,about what we're having for dinner tonight.
00:08:15,00:08:16,(laughing)
00:08:16,00:08:18,I think that means there's gonna be a weapons drop
00:08:18,00:08:20,in Kazakhstan? - Yeah.
00:08:20,00:08:23,"- 0, 0, 0 is also literally the non-spy, isn't it?"
00:08:23,00:08:26,"'Cause every number up is-- - 007, 006, 005."
00:08:26,00:08:29,- The worst spy. - The worst spy.
00:08:29,00:08:31,- I read in an article where they interviewed
00:08:31,00:08:33,"Dan Bricklin, who invented the spreadsheet."
00:08:33,00:08:34,- Oh.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"- Apparently, when he invented it,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,people thought that people who were using it
00:08:38,00:08:42,"had magical powers, 'cause this is what he said."
00:08:42,00:08:42,- Cool.
00:08:42,00:08:43,- Because they could do these jobs
00:08:43,00:08:45,so much quicker than anyone else.
00:08:45,00:08:46,- Yeah.
00:08:46,00:08:47,- But he said that not everyone quite understood
00:08:47,00:08:49,"what they did, so some people thought"
00:08:49,00:08:51,that it was just a way of showing numbers
00:08:51,00:08:53,and didn't realize that they had ways
00:08:53,00:08:56,of doing calculations and stuff as well.
00:08:56,00:08:57,"And so, according to this guy,"
00:08:57,00:08:59,some people would have the spreadsheet
00:08:59,00:09:00,and then would glue a calculator
00:09:00,00:09:02,to the side of their keyboard
00:09:02,00:09:06,so that they could do the calculations at the same time.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"- Have you guys heard of Paul McKenna, the hypnotist?"
00:09:08,00:09:09,"- Yeah, of course, of course."
00:09:09,00:09:13,"- So, Paul McKenna decided who he should marry"
00:09:13,00:09:14,with the spreadsheet.
00:09:14,00:09:17,"- As in, he wrote down the, like, pluses and minuses and--"
00:09:17,00:09:20,"- Well, he was, at a time in his life when he was,"
00:09:20,00:09:22,"he was going out with, he was dating"
00:09:22,00:09:24,and he would go on dates with lots of women
00:09:24,00:09:26,"and he then realized, oh, I don't think"
00:09:26,00:09:27,I'm looking for the right thing
00:09:27,00:09:29,or he wasn't finding the right person.
00:09:29,00:09:30,- Yeah.
00:09:30,00:09:32,"- And a friend pointed out, you're not happy."
00:09:32,00:09:32,You're going on all these dates
00:09:32,00:09:35,but you're really not happy with how your romantic life is.
00:09:35,00:09:36,Why didn't you make a spreadsheet
00:09:36,00:09:38,to find out who you really love?
00:09:38,00:09:40,"And he did so, and he found out"
00:09:40,00:09:44,"that it was his long-term personal assistant, Kate, who--"
00:09:44,00:09:46,- Who was also the person who did all his IT.
00:09:46,00:09:49,(laughing)
00:09:49,00:09:50,"- Yeah, no, I know that, I mean, I did--"
00:09:50,00:09:53,"- I mean, it sounds like he's being Paul McKenna, doesn't it?"
00:09:53,00:09:54,"- Yeah, it does."
00:09:54,00:09:55,- Yeah.
00:09:55,00:09:57,"- Wow, did he marry her?"
00:09:57,00:09:58,- Yeah.
00:09:58,00:09:58,- He did?
00:09:58,00:09:59,- Yeah.
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Okay.
00:10:00,00:10:01,(laughing)
00:10:01,00:10:03,Good to know how that worked out.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"But well, have you guys heard of less famous"
00:10:06,00:10:08,but Ariel Fishman?
00:10:08,00:10:09,- No.
00:10:09,00:10:10,- Ariel Fishman has--
00:10:10,00:10:12,"- Ariel Fishman, sounds like someone"
00:10:12,00:10:13,from The Little Mermaid to me.
00:10:13,00:10:14,"- It does, doesn't it?"
00:10:14,00:10:15,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:15,00:10:16,"- It does, isn't Ariel the mermaid?"
00:10:16,00:10:18,"- Ariel is the mermaid, and she's a fish woman, yeah."
00:10:18,00:10:20,"- Yeah, so this is her brother."
00:10:20,00:10:21,"- Brother, yeah."
00:10:21,00:10:22,(laughing)
00:10:22,00:10:25,- And he has the largest collection
00:10:25,00:10:28,of spreadsheet software in the world.
00:10:28,00:10:30,He's been collecting it since its early days.
00:10:30,00:10:33,"James, you look so excited by this."
00:10:33,00:10:34,- We don't need to ask if he's married.
00:10:34,00:10:37,(laughing)
00:10:37,00:10:37,- So he's got--
00:10:37,00:10:38,"- That's me, that's me."
00:10:38,00:10:42,- Over 800 individual unique bits of Excel
00:10:42,00:10:43,and other companies.
00:10:43,00:10:44,'Cause back in the day--
00:10:44,00:10:45,- That's pretty cool.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"- When spreadsheets started, there was a boom."
00:10:46,00:10:48,Companies were trying to get involved in it.
00:10:48,00:10:51,"Boeing even started their own spreadsheet software,"
00:10:51,00:10:53,but they lost out to Excel and Microsoft.
00:10:53,00:10:55,And so he's got a collection
00:10:55,00:10:57,of 800 unique pieces of software.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"He's been collecting it for many, many years."
00:10:59,00:11:01,"And apparently there's one, kind of like the Holy Grail,"
00:11:01,00:11:04,the missing thing that he's been trying to get his hands on.
00:11:04,00:11:06,This is a bit of an old article.
00:11:06,00:11:07,Possibly he's got it now.
00:11:07,00:11:09,But Excel 2001 for the Mac
00:11:09,00:11:12,is the one thing that he can't get his hands on.
00:11:12,00:11:13,- Oh.
00:11:13,00:11:14,- So if anyone has it out there listening
00:11:14,00:11:15,"or in the audience here in Aberdeen,"
00:11:15,00:11:17,you're sitting on gold.
00:11:17,00:11:21,"You're sitting on precious, precious gold."
00:11:21,00:11:22,- Wow. - My God.
00:11:22,00:11:25,- And Ariel Fishman would like to hear from you.
00:11:25,00:11:26,(laughing)
00:11:26,00:11:28,- Do wrap it in plastic before you send it to him.
00:11:28,00:11:30,'Cause obviously he lives under the waves.
00:11:30,00:11:32,"- And, yeah."
00:11:32,00:11:32,- Yeah.
00:11:32,00:11:35,"Oh wow, and Ariel collects things, doesn't she, as well?"
00:11:35,00:11:36,- She does. - She does.
00:11:36,00:11:38,- Imagine what a boring film that would have been
00:11:38,00:11:42,if what she collected was versions of Excel.
00:11:42,00:11:45,- I've got spreadsheets and we're dusted.
00:11:45,00:11:48,"- Under the sea, and when I say sea, I mean column sea."
00:11:48,00:11:50,(laughing)
00:11:50,00:11:59,- It is time for fact number two.
00:11:59,00:12:02,And that is Anna.
00:12:02,00:12:05,"- My fact this week is that in 1966,"
00:12:05,00:12:08,the World Chicken Congress happened in Kiev.
00:12:08,00:12:11,(laughing)
00:12:11,00:12:12,- Super.
00:12:12,00:12:14,(laughing)
00:12:14,00:12:20,- I know basically nothing else about it.
00:12:20,00:12:22,"And it's, look, if we're being really pedantic,"
00:12:22,00:12:25,it's the World Poultry Congress.
00:12:25,00:12:27,"But potato batata, right?"
00:12:27,00:12:28,"- Well, I think that's quite important"
00:12:28,00:12:32,"because in 2019, 2004, and 2001,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,the World Poultry Congress was in Turkey.
00:12:34,00:12:37,"- Oh, brilliant. - Oh."
00:12:37,00:12:38,- Yeah.
00:12:38,00:12:41,"- And in 2017, and 2003, it was in Northwest France,"
00:12:41,00:12:44,30 miles from the city of Brest.
00:12:44,00:12:46,- Nice. - Super.
00:12:46,00:12:49,- What a shame that the city of Peking changed its name.
00:12:49,00:12:50,"- Yes. - Traditionally, yeah, yeah."
00:12:50,00:12:52,- Not for the people of China who were going to be out
00:12:52,00:12:55,"from under the yoke of, but yeah, not for the pun."
00:12:55,00:12:57,"- I think if you told them the reason to keep it,"
00:12:57,00:12:59,"they might have, right?"
00:12:59,00:13:01,"- It does sound like a wild, it sounds really fun."
00:13:01,00:13:03,It sounds like a good place to get.
00:13:03,00:13:04,"- Do you think? - Oh, well, I think so, yeah, yeah."
00:13:04,00:13:05,- What would you rather attend?
00:13:05,00:13:09,"The World Excel Championships or the World Poultry Congress,"
00:13:09,00:13:10,1966? - I couldn't choose.
00:13:10,00:13:11,I couldn't choose.
00:13:11,00:13:12,I'd tear myself in two.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"- If they're on the same day, that'd be tough, wouldn't it?"
00:13:14,00:13:16,"- Well, just they've got interesting sounding papers"
00:13:16,00:13:17,and sessions.
00:13:17,00:13:21,"So this year, papers have included recent advances"
00:13:21,00:13:22,in ostrich farming.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"Wow, yeah, ostrich is a poultry too."
00:13:24,00:13:25,That's interesting.
00:13:25,00:13:26,(laughing)
00:13:26,00:13:28,- Can I just point out for the list of her?
00:13:28,00:13:29,"Andy went, ""Wow, yeah, right,"
00:13:29,00:13:32,"""before anyone in the audience made any noise."""
00:13:32,00:13:34,- I think I'd heard a collective intake of breath.
00:13:34,00:13:37,Recent advances in duck nutrition.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"Okay, that's weaker."
00:13:38,00:13:40,That is definitely weaker.
00:13:40,00:13:42,And mechanisms of regulation of the sperm
00:13:42,00:13:44,acrosome response in chickens.
00:13:44,00:13:46,The role of membrane rafts.
00:13:46,00:13:47,(groaning)
00:13:47,00:13:48,- Wow.
00:13:48,00:13:50,- I've always wondered what their role was.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"- Yeah, so some questions to the one before."
00:13:53,00:13:55,"You're at the conference, but, uh-oh,"
00:13:55,00:13:56,all three of those talks are happening
00:13:56,00:13:58,on different stages at the same time.
00:13:58,00:14:00,(laughing)
00:14:00,00:14:01,"- I'll go to ostrich farming, I think."
00:14:01,00:14:02,"- Oh, wow."
00:14:02,00:14:03,- Advanced advances in ostrich farming.
00:14:03,00:14:05,I just don't think I'd understand that one.
00:14:05,00:14:07,I was clinging on as I read it out.
00:14:07,00:14:09,(laughing)
00:14:09,00:14:14,"- In the 1966 one, all the papers had to be presented."
00:14:14,00:14:17,"So you had to present a paper that was about 2,500 words"
00:14:17,00:14:19,and then you read it out to a scintillated audience.
00:14:19,00:14:21,And they all had to be typed up
00:14:21,00:14:23,"in English, French, Russian, and German."
00:14:23,00:14:25,"And you'd have to type it up, you know."
00:14:25,00:14:26,"Yourself, individually."
00:14:26,00:14:28,And there was just a thing in the bump
00:14:28,00:14:30,"that they sent out for it that said,"
00:14:30,00:14:33,"""Should the author have any difficulty translating"
00:14:33,00:14:37,"the paper into Russian in case the author struggles,"
00:14:37,00:14:39,"the organizing committee provides it free of charge."""
00:14:39,00:14:40,"But, which implies that the others,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,"you've just got to be trilingual,"
00:14:42,00:14:44,as well as being a poultry bro.
00:14:44,00:14:45,"- Is it English, French, and German?"
00:14:45,00:14:46,- Yeah.
00:14:46,00:14:47,"- That's a challenge, yeah."
00:14:47,00:14:47,- Wow.
00:14:47,00:14:48,"- It is, but yeah."
00:14:48,00:14:51,The World Poultry Congress is a big deal.
00:14:51,00:14:53,"- One interesting thing about poultry farming, right,"
00:14:53,00:14:56,is that some people think that we are currently
00:14:56,00:14:59,in the geological age of the chicken.
00:14:59,00:14:59,- Ah!
00:14:59,00:15:03,"- And the reason being that we eat as a species,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,"so many chickens, and we farm so many of them."
00:15:05,00:15:08,"And because when we finish with them,"
00:15:08,00:15:09,"their bones often go into landfill,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"they'll be left for long, long periods."
00:15:11,00:15:15,"And so in thousands and hundreds of thousands of years time,"
00:15:15,00:15:17,they'll just find loads and loads of chicken bones everywhere
00:15:17,00:15:21,and just assume that this was some kind of chicken culture.
00:15:21,00:15:22,- They were in charge.
00:15:22,00:15:23,- Oh my God.
00:15:23,00:15:25,- All the buildings that were there were built by chickens.
00:15:25,00:15:26,- I guess I'll think that.
00:15:26,00:15:27,"- And they'll all be wiped out of history,"
00:15:27,00:15:30,"and it's just, wow, that's so exciting."
00:15:30,00:15:33,"- Oh, the only other conclusion you can take"
00:15:33,00:15:36,"is that the dinosaurs weren't the biggest thing at the time,"
00:15:36,00:15:37,just people were eating a lot of them.
00:15:37,00:15:38,- Yes.
00:15:38,00:15:40,- There was something bigger that was eating all of them.
00:15:40,00:15:42,- That's such a great point.
00:15:42,00:15:44,"Up until, I think it was the Second World War,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,we didn't really eat chicken that much.
00:15:46,00:15:48,It was really expensive to produce them.
00:15:48,00:15:51,"You would eat, this is, the story I read"
00:15:51,00:15:52,"was more to do with America,"
00:15:52,00:15:55,so it was about the production and how much it would cost.
00:15:55,00:15:57,And then there was a competition run
00:15:57,00:15:59,called the Chicken of Tomorrow.
00:15:59,00:16:02,"And the Chicken of Tomorrow competition was,"
00:16:02,00:16:05,every farmer was invited to come and present their chicken.
00:16:05,00:16:08,"They sent in the eggs, so they didn't even bring a chicken."
00:16:08,00:16:09,"So they just sent the eggs,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,and then the eggs were incubated and they hatched.
00:16:11,00:16:13,And then they looked after these eggs
00:16:13,00:16:15,and they watched what kind of chickens were yielded
00:16:15,00:16:16,and how meaty they were
00:16:16,00:16:19,and how quickly they could produce eggs and so on.
00:16:19,00:16:20,And they were trying to find a chicken
00:16:20,00:16:23,that they could then mass farm and produce
00:16:23,00:16:24,so that all of America could basically
00:16:24,00:16:26,eat chicken as a standard meal.
00:16:26,00:16:28,"- The chickens we're eating now are basically,"
00:16:28,00:16:30,they are the descendants of the Chickens of Tomorrow.
00:16:30,00:16:31,"- Yeah, of this one competition."
00:16:31,00:16:33,- The Chickens of today are the Chickens...
00:16:33,00:16:34,- The Chickens of Tomorrow.
00:16:34,00:16:37,"- It's like back to the future, but they're chickens."
00:16:37,00:16:39,- It sounds absolutely bananas.
00:16:39,00:16:42,"So there were 40 finalists in this competition,"
00:16:42,00:16:46,and you had to submit 720 eggs as an individual farmer.
00:16:46,00:16:47,"And then they were, as Dan says,"
00:16:47,00:16:49,they were raised in controlled conditions.
00:16:49,00:16:51,They were all fed the same thing.
00:16:51,00:16:52,"And then after 12 weeks,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,the survivors were slaughtered and judged.
00:16:54,00:16:56,So it sounds like it was really fun.
00:16:56,00:17:01,"- Gosh, that's like, Miss World was like that, isn't it?"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"- What is weird that you mentioned beauty queens, James,"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"because as part of the celebrations,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,the jamboree to celebrate the offing
00:17:07,00:17:10,"of however many thousands of the surviving chickens,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,"they had dances, they had a parade, they had a rodeo,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,"and they also had a chicken of Tomorrow Queen,"
00:17:15,00:17:18,who was a beauty queen who would go around
00:17:18,00:17:19,promoting the chicken of Tomorrow.
00:17:19,00:17:20,"- Oh, a human."
00:17:20,00:17:22,"- Yeah, a human."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"- She was called Nancy McGee, which is a good name, I think,"
00:17:25,00:17:26,for the Chickens of Tomorrow Queen.
00:17:26,00:17:29,"And she was like, we've talked about industry queens"
00:17:29,00:17:30,in the middle of the century.
00:17:30,00:17:31,They were there to promote the industry.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"- Well, we talked about Marilyn Monroe ages ago,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,being the asparagus queen of--
00:17:35,00:17:36,"- Or us, Chiltrope."
00:17:36,00:17:38,"- Oh, sorry, was it? - Or us, Chiltrope."
00:17:38,00:17:39,"- Oh, sorry, was it? - Oh, yeah."
00:17:39,00:17:39,- I'm sorry.
00:17:39,00:17:40,- Can you idiot?
00:17:40,00:17:42,(laughing)
00:17:42,00:17:44,"- Do we know anything more about Nancy McGee, though?"
00:17:44,00:17:45,"- I don't know, I mean, she might still be alive."
00:17:45,00:17:47,She was about 18 at the time she won.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"That was 1948. - Yeah, right."
00:17:48,00:17:51,- I know that she didn't have as big a Chicken of Tomorrow
00:17:51,00:17:54,career as the person who came after her.
00:17:54,00:17:57,"So it was so successful, Chicken of Tomorrow, 1948,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,"I think it was, that they had another one in 1951."
00:17:59,00:18:02,"And there's a huge star, Joan Walters of Arkansas,"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"was the queen of Chicken of Tomorrow contest, 1951."
00:18:06,00:18:07,She was a big celeb.
00:18:07,00:18:08,- Was she?
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- Well, in a very small part of America."
00:18:09,00:18:10,Yeah.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"- Okay, wow."
00:18:11,00:18:12,"- But no, we don't."
00:18:12,00:18:14,All I know about the contest is also
00:18:14,00:18:16,"when they sent their 720 eggs,"
00:18:16,00:18:19,"'cause they had to be really carefully timed,"
00:18:19,00:18:20,'cause you've got to start incubating them
00:18:20,00:18:22,at precisely the right time.
00:18:22,00:18:24,They had to be loaded onto trains
00:18:24,00:18:26,that were specifically timed to take the eggs
00:18:26,00:18:28,and get them to the place where they were gonna be
00:18:28,00:18:31,"incubated at the perfect moment for them, you know,"
00:18:31,00:18:33,to be put under heat.
00:18:33,00:18:35,So special egg trains.
00:18:35,00:18:36,"- Speaking of eggs, by the way,"
00:18:36,00:18:39,"the National Egg Collection of 1914,"
00:18:39,00:18:41,I don't know if you came across that.
00:18:41,00:18:42,- No. - It's pretty amazing.
00:18:42,00:18:44,And I can tell that you did.
00:18:44,00:18:46,"The idea of this was, it was during the war,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,and what you would do is you would collect some eggs
00:18:48,00:18:51,and you would send them over to France
00:18:51,00:18:55,for recovering soldiers or people on the front line.
00:18:55,00:19:00,"Their aim was to get 20,000 eggs a week over to France."
00:19:00,00:19:04,"And in the week of the 16th to the 23rd of August that year,"
00:19:04,00:19:09,"they managed 1,030,380 eggs that they sent over."
00:19:09,00:19:12,It's insane.
00:19:12,00:19:13,- Were they intact though?
00:19:13,00:19:15,"Were they like, can you use bubble wrap next time?"
00:19:15,00:19:18,"- I think it was a massive omelet, they said."
00:19:18,00:19:21,"No, it's bizarre, because think of the one fragile,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,"precious thing you don't want to send into a war zone,"
00:19:23,00:19:24,an egg with its little shell.
00:19:24,00:19:27,- The problem was they put them all in one massive basket.
00:19:27,00:19:32,- It does sound incredibly sweet.
00:19:32,00:19:33,"- It's incredible, it's so cool."
00:19:33,00:19:34,"- Because there was this theory that eggs were so nutritious,"
00:19:34,00:19:36,"they were the best thing for, you know,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"our boys over in northern France,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,"and there were lots of protein,"
00:19:39,00:19:40,and they were great for recovery.
00:19:40,00:19:42,And children would write their names and addresses
00:19:42,00:19:44,"on the eggs, and sometimes soldiers"
00:19:44,00:19:47,who were given the eggs would write back to the children and...
00:19:47,00:19:49,- On what? Another egg?
00:19:49,00:19:51,"- No, fake, well, no."
00:19:51,00:19:52,- On a sausage?
00:19:52,00:19:56,- Just on a bit of paper.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"But by August 1916,"
00:19:58,00:20:00,they got through 22 million eggs in total.
00:20:00,00:20:01,- It's so amazing.
00:20:01,00:20:01,- It's bananas.
00:20:01,00:20:02,- You could put like little messages as well
00:20:02,00:20:04,"as your name and address, couldn't you,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,and they called them egograms.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"- Oh, that's great, so good."
00:20:08,00:20:10,"If you're a chicken farmer,"
00:20:10,00:20:12,"sometimes your chickens will try and overthrow you,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,and you have to resist.
00:20:14,00:20:15,- What?
00:20:15,00:20:16,- This is true.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"So, it's..."
00:20:18,00:20:19,- Have you recently read Animal Farm?
00:20:19,00:20:20,- Yeah.
00:20:20,00:20:22,"- No, you're thinking here."
00:20:22,00:20:26,"- No, so, you know, the pecking order is a real thing."
00:20:26,00:20:27,- Yeah.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"- Actual hierarchies in chicken societies,"
00:20:28,00:20:32,and some cockerels will try to challenge the pecking order
00:20:32,00:20:35,"and start pecking you, the farmer,"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"and you have to, you have two methods at that point"
00:20:38,00:20:41,to kind of reassert your dominance over the whole barn
00:20:41,00:20:42,or the whole flock or whatever it is.
00:20:42,00:20:45,"So, method one is to put on thick leather gloves,"
00:20:45,00:20:47,and you just pin the aggressive rooster to the ground.
00:20:47,00:20:51,"Every time it comes at you, you just say, ""No, stop."
00:20:51,00:20:54,"""Chill out, I'm the captain now."""
00:20:54,00:20:57,"And you just do that, and eventually it just gets"
00:20:57,00:20:59,"the message and it's like, ""Okay, I submit."""
00:20:59,00:21:02,"You know, the other option is to kill and eat that rooster."
00:21:02,00:21:03,(laughing)
00:21:03,00:21:05,Do you have to eat it in front of all the other chickens?
00:21:05,00:21:06,- I say so.
00:21:06,00:21:07,"- Oh, no."
00:21:07,00:21:10,- Let this be a lesson to you all.
00:21:10,00:21:13,"- So, but you said there's only two ways to stop this, right?"
00:21:13,00:21:16,"So, have there been situations where neither method"
00:21:16,00:21:19,has been deployed and a whole farm is now being run
00:21:19,00:21:21,by a chicken with some dead farmer?
00:21:21,00:21:22,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:21:22,00:21:24,"You've seen those signs, you know,"
00:21:24,00:21:27,pick your own humans at the side of the motorway.
00:21:27,00:21:29,"- You know, that and Matthews?"
00:21:29,00:21:31,- 10 chickens in an overcoat.
00:21:31,00:21:33,(laughing)
00:21:33,00:21:36,- And do you know what fart eggs are?
00:21:36,00:21:38,"- Ah, fart eggs. - Ah, fart eggs."
00:21:38,00:21:40,"- No. - Or cock eggs,"
00:21:40,00:21:41,"they're the same thing, or wind eggs."
00:21:41,00:21:43,"They've got lots of names for this one thing,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,"and they're tiny, tiny eggs."
00:21:45,00:21:47,But I didn't know that hens did this.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"They sometimes get laid by completely ordinary hens,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,"and it's often when they're just learning how to lay,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,"I think, and they haven't got it quite right."
00:21:53,00:21:55,"- Just a, just a-- - Just a mini egg is a,"
00:21:55,00:21:57,"it's like a mini egg, compared to--"
00:21:57,00:21:58,(laughing)
00:21:58,00:22:00,- It's incredible they get so many of them every year.
00:22:00,00:22:01,(laughing)
00:22:01,00:22:03,"And they have to pump the chocolate, yeah, yeah."
00:22:03,00:22:05,"- Yeah, then they get the chocolate right inside."
00:22:05,00:22:06,- But do they fart them out?
00:22:06,00:22:07,"Is it like a cough, where it's like,"
00:22:07,00:22:08,"""Oh, God, there's an egg?"""
00:22:08,00:22:09,(laughing)
00:22:09,00:22:11,"I don't know what the process is,"
00:22:11,00:22:13,"but it's not, it's not the passing of wind that causes it."
00:22:13,00:22:14,"- Okay. - It's just,"
00:22:14,00:22:15,"I guess it's just called that,"
00:22:15,00:22:17,"because it's like an accidental whoopsy,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,I've laid a useless egg.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"Although sometimes very good for dieting, I'd imagine,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,because they're often without any yolk.
00:22:22,00:22:24,They're all white.
00:22:24,00:22:25,"They're on a diet. - Oh, good for making a meringue."
00:22:25,00:22:27,- Very good for meringue. - Great for meringues.
00:22:27,00:22:28,- A tiny meringue.
00:22:28,00:22:30,(laughing)
00:22:30,00:22:32,"And they used to be, if you do have a cock egg,"
00:22:32,00:22:35,"or a fart egg, there is, well, there's a myth"
00:22:35,00:22:37,"that it used to be produced by a cockatrice,"
00:22:37,00:22:40,"a mythical serpent,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,and that the only way to get rid of the curse
00:22:42,00:22:44,"that would be on you is to,"
00:22:44,00:22:46,"'cause it could kill you with an evil stare,"
00:22:46,00:22:49,is by throwing the egg over the house
00:22:49,00:22:51,and smashing it in the field next door.
00:22:51,00:22:52,So you've got to get rid of that egg.
00:22:52,00:22:55,- Or you can just kill and eat the cockatrice.
00:22:55,00:22:56,That also works. - Yeah.
00:22:56,00:22:58,- Can I quickly ask a very stupid question?
00:22:58,00:23:00,I just realized I don't know about this egg.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"So these are tiny, tiny eggs."
00:23:02,00:23:03,- Yes. - From a chicken
00:23:03,00:23:05,"that would usually have big eggs, right?"
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- Well, normal sized eggs."
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Normal sized eggs.
00:23:07,00:23:09,"So when an egg is growing inside,"
00:23:09,00:23:11,"I always assumed that it would sort of,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,"it was the size it was always gonna be,"
00:23:12,00:23:16,and it sort of forms a shape and congeals and stuff.
00:23:16,00:23:17,Do eggs start as tiny little eggs
00:23:17,00:23:19,and slowly like expand like a balloon?
00:23:19,00:23:20,"- No, they definitely don't do that."
00:23:20,00:23:22,- Okay. - I think so.
00:23:22,00:23:23,(laughing)
00:23:23,00:23:25,- I think you need to go to next year's World Poultry Company.
00:23:25,00:23:27,(laughing)
00:23:27,00:23:31,"Just very quickly, before we move on."
00:23:31,00:23:32,"- Yeah. - On chicken kievs,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,or chicken kievs. - Yep.
00:23:34,00:23:36,- We obviously often call them these days.
00:23:36,00:23:41,"Invented possibly in Ukraine, possibly in Russia,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"possibly in France, we're not really sure."
00:23:43,00:23:44,I think invented in Britain.
00:23:44,00:23:47,"Because the modern chicken kiev,"
00:23:47,00:23:50,like the old ones were basically buttery
00:23:50,00:23:51,and with herbs and stuff.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"And if you go to Russia and Ukraine,"
00:23:53,00:23:55,that's kind of what you get most of the time.
00:23:55,00:23:57,"Modern ones with garlic in,"
00:23:57,00:24:01,"probably invented by a woman called Cathy Chapman in 1979,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,who was working for Marks & Spencer.
00:24:04,00:24:08,"And this was the first ever chilled, ready meal,"
00:24:08,00:24:09,which she invented.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"And when she invented it,"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"the guy at Marks & Spencer, who was in charge,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,"was like, I don't like garlic,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,so no one else likes garlic.
00:24:17,00:24:18,We're not gonna make them.
00:24:18,00:24:20,"And she was like, no, no, I tell you, tell you,"
00:24:20,00:24:22,like garlic is the next big thing.
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Honestly, it's gonna be huge."
00:24:23,00:24:26,"And within about two years,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,M&S had to set up a whole new factory
00:24:28,00:24:30,just to make chicken kievs.
00:24:30,00:24:32,"- Oh, wow. - Amazing."
00:24:32,00:24:33,- That's so cool. - Rocket.
00:24:33,00:24:38,"- A applause, a applause for that woman who we thought."
00:24:38,00:24:40,"- Can I do one more really quick? - Okay, very quickly."
00:24:40,00:24:42,"- The USA has a secret stock of chicken farms,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,which are guarded.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"And no one is allowed to know where they are,"
00:24:46,00:24:47,apart from the people who work there.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"So this is because they make,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,"they truck them to, again, secret facilities,"
00:24:52,00:24:53,the eggs that are laid there.
00:24:53,00:24:57,"The eggs are cracked open and used to make, any guesses?"
00:24:57,00:24:58,- Omelettes. - Something we've all had for of
00:24:58,00:25:00,in the last year?
00:25:00,00:25:02,- Pandemics. - Pandemics.
00:25:02,00:25:03,"- Vaccines. - Vaccines, thank you."
00:25:03,00:25:04,Thank you for the sensible suggestion.
00:25:04,00:25:06,James.
00:25:06,00:25:09,"Yeah, each egg produces one vaccine."
00:25:09,00:25:10,"They sort of inject the virus,"
00:25:10,00:25:13,"the virus strain they're looking for, into an egg,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"and they incubate it for a few days,"
00:25:15,00:25:17,"and then they harvest the virusy goo,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"and then they kill off the virus,"
00:25:19,00:25:20,and then they use that to make a vaccine.
00:25:20,00:25:24,"And the US government gets through 100 million eggs every year,"
00:25:24,00:25:26,and the farms that lay them are secret.
00:25:26,00:25:29,You're not allowed to know. They're kind of national security.
00:25:29,00:25:30,- Wow. - Egg farms.
00:25:30,00:25:32,What then happens with that egg? Sorry.
00:25:32,00:25:34,- It's done. It's done its job. - It's finished.
00:25:34,00:25:36,It's not cooked.
00:25:36,00:25:39,"It's been used in a very serious, complicated medical prison."
00:25:39,00:25:42,I'm wondering if you could secretly vaccinate a whole country
00:25:42,00:25:43,by just giving them eggs.
00:25:43,00:25:45,- Oh! - Oh!
00:25:45,00:25:48,"And there's your Dan Brown novel, I guess."
00:25:48,00:25:51,[laughter]
00:25:51,00:25:56,[upbeat music]
00:25:56,00:25:58,"Okay, I do need to move us on to our next fact."
00:25:58,00:26:02,"It is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:26:02,00:26:05,"Okay, my fact this week is that in the 18th century,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,a Worcestershire man called John Tallis
00:26:08,00:26:12,stayed in bed for 30 years with a peg on his nose
00:26:12,00:26:15,because he thought fresh air was dangerous.
00:26:15,00:26:16,[laughter]
00:26:16,00:26:19,"- He sounds like a very strange guy. - He is, rather."
00:26:19,00:26:22,"This was a review of a book called ""The Georgians"""
00:26:22,00:26:25,by Penelope J. Corfield.
00:26:25,00:26:29,"And this was a report in a magazine called ""Gentlemen's Magazine"""
00:26:29,00:26:31,and they were talking about this guy who lived
00:26:31,00:26:34,in a place called Burkut near Solihull.
00:26:34,00:26:37,"And throughout this whole time, he didn't see anyone, basically."
00:26:37,00:26:39,He had hardly any visitors.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"Basically, the only people he ever saw were his servants"
00:26:41,00:26:45,who would change his bed once a year.
00:26:45,00:26:47,- Is that... - I'm not sure they were changing
00:26:47,00:26:50,"the bed sheets once a year. - No, they were changing the whole bed."
00:26:50,00:26:52,- I believe it was the whole bed. - That's quite good.
00:26:52,00:26:54,"It was a mixture, so occasionally they would change the sheets."
00:26:54,00:26:57,"So if they changed the sheets, he would roll onto one side of the bed"
00:26:57,00:27:00,"and they would undo it, and then he would roll back onto the other."
00:27:00,00:27:02,"They undo and slip it on, like on those table tricks."
00:27:02,00:27:05,"So he'd go, ""Hula!"" And nothing leaves, right?"
00:27:05,00:27:08,"And then the other thing was, if they were changing the full bed,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,they would wheel in another bed and he would sort of tumble
00:27:10,00:27:14,into the new bed and then they would remove the old bed.
00:27:14,00:27:17,- Were they making the call based on how disgusting the bed was?
00:27:17,00:27:19,"Was it, like, on the 1st of January, we're going to come round,"
00:27:19,00:27:21,are we going to see if you just need a change of sheets
00:27:21,00:27:23,or if it's a full new bed that you need again? Was it that?
00:27:23,00:27:26,"Probably once a year for the full bed, and then incremental changes?"
00:27:26,00:27:29,"- I think that's right, yeah. - You can estimate how gross it's going to be"
00:27:29,00:27:30,without fully checking it.
00:27:30,00:27:34,"- After 20 years, I imagine you'll have some data to work with, yeah."
00:27:34,00:27:36,"- If you've got a spreadsheet. - Yeah, exactly."
00:27:36,00:27:38,- So why did he refuse to get out of bed?
00:27:38,00:27:40,"The fresh air thing, fine, he doesn't want to go outside,"
00:27:40,00:27:43,"but I just, like, stand up and let them take the sheets off."
00:27:43,00:27:44,"- Is that just... - I guess so, yeah."
00:27:44,00:27:47,"- Well, I mean, it's lazy. - He's been in bed for a while."
00:27:47,00:27:49,"- It's hard to get out of bed, isn't it? - I know, I've been there."
00:27:49,00:27:52,"- He didn't want his... Like, he didn't want any fresh air in the room,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"so he had, like, just one window in the room with glass,"
00:27:54,00:27:58,which was three times thicker than any other glass you could get at that time.
00:27:58,00:28:00,I think just three panes.
00:28:00,00:28:04,And his head was covered in more than 100 yards of flannel.
00:28:04,00:28:06,- 100 yards? - What?
00:28:06,00:28:07,"- Yeah, no. - And it, like, a mummy?"
00:28:07,00:28:08,Like this.
00:28:08,00:28:12,- They said it was as large as a large beehive.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"- Wow. - Oh, thank you so much for that."
00:28:14,00:28:17,- That really puts it into context for me. - That was the quote from the day.
00:28:17,00:28:19,- No wonder he didn't leave the room. He wouldn't have been able to fit out the door.
00:28:19,00:28:22,- 100... - Exactly. - A massive beehive on his head.
00:28:22,00:28:24,- I know why he was in bed. - Why?
00:28:24,00:28:27,- He was cursed by a woman. - Oh.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"- Yeah, so he was... - Classic."
00:28:30,00:28:33,You've made it sound quite sexy being...
00:28:33,00:28:36,"- Well, I just think he went to bed. - Cursed by a woman."
00:28:36,00:28:39,"So he caught her stealing part of his fencing,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,and he ordered her to put it down.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"He said, ""Put those sticks down."""
00:28:43,00:28:45,"And she said, ""A curse on you."""
00:28:45,00:28:50,And she condemned him to remain cold and to never feel the warmth of a fire.
00:28:50,00:28:53,"And that's what happened, because he made it happen."
00:28:53,00:28:56,- So did he say he thought that's why he was in this situation?
00:28:56,00:28:59,"- Well, that's the story. I mean, there's a lot of story in the story."
00:28:59,00:29:01,"- Oh, but that's not his story. - Sorry."
00:29:01,00:29:03,- That's not his story as to why he was in bed.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"He wasn't like, ""I've been cursed by this woman."""
00:29:05,00:29:06,"- Oh, that's his story. - That was his story."
00:29:06,00:29:09,"- I've been cursed. Yeah, yeah. - Oh, okay."
00:29:09,00:29:11,- And you're saying you believe him? - Absolutely.
00:29:11,00:29:12,- Okay. - Yeah.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"- Right. - If you believe in a curse, then you have been cursed."
00:29:14,00:29:16,"- Exactly. It's all psychological, if you believe in it."
00:29:16,00:29:18,"- But then it explains what was confusing me,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,which was what was his explanation for the fact that everyone else
00:29:20,00:29:23,"wasn't dropping dead, who was in the outside world."
00:29:23,00:29:25,But was it just him who was going to die at the Fresh Air?
00:29:25,00:29:28,"- Yeah, it's very rarely I curse you on, by the way, everyone else."
00:29:28,00:29:29,- For that? - It takes the thing out of the curse
00:29:29,00:29:31,if it's a universal thing.
00:29:31,00:29:33,"- Well, because James said, ""Because Fresh Air was dangerous,"""
00:29:33,00:29:36,"which it was, but not universally, right?"
00:29:36,00:29:38,It's like if you're allergic to prawns.
00:29:38,00:29:40,Prawns are dangerous. - That's true.
00:29:40,00:29:41,"- You know. - Yeah, yeah."
00:29:41,00:29:43,"- That makes sense. - Well, he must have seen other people"
00:29:43,00:29:44,"who could go outside and get him new beds,"
00:29:44,00:29:47,so it clearly wasn't as dangerous for everybody.
00:29:47,00:29:49,"- Unless the servants were coming in and going,"
00:29:49,00:29:52,"it's still, they're dropping dead outside like flies, yeah?"
00:29:52,00:29:55,- I think there was a rule that they weren't allowed to mention
00:29:55,00:29:57,"what was going on. They couldn't bring up the whole,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,"like, ""Why don't you just come out now?"""
00:29:59,00:30:01,"You know, they just sort of let it happen."
00:30:01,00:30:02,"- Well, no one kind of intervened."
00:30:02,00:30:05,He clearly was suffering from what we call hypochondria now.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"- Yeah, except it was a curse."
00:30:07,00:30:09,(laughter)
00:30:09,00:30:11,"- Yeah, but that's probably how he would have rationalised"
00:30:11,00:30:13,his hypochondria at the time.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"Oh, I can't come out, I've been cursed, sorry."
00:30:15,00:30:17,- You've obviously never been cursed.
00:30:17,00:30:18,I feel like it.
00:30:18,00:30:20,"- Supposedly as well, like James, you're a fact saying"
00:30:20,00:30:23,that he had a peg on his nose and there's a few other accounts
00:30:23,00:30:27,"where he would put a cork up each nostril as well,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"which just sounds fun, I think."
00:30:29,00:30:33,"- 'Cause you'd imagine whenever he sneezed, he just went..."
00:30:33,00:30:35,(laughter)
00:30:35,00:30:38,"- Oh, dear. - Yeah."
00:30:38,00:30:40,"Great guy, great guy, John Talis."
00:30:40,00:30:41,- Yeah. - Was he?
00:30:41,00:30:42,- Outside of the curse thing.
00:30:42,00:30:46,"- Just, no, just committing to a curse, you know, kind of."
00:30:46,00:30:47,A lot of us are going to lead lives
00:30:47,00:30:50,that don't get talked about in 100 years from now.
00:30:50,00:30:53,"John Talis, here we are in Aberdeen on stage,"
00:30:53,00:30:56,"talking about a guy, put a peg on his nose."
00:30:56,00:30:58,- Rolled over his... - Beehive on his head.
00:30:58,00:30:59,"- Beehive on his head, large beehive."
00:30:59,00:31:00,- Large beehive.
00:31:00,00:31:02,- I read about a woman from Taunton.
00:31:02,00:31:06,This was supposedly written in the British Medical Journal.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"I couldn't find it in the BMJ,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,but it's written in lots of newspaper reports
00:31:09,00:31:12,where they say it was in the BMJ.
00:31:12,00:31:15,"Anyway, her doctor, Peter Rowe, in 1978,"
00:31:15,00:31:18,said that she stayed in bed for 40 years
00:31:18,00:31:20,because a doctor once told her to not get up
00:31:20,00:31:23,until he came back and he never came back.
00:31:23,00:31:26,"- Oh, no! (laughter)"
00:31:26,00:31:30,"- And was that doctor, like, on his deathbed some years later"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"and just his last words were, ""Oh!"""
00:31:32,00:31:33,(laughter)
00:31:33,00:31:35,- I knew he went back.
00:31:35,00:31:37,- But we all know that feeling
00:31:37,00:31:39,where you commit just a bit too long
00:31:39,00:31:41,"and then you think, ""Well, I can't quit now,"""
00:31:41,00:31:42,and then it just kind of gets a bit ridiculous.
00:31:42,00:31:44,"- Yeah, I've seen you stand up."
00:31:44,00:31:47,"- Yeah, my career is. (laughter)"
00:31:47,00:31:49,"- Speaking of lying in bed for a very long time,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,"this is a different kind of lying in bed for a very long time,"
00:31:51,00:31:54,lying on a bed of nails.
00:31:54,00:31:54,"- Oh, very good."
00:31:54,00:31:57,"- Yeah, so the records are quite interesting."
00:31:57,00:32:02,"The female record for lying on a bed of nails is 30 hours, okay?"
00:32:02,00:32:06,"By a woman called Miranda, Queen of the Fakirs."
00:32:06,00:32:07,- Queen of the Fakirs.
00:32:07,00:32:08,"- Wow, nominative determinism."
00:32:08,00:32:09,(laughter)
00:32:09,00:32:10,- Fakir.
00:32:10,00:32:11,"- Fakir, so?"
00:32:11,00:32:12,- Okay.
00:32:12,00:32:13,"- Kind of, come on."
00:32:13,00:32:14,(laughter)
00:32:14,00:32:15,"Come on, mate."
00:32:15,00:32:16,"There's kind of,"
00:32:16,00:32:18,(laughter)
00:32:18,00:32:22,"kind of far-eastern mystic is a Fakir, you know?"
00:32:22,00:32:22,Yeah.
00:32:22,00:32:23,- Sorry.
00:32:23,00:32:24,- That's all right.
00:32:24,00:32:27,"So anyway, Miranda, Queen of the Fakirs has the,"
00:32:27,00:32:32,"sorry, I'm sorry for telling you off."
00:32:32,00:32:34,(laughter)
00:32:34,00:32:35,I really am.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"So anyway, female record,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"Miranda, Queen of the Fakirs."
00:32:39,00:32:41,"Male record, held by a man called Ken Owen."
00:32:41,00:32:42,And it's just a...
00:32:42,00:32:44,(laughter)
00:32:44,00:32:44,- Ken Owen.
00:32:44,00:32:47,(laughter)
00:32:47,00:32:51,"- But his record is 300 hours, compared with 30."
00:32:51,00:32:53,And it was broken in 1986.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"- I mean, doesn't that just tell you women have things to do?"
00:32:56,00:32:56,(laughter)
00:32:56,00:32:59,"- Well, well, no, no, no, because no, well,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"to be fair to him, Ken was on holiday."
00:33:01,00:33:04,And this was in 1986.
00:33:04,00:33:04,- And it's...
00:33:04,00:33:06,- Someone had taken all of the loungers
00:33:06,00:33:07,"and he's like, ""Oh."""
00:33:07,00:33:08,(laughter)
00:33:08,00:33:11,"- No, so it's written, it's on the Guinness website,"
00:33:11,00:33:14,"but it's not, it's only in newspapers from the time."
00:33:14,00:33:16,"And he was, he traveled across Wales"
00:33:16,00:33:18,"on a fortnight's holiday and wherever he went,"
00:33:18,00:33:20,"he would lie down for, you know, 10 hours at a time."
00:33:20,00:33:21,It was cumulative.
00:33:21,00:33:24,"- Oh, it wasn't icy, it wasn't consecutive."
00:33:24,00:33:26,That is cheating.
00:33:26,00:33:26,"- Yeah, maybe."
00:33:26,00:33:29,"Well, he also, he did other things while he was doing it."
00:33:29,00:33:30,I think it was maybe a martial arts guy.
00:33:30,00:33:33,He had 26 concrete blocks piled on his chest
00:33:33,00:33:34,and then smashed by his friends.
00:33:34,00:33:35,- Okay.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"- It's that while he was lying on the nails, yeah."
00:33:38,00:33:39,They do do that sometimes.
00:33:39,00:33:40,"- Yeah, I think it was, yeah."
00:33:40,00:33:41,"And he said, ""The good news was,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,"the longer you lie on the bed of nails,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,"the more the nails gradually rust due to your sweat."""
00:33:45,00:33:46,So...
00:33:46,00:33:47,"- Oh, what does that do to it?"
00:33:47,00:33:48,- Is that good?
00:33:48,00:33:49,"- He said, ""Well, by the time I finish,"
00:33:49,00:33:52,"my bed should, in theory, feel as flat as a snooker table."""
00:33:52,00:33:53,(laughter)
00:33:53,00:33:57,- So it's just a very long and aware filing down your nails.
00:33:57,00:33:59,Although you don't want to file those kind of nails.
00:33:59,00:34:00,- No.
00:34:00,00:34:01,- I've become confused.
00:34:01,00:34:02,- Yeah.
00:34:02,00:34:03,- Anyway.
00:34:03,00:34:05,- Do you know the person who has been asleep
00:34:05,00:34:06,"for the longest amount of time,"
00:34:06,00:34:10,"according to newspapers at the time,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,was someone who was hypnotised.
00:34:12,00:34:14,So I think asleep under hypnosis.
00:34:14,00:34:16,I was hypnotised by a hypnotist called Peter Powers.
00:34:16,00:34:17,You guys heard of Peter Powers?
00:34:17,00:34:18,"- Oh, yeah."
00:34:18,00:34:20,- I think he was a deal in the 80s and 90s.
00:34:20,00:34:23,He hypnotised a man in a Liverpool shop window.
00:34:23,00:34:24,I don't know if the man asked for it
00:34:24,00:34:26,or if he was just looking for...
00:34:26,00:34:27,- Was that not a man? - Traumaticus.
00:34:27,00:34:29,(laughter)
00:34:29,00:34:30,"- Well, he's still asleep."
00:34:30,00:34:31,(laughter)
00:34:31,00:34:33,"- Well, he doesn't seem to have a head."
00:34:33,00:34:36,(laughter)
00:34:36,00:34:38,- Someone keeps him up with the latest fashion.
00:34:38,00:34:40,(laughter)
00:34:40,00:34:41,Every week.
00:34:41,00:34:43,"- Guys, you've blown it absolutely wide open."
00:34:43,00:34:45,He's a big old cheat.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"No, he slept apparently for eight continuous days."
00:34:48,00:34:49,- Okay.
00:34:49,00:34:52,- Except that he was woken every few hours
00:34:52,00:34:54,to go to the loo and drink water.
00:34:54,00:34:57,But he was woken but was still in a hypnotic state.
00:34:57,00:34:59,So apparently it counts.
00:34:59,00:35:03,But Peter Powers recorded a tape of himself
00:35:03,00:35:04,that he gave to the medical team
00:35:04,00:35:06,who were monitoring this bloke all the time.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"That was if saying like,"
00:35:08,00:35:11,"if Peter Powers got killed in a mysterious accident,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,then they were to turn on this tape of him
00:35:13,00:35:15,and it would get him out of his hypnotic state.
00:35:15,00:35:18,Because otherwise he'd be asleep forever.
00:35:18,00:35:19,"- Oh, wow. - Yeah."
00:35:19,00:35:20,- That's sensible.
00:35:20,00:35:21,- It's good health and safety.
00:35:21,00:35:22,- It's responsible hypnotism.
00:35:22,00:35:24,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:35:24,00:35:24,Good on him.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"- The country of Montenegro has a lying down champion,"
00:35:26,00:35:28,"an annual championship in lying down,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,yet to be televised on ESPN.
00:35:30,00:35:31,Big mistake.
00:35:31,00:35:33,I had never heard this before.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"Supposedly there is a widespread national stereotype,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,internal stereotype of laziness in Montenegro.
00:35:38,00:35:39,- Is that right?
00:35:39,00:35:41,- People are very relaxed.
00:35:41,00:35:44,They like to take it easy.
00:35:44,00:35:46,And this year's winner won after 60 hours
00:35:46,00:35:48,"and said, ""I didn't even warm up."""
00:35:48,00:35:51,"And it's, you know,"
00:35:51,00:35:52,lots of foreigners have entered over the years.
00:35:52,00:35:53,It's been going on.
00:35:53,00:35:55,Only Montenegroans have ever won.
00:35:55,00:35:56,So yeah.
00:35:56,00:35:58,"And I found an old Montenegroan joke,"
00:35:58,00:35:58,if you'd like to hear it.
00:35:58,00:36:01,- I'd love to 'cause I got to Montenegro quite a lot.
00:36:01,00:36:02,- Right.
00:36:02,00:36:03,"Well, this is, it can't be that old"
00:36:03,00:36:04,'cause it features Steven Spielberg.
00:36:04,00:36:05,So...
00:36:05,00:36:06,- Yeah.
00:36:06,00:36:07,He's been around a while.
00:36:07,00:36:07,- He's been around a while.
00:36:07,00:36:09,Steven Spielberg's shooting a movie in Montenegro
00:36:09,00:36:10,and he invites a load of locals
00:36:10,00:36:12,"to audition to be extras, right?"
00:36:12,00:36:13,- Yeah.
00:36:13,00:36:14,- And he hires two Montenegroan guys
00:36:14,00:36:16,and he explains to them their task for this movie
00:36:16,00:36:17,is just to lie under a tree.
00:36:17,00:36:19,"It's all you have to do, lie under a tree."
00:36:19,00:36:21,And they work for two days
00:36:21,00:36:22,while they're shooting this scene around them.
00:36:22,00:36:23,- I wonder what movie that was.
00:36:23,00:36:24,- I don't know.
00:36:24,00:36:25,- It would probably be...
00:36:25,00:36:25,- Yeah.
00:36:25,00:36:26,"- Okay, I'm sorry."
00:36:26,00:36:27,(audience laughing)
00:36:27,00:36:29,"- On the third day, Spielberg tells them"
00:36:29,00:36:31,"that for the new scene they're shooting,"
00:36:31,00:36:32,they have to move to another tree.
00:36:32,00:36:33,"And one of the guys replies,"
00:36:33,00:36:36,"""Mr. Spielberg, we're actors, not stuntmen."""
00:36:36,00:36:38,(audience laughing)
00:36:38,00:36:40,- That's quite a nice joke.
00:36:40,00:36:40,- It's a good joke.
00:36:40,00:36:41,- Yeah.
00:36:41,00:36:42,- I like it.
00:36:42,00:36:44,"- We're gonna have to move on in a sec, by the way."
00:36:44,00:36:47,Unless you work out what movie that's from.
00:36:47,00:36:48,(audience laughing)
00:36:48,00:36:51,- I've got one more kind of slightly eccentric person
00:36:51,00:36:52,from the 18th century if we have time.
00:36:52,00:36:53,"- Go for it, yeah, yeah."
00:36:53,00:36:55,- This guy called Henry Cope
00:36:55,00:36:58,and he was known as the Green Man of Brighton
00:36:58,00:37:01,because he always dressed in green pantaloons
00:37:01,00:37:05,"with a green waistcoat, a green frock, a green cravat."
00:37:05,00:37:07,He dyed his hair green and his whiskers
00:37:07,00:37:09,and his eyebrows green.
00:37:09,00:37:13,"He would always eat nothing but green food,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,green fruits and green vegetables.
00:37:15,00:37:17,He had his apartment painted green
00:37:17,00:37:19,"and he had it furnished with a green sofa,"
00:37:19,00:37:24,"green chairs, green table, a green bed and green curtains."
00:37:24,00:37:27,He always walked around with a green silk handkerchief
00:37:27,00:37:29,and he had green buttons on his coat
00:37:29,00:37:32,and he walked around also with a green poodle.
00:37:32,00:37:35,- I'm waiting for you to say his shoes were always red.
00:37:35,00:37:37,(audience laughing)
00:37:37,00:37:40,"- There's no line there, I guess."
00:37:40,00:37:42,Apart from maybe like Eiffel 65 or colorblind
00:37:42,00:37:44,"and they were right about this guy, I don't know."
00:37:44,00:37:48,But apparently he'd lost his wits over love
00:37:48,00:37:51,for a beautiful woman and decided to wear green forever.
00:37:51,00:37:52,- Right.
00:37:52,00:37:52,- That'll get her back.
00:37:52,00:37:54,(audience laughing)
00:37:54,00:37:56,"- How's a woman, trust me."
00:37:56,00:38:00,"- Every time he passes, ""Ah, the one I let go."""
00:38:00,00:38:04,"- Meanwhile, she's looking out of her window at her field,"
00:38:04,00:38:05,can't see him at all.
00:38:05,00:38:06,(audience laughing)
00:38:06,00:38:09,Doesn't realize he's passing.
00:38:09,00:38:11,"- If only he'd come to see me once, I'd marry him."
00:38:11,00:38:14,(upbeat music)
00:38:14,00:38:20,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:38:20,00:38:21,and that is my fact.
00:38:21,00:38:26,"My fact this week is that according to Cameroonian folklore,"
00:38:26,00:38:29,the best way to beat a chimpanzee in a fight
00:38:29,00:38:32,is to pretend to stab yourself with your weapon
00:38:32,00:38:33,and then throw it at them.
00:38:33,00:38:36,The chimpanzee will then imitate what you did
00:38:36,00:38:38,and fatally stab itself.
00:38:38,00:38:40,(audience laughing)
00:38:40,00:38:41,Fight over.
00:38:41,00:38:45,"So as I say, this is folklore."
00:38:45,00:38:47,I found this in an academic book
00:38:47,00:38:49,"called ""Primates of Geshakar"""
00:38:49,00:38:51,and it was edited by someone
00:38:51,00:38:53,that I've worked with in the past.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"So has James, a primatologist called Volka Sumer."
00:38:56,00:38:59,And the idea is that the mimicry abilities
00:38:59,00:39:02,of the chimpanzee is such that they will think
00:39:02,00:39:04,that that's part of how the processes
00:39:04,00:39:05,of chucking these things back.
00:39:05,00:39:08,So they were finding that when they were throwing
00:39:08,00:39:09,"these spears at chimpanzees,"
00:39:09,00:39:12,"which was their chosen weapon to kill them,"
00:39:12,00:39:14,they would imitate it and pick it back
00:39:14,00:39:15,and people could get hurt.
00:39:15,00:39:17,So the hunter would be hunted
00:39:17,00:39:18,by the spear being thrown back.
00:39:18,00:39:20,So they introduced this idea.
00:39:20,00:39:22,What if we pretended to stab ourselves
00:39:22,00:39:25,and that hence is what happened with the chimpanzees?
00:39:25,00:39:28,- But presumably they didn't actually do it.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"- Well, it's folklore."
00:39:29,00:39:31,"So it's sort of like, it's told as if it did happen,"
00:39:31,00:39:33,but I don't think there's any actual evidence.
00:39:33,00:39:34,- It will be based presumably on the cliche
00:39:34,00:39:36,that they are good mimics and so--
00:39:36,00:39:37,"- Like the monkey people, right?"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:39:39,00:39:41,"- Volka Sumer, have we ever mentioned him before?"
00:39:41,00:39:43,- I don't think we have.
00:39:43,00:39:43,"- Correct me if I'm wrong,"
00:39:43,00:39:44,"'cause I'm going off memory,"
00:39:44,00:39:46,but I think his main thing was
00:39:46,00:39:51,they wanted to know how many ants some apes were eating
00:39:51,00:39:53,"and they didn't know how many they'd been eating,"
00:39:53,00:39:55,but the only bit of evidence they had
00:39:55,00:39:56,was looking through the feces
00:39:56,00:40:00,"and seeing how many like bits of dead ant the were, right?"
00:40:00,00:40:02,But that doesn't really tell you
00:40:02,00:40:05,how much has kind of been absorbed into the body.
00:40:05,00:40:07,And so he got all of his research students
00:40:07,00:40:11,to eat a load of ants and then save their poo.
00:40:11,00:40:14,And then they all had to check through all of their poos
00:40:14,00:40:16,to see how many bits of ants came out
00:40:16,00:40:19,because we have a similar digestion system to the apes
00:40:19,00:40:20,and that would be able to tell us
00:40:20,00:40:22,how many ants were eaten by the ants.
00:40:22,00:40:25,"- So you'd eat the ant, it would just be the head"
00:40:25,00:40:28,"and it was roughly, for every 10 ants,"
00:40:28,00:40:30,one ant head would come out is what he found.
00:40:30,00:40:31,"And it was a cultural thing,"
00:40:31,00:40:34,it was like the group that identified by this one thing.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"- Oh, like it was one group of--"
00:40:36,00:40:37,"- It's a cultural marker, basically."
00:40:37,00:40:38,"- It's a cultural marker, exactly."
00:40:38,00:40:39,- Yeah.
00:40:39,00:40:41,"- They're very nice guys, chimpanzees."
00:40:41,00:40:43,"Most of the time, yes, you're giving me a funny look"
00:40:43,00:40:45,'cause they also do have quite high murder rates.
00:40:45,00:40:47,(laughing)
00:40:47,00:40:51,But I think their murder rate is the same as Tijuana
00:40:51,00:40:55,"in the center of the drug wars in Mexico,"
00:40:55,00:40:58,which I know doesn't reflect very well on them.
00:40:58,00:40:59,They are the only other species aside from humans
00:40:59,00:41:01,"who sort of plot to kill each other,"
00:41:01,00:41:04,but they generally avoid it
00:41:04,00:41:07,and they are really good in other ways.
00:41:07,00:41:10,"So for instance, they're much fairer than human beings."
00:41:10,00:41:12,Not like Snow White is the fairest of them all.
00:41:12,00:41:16,"Like they have inequity aversion, they hate unfairness."
00:41:16,00:41:17,- Oh really?
00:41:17,00:41:19,- So there are various studies
00:41:19,00:41:20,that have been done with other monkeys
00:41:20,00:41:23,where like if you give one monkey a grape
00:41:23,00:41:26,"and then you give another monkey a bit of lettuce,"
00:41:26,00:41:30,then the monkey with the lettuce stops eating it really soon
00:41:30,00:41:32,because they're too jealous of the guy with the grape.
00:41:32,00:41:35,"Even though if they hadn't seen the bloat with the grape,"
00:41:35,00:41:36,they would have eaten the lettuce very happily.
00:41:36,00:41:38,So that happens with monkeys and other animals
00:41:38,00:41:40,'cause they've got a real sense of fairness like we have.
00:41:40,00:41:42,"Like that's so unfair, how come he gets a grape?"
00:41:42,00:41:45,But chimps do it on behalf of each other.
00:41:45,00:41:49,So there've been experiments where if you give one chimp a grape
00:41:49,00:41:51,"but you don't give her friend a grape,"
00:41:51,00:41:53,then she won't eat that grape
00:41:53,00:41:54,until her mate's been given one.
00:41:54,00:41:55,- They're unionized.
00:41:55,00:41:57,(laughing)
00:41:57,00:41:58,"- Yeah, people are really--"
00:41:58,00:41:59,"- That's amazing, that's really cool."
00:41:59,00:42:02,"- I mean, chimps research was so controversial."
00:42:02,00:42:04,"- I mean, if you gave me and Dan a grape."
00:42:04,00:42:05,- I know.
00:42:05,00:42:07,"- Sorry, if you gave me a grape and not Dan,"
00:42:07,00:42:08,there would soon be no grapes around
00:42:08,00:42:10,where I'd just quickly eat the grape and hope
00:42:10,00:42:12,Dan hadn't noticed that I'd be given a grape.
00:42:12,00:42:13,- You're less evolved than a chimp.
00:42:13,00:42:14,- Apparently so.
00:42:14,00:42:15,(laughing)
00:42:15,00:42:18,"- That is, like that was at Franz de Valle says,"
00:42:18,00:42:20,"""They're more fair than us, certainly than you,"
00:42:20,00:42:21,"""but even than all of us."""
00:42:21,00:42:23,"And actually he was saying when this was so controversial,"
00:42:23,00:42:26,"this was coming out, the idea in the late 20th century"
00:42:26,00:42:28,that all these human traits actually existed
00:42:28,00:42:29,in chimps as well.
00:42:29,00:42:31,And Franz de Valle said that when they came up
00:42:31,00:42:34,with the conclusion that chimps have this innate sense
00:42:34,00:42:36,"of fairness, a philosopher wrote to him saying,"
00:42:36,00:42:38,"""It's completely impossible that any animal"
00:42:38,00:42:40,"""has a sense of fairness because fairness was invented"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"""in the French Revolution."""
00:42:42,00:42:44,(laughing)
00:42:44,00:42:50,"- Franz de Valle, he was like, he's one of the main writers"
00:42:50,00:42:53,"on chimps and bonobos as well, right?"
00:42:53,00:42:57,And I read some of his writings on both of those things.
00:42:57,00:42:59,And he was writing about a zookeeper
00:42:59,00:43:00,who'd worked with chimpanzees.
00:43:00,00:43:03,And then he started working with bonobos.
00:43:03,00:43:04,"And bonobos, I don't know if you know,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,"I think they're our closest relatives, right?"
00:43:06,00:43:09,They're very sexual animals.
00:43:09,00:43:13,"They are very touchy-feely, all that kind of stuff."
00:43:13,00:43:15,This zookeeper had only worked with chimps before.
00:43:15,00:43:18,And so he went up to this bonobo for the first time
00:43:18,00:43:19,and went to give him a little kiss.
00:43:19,00:43:22,And the bonobo stuck his tongue down his throat.
00:43:22,00:43:24,(laughing)
00:43:24,00:43:26,- That's amazing.
00:43:26,00:43:29,- And it turns out they French kiss bonobos.
00:43:29,00:43:30,"- Oh, really?"
00:43:30,00:43:32,They French kiss humans?
00:43:32,00:43:33,"- Well, generally each other,"
00:43:33,00:43:35,but if you get close enough.
00:43:35,00:43:36,- Wow.
00:43:36,00:43:37,- Un-fussy.
00:43:37,00:43:38,- What a good fact.
00:43:38,00:43:39,- That's so good.
00:43:39,00:43:40,- That was also controversial.
00:43:40,00:43:43,"'Cause people, again, Franz de Waal was saying,"
00:43:43,00:43:44,when the whole thing that bonobos--
00:43:44,00:43:46,- Stocking was invented by the French
00:43:46,00:43:48,during the French Revolution.
00:43:48,00:43:50,That's why we call it the French Kiss.
00:43:50,00:43:51,- Yes.
00:43:51,00:43:53,- There was this big thing came out that bonobos
00:43:53,00:43:55,"are just rampantly shagging all the time,"
00:43:55,00:43:58,"like regardless of gender, practically species."
00:43:58,00:44:00,And Franz de Waal wanted to publish
00:44:00,00:44:02,his big coffee table book on it.
00:44:02,00:44:03,And it wouldn't get published
00:44:03,00:44:05,by National Geographic in America.
00:44:05,00:44:06,I think this was in the '70s or the '80s.
00:44:06,00:44:08,Because basically it was too rude.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"And they said, ""This is too raunchy."""
00:44:10,00:44:13,"And so he had to go to Germany to get it published,"
00:44:13,00:44:16,"where, obviously, they said, ""Please!"""
00:44:16,00:44:17,- That's very funny.
00:44:17,00:44:18,- And they put a picture of shagging bonobos
00:44:18,00:44:19,on the front cover.
00:44:19,00:44:20,- That's so cool.
00:44:20,00:44:21,"- As part of this research of this fact,"
00:44:21,00:44:23,I was Googling chimpanzees.
00:44:23,00:44:24,- Makes sense.
00:44:24,00:44:25,- Yeah.
00:44:25,00:44:26,- It checks out.
00:44:26,00:44:28,But I Googled chimpanzees.
00:44:28,00:44:31,"And you know, it quickly comes up with"
00:44:31,00:44:33,people also ask on Google.
00:44:33,00:44:34,"- Okay, yeah."
00:44:34,00:44:36,"- And I hadn't been searching for anything,"
00:44:36,00:44:38,any unusual terms or anything like that.
00:44:38,00:44:39,- Sure you weren't.
00:44:39,00:44:41,- It was like chimpanzee rituals
00:44:41,00:44:42,or whatever I'd searched for.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"Anyway, one of the main,"
00:44:44,00:44:46,"like this presented it to,"
00:44:46,00:44:46,"I can't stress,"
00:44:46,00:44:51,I hadn't done anything to deserve this suggestion from Google.
00:44:51,00:44:54,"One of the main questions for Google on chimpanzees,"
00:44:54,00:44:55,"people also ask,"
00:44:55,00:45:00,"""What happens if human sperm gets in a chimpanzee?"
00:45:00,00:45:02,"""Get in."""
00:45:02,00:45:03,- Yes.
00:45:03,00:45:07,"- Sorry, you know when you let me your computer last week."
00:45:07,00:45:07,"- That's what genuinely,"
00:45:07,00:45:10,I was very shocked that that came up.
00:45:10,00:45:11,"- Well, it's a big question."
00:45:11,00:45:12,- It's not a big question.
00:45:12,00:45:13,- It is.
00:45:13,00:45:15,Is there possible to have a hybrid species
00:45:15,00:45:18,between like a lot of people?
00:45:18,00:45:20,(audience laughing)
00:45:20,00:45:21,"- There was that Soviet guy,"
00:45:21,00:45:22,wasn't there?
00:45:22,00:45:23,We probably mentioned him before.
00:45:23,00:45:23,- Yeah.
00:45:23,00:45:25,- He tried to sort of do a hybrid between.
00:45:25,00:45:27,"- A humanzi, it's called."
00:45:27,00:45:29,"- Well, I think we have solved the mystery"
00:45:29,00:45:32,of why your computer was defaulting to that.
00:45:32,00:45:34,I think you've got to stop learning it to Dan.
00:45:34,00:45:35,- What was the answer though?
00:45:35,00:45:36,- I didn't click on it.
00:45:36,00:45:39,"- Oh, you, you wimp."
00:45:39,00:45:40,- What are you...
00:45:40,00:45:42,(audience laughing)
00:45:42,00:45:42,- A humanzi.
00:45:42,00:45:44,- Call yourself a researcher.
00:45:44,00:45:45,- I don't like humanzi.
00:45:45,00:45:46,- You don't like it?
00:45:46,00:45:47,- I go with chump.
00:45:47,00:45:48,(audience laughing)
00:45:48,00:45:49,- Nice.
00:45:49,00:45:51,- The harm of human and the chump of chump.
00:45:51,00:45:52,"- That's, yeah, I actually worked that out."
00:45:52,00:45:53,What do you say?
00:45:53,00:45:55,(audience laughing)
00:45:55,00:45:56,- But they make nests.
00:45:56,00:45:59,This is a thing that should be more spoken about.
00:45:59,00:46:00,They make nests every night.
00:46:00,00:46:01,- Yeah.
00:46:01,00:46:01,- Birds make nests.
00:46:01,00:46:02,I don't think of any other animals
00:46:02,00:46:04,that make nests apart from birds.
00:46:04,00:46:05,- That's what the thought is.
00:46:05,00:46:06,That's how we got pubic lice.
00:46:06,00:46:10,Is through sleeping in the nests
00:46:10,00:46:12,of gorillas and chimpanzees and so on.
00:46:12,00:46:13,- Wasps.
00:46:13,00:46:14,Sorry.
00:46:14,00:46:16,Wasps make nests.
00:46:16,00:46:17,- Ah.
00:46:17,00:46:18,- Wasps make nests.
00:46:18,00:46:19,Great one.
00:46:19,00:46:20,"Birds, bees. - Sorry, Dan."
00:46:20,00:46:20,"- Sorry, someone said."
00:46:20,00:46:21,- Bees.
00:46:21,00:46:22,- Bees don't make nests.
00:46:22,00:46:23,- I work with them beehive.
00:46:23,00:46:24,- Bees don't make nests.
00:46:24,00:46:25,"- Yeah, some of them do, I reckon."
00:46:25,00:46:26,- Some do.
00:46:26,00:46:28,"- Oh, some solitary bees, yeah."
00:46:28,00:46:28,"Yeah, yeah."
00:46:28,00:46:30,"- Actually, the vast majority of bees are solitary."
00:46:30,00:46:31,"- Right, the vast majority of bees."
00:46:31,00:46:34,"- Wasps, birds, and chimpanzees."
00:46:34,00:46:36,It's still interesting.
00:46:36,00:46:37,"But they, so this is the interesting thing."
00:46:37,00:46:39,"Their beds are extremely clean,"
00:46:39,00:46:41,and they also reuse them.
00:46:41,00:46:42,This is amazing.
00:46:42,00:46:43,"As they travel, 'cause they're often moving,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,they make new beds every night.
00:46:45,00:46:48,"They will reuse their beds within six months,"
00:46:48,00:46:50,and they will leave the foundations in place
00:46:50,00:46:52,to build on when they return.
00:46:52,00:46:52,- Face mark.
00:46:52,00:46:54,"And yet, pubic lice, Dan."
00:46:54,00:46:57,"- We get, no, because they also poo in their beds,"
00:46:57,00:46:59,which is part of the reason that they move around.
00:46:59,00:47:01,So they use it as a toilet.
00:47:01,00:47:02,So why would you sleep in your toilet
00:47:02,00:47:03,after you've used it?
00:47:03,00:47:06,So they migrate every day.
00:47:06,00:47:07,- Very slow learners.
00:47:07,00:47:10,"Just every morning, ""Oh, fuck, I pooed in my bed again."
00:47:10,00:47:12,"""I'm gonna have to move."""
00:47:12,00:47:14,"- Get the servants to wheel it, a new one."
00:47:14,00:47:16,"Yeah, over you go."
00:47:16,00:47:21,"- But yeah, and then, so, early human, early man,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,I don't even know if necessarily it was the point
00:47:23,00:47:26,where we were necessarily homo sapien.
00:47:26,00:47:29,"It was proto man, let's say, would see these empty nests"
00:47:29,00:47:31,"and go, ""Great, I've got a bed for the night."""
00:47:31,00:47:33,So we would sort of be walking behind the chimps
00:47:33,00:47:36,and gorillas to find bedding for the evening.
00:47:36,00:47:39,"And little bits of pubic lice would be hanging around in there,"
00:47:39,00:47:40,and that's where we'd catch them from.
00:47:40,00:47:41,- Wow.
00:47:41,00:47:42,"- So that's what you Google,"
00:47:42,00:47:44,how do people get pubic lice?
00:47:44,00:47:45,- Yeah.
00:47:45,00:47:47,"- Great news, darling."
00:47:47,00:47:52,"- Unfortunately, a little bit of sperm did get in."
00:47:52,00:47:53,"- Oh, God."
00:47:59,00:48:01,"- The show of voices, Aberdeen,"
00:48:01,00:48:04,how many people think they could beat a chimpanzee in a fight?
00:48:04,00:48:07,- Let's do it.
00:48:07,00:48:10,"- Well, the stereotypes of Scotland is not what I thought."
00:48:10,00:48:12,(laughing)
00:48:12,00:48:16,"- That's class go. - Class go, yeah."
00:48:16,00:48:18,"- We're going there tomorrow, I think,"
00:48:18,00:48:20,and we'll tell them you said that.
00:48:20,00:48:22,(laughing)
00:48:22,00:48:25,- There was a famous study that we've actually mentioned
00:48:25,00:48:28,"once or twice, and they found that 38% of men thought"
00:48:28,00:48:30,that they could beat a chimpanzee in a fight.
00:48:30,00:48:31,- 38!
00:48:31,00:48:34,- Now there was some studies done in the 1920s
00:48:34,00:48:36,"about how strong chimpanzees are,"
00:48:36,00:48:39,"and they found one chimpanzee called Suzette,"
00:48:39,00:48:44,"who could do a one-handed pull of 1,260 pounds."
00:48:44,00:48:45,- Wow.
00:48:45,00:48:48,"- Okay, it was during a fit of passion,"
00:48:48,00:48:50,"so it wasn't normally how she would do it,"
00:48:50,00:48:52,"but they kind of, they gave them things to pull"
00:48:52,00:48:53,and they did that.
00:48:53,00:48:56,"Now, there is a very recent study from this year"
00:48:56,00:48:57,"that has looked at all those old ones,"
00:48:57,00:49:00,and reckon that they were properly exaggerated.
00:49:00,00:49:03,"And actually, chimpanzees aren't as strong as we think."
00:49:03,00:49:05,"They're actually much closer to humans,"
00:49:05,00:49:08,and they reckon that the average chimpanzee
00:49:08,00:49:13,has a differential of about 1.5 times the average human.
00:49:13,00:49:14,And so if you actually plot those graphs
00:49:14,00:49:18,"of the stronger humans and the weaker chimpanzees,"
00:49:18,00:49:20,"actually, it's not much."
00:49:20,00:49:23,It's like in the 20% or 20 or 30%.
00:49:23,00:49:27,"So actually, 38% of men saying that could actually be right."
00:49:27,00:49:27,- Really?
00:49:27,00:49:29,"- That's incredible, wow."
00:49:29,00:49:33,"But chimpanzees will sort of just rip your ear off,"
00:49:33,00:49:35,as in they don't fight nice.
00:49:35,00:49:38,"I don't think even if I was stronger than a chimpanzee,"
00:49:38,00:49:40,"which I'm definitely not saying I am,"
00:49:40,00:49:43,"I would be willing to go for the, go for it."
00:49:43,00:49:44,"- Yeah, well, that's true."
00:49:44,00:49:47,I suppose they might fight in a different way than us.
00:49:47,00:49:48,"- Would you, your tactic would be just complaining"
00:49:48,00:49:50,to the umpire constantly.
00:49:50,00:49:51,(laughing)
00:49:51,00:49:52,"- Breath, breath."
00:49:52,00:49:53,"The ear thing, come on."
00:49:53,00:49:56,- Andy wins with a technicality collector ripped off.
00:49:56,00:49:59,- Queensbury rules are not being observed here.
00:49:59,00:50:00,(laughing)
00:50:00,00:50:02,"We're gonna have to wrap up in a sec, guys."
00:50:02,00:50:05,"- Well, did you know that chimps drink responsibly?"
00:50:05,00:50:05,- Cool.
00:50:05,00:50:10,"- Yeah, they do drink, but never to excess."
00:50:10,00:50:12,- And it's mostly PG tips.
00:50:12,00:50:15,(laughing)
00:50:15,00:50:17,"- This was, they found this out in Guinea,"
00:50:17,00:50:19,'cause humans harvest us.
00:50:19,00:50:22,We harvest and ferment stuff from trees
00:50:22,00:50:25,and they were harvesting sugary sap from raffia palms
00:50:25,00:50:26,and fermenting it.
00:50:26,00:50:28,"And they found that when they allowed it to ferment,"
00:50:28,00:50:31,they'd leave it in little cups jammed into the tree.
00:50:31,00:50:33,Then chimps would come and they'd fold up leaves
00:50:33,00:50:35,"and they'd dip them in, use them as sponges,"
00:50:35,00:50:36,and then they'd drink it.
00:50:36,00:50:37,"But in their drinking sessions,"
00:50:37,00:50:39,"they would dip about nine times,"
00:50:39,00:50:43,which would amount to a beer of about 3.1% alcohol.
00:50:43,00:50:44,(laughing)
00:50:44,00:50:45,- And then they'd stop.
00:50:45,00:50:46,- And then they've had enough.
00:50:46,00:50:47,"That's it, home from the pub."
00:50:47,00:50:49,"- Well, it means they can drive back, doesn't it?"
00:50:49,00:50:51,(laughing)
00:50:51,00:50:55,- I was reading about a chimp from Aberdeen.
00:50:55,00:50:56,- Oh.
00:50:56,00:50:58,"- Yeah, you guys know Hazelhead Park?"
00:50:58,00:51:00,- Yes.
00:51:00,00:51:01,- They sure do.
00:51:01,00:51:03,"That means, at least I got the right Aberdeen."
00:51:03,00:51:05,(laughing)
00:51:05,00:51:09,"Otherwise, I don't know where this would have gone."
00:51:09,00:51:11,"But in the '60s and '70s,"
00:51:11,00:51:13,you had a zoo in Hazelhead Park.
00:51:13,00:51:14,It's not there anymore.
00:51:14,00:51:17,And they had a chimp called Humphrey.
00:51:17,00:51:19,"And while they were building the zoo,"
00:51:19,00:51:21,Humphrey lived with one of the owners
00:51:21,00:51:24,or one of the people who was kind of paying for it.
00:51:24,00:51:28,And they kept him in a nappy so that he didn't poo everywhere.
00:51:28,00:51:29,And then one day they went out
00:51:29,00:51:32,"and they kept him in like a cage, a large cage,"
00:51:32,00:51:33,but they kept him in a cage.
00:51:33,00:51:35,And he managed to break out of the cage.
00:51:35,00:51:38,"And they found him, he'd broken into the larder,"
00:51:38,00:51:40,and they found him in an easy chair
00:51:40,00:51:41,with a lump of cake in one hand
00:51:41,00:51:43,and a chocolate biscuit in the other.
00:51:43,00:51:45,(laughing)
00:51:45,00:51:52,(upbeat music)
