00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.360
 Hi everyone, welcome to the Noticed Thing As A Fish

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.240
 Breakfast Club, a little bit of bonus material

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.800
 for you club fish members.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.440
 Now, if you haven't listened to part one of this,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.320
 then I would advise you to go back two weeks

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.200
 and listen to that because we will reference

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.360
 a few things from there in this section.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.760
 But basically, this is the New Zealand leg

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.080
 of the Breakfast Club, where I am chatting the breeze

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.200
 with two new co-hosts, and hopefully by the end of it,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.360
 I'll work out who was the perfect person

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.160
 to share my breakfast with.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.320
 Really hope you enjoy it.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 We'll be back in a couple of weeks time

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200
 with a new bit of bonus material.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 I think it will probably be a drop as a line,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.360
 so we'll be back to the normal way

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.640
 because we'll be back in the UK.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.680
 In the meantime, all that's left to say

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 is on with the bonus material.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.260
 (upbeat music)

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.280
 (upbeat music)

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:05.580
 - Okay, we're recording.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.340
 Welcome to Anna and James's Breakfast Club.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.940
 Welcome back, in fact, because this is a new phase

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.100
 of the notice thing as a fish trip.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.660
 We've been in Australia.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.500
 - Yes.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.340
 - We're now in New Zealand.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.180
 - Yes.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.380
 - And I thought we would turn over a new leaf

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.700
 for the Breakfast Club because I've had some creative

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.100
 differences with my two other co-hosts,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.740
 Dad and Andy.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.660
 And yeah, it just wasn't really working out.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.180
 And the thing is, Anna, 'cause we have our other podcast.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.780
 I thought it wasn't really fair for us

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.740
 to do the Breakfast Club,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.660
 even though I knew it would be best this way.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.500
 - Oh, that's why.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 'Cause I thought I must have missed the mail.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.980
 I missed the post, the letter that requested my presence.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.220
 - No, there was full disclosure.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.900
 Honestly, I didn't ask you first,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.180
 but it was only because, do you remember the times

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.580
 we did a review of our podcast

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.180
 and said we had such great chemistry?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.020
 - Yeah.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 - I thought maybe the chemistry would be too good.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.860
 - Yeah.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.100
 No, no, you don't want to overdo it.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.940
 - Yeah.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.060
 - Yeah, get a big reaction and explosion.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.900
 - Yeah, I know.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.820
 So, and especially this early in the morning,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.660
 who needs that?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.060
 - Oh, God, I feel it already, the sparks.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.900
 Wow.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.740
 - That's why.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.560
 - That's why.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 - Oh, that's why.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.940
 - So what we do is we review our breakfast.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.780
 - Right.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.820
 - That's ostensibly the idea.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.460
 But, like all the best formats,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.300
 but not enough like them,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.860
 that there's any plagiarism issues,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.580
 we're going to talk about the breakfast,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.020
 but really we're going to talk about

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.380
 what's going on in our lives.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.780
 - Oh, it's like desert island discs.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.460
 You're going to get to the heart of me.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.700
 - It's very similar to that,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.700
 but with at least four or five different

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.060
 format point differences.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.300
 - I see, I see.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.900
 - Well, I end up in tears at any point.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900
 Is it sort of like you're going to be dredging up

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.980
 some childhood trauma that I'd rather you didn't?

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.220
 - We won't be doing that,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.060
 but depending on how good your omelet is.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.060
 - Tears of joy.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.020
 If it's cheesy enough, I might cry with joy.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.060
 - Okay, so first of all,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.500
 we are in New Zealand.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.940
 Have you found the tour so far?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.460
 We've been here for, what, almost two weeks?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.300
 - Yeah.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.980
 You know what, it's been surprisingly good fun.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.820
 - Yeah.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.180
 - Oh, it's been absolutely charming to spend time

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.020
 with my three best friends.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.100
 - Oh, that's so nice.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.140
 - Oh, you talked about people who you met in Melbourne.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.540
 - Yeah, just these lads in a bar the other night.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.660
 They were really fond of this.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.500
 - No, it's been good.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.660
 Australasia is a fun place to be, isn't it?

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.820
 The audiences are, they're up for it

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.020
 because they're in a far flung bit of the world

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.100
 that doesn't get a lot of action a lot of the time.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.740
 And suddenly they've been descended on by,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.420
 and it's not just us, we're the headlines,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.420
 but our warm-ups were Coldplay was before us,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.220
 Stephen Fry came just before us.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.060
 - Yeah.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.380
 - Who's Eric Idle's there, isn't he?

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.300
 - Eric Idle, they're getting an M-Fox.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.060
 - Yeah.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.180
 - And we're the Amusebouche,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.220
 although actually we found that we're following Stephen around

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.300
 and Coldplay are following us around.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.500
 - So we're the main course?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.540
 - Yeah, oh yeah, that's a good way of looking at it.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.060
 - Coldplay the cheese course.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.580
 - Unbelievably apt.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.340
 - Yeah.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.500
 - And Stephen is someone ordering 12 starters

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.180
 whether everyone else is on the ordered one.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.540
 So here's something, you know,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.020
 this will blow your mind actually.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.660
 - Do you know the book "Harry McClary from Donaldson's Dairy"

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.660
 by Lindley Dodd?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.340
 - I'm very familiar with it, yeah.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.460
 - Well, Lindley Dodd is from New Zealand,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.700
 and where do you think Harry McClary lives?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.020
 - Well, he lives in Donaldson's Dairy.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.020
 - He does, that's where he's from.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.860
 - I'm a cow.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.180
 - Famously from there.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.140
 But what do you think happens in that dairy?

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.940
 - Well, he gets his little paws out

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.460
 and he milks those udders, those cow's udders,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.340
 for all he's worth.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.420
 - Well, would you believe it that in New Zealand,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.100
 that's not what a dairy is?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.140
 A dairy is a corner shop.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.340
 And so Harry McClary is from a corner shop.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.660
 - What?

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.980
 He's just a local off-licensed dog.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.980
 - He's living off discarded crunchy wrappers.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.060
 - It makes so much sense actually,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.660
 because there's actually not that many

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.340
 like big open wild country field scenes in Harry McClary

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.140
 that you'd expect if you're in a dairy.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.460
 It does seem to happen in a bit of an urban area

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.300
 a lot of the time.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.020
 - It happens in a little town, doesn't it?

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.860
 - Yeah.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.180
 - So, yeah.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.020
 - That's huge.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.860
 That's a huge fact.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.860
 - It's quite a big fact, that.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.700
 - Yeah.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.060
 - I was told that by someone I played golf with the other day.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.900
 - Good stuff.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.900
 - We're in Auckland right now.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.940
 So how are you finding Auckland?

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.020
 - Gosh, I'm not gonna lie, James.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.420
 'Cause this is going out after we've left,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.540
 so I can't get lynched.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.940
 But it's not my kind of place.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.620
 But as you know, I don't like a city.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.060
 So, which is difficult with touring,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.100
 'cause there are very few big venues

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.620
 in the middle of nowhere that we can finish.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.460
 Thank you.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.420
 Oh, yum.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.260
 This looks like a good omelet.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.140
 Look at that swimming, cheesy,

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.020
 saucy, creamy inside.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.180
 - The tears are coming.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.020
 - They are.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.860
 - I can feel it.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.740
 - The cheese is welling up.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.740
 So, yeah, I think you're a country kind of girl, really.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.580
 - Yeah.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.980
 - Countryside, small villages, stuff like that.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.260
 If we could go on tour and only play hamlets.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.340
 - Oh, that'd be good, wouldn't it?

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.700
 - Yeah, villages on the 1,000 population.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.540
 Do you think that would be good?

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.460
 - I think that would be the dream.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.460
 Yeah, on mountain sides and beside lakes.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.140
 But, I mean, the reason it's stunning,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.660
 I think the thing that often people forget

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.020
 about Australia and New Zealand is that

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.460
 because so few towns, cities,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.100
 the town cities that there are are very popular.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.260
 - They're humongous, aren't they?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.260
 - Yeah, they're big.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.580
 - 'Cause when we're in Perth,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.700
 here's a little bit of behind the scenes baseball.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.700
 So, whenever we go to a new town,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.340
 Andy gets his phone out

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.220
 and looks at the population on Wikipedia

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.780
 and says, "We all know and love Perth."

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.380
 - We all know and love Perth.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.700
 - But what's the population?

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.060
 - What's the population?

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.660
 - And then we have a guess.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.260
 And whoever's closest wins.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.060
 And usually, our guesses are absolutely wild.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.060
 If you think by now, we would know that.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.900
 - Have a sense of it.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.820
 - A large English town is usually a few hundred thousand,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.940
 but a city is usually, you know, more hundred thousands.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.660
 - Dan helps throwing some wild guesses.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.500
 - Yes, he does.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.700
 - With a lack of any sort of context in the real world.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.660
 And then we always have a driver who takes us around places

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.380
 and they always know exactly what the population is,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.820
 so they always win.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.700
 But we did it in Perth this time.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.820
 And it's kind of a middle of nowhere town

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.380
 in the middle of nowhere country.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.020
 And you think it's just gonna be like a mining town and stuff.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.060
 And even when you're there, it doesn't feel massive.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.340
 It feels like a proper city,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.100
 but it doesn't feel like an enormous city.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.100
 - Yeah, what was the plot there?

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.940
 - It was like 1.5 million or something.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.780
 - It's too much.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.420
 - It's more than a million, I'm sure.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.740
 We should make it the second biggest city in England,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.620
 I think, bigger than Birmingham.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.580
 - Oh yeah, definitely the second biggest city in England.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.420
 - Yeah.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.540
 - So like, you just, because no one lives anywhere else,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.740
 they all just congregate to these CBDs,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.380
 Central Business Districts.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.260
 - The CBD, it's funny isn't it?

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.580
 How Australians do that?

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.780
 The CBDs, they just call it the Central Business District.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.300
 There's nothing more off-putting.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.060
 Hi, we're going out in the Central Business District.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.740
 Doesn't say goodnight out to me.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.420
 And it is one of the slight problems

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.100
 with touring in Australia and New Zealand,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.260
 and that's where the theatres are usually.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.660
 So they put us in a hotel which is near to it.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.180
 So we're always in hotels that are surrounded

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.940
 by skyscrapers, and I mean, not to complain of course,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.300
 because we're very lucky to be here and stuff,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.860
 but we don't really get to see real Australia very much.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.260
 - No, and the fact that we're always in skyscrapery hotels

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.300
 means that we can't share hotels, of course.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.140
 - That's true.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.740
 - Because I can't go in lifts, because I'm a weed.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.820
 - This is really cold, worse.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.620
 - Yeah, you have to fight people

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.740
 to get into the lifts in Australia,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.860
 and it just doesn't...

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.780
 - I shy away, I shy away from that, yeah.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.980
 No, I'm claustrophobic, and so it's been really entertaining.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.060
 I'm sure for our tour managers, having doubled the work,

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.340
 having to find other hotels,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.260
 or sort of little bedsits to put me in.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.140
 It feels like students think that I'm in quite a lot

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.740
 of the time, but when I love it, it's so much like...

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.380
 - Oh, hi, Dan.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.220
 - Where the hell's this?

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.420
 - Hi, I'm here.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.740
 - Sorry.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.580
 - Hello.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.420
 - Hi.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.260
 - Hi, James.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.820
 - How are you having some breakfast?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.460
 - Yeah, I am.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.100
 - We should probably keep this surreptitious

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.460
 so that people don't realize

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.300
 that you're a big old breakfast reviewer.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.140
 - I see, good idea.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.820
 - So maybe if you just leave us for a few minutes,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.340
 'cause otherwise they might see me and think that, 'cause...

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.180
 - I'm never gonna get old INC.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.620
 - Yeah, yeah, but we're not doing any breakfast club today.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.460
 - Really, okay.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.300
 - All right, okay.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.140
 - We're just having a chat.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.140
 - Well, you let me know when you're ready

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.860
 for the next recording, 'cause I am free.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.100
 - Great, okay, enjoy your breakfast, Dan.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:24.940
 - See you in a bit.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.780
 - Who was that?

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.340
 - Oh, he's like, he's a former colleague of mine.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.700
 Anyway, it doesn't matter.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.380
 So what were we saying?

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.420
 Oh yeah, we're very lucky to be in the CVDs.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.260
 - Yeah.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.460
 - But it does mean you don't see the bush too much.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.500
 - No, you don't see much of the bush, no.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.500
 - Okay, so we've been chatting about our lives

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.780
 and hopefully, dear listener,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.420
 you've learned something about what it's like

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.980
 being on tour with no such insufficient.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.580
 The same yellow car's just driven past twice in a row.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.140
 - Oh my god, the Truman Show.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.540
 - 'Cause it's exactly the same car

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.740
 as I have at home.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.580
 - Is it?

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.940
 - Yeah, the same color as well.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.100
 Yeah, it's quite funny when you and I go anywhere together

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.020
 and we're not together, but we go and drive to the place

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.900
 'cause we both have very colorful cars.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.620
 - Yeah, bright yellow and bright green.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.020
 - We're talking back to each other

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.340
 and we look like a fruit salad.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.500
 - Yeah.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.620
 - But I'll let you know if they drive past again.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.540
 - Yeah, I do, because that's a bit suspect, isn't it?

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.380
 - But what we need to do is review our breakfast.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.580
 So as the listener might have realized,

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.060
 you've ordered an omelette today.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.900
 - I have, yeah.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.460
 - So, we're in the QT Auckland.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.540
 - Yeah.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.220
 - And again, it's a menu.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.060
 So there's a lot of different things on the menu

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.340
 that you can have.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.260
 First of all, why did you choose the omelette?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.620
 - Well, great question.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.660
 Thank you for asking.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.260
 I'm gonna do the old politician.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.980
 I'm not gonna ask you a question immediately.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.140
 I'm gonna ask the question I want to answer,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.340
 which is that do I prefer the menu or the buffet?

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.340
 And instinctively, I prefer a buffet,

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.060
 of course, 'cause you can go back and forth,

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.980
 back and forth, have 19 courses.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.300
 But actually, when you're on menu,

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.860
 you do feel a bit less sick leaving the breakfast room

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.820
 when you haven't had 19 courses.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.340
 And sometimes it puts you in a better state

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.100
 to spend the rest of the day working.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.380
 - So you like being on menu.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.980
 I was wondering, maybe we should call this podcast on menu.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.940
 - Oh, that's a lovely name.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.780
 - Nice name, nice name.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.900
 - Anyway, so you ordered your omelette.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.740
 - Yeah.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.060
 - And how is your omelette?

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.820
 - It's really, it's very nice.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.820
 It's got some sort of cream inside.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.100
 - Is it fluffy?

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.500
 - It's really fluffy.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.580
 It's just tomato, it seems to be basic tomato.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.740
 I'm dissecting now.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.660
 Tomato, bechamel, could do with more cheese,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.460
 but they always could, couldn't they?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.180
 - Yeah, cheese is the main thing about omelettes.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.540
 It's really just a way of delivering cheese

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.020
 and see your face, isn't it?

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.300
 - Well, I'm a big fan of egg as well.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.780
 I think I like eggs done anyway.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.620
 - That's true.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.780
 This is something I know about you,

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.580
 is that you like an egg on everything.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.420
 - I do, yeah, yeah.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.740
 - Basically any meal that you get,

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.860
 if an egg comes with it, that's the one you're choosing.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.340
 - I think egg on ice cream, yeah, egg on a cracker.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.540
 - Okay, so your omelette is not just omelette.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.380
 It comes with--

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.220
 - It's got salad with it.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.220
 - It's got a side salad, which is, is it rocket?

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.100
 - So it's, do you know, I don't know if it is rocket in here.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.940
 I think it's spinach.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.460
 I know there is, it's rocket, it's spinach, it's lettuce.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.740
 And I'm enjoying the--

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.780
 - Raw greens.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.820
 - I'm enjoying feeling very smug

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.500
 not having had some salad for breakfast.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.820
 - Yeah, your salad has a bit of a dressing on it as well.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.660
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.100
 - What is it, it's--

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.940
 - What is it, it's balsamic.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.340
 - Balsamic, isn't it?

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.580
 - Yeah, I'm gonna say that.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.500
 - Is it helping?

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.740
 - Do you know what I found out yesterday?

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.260
 Is that, oh yeah, you can't have salad

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.020
 without drenching it in vinegar.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.820
 Cats, I was reminded of this

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.860
 because I was just thinking about tastes and umami,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.180
 which actually maybe balsamic isn't,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.260
 but cats like Asian food best.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.580
 - Do they?

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.700
 - In theory they should

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.460
 because there's this amazing pet food testing place

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.860
 in Milton Mowbray, I think,

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.140
 and I was reading a big Guardian long read

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.060
 that was based there

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.180
 and they test all these foods on cats

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.420
 and they said they go for all the foods that are,

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.460
 their favorite foods are umami and kokumi,

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.300
 which is that--

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.140
 - Oh yeah, the new one.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.060
 - Seventh taste, six, seven, six.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.380
 - Six, yeah.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.740
 - Which is, I think it's, I wanna say meaty.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.180
 - No, umami's meaty.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.180
 - I think kokami enhances salty stuff.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.260
 - Yeah, or--

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.660
 - It enhances something, yeah.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.980
 - Anyway, it's all over Asian food.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.220
 So really we should be giving cats, cats to curry.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.580
 - Very good.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.060
 I'm a bit worried that there's a big cat food facility

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.020
 in Milton Mowbray,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.100
 which I mostly associate with pork pies.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.940
 - I know.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.100
 - And the inside of a pork pie

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.940
 is not a million dollars.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.060
 - It's very similar, isn't it?

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.660
 There's gotta be some mixing up happening there.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.940
 - Oh my god, we've blown this shit wide open.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.860
 - They're doing some spots.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.980
 - Okay, so you're getting to the end of your omelet now.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.780
 You've got one last bite for the ASMR.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.900
 Do you want to quickly--

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.000
 - Oh, I should do a little, yeah.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.060
 Yeah, I'll get my hair out of the way.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.020
 Do a little crunching.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.860
 Ready?

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.060
 It's not very crunchy omelet, but.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.900
 - No.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.900
 (groans)

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.740
 - What?

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.660
 (laughs)

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.740
 - Yeah, okay, okay.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.580
 That's enough.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.400
 - That'll do.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.240
 - Yeah, brilliant.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.080
 - What do you want to?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.220
 - That's exactly what we wanted.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.020
 So, you finish your omelet and we need to do a final score

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.660
 for the breakfast at the QT in Auckland.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.500
 - Okay.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.940
 - So, I just quickly, for the listener, I've had a coffee.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.180
 My coffee was very nice.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.300
 Unlike other places where I've had to order it in,

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.020
 actually there's like a filter coffee station,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.500
 so I can just help myself for as much as I want.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.860
 And I really do appreciate that in a place.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.300
 I don't like it where you have to order it,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.340
 'cause then I feel like I can only order one.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.180
 - Yeah.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.700
 - And I like to drink about 12 coffees every day.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.700
 - Sure, sure.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.700
 - So, I'm gonna give the coffee 4.5 lumps of milk out of five.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.020
 - That sounds decent.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.860
 - Yeah.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.260
 - Just 'cause there's little lumps of milk floating

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.420
 on the top of this one.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.540
 - That's what you want, isn't it?

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.260
 - Yeah, so what are you gonna give your?

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.900
 - Well, Brett, when I just said I've had a cup of tea

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.980
 as well, and beautiful crockery,

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.460
 but it's not the best cup of tea I've ever had.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.460
 So, overall, 16.5 drops of balsamic vinegar

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.620
 out of 20, out of 21.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.460
 - Okay.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.740
 (laughing)

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.500
 - It's the Blackjack scoring system.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.340
 - Brilliant.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.940
 Okay, 16 and 17 in Blackjack is really where you have

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.580
 to make a decision if you've got a twist or a thing.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.420
 - Is it?

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.260
 - Yeah.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.180
 - I'm choosing a pivotal school, okay.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.260
 So, we didn't mention the other night,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.700
 speaking of coffee, we were talking about Gustav,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.060
 the first. - Third of Sweden.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.900
 - Sweden.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.740
 Well, I think I said to you,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.580
 I sort of fell in love with,

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.860
 I found him a very fascinating person.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.260
 And we didn't even get around to mentioning

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.940
 that he was the person, I think,

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.420
 who commissioned that investigation into coffee.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.260
 - Oh, yeah.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.740
 - And that thing was published about,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.780
 I think it was about the evils of coffee.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.380
 Was it when coffee houses were becoming

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.820
 really, really popular?

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.460
 And it was thought to be,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.500
 I think it was thought to be trash.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.460
 It was like, further by women, quite a lot.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.660
 So, it was dragging men away.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.940
 - And it had come from the Arabic world and stuff.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.980
 So, it's very foreign.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.300
 - Oh, yeah.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.500
 So, they did this huge investigation

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.860
 into why coffee was gonna ruin the world.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.660
 But anyway, I just wanted to give Gustav a shout out

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.380
 because I'd recommend looking into him.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.780
 - And anyway, the punchline is that he gave two people,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.180
 one of them only drank coffee

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.820
 and one of them never drank coffee,

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.900
 expecting that the one who only drank coffee

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.340
 would die really quickly.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.380
 But actually, not only did he outlive

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.700
 the person who didn't drink coffee,

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.460
 he also outlived Gustav.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.300
 - Really?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.140
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.260
 - It's not very fair because Gustav

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.580
 was shot in the back at my right range, wasn't he?

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.980
 You can't blame him.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.460
 - By a coffee salesman.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.300
 - Yeah.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.420
 - Okay, well, thank you very much, Anna,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.460
 for your breakfast review.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.780
 - Oh, thank you.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.420
 - We will, I feel like the chemistry was a bit too much.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.740
 - The fire has lit.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.260
 Well, this place is burning down.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.940
 - But if we ever do this again, I'll be in touch.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.420
 - I look forward to your call.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.060
 I'll be, I've got my phone on all the time.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.260
 I may, I get in on it.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.660
 - And thank you, Listener,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.900
 for listening to Anna and James's Breakfast Club.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.480
 (upbeat music)

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.860
 - Okay, we're recording.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.940
 - Great.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.060
 - Are you good?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:18.900
 - I'm feeling great.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.740
 - Cool, okay.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.540
 Well, welcome to James and Ash's Breakfast Club.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.060
 - This is a little bit of bonus material,

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.620
 where I speak to our sound engineer

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:34.140
 and the person who wrote our theme tune, Ash Gardner.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.340
 And we discuss our breakfasts.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.260
 So, hello, Ash, how are you?

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.460
 - Hello, James.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.500
 I'm doing so nicely.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.940
 You can tell that's authentic,

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.260
 'cause I've got food in my mouth.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.460
 We're actually eating breakfast.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.740
 - I just waited literally

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.940
 until you put that mouthful of salad in your face.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.740
 This is the first test,

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.560
 because you're not one of the regular

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.020
 noses things of fish members,

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.940
 but you're probably the fifth member of fish, really.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.740
 'Cause you've been here since the very start.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.820
 - Certainly have.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.500
 I've watched these fishes grow.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.700
 - Yeah, since we were tiny little sprats,

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.060
 who didn't know what we were doing

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.740
 until we became world beggastars on a tour of...

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.980
 - Where people recognize you on the plane.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.020
 - I know, it's crazy. - Just by your voices.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.900
 - It's absolutely crazy.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.100
 How you enjoying the Tarsel bar?

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.300
 - It's delicious.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.980
 It's very nice being around people

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.700
 that understand 50% of what I'm talking about.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.740
 - You have to understand, listener,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.860
 that Ash is a real tour de force

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.060
 of knowledge, of opinion, of everything.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.980
 And he gets mentioned every now and then

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.500
 on the podcast, but really,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.300
 he's part of everyone's hearts

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.180
 and noses things of fish.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.220
 And a lot of the things that we say

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.100
 are his catchphrases that we picked up over the years.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.020
 - You used one of them last night in the...

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:51.860
 - Did I? - Yes.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:52.700
 - What did I say?

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.900
 - No further questions.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.140
 - No further questions.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:00.900
 - So in the show, you're at the back of the theater usually,

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.500
 and you are not just doing the sound,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.380
 but you're basically coordinating with the sound guys,

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.940
 with the lighting guys, with the stage managers,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.900
 with everyone, and making sure that everything happens

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.100
 as it's supposed to happen,

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.380
 and that we can just make the show without worrying

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.980
 about what's gonna go wrong, right?

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.460
 - Yes, James, I'm like the translator

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.260
 in between you guys and the stage crew.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.860
 - Which considering most people don't understand anything

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.860
 about what you say is quite amazing

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.860
 that you managed to do that.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.940
 - Those kinds of people I can speak to.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.740
 - Do you have your own sounding language?

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.660
 - No, I've got all the wrong terminology.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.700
 I haven't really called the show before,

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.460
 and Michael, who's our tour manager,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.180
 is very busy on flights, and hotels, and emails,

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.940
 and all that stuff, so I'm covering all the stage stuff.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.020
 And yes, I tell the people, I've got no idea

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.700
 what stage left or stage right is.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.260
 So we develop a language privately every time we chat

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.140
 over what I'm actually talking about, what I mean.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.140
 - There's a school in Nicaragua,

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.620
 which is like a deaf school, school for deaf.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.620
 And they didn't have an ASL there,

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.580
 American Sound Language, or BSL, or anything.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.500
 And they came up with their own language, these kids.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.500
 And it's the only known example of a language popping up

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.700
 in the last 100 years from nowhere.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.940
 And so linguists are really excited to learn about,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.820
 you know, where it's coming from,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.980
 especially as kids are doing it, so it's so natural.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.100
 But I didn't realize that you were also doing

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.820
 the same thing backstage at every show that we did.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.780
 - On the regs.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.100
 (laughing)

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:41.940
 - On the regs.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.580
 - And have you found that there's soundies

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.220
 and lighties subbing, yeah?

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.100
 - Yeah, they've all known what they were doing,

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.100
 and they all have a very relaxed, but can do vibe.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.500
 - Yeah.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.500
 - Yeah, it's quite pleasant.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.580
 Everybody's keen.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.820
 - What do you think of New Zealand?

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.900
 'Cause you've never been here before, I don't think.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.540
 - No, I've never been here before,

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.940
 and it's very nice to be somewhere

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.100
 where I don't recognize all the foliage.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.780
 - Interesting, you like your trees, don't you?

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.700
 - Yeah, I feel like I've traveled quite luckily,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.940
 been able to travel quite a lot,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.980
 and trees are something that are everywhere,

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.780
 and you can't help but notice them.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.620
 - That's so wise.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.860
 Apart from, of course, on the Nalaba Plain in Australia,

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.340
 which is named after the fact that there's no trees on it.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.980
 - Nice, I haven't been there yet.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.060
 (laughing)

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:31.900
 - You would like it, Ash.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.700
 - No, I'd be looking at something else.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.980
 They'd be some kind of fancy lizards or something.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.380
 That lizard, the Tuatara.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.940
 - Oh, yeah, we were talking about that the other day,

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.780
 weren't we?

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.780
 Oh, 'cause was there a beer named after us?

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.060
 - There was a beer named after it,

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.820
 and there was a pub named after it

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.500
 just next to the venue last night, the Opera House.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.820
 And that's a very fascinating feature.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.300
 - Oh, actually, I should say,

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300
 you should have said this in the start,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.540
 but we're in Wellington.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.540
 - Yes. - New Zealand.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.500
 - We are.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.580
 - But yeah, the Tuatara,

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.860
 which has a third eye on top of its head.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.820
 - So cool for detecting where the sun is,

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.700
 and stuff, so cool.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.980
 - It's absolutely amazing.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.620
 And they live on the North Island, I think,

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.220
 right in the far North of New Zealand.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.540
 - They do, yes.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.660
 And they've been around for a really good, long time.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.260
 - Really? - Kind of dinosaur age.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.980
 Yes, I think it was 240 million years ago,

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.820
 they were around.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.100
 - Oh, boy, that's very cool.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.700
 So when we first arrived,

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.100
 the first gig that we did,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.620
 which was in Adelaide,

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.860
 Andrew Contamurray came a day early

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.100
 to acclimatise.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.660
 And then myself, Anna and Dan,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.460
 came the day later.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.300
 And when we arrived, slightly jet-lagged,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.100
 you and Andy had been,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.580
 you'd been partying, hadn't you?

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.700
 - We certainly had been partying.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.540
 - Yeah?

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.620
 - We went to St. Peter's Cathedral

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.620
 and had a lovely good old fashioned knees up.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.900
 (laughing)

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.620
 - Yes. - You just,

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.220
 this is so random and so very on brand for you.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.220
 You found out that there was something happening

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.460
 in a local church.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.860
 - Yes. - And you dragged Andy along.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.300
 And you both sat there for an hour,

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.820
 listening to a bit of Bach.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.900
 - Andy didn't need to be dragged down in Australia.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.980
 There's not as many churches as there are back home.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.660
 - Yeah, it's a godless place down here.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.260
 - Just not so many, they're everywhere back home.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.340
 Over here, there's not so many.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.780
 So whenever I see them, I'm like,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.820
 ooh, that's some old stuff, I'll go in and enjoy.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.500
 And my kids think they're all Bowser's Castle.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.300
 So it's super easy to get my kids to come and join me as well.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.180
 - Yeah, but you have to take them in go-karts

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.980
 and throw bananas and shells around all the time, don't you?

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.460
 Okay, and what happened in the church?

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.820
 - There was an organ recital of a requiem.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.060
 I forget who wrote it,

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.140
 but I was trying to get into the church

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.620
 and just walking around by myself, by my lonesome.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.420
 And the church was closed,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.860
 but there was a poster for a gig

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.500
 happening that very night.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.060
 And I saw an organist, and I was like,

00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:00.100
 oh, an organ in there, that's worth it.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.300
 - And was it worth it? - It was worth the gandon.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.980
 Dude, it's one of the best gigs I've been to.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.140
 - What's the second best gig you've ever been to?

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.540
 - Ooh, which is, that's also really tough.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.540
 I've been to some really, really sweet gigs.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.380
 Soft and Stevens at the Barbican was quite good in 2016.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.300
 - Okay, well, that's what we're gonna say that.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.260
 That was your number two, but your number one

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.420
 was the requiem.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.060
 - Ah, James, it was so good.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.180
 They had someone on "Smoke Machine"

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.300
 who was wafting around,

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.020
 and they were hitting all the senses.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.940
 There was smells coming out of their "Smoke Machine."

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.660
 - That's an incense burner.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.420
 - It was so effective, James, it was incredible.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.500
 And they also, I feel like I've been

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.060
 to one of those gigs back home.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.100
 And their "Smoke Machine" smelled Australian down here.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.460
 They must've been burning some type of red gum,

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.540
 some kind of a... - Some kind of a...

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.380
 - All right.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.860
 - Maybe that's the smell that I'm smelling.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.860
 But there was a real Australian smell.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.060
 - How interesting.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.220
 That's really cool.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.100
 - And another great thing is, at the end of the gig,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.260
 they just walked off stage,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.780
 and they just walked right out of the venue.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.980
 - As a kid, I was forced to go to church every week.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.700
 But I reckon if my parents had said,

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.820
 "James, there's some sweet gig happening

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.220
 "at St. Neffleburg's Church in Dalton,"

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.020
 I might have been more inclined to go.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.380
 - It's just how you view these things.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.580
 - So, we're in Wellington, as we mentioned earlier,

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.620
 in the capital of New Zealand.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.780
 And the windiest capital city in the world.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.260
 It's pretty windy out there.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.380
 I've lost my hat quite a lot of times.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.580
 There's a southerly at the moment,

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.140
 which means the wind is coming directly from Antarctica.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.700
 And there's no landing between us and Antarctica,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.380
 so it's pretty nippy.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.100
 But despite the cold,

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.700
 what did you and Anna get up to a couple of nights ago?

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.220
 - James, we went for a little swim.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.820
 Since I've been in New Zealand,

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.060
 I've been wanting to see orcas.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.660
 And I don't think the swim was so much to find orcas,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.700
 'cause that's not the place that I'd like to see them.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.780
 But Anna's so cool.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.740
 She's so hardy and just up for stuff.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.300
 - Well, she's up for swimming, especially.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.460
 She likes a wild swim.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.420
 - Oh, it was great.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.020
 We were taking our outer layers of clothes off,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.300
 and there was some kids drinking under a bridge.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.060
 And they were cheering for us.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.140
 - Oh, were they? - Yeah.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.060
 - They were wondering how far you were gonna get.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.020
 - Yeah, and it was nice to do it with Anna.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.780
 There was no screaming or, you know, we just went for a swim.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.740
 There was no giddy laughing.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.820
 - Was it not unbelievably cold?

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.660
 - Not so much, no.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.820
 I was swimming in Melbourne in the bay

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.260
 before this tour started,

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.700
 and it was definitely colder there.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.220
 I'm not sure if it's shallow or if it was in a marina.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.820
 So I'm not sure if the boats are sure.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.660
 - Oh, yeah.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.900
 - 'Cause they discharged all of their feces from there.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.740
 That's gonna warm things up.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.780
 - It was either feces or oil or something.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.180
 - It was like the temperature bombing.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:59.100
 - Okay, so we should talk about our breakfast,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.340
 'cause that's the whole point of this,

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.900
 and we've gone quite far into this chat,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.260
 which is very typical of chats with Ash.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.380
 - Attempts.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.540
 - Yeah, we go quite far without getting anywhere

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.940
 near what we're supposed to talk about.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.540
 And actually similarly to Anna yesterday in Auckland,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.500
 you have chosen, well, you've chosen the same item

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.340
 from the menu.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.180
 What did you choose?

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.020
 - I think I chose an omelet.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.220
 - You've chosen omelet.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.420
 How's your omelet?

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.260
 - It's quite nice.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.660
 It's a little bit overcooked.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.540
 I like a slightly runny omelet.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.500
 - Have you found the breakfast on this tour so far?

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.860
 Do you always come down for breakfast or?

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.780
 - I think I've missed one breakfast.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.660
 - That's good.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.700
 - We've been travelling through a lot of time zones,

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.220
 which have been quite confusing.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.740
 Normally when you tour in the UK,

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.900
 there's no jet-like within jet-like,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.260
 within jet-like that's going on.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.820
 So we started in Adelaide,

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.900
 and then we went two hours off to Perth,

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.380
 and then we went three hours off to Brisbane,

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.060
 and then we went one hour off to Melbourne and Sydney,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.380
 and then we're another two hours off to New Zealand.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.500
 - And the other confusing thing is that in Adelaide,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.620
 it's an extra half hour.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.460
 - It's wild.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.820
 - It's absolutely crazy.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.140
 - Do you know the half hour that they have in India?

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.260
 Do you know of that?

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:14.740
 - So India's six and a half hours off from the UK.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.580
 - Oh yeah.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.420
 - And do you know why that is?

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.260
 - No.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.620
 - It's so you can use your analogue clock,

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.060
 and you can just turn it 180 degrees from English time,

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.780
 and you're on Indian time.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.060
 - Is that the reason?

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.100
 - Yeah.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.540
 - Don't fact-check that anyone, just in case.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.500
 (laughing)

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.620
 - Could be the next Perrier.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:38.180
 - Yeah, Ash was responsible for Dan's fact saying once,

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.340
 that when you take sparkling water from America to the UK,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.620
 you have to take the bubbles out before you ship the water.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.780
 And then when you get back to the UK,

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.260
 you put the bubbles back in the same bubbles.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.260
 I've always wondered where you got that from.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.420
 Did you just make it up?

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.260
 Or is it something?

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.700
 - No, somebody would have told me.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.540
 - Yeah.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.540
 - Well, okay, so you've made most of the breakfast.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.180
 What is your general tactic?

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.180
 Let's say there's a buffet.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.980
 Are you a one-time guy, one plate, fill it up, come back?

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:13.100
 Or are you a multiple course guy, the guy, or what?

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.940
 - James, I have very little regimented plans

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.820
 when I'm doing buffets.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.140
 What I normally do is I look around

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.500
 and I copy somebody's meal entirely.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.420
 (laughing)

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.980
 'Cause when I go over there, I'm completely overwhelmed,

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.020
 and I'm like, "Oh, there's this and there's that."

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.660
 So I look around at a finished plate,

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.980
 and that I can digest mentally.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.460
 And then I just go, "I'm gonna rinse that."

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.260
 - So when you're deciding who to copy,

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.860
 are you looking at the plates and thinking,

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.900
 "I like the look of that plate,"

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.340
 or are you looking at the person saying,

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.860
 "That's the kind of person I trust?"

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.340
 - No, no, I'm just looking at the plate.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.660
 It's like when making music,

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.460
 it's really difficult to imagine

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.620
 whether what you're trying to do is good or not.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.700
 I need to like try it and hear it.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.780
 And then you're like, "Ah, I can tell instantly

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.060
 whether that was a good idea."

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.980
 Before you can, before it's there, I have a hard time.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.740
 - That's an interesting creative thing,

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.860
 'cause I think it's very similar to the idea

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.180
 that writers have, which is like,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.180
 it's very difficult to have a blank sheet of paper

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.780
 and start from scratch.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.740
 But once you've gone through that

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.540
 and written down some absolutely rubbish,

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.500
 then you can start editing and start telling things

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.340
 and something good.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.180
 Is it the same in music?

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.700
 - For me, anyways, I think there's a lot of,

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.420
 I mean, there's a lot of talented people

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.580
 who work in all of these different ways of working.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.340
 But I'm definitely, I need to hear it.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.740
 - The guy, Howard Goodall, who wrote the QI theme tune,

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.540
 he reckons that he just has constant music

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.020
 playing in his head.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.780
 And if he ever wants to write a song,

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.140
 he just can kind of turn on a tap.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.260
 And he just, whatever comes out is...

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.140
 - Jim, that's very occasionally music will play in my head.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.460
 And it's normally when I'm like lying down

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.380
 and trying to sleep.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.940
 And it's really occasionally I'll be like,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.140
 "Whoa, I'm listening to music that's happening."

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.460
 And it's so enjoyable.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.860
 And you can kind of imagine it to go in different directions.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.620
 You can be like, "Oh, where's this instrument?"

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.260
 And then suddenly it'll go off, but dude, it's so rare.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.340
 And I've never been able,

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.860
 I'm not so musically knowledgeable

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.700
 that I can remember and put that stuff into anything.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.500
 It's normally kind of classical music

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.620
 that I'll end up generating like that.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.100
 But I think you need quite the good musical vocabulary

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.420
 to be able to remember that kind of stuff.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.700
 - Can you read music?

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.860
 - I cannot, no.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.140
 - So interesting how few very good musicians,

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.140
 or how many very good musicians can't read music.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.020
 - James, it's...

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.980
 - Like, for instance, we were with Tim mentioned

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.460
 the other day and he can't read music.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.420
 - Yeah, I think, I'm not sure where it comes from,

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.780
 but I think if you're reading music,

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.980
 you're not really writing music.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.540
 - Yeah, because I can read music,

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.500
 but I wouldn't call myself a musician in any way at all.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.340
 - I think the drive to make people want to create music

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.580
 doesn't come out of learning an instrument

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.940
 and through that path.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.300
 It kind of comes, I don't know, from somewhere else.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.500
 - Perhaps also people who are forced to do that as kids,

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.860
 like you're forced to learn how to do music.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.300
 - You don't see music in the same way as these weirdos

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.700
 who are just like coming up with stuff,

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.300
 especially with electronic music.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.020
 You know, you're really writing it on how it feels

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.900
 on your body through a big sound system

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.260
 and that's what's inspiring you and stuff.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:37.540
 - Okay, so we should quickly review this breakfast,

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.540
 even though, let's be honest, it's just an omelet.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.380
 But...

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.900
 I've got my breakfast, which is a coffee here,

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.580
 and it's a very good coffee.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.220
 I very much enjoyed it.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.940
 It's kind of middle of the road coffee,

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:53.780
 I would say.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.100
 I'm just gonna give it, in that case,

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.540
 three drumsticks out of five for my coffee.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.380
 But what kind of mark are you gonna give your omelet today?

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.780
 - Three peacocks.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.740
 - Three peacocks?

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.700
 - There is a stuffed peacock in a very curious position,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.540
 looking over its old shoulder, behind Hamez right now.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.180
 - Okay, very good.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.820
 So three peacocks out of five.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.660
 - Yeah.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.100
 - Very good.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.540
 And I gotta say, this has been brilliant.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.380
 She's been absolutely amazing.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.780
 And I think you've got the job.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.780
 I think this is gonna be James and Ash's breakfast club

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.220
 from now on for the rest of the tour.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.180
 Unfortunately, this is the end of the tour.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.100
 - See you next time, James.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.620
 - See you in six years, next time we come to Australia.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.460
 - Can't wait.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.880
 (upbeat music)

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.300
 (upbeat music)

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.880
 (upbeat music)
