00:00:12,00:00:16,">> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:20,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:20,00:00:21,"My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:00:21,00:00:23,"I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:00:23,00:00:26,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Tyshinski."
00:00:26,00:00:28,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with"
00:00:28,00:00:31,"our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:34,00:00:37,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:37,00:00:39,">> Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:00:39,00:00:41,L. Frank Baum based one of
00:00:41,00:00:45,the witches in the Wizard of Oz on his mother-in-law.
00:00:45,00:00:48,>> I didn't know that he was a 1970s stand-up comedian.
00:00:48,00:00:51,">> It sounds like such a sexist fact, doesn't it?"
00:00:51,00:00:52,>> Yeah.
00:00:52,00:00:55,">> But if we tell you who the mother-in-law involved is,"
00:00:55,00:00:56,it won't sound sexist.
00:00:56,00:00:57,>> And also which witch it was.
00:00:57,00:01:00,">> And which witch it was, yeah, that's more important."
00:01:00,00:01:03,"It's the beautiful and benevolent Glinda,"
00:01:03,00:01:05,who is the good witch of the North.
00:01:05,00:01:07,">> Gotcha, you thought it was the green one."
00:01:07,00:01:10,">> No, I don't know what color she is, I've never seen the film."
00:01:10,00:01:11,Is it black and white?
00:01:11,00:01:13,">> She's famously, the wicked one, is famously green."
00:01:13,00:01:14,>> Okay.
00:01:14,00:01:16,">> And it also is black and white, and then not."
00:01:16,00:01:17,It was sort of the introduction of
00:01:17,00:01:19,"Technicolor to Cinema World, really."
00:01:19,00:01:20,>> Is it?
00:01:20,00:01:22,"So it's not like follow the black and white road,"
00:01:22,00:01:23,they didn't do that.
00:01:23,00:01:25,">> No, they invented the color process"
00:01:25,00:01:27,halfway through the first screening of the film.
00:01:27,00:01:29,">> Yeah, very exciting, so quickly."
00:01:29,00:01:30,>> Just randomly.
00:01:30,00:01:36,>> He had this mother-in-law who was called Matilda Elector Jocelyn Gage.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"And it turns out that she was a very, very awesome woman,"
00:01:39,00:01:40,as well as being his mother-in-law.
00:01:40,00:01:44,She was one of the three leaders of the women's rights movement in the US.
00:01:44,00:01:47,So you might have heard of Susan B. Antony.
00:01:47,00:01:50,"There was also Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and there was this lady,"
00:01:50,00:01:52,Matilda Elector Jocelyn Gage.
00:01:52,00:01:53,>> She was very cool.
00:01:53,00:01:56,">> Yeah, she gave him lots of ideas for the story."
00:01:56,00:01:59,"In fact, she maybe even gave him the idea of becoming an author."
00:01:59,00:02:02,"And she came up with the idea of putting a cyclone in the story,"
00:02:02,00:02:05,which spoiler alert is what sends them to Oz.
00:02:05,00:02:08,>> This is a spoiler alert from a guy who hasn't seen the film.
00:02:08,00:02:14,">> I couldn't work out, and therefore I have a theory on how she suggested the cyclone."
00:02:14,00:02:18,"She died in March 1898, which is just when he started writing."
00:02:18,00:02:22,"And I wonder if he was having a massive mental block where he just spent years,"
00:02:22,00:02:26,"like, I've got this idea, but I've got no idea how to transport them."
00:02:26,00:02:31,"And then on her death bed, she said, I've got it, cyclone, and that was it."
00:02:31,00:02:33,Because she literally died as he was starting the book.
00:02:33,00:02:35,So it must have been the first idea that was had.
00:02:35,00:02:38,>> I wonder if she just already half written this book.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"And then when she died, he picked it up and went, oh, this is good."
00:02:41,00:02:44,Because she was also an expert on witches.
00:02:44,00:02:46,">> Oh, yes, she was, the real kind."
00:02:46,00:02:51,">> Yeah, because when she did a lot of her sort of feminism and all that kind of stuff,"
00:02:51,00:02:54,people just kept calling her Satanic and the heretic and stuff like that.
00:02:54,00:03:00,"And they would call her a witch, which is obviously a way of demeaning women in those days."
00:03:00,00:03:02,"And as such, she decided, OK, I'm going to study them."
00:03:02,00:03:04,And she was a real expert on witches.
00:03:04,00:03:05,>> Yeah.
00:03:05,00:03:06,>> So that's another part that she had to do.
00:03:06,00:03:08,>> That's a very good point.
00:03:08,00:03:10,>> She inspired a term.
00:03:10,00:03:15,"So she not only was a suffragette, she also was looking at any kind of discrimination"
00:03:15,00:03:17,that was going on in the States at the time.
00:03:17,00:03:21,And she wrote a pamphlet and it was called Women as Inventors.
00:03:21,00:03:25,"And she basically said, here are all the women who have not been given their credit"
00:03:25,00:03:27,for all the inventions that they've done.
00:03:27,00:03:31,"And years later, the term, the Matilda Effect, is used to describe exactly that."
00:03:31,00:03:35,So women who have been brushed aside from history and should get the credit.
00:03:35,00:03:39,"Now, interestingly, there's a male equivalent to this, which is called the Matthew Effect."
00:03:39,00:03:45,And the Matthew Effect is when a male scientist who is distinguished and older often gets the credit
00:03:45,00:03:49,if he has a co-writer who is younger and new to the field.
00:03:49,00:03:52,That was invented by a guy called Robert K. Merton.
00:03:52,00:03:57,"Interestingly, his wife, Harriet Zuckerman, appears on the Matilda Effect list"
00:03:57,00:04:02,because she provided all the data that led to him inventing the Matthew Effect.
00:04:02,00:04:03,Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:07,">> Can I ask the Matilda Effect, if you're talking about a really awesome woman"
00:04:07,00:04:10,"who is like one of the main leaders of the women's rights movement,"
00:04:10,00:04:14,"but you start the fact off about her son-in-law who wrote a children's book,"
00:04:14,00:04:15,is that kind of similar?
00:04:15,00:04:18,">> I think you're banked the right stuff, yeah."
00:04:18,00:04:21,>> Do you guys know what the reverse Matilda Effect is?
00:04:21,00:04:25,">> Okay, so it's where women get loads of extra credit for stuff that they hadn't done?"
00:04:25,00:04:26,">> You'd think it was that, but--"
00:04:26,00:04:27,>> Is it this podcast?
00:04:27,00:04:29,>> Wow.
00:04:29,00:04:30,">> That is the reverse though, isn't it?"
00:04:30,00:04:31,">> Oh, wow."
00:04:31,00:04:32,"I mean, it is logically the reverse."
00:04:32,00:04:36,I'm afraid that's not the thing that's been labeled the reverse Matilda Effect.
00:04:36,00:04:40,"This was a quite interesting study that was done in Poland last year, actually,"
00:04:40,00:04:46,where a Polish scientist ran this study where they showed over 800 school children
00:04:46,00:04:50,"a bunch of presentations about the history of math and science and STEM stuff,"
00:04:50,00:04:54,"and then as part of it, they mentioned people who'd invented certain mathematical or"
00:04:54,00:04:58,"scientific physics-based things, but these were made-up inventions."
00:04:58,00:05:01,"They were made-up people, and for one group of students,"
00:05:01,00:05:02,"they had a woman be the inventor,"
00:05:02,00:05:04,"and for the other group of students, they had a man be the inventor,"
00:05:04,00:05:07,"and it turned out when they asked the students afterwards,"
00:05:07,00:05:09,"when they'd mentioned that a woman was the inventor,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,the people just weren't interested in the subject.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"They were like, ""Well, that sounds like a shit subject,"""
00:05:13,00:05:14,and they didn't want to study it anymore.
00:05:14,00:05:15,>> Oh.
00:05:15,00:05:18,>> And so we need to stop talking about women in science
00:05:18,00:05:22,"in order to get women into science, and it was the girls and boys."
00:05:22,00:05:22,>> It was awesome.
00:05:22,00:05:24,">> They were both like, ""Ugh, women did this."""
00:05:24,00:05:27,>> And it was the same level of coolness of invention
00:05:27,00:05:28,they were discussing for both the women and the men.
00:05:28,00:05:30,>> It was the same invention itself.
00:05:30,00:05:31,">> Oh, it was the same, it wasn't, okay, okay, okay."
00:05:31,00:05:33,">> It wasn't like someone invented a doily,"
00:05:33,00:05:36,and this man invented the space rocket.
00:05:36,00:05:40,You'd run some great studies there.
00:05:40,00:05:44,">> But I think a doily is a cool, I've come into contact much more with the doily"
00:05:44,00:05:45,than the space rocket.
00:05:45,00:05:48,A doily has probably avoided more human misery than a space rocket.
00:05:48,00:05:50,">> No, it is more up your street, I agree with that."
00:05:50,00:05:53,>> I can imagine you starting your doily ex company
00:05:53,00:05:56,when you become a billionaire.
00:05:56,00:05:59,>> The world's most revolutionary doily.
00:05:59,00:06:03,">> So before he was a writer,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,"L. Frank Baum worked in shops,"
00:06:06,00:06:10,"and he did amazing sort of window displays, didn't he?"
00:06:10,00:06:12,"Really, that's what he was famous for at the time."
00:06:12,00:06:13,>> Didn't you have a magazine?
00:06:13,00:06:16,How famous can you be for writing a magazine about window displays?
00:06:16,00:06:20,">> I think in the areas where he had window displays,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"people would copy his ideas,"
00:06:22,00:06:23,"and then he had the magazine,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,and he came up with lots of different ways of doing things.
00:06:25,00:06:30,"Like he thought that if you had an American flag in your window display,"
00:06:30,00:06:32,"you shouldn't have a fan blowing it,"
00:06:32,00:06:36,because that's not the correct way for an American flag to be flown.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"It should be on the end of a massive stick with someone waving it,"
00:06:39,00:06:41,like a figure of eight.
00:06:41,00:06:44,And he came up with a mechanical system
00:06:44,00:06:47,to get a flag to go that way instead of being blown with a fan.
00:06:47,00:06:48,">> Oh, incredible."
00:06:48,00:06:50,>> So he just came up with loads of amazing innovations
00:06:50,00:06:52,"that we all know today, like that."
00:06:52,00:06:54,>> And then put it in his magazine.
00:06:54,00:06:55,>> And then he put it in his magazine
00:06:55,00:06:57,"and said, ""This is what you should be doing, guys,"
00:06:57,00:06:58,"not your stupid fan thing."""
00:06:58,00:06:58,">> Yeah, okay."
00:06:58,00:07:00,>> I didn't know he did the window displays.
00:07:00,00:07:01,I thought he just wrote about them.
00:07:01,00:07:01,">> Oh, no."
00:07:01,00:07:05,"We should say the magazine was called ""The Show Window,"""
00:07:05,00:07:07,which then became a book called
00:07:07,00:07:10,"""The Art of Decorating Dry Goods, Windows, and Interiors,"""
00:07:10,00:07:12,which was almost the last thing he published
00:07:12,00:07:13,"before ""The Wizard of Oz,"" actually."
00:07:13,00:07:14,">> I think it was in the same year, wasn't it?"
00:07:14,00:07:16,>> That was 1900.
00:07:16,00:07:17,So it was maybe a year or two before.
00:07:17,00:07:19,">> I wonder if he's got anyone out there who, if they say,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,"""What do you think of L. Frank Baum?"""
00:07:21,00:07:22,"They go, ""I prefer his early stuff."""
00:07:22,00:07:26,">> He had a shop called Baum's Bazaar,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,"which was a complete disaster,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,"because it was lots of tap, basically."
00:07:30,00:07:31,It was sort of a...
00:07:31,00:07:33,Do you call it a bizarre stuff?
00:07:33,00:07:34,Very nice.
00:07:34,00:07:35,Didn't want to let that go unmarked.
00:07:35,00:07:38,">> You know, I probably would have cut that out,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,"but now that you've made a point of it,"
00:07:40,00:07:41,I think let's keep that in now.
00:07:41,00:07:43,">> Let's shine a harsh light on that, then."
00:07:43,00:07:44,">> Thank you, Andy."
00:07:44,00:07:44,>> And it sold also.
00:07:44,00:07:46,It was a very novelty-based shop.
00:07:46,00:07:48,It was not a dry goods emporium.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"It was, you know, like chocolates and..."
00:07:51,00:07:52,">> It was based on Woolworths, wasn't it?"
00:07:52,00:07:54,">> Yeah, it was any old stuff, like lanterns,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,"paper lanterns, strange glassware, anyway."
00:07:56,00:07:58,He opened it shortly before a very harsh drought
00:07:58,00:07:59,decimated the entire region.
00:07:59,00:08:03,And the appetite for paper lanterns and amusing glassware
00:08:03,00:08:05,just went through the floor.
00:08:05,00:08:06,And lots of people were ruined.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"And I think that was the point at which,"
00:08:09,00:08:10,"I think his mother-in-law, I think Matilda,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,was very concerned about his prospects.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"She didn't originally want her daughter to marry him,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,because he was a bit of a bum.
00:08:17,00:08:18,">> Well, he was just a very bad businessman."
00:08:18,00:08:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:21,00:08:23,>> Brilliant. Brilliant.
00:08:23,00:08:25,">> See, that's how you do it."
00:08:25,00:08:26,>> That was good.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Thank you for the lesson.
00:08:27,00:08:30,">> Say it loudly, and then a loud laugh to follow it up."
00:08:30,00:08:34,"Yeah, he saw he was very bad at business,"
00:08:34,00:08:37,"and that bazaar, in fact, had to be renamed Gage's Bazaar."
00:08:37,00:08:39,And this was another member of his wife's family
00:08:39,00:08:41,"who helped him out, who I think was Helen Gage,"
00:08:41,00:08:42,his sister-in-law.
00:08:42,00:08:44,"So he drove the shop into the ground,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"and his sister-in-law was like, oh my God, poor Frank,"
00:08:46,00:08:47,he's screwed up again.
00:08:47,00:08:50,"And so she bought up all the remaining stock,"
00:08:50,00:08:52,"renamed it Gage's Bazaar, and made it a very successful stock."
00:08:52,00:08:54,>> Really? That's so good.
00:08:54,00:08:57,"We haven't mentioned his wife, Maud, daughter of Matilda."
00:08:57,00:09:02,"She came into his life, as it was a quite quick marriage."
00:09:02,00:09:05,They were introduced by Bounds Auntie.
00:09:05,00:09:07,"He immediately said, I'm going to be marrying you one day."
00:09:07,00:09:09,They married a few months later.
00:09:09,00:09:11,But she was quite brutal from some of the stories
00:09:11,00:09:14,"about how she ran the house in certain ways,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,because she sort of did everything in the house.
00:09:16,00:09:17,>> Do you mean the donut incident?
00:09:17,00:09:18,">> Yeah, the donut incident."
00:09:18,00:09:19,>> Let's talk about this.
00:09:19,00:09:20,>> It's incredible.
00:09:20,00:09:24,"So he comes home one day, Frank, with a box of donuts."
00:09:24,00:09:24,>> Right.
00:09:24,00:09:27,>> But he hasn't consulted her about buying these donuts.
00:09:27,00:09:28,She is furious.
00:09:28,00:09:30,She's the one who decides what food enters the house.
00:09:30,00:09:32,She wants only good food in the house.
00:09:32,00:09:34,"So if he was going to do anything like that,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,"it had to go through her, and it was not going to go to waste."
00:09:36,00:09:38,So he was going to have to eat all of these donuts.
00:09:38,00:09:40,He couldn't manage it by the fourth day.
00:09:40,00:09:44,">> It's very much a Matilda and Bruce Bogtrotter situation,"
00:09:44,00:09:44,isn't it?
00:09:44,00:09:45,He has to eat the whole cake.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Do you remember that?
00:09:46,00:09:47,">> Oh, yes, yes, exactly."
00:09:47,00:09:48,>> It's that.
00:09:48,00:09:50,">> So by the fourth day, they start going moldy,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"and he thinks, I can't eat these anymore."
00:09:52,00:09:54,"So he sneaks out into the backyard,"
00:09:54,00:09:56,and he buries them under the ground.
00:09:56,00:09:56,>> Right.
00:09:56,00:10:01,">> She knows something's up, so she goes into the garden."
00:10:01,00:10:02,She digs them back up.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"She presents them back to him and says,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"""You never buy donuts again,"" and he doesn't."
00:10:08,00:10:09,And she says--
00:10:09,00:10:12,">> Can I ask, how many donuts did he buy"
00:10:12,00:10:14,that he couldn't eat them in four days?
00:10:14,00:10:14,>> Exactly.
00:10:14,00:10:17,">> Well, he's got one of those Krispy Kreme full packs,"
00:10:17,00:10:17,isn't he?
00:10:17,00:10:18,There are like a dozen in there.
00:10:18,00:10:21,">> Anna, I've seen you go through those packs."
00:10:21,00:10:23,">> James, we don't need to talk about my history with Toda."
00:10:23,00:10:24,">> No, you're right."
00:10:24,00:10:26,That is the whole in the story.
00:10:26,00:10:27,>> Yeah.
00:10:27,00:10:29,>> I reckon I could get through 50 in four days.
00:10:29,00:10:30,No problem.
00:10:30,00:10:33,">> Well, you'd have a happier marriage."
00:10:33,00:10:34,">> Than he did, clearly."
00:10:34,00:10:38,I love the sheer list of his failures.
00:10:38,00:10:39,He's one of the--
00:10:39,00:10:42,"Actually, he is one of these guys who makes you think,"
00:10:42,00:10:44,"if I haven't made it by age X,"
00:10:44,00:10:46,"like, you know, if you haven't started by the age of three,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"you're not going to be a tennis pro, for example."
00:10:48,00:10:52,"Boom, until mid-30s, we're still just knocking about"
00:10:52,00:10:53,doing random stuff.
00:10:53,00:10:54,">> So, is he giving you hope?"
00:10:54,00:10:55,>> He's giving me a lot of hope.
00:10:55,00:10:59,He was a chicken breeder.
00:10:59,00:11:02,He managed to fail selling oil in America
00:11:02,00:11:03,in the 1880s and '90s.
00:11:03,00:11:05,He just couldn't hack it.
00:11:05,00:11:08,How do you fail a petrol company?
00:11:08,00:11:11,"Just ridiculous, yeah."
00:11:11,00:11:13,>> I thought the saddest story about Frank
00:11:13,00:11:15,"was, did you read about when he tried to be an actor?"
00:11:15,00:11:16,>> No.
00:11:16,00:11:17,>> I will save him.
00:11:17,00:11:18,He tried so much.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"The reason I know I'm not him,"
00:11:19,00:11:21,"I'm not going to suddenly be successful at 40,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,"is that he, like, had a new fan every year"
00:11:23,00:11:25,and he threw himself into it.
00:11:25,00:11:26,And his dad bought a bunch of theaters
00:11:26,00:11:28,and he decided I'll be an actor.
00:11:28,00:11:30,So he kept on asking producers to cast him.
00:11:30,00:11:32,"And eventually, one said,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,"""Oh, yeah, I'll definitely cast you in loads of leading roles,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,but you need to provide all the costumes
00:11:36,00:11:39,"for all of the possible leading roles you could be cast in."""
00:11:39,00:11:41,"So when he told his mum and dad,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,"his dad said, ""No."""
00:11:43,00:11:45,"The mum said, ""Oh, come on, he's got a job."
00:11:45,00:11:46,"Buy this stuff."""
00:11:46,00:11:48,So they spent thousands and thousands of dollars
00:11:48,00:11:49,"buying up all the leading roles,"
00:11:49,00:11:52,"like, you know, Romeo, Macbeth, all the costumes."
00:11:52,00:11:54,He turned up with the theater troupe.
00:11:54,00:11:56,"On the first day, the actor was playing Romeo, said,"
00:11:56,00:11:58,"""Oh, my doublet's a bit broken."
00:11:58,00:11:59,"Can I just borrow that costume of yours?"""
00:11:59,00:12:00,"Oh, my God."
00:12:00,00:12:02,"""Within four days, every single costume"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"had been taken from him and not returned."""
00:12:04,00:12:06,Did he play anyone in the play in the end?
00:12:06,00:12:07,He got some tiny little extra parts.
00:12:07,00:12:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:08,00:12:09,He got so many.
00:12:09,00:12:10,No.
00:12:10,00:12:11,That's amazing.
00:12:11,00:12:12,"Speaking of costumes, by the way,"
00:12:12,00:12:15,"obviously a movie, The Wizard of Oz."
00:12:15,00:12:16,"Yeah, yes."
00:12:16,00:12:20,"The Cowardly Lion costume was very, very heavy."
00:12:20,00:12:21,But the really interesting thing about it
00:12:21,00:12:25,is because it was made of real lion fur
00:12:25,00:12:28,"and because lions have distinctive fur patterns,"
00:12:28,00:12:29,they had to use the same one
00:12:29,00:12:30,all the way through.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"Because if they wore a different lion,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,"they'd be like, ""Oh, that's just a different lion's costume"
00:12:34,00:12:35,"because it's a different pattern."""
00:12:35,00:12:38,"Wait, as in would a viewer, a casual viewer of the film,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"think, ""Where did the lion go?"
00:12:40,00:12:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:42,00:12:42,Who's this?
00:12:42,00:12:45,"Who's just a new character they've just introduced?"""
00:12:45,00:12:47,"Well, on the other hand, you might say,"
00:12:47,00:12:49,"""Good work,"" to say, ""Let's try and make it"
00:12:49,00:12:50,"as much fun to do it to as possible."""
00:12:50,00:12:52,And probably to kill as few lions as you need to.
00:12:52,00:12:54,I agree with all of this.
00:12:54,00:12:56,I don't know if you needed to kill one.
00:12:56,00:12:58,"If I'm going to be totally honest,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,was the real lion fur completely necessary?
00:13:00,00:13:02,"Because actually, I'm thinking about the character of the film."
00:13:02,00:13:04,He looks nothing like a lion.
00:13:04,00:13:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:05,00:13:07,"They could have just put a yellow carpet on him, couldn't they?"
00:13:07,00:13:08,"And then, ""Oh, we'll just keep using the same yellow..."""
00:13:08,00:13:10,"Actually, use the second yellow carpet."
00:13:10,00:13:10,It doesn't matter.
00:13:10,00:13:13,I had no idea that that was an actual lion's costume.
00:13:13,00:13:13,That was a real lion's fur.
00:13:13,00:13:15,"""What? How about perm?"
00:13:15,00:13:16,"Lions don't have that natural perm."""
00:13:16,00:13:18,"Like, the head bit was separate."
00:13:18,00:13:20,The head bit was moulded.
00:13:20,00:13:23,But the actual fur bit was real fur.
00:13:23,00:13:24,"Oh, right."
00:13:24,00:13:25,The one with the furringed.
00:13:25,00:13:26,Another interesting thing about that
00:13:26,00:13:29,is that it went up for auction in 2014.
00:13:29,00:13:31,And one way of authenticating it
00:13:31,00:13:33,is they looked at the patterns on the movie
00:13:33,00:13:35,and they could see it was the same
00:13:35,00:13:37,on the costume that they had.
00:13:37,00:13:38,So they knew it was real.
00:13:38,00:13:38,Ah.
00:13:38,00:13:41,"And it sold for $3 million,"
00:13:41,00:13:43,which makes it the third highest priced outfit
00:13:43,00:13:45,ever sold from a Hollywood film.
00:13:45,00:13:46,Incredible.
00:13:46,00:13:47,And the winner is...
00:13:47,00:13:48,Can we guess the others?
00:13:48,00:13:50,I think you can guess one of them.
00:13:50,00:13:52,Batman's costume with the nipples on from the TV.
00:13:52,00:13:53,The TV version.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Very true.
00:13:54,00:13:54,"Very good, no."
00:13:55,00:13:58,"Jim Carrey's wig in Dumb and Dumber, the four haircuts."
00:13:58,00:14:02,"Oh, I'm going to say Ruby Slippers, surely."
00:14:02,00:14:04,So they're not from that movie.
00:14:04,00:14:06,Marilyn Monroe's dress from...
00:14:06,00:14:07,Is it the 70-year-rich?
00:14:07,00:14:08,The winner from the 70-year-rich.
00:14:08,00:14:11,$4.6 million that sold for.
00:14:11,00:14:12,"Rosebud, the sleigh from..."
00:14:12,00:14:13,"No, you won't get the other one."
00:14:13,00:14:14,That's not a costume.
00:14:14,00:14:16,That was an actor in that.
00:14:16,00:14:19,"Not that you won't know it, but you won't have guessed it."
00:14:19,00:14:21,It's Audrey Hepburn's dress from My Fair Lady.
00:14:21,00:14:22,"Oh, from My Fair Lady?"
00:14:22,00:14:23,Wow.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"Yeah, that's incredible."
00:14:24,00:14:26,"Andy, back to your point very quickly about..."
00:14:26,00:14:28,He was going through lots of different careers
00:14:28,00:14:30,"and he finally had enough and he was like,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,"""I'm going to become a proper writer."""
00:14:32,00:14:34,And he sits down finally to write The Wizard of Oz.
00:14:34,00:14:36,I really like this because you do often wonder
00:14:36,00:14:39,if you've written something that is going to change the world.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"I always wondered, does an author have that feeling?"
00:14:41,00:14:42,He clearly did.
00:14:42,00:14:44,He got to the end of it and he had his pencil
00:14:44,00:14:46,that he'd used to write the manuscript with
00:14:46,00:14:48,and it was right down to the nub.
00:14:48,00:14:50,And he immediately framed that pencil
00:14:50,00:14:53,because he knew that he'd written something that was great.
00:14:53,00:14:55,It was next to his window display pencil
00:14:55,00:14:58,and it had his exotic chicken pencils in it.
00:14:58,00:15:07,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:15:07,00:15:11,My fact is that the journey towards modern weight loss drugs
00:15:11,00:15:15,begins with the venom of a Gila monster.
00:15:15,00:15:17,Do you mean a Gila monster?
00:15:17,00:15:20,I do and that is how I've seen it written down.
00:15:20,00:15:21,It's because I don't live in Utah.
00:15:21,00:15:23,I've never heard it called a Gila monster.
00:15:23,00:15:25,We have had this discussion before we came on Mike
00:15:25,00:15:27,and I always called it a Gila monster
00:15:27,00:15:28,but apparently you've been wrong.
00:15:28,00:15:29,"No, it's not."
00:15:29,00:15:31,I don't even think you need to do the...
00:15:31,00:15:32,"Yeah, I don't know where that came from."
00:15:32,00:15:34,I think it's just...
00:15:34,00:15:34,What do you meant to say?
00:15:34,00:15:35,"Just Gila, right?"
00:15:35,00:15:36,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
00:15:36,00:15:39,It's healing people and it's a Gila monster.
00:15:39,00:15:40,Oh my god.
00:15:40,00:15:42,We blowed the shit wide open.
00:15:42,00:15:42,"Wow, wow, wow."
00:15:42,00:15:43,You've got to reword the fact.
00:15:43,00:15:44,That's terrific.
00:15:44,00:15:48,So I read this on a great blog called Astral Codex 10
00:15:48,00:15:50,and it was from a piece about Ozempic
00:15:50,00:15:52,and it was about this whole class of weight loss drugs
00:15:52,00:15:53,and where they come from.
00:15:53,00:15:56,They're called GLP1 drugs.
00:15:56,00:15:57,They were invented for diabetes
00:15:57,00:15:59,"and then the scientists noticed no, everyone's losing weight."
00:15:59,00:16:01,"Human and rat who were trying this on, they're all losing weight."
00:16:01,00:16:04,The basic thing about these drugs is
00:16:04,00:16:06,and the reason they work for weight loss
00:16:06,00:16:09,"is that when you eat a meal,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,you're intestine detects that you've eaten
00:16:11,00:16:12,and it releases this hormone which is called
00:16:12,00:16:15,"glucagon like peptide 1, GLP1."
00:16:15,00:16:18,That hormone tells your body you're full
00:16:18,00:16:20,and commences operations to sort of deal with it.
00:16:20,00:16:22,"So, you know, your body will, you know,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,it tells you pancreas to release insulin.
00:16:24,00:16:26,It pushes sugar down and so on.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"But the problem is, originally, you couldn't make a synthetic version"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"of that exact chemical, the GLP1,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,because it decays within a minute.
00:16:34,00:16:35,"So if you were going to use that as a drug,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,you would have to inject yourself with it every hour.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"You know, it's not an effective way"
00:16:39,00:16:41,of tricking your body into thinking you're full.
00:16:41,00:16:45,"But in 1992, scientists found that healer monster venom."
00:16:46,00:16:49,"I pulled out of the full Espanola, healer monster venom."
00:16:49,00:16:52,It has this chemical in it which does a similar thing.
00:16:52,00:16:54,"It triggers all the processes that GLP1 does,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,but it lasts two hours.
00:16:56,00:16:59,And so they started playing around with the structure of that
00:16:59,00:17:00,and making a synthetic version of that.
00:17:00,00:17:03,"And they came up with something called exenotide,"
00:17:03,00:17:05,which was sold to treat diabetes.
00:17:05,00:17:06,And then other scientists piled in
00:17:06,00:17:08,"and started, you know, the thing which led to his M pic."
00:17:08,00:17:10,"Yeah, I really like."
00:17:10,00:17:12,"So it was 1984, Dr. Daniel Drucker."
00:17:12,00:17:13,I have a lot of connection to that.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"I was born in '84, called Daniel as well."
00:17:15,00:17:17,Got it spooky.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"It's really weird, isn't it?"
00:17:18,00:17:21,Jesus Christ.
00:17:21,00:17:24,I love that he found out this thing about the healer monster
00:17:24,00:17:25,"and thought, I need to test it,"
00:17:25,00:17:27,but they didn't have any of its DNA in the bank.
00:17:27,00:17:28,So any that they did wasn't usable.
00:17:28,00:17:31,So he had to get in contact with a zoo.
00:17:31,00:17:34,He had to go and actually get one in person
00:17:34,00:17:35,and had to apply for them to go and find one.
00:17:35,00:17:36,He didn't go and get one.
00:17:36,00:17:38,"Well, they actually, it fluted him on a plane."
00:17:38,00:17:39,Yeah.
00:17:39,00:17:40,"Yeah, it was good too."
00:17:40,00:17:43,We'd go in the zoo and sneak one out and just come.
00:17:43,00:17:46,But he sort of talks about how it was very different back then
00:17:46,00:17:48,when you were trying to get any of these kind of DNAs
00:17:48,00:17:50,that you had a theory about.
00:17:50,00:17:51,And that's what it was.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"He said, I think this could be to help diabetes."
00:17:53,00:17:55,"And they went, fine, that's good enough."
00:17:55,00:17:56,We'll go and get you one.
00:17:56,00:17:58,It came in a cage with a metal bottom
00:17:58,00:18:00,because they're so good at digging healer monsters
00:18:00,00:18:02,"that they thought if we put it in any other cage,"
00:18:02,00:18:03,it will just dig its way out.
00:18:03,00:18:05,Dig its way through the bottom of the plane.
00:18:05,00:18:10,"Oh my God, imagine if that's what caused a terrible tragedy."
00:18:10,00:18:11,So then he did this work.
00:18:11,00:18:13,And then there was a guy called John Eng
00:18:13,00:18:15,who synthesized a version.
00:18:15,00:18:18,So this Daniel Drucker was working with actual healer monsters.
00:18:18,00:18:21,"And then John Eng came up with this version,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"which was fake, not fake, but you know what I mean."
00:18:23,00:18:24,It was synthetic.
00:18:24,00:18:25,"Yeah, synthetic."
00:18:25,00:18:27,"And he had never seen a healer monster in his entire,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,he probably pronounced it Gila monster like that.
00:18:29,00:18:33,He'd never seen one in his whole life at that stage.
00:18:33,00:18:34,"Also, we should say, obviously,"
00:18:34,00:18:37,"as Epic has become one of the most valuable,"
00:18:37,00:18:39,remarkable drugs in the world.
00:18:39,00:18:41,"It does sound like the beginning of a horror film, doesn't it?"
00:18:41,00:18:42,"Like, it was great."
00:18:42,00:18:45,We all started inventing this synthetic lizard saliva
00:18:45,00:18:48,and the effects were great at first.
00:18:48,00:18:53,"We should also say that Novo Nodesk, who make as Epic,"
00:18:53,00:18:56,they say that the Gila monster study has nothing to do with Epic.
00:18:56,00:19:02,And that it was an important step in the making of this kind of drugs.
00:19:02,00:19:05,But their work was separate to the Gila monster.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"Well, actually, I don't know if you know this,"
00:19:06,00:19:09,"but the Gila effect, James, is the name for when Gila monsters"
00:19:09,00:19:13,are not given due credit for the inventions that they make.
00:19:13,00:19:16,There isn't an enormous bank of Gila monsters
00:19:16,00:19:20,somewhere in Denmark being systemically drained of their venom.
00:19:20,00:19:20,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:20,00:19:21,That's not.
00:19:21,00:19:25,"But it did take about 20 years between the Gila monster discovery,"
00:19:25,00:19:29,all the way for it to be approved by the American pharmaceutical companies.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"Yeah, that's because it was two different."
00:19:31,00:19:32,"Yeah, it was a long journey."
00:19:32,00:19:36,"And yeah, so that happened April 28th, 2005, which is my birthday."
00:19:36,00:19:39,"Yeah, that's stunning."
00:19:39,00:19:42,"Your 21st birthday when you became a man is the, my God."
00:19:42,00:19:44,And here's one more thing just to say.
00:19:44,00:19:47,"Like these new drugs that people are taking to make them thinner,"
00:19:47,00:19:52,"it gives you this GLP1, which helps you not want to eat."
00:19:52,00:19:54,You can get GLP1 naturally.
00:19:54,00:19:57,Good news for everyone.
00:19:57,00:20:00,"But unfortunately, you have to eat basically healthy foods and exercise."
00:20:01,00:20:04,"Well, guys, it doesn't have to be that healthy."
00:20:04,00:20:08,You could literally just eat porridge instead of taking a Zempik.
00:20:08,00:20:09,And it does the same thing.
00:20:09,00:20:11,And that's an exaggeration because it's not nearly as powerful.
00:20:11,00:20:14,"But I did find it really interesting, the role of fiber."
00:20:14,00:20:17,I had no idea what fiber did as an appetite suppressant.
00:20:17,00:20:20,So it does the same thing when you eat fiber.
00:20:20,00:20:23,It goes through your digestive system really slowly.
00:20:23,00:20:24,You can't really digest it.
00:20:24,00:20:26,"So usually the stuff you eat, like Andy said,"
00:20:26,00:20:29,"it triggers the release of this GLP, which tells your body,"
00:20:29,00:20:31,"""I'm full. Don't eat anymore."""
00:20:31,00:20:32,But then it goes away really fast.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"If you eat loads of fiber, some brown bread, some porridge,"
00:20:35,00:20:38,then that takes ages getting to your colon.
00:20:38,00:20:41,And then that triggers way more release of it later on.
00:20:41,00:20:43,"So as Zempik does, it will tell you,"
00:20:43,00:20:46,"""I'm full two hours, three hours after you've eaten."""
00:20:46,00:20:47,"There's a weird thing about Zempik,"
00:20:47,00:20:50,which is that it works inside the brain.
00:20:50,00:20:52,So the anti-diabetic effect happens in your intestine
00:20:52,00:20:54,because that's where the GLP1 is released.
00:20:54,00:20:58,And that is what triggers the body to slow down its release of sugar.
00:20:58,00:21:01,"For example, to prevent a big sugar spike."
00:21:01,00:21:03,But scientists didn't know for a long time
00:21:03,00:21:09,exactly how Zempik controls the mental sensation of hunger.
00:21:09,00:21:10,And it shouldn't be possible for it to happen
00:21:10,00:21:13,"because there's the thing in your body, the blood-brain barrier,"
00:21:13,00:21:17,"which is meant to keep your brain just working on nice, clean blood"
00:21:17,00:21:18,with no other stuff in it.
00:21:18,00:21:21,Just stops any big molecules from getting in.
00:21:21,00:21:23,"And Zempik, the drug, is a big molecule."
00:21:23,00:21:25,So what the hell is going on?
00:21:25,00:21:27,And it turns out that if a little bit gets in
00:21:27,00:21:30,"and that activates a bit of the brain stem,"
00:21:30,00:21:33,"which in turn acts as a kind of transmitter, relay station,"
00:21:33,00:21:35,"for other bits of the brain,"
00:21:35,00:21:38,that then makes your brain generate its own GLP1
00:21:38,00:21:40,because it's not only made in the intestine.
00:21:40,00:21:42,So that's why you feel less hungry.
00:21:42,00:21:43,That's really weird.
00:21:43,00:21:46,So there's another thing that I was going to mention
00:21:46,00:21:48,"off the back of - I wonder if Fibro would do this for you,"
00:21:48,00:21:48,and I don't think it does.
00:21:48,00:21:53,One of the side effects of taking a Zempik and other weight loss drugs
00:21:53,00:21:57,is a lot of people have reported the stopping of what they call food noise
00:21:57,00:21:58,and food noise.
00:21:58,00:22:01,"I've never personally had it, but if you need -"
00:22:01,00:22:03,"I've sat next to you while you're eating,"
00:22:03,00:22:04,and you do have a lot of food noise.
00:22:04,00:22:06,I have outward food noise.
00:22:06,00:22:08,"Yeah, not inside food noise."
00:22:08,00:22:10,"And inside food noise is if you can't help,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,"but keep eating and keep eating,"
00:22:12,00:22:13,"it's your head talking to you going,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"""We need food. We need food right now."
00:22:15,00:22:15,Do you see that place?
00:22:15,00:22:16,"Why don't you get some food?"""
00:22:16,00:22:18,And it's this thing that people really suffer from
00:22:18,00:22:19,when they're trying to be all done.
00:22:19,00:22:22,I don't think it's always necessarily like a voice saying it.
00:22:22,00:22:23,It could be just a feeling.
00:22:23,00:22:24,Exactly.
00:22:24,00:22:25,They call it the noise.
00:22:25,00:22:28,"And supposedly, a Zempik knocks out the noise as well as suppressing the -"
00:22:28,00:22:30,But is that just because you feel full?
00:22:30,00:22:32,"And so your body, your brains can stop saying it?"
00:22:32,00:22:35,"I think people who are full still have the noise going,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,"""We could probably get a bit more."""
00:22:37,00:22:38,"""We could probably get a bit more."""
00:22:38,00:22:40,"""We could probably get a bit more."""
00:22:40,00:22:40,Another doughnut.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"""Come on, you can do it."""
00:22:42,00:22:44,"It's great that mould off the top, but it's still good."
00:22:44,00:22:47,"It is the case that it's not just about when you're full,"
00:22:47,00:22:50,"because it stops other cravings, I think."
00:22:50,00:22:54,So it's supposed to be quite good for people who are addicted to other things.
00:22:54,00:22:54,Yes.
00:22:54,00:22:57,"And unfortunately, people who are addicted to exercise,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,it seems to stop you from wanting to exercise.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"You don't need to anymore, you've been."
00:23:01,00:23:07,We haven't actually mentioned the real major player in the Zempik story.
00:23:07,00:23:09,And that is the great theme tune it has.
00:23:09,00:23:12,"You know, Magic by Van Kled Pilot."
00:23:12,00:23:15,"So that it's, ""Oh, whoa, whoa, it's magic."""
00:23:15,00:23:16,You know that one?
00:23:16,00:23:16,Okay.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"Okay, Andy doesn't know it."
00:23:17,00:23:20,"Well, we might not be able to put that in for legal reasons,"
00:23:20,00:23:21,but we'll Google it if we haven't.
00:23:21,00:23:24,"But they changed it to, ""Okay, so, oh, oh, it's magic."""
00:23:24,00:23:24,Oh.
00:23:24,00:23:27,"They changed it to, ""Oh, oh, oh, ozempik."""
00:23:27,00:23:29,"And so, everyone was singing it."
00:23:29,00:23:31,"And they were saying that psychologically,"
00:23:31,00:23:33,"they think it worked really well, because it's such an upbeat song."
00:23:33,00:23:36,"It makes you feel good, but you all at the certain age know"
00:23:36,00:23:38,"that the word that ozempik represents is magic,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,and magic is now in your head.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"And so, the lead singer of Pilot had no idea that this was happening."
00:23:44,00:23:46,"He just started getting messages going,"
00:23:46,00:23:47,"""I'm hearing your song everywhere in America."""
00:23:47,00:23:49,"And he was like, ""What's going on?"""
00:23:49,00:23:51,"Because they're able to license the song out,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,no one had to ask him for its use of adverts and...
00:23:54,00:23:56,"Okay, so it sounds like we can use it."
00:23:56,00:23:57,Sing the whole thing.
00:23:57,00:24:01,"Unfortunately, it'll be owned by a huge multinational music company."
00:24:01,00:24:02,"That's the issue, yeah."
00:24:02,00:24:04,"But so, he himself is so on board with it"
00:24:04,00:24:06,that he's even gone back to Abbey Road
00:24:06,00:24:09,to record the ozempik version of the song.
00:24:09,00:24:13,"Is it possible that all of the science behind ozempik is nonsense,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,and the only way it works is that that theme tune
00:24:15,00:24:17,has replaced food noise in people's heads?
00:24:17,00:24:19,That could be it.
00:24:19,00:24:21,Shall we go on to Healer Monsters?
00:24:21,00:24:24,"I said at the start, we're blowing shit wide open."
00:24:24,00:24:27,They do open their bums to keep cool.
00:24:27,00:24:30,Clever.
00:24:30,00:24:30,Can they do it?
00:24:30,00:24:33,"Can they just, with thought, or like with muscle movement?"
00:24:33,00:24:34,They don't hold it open.
00:24:34,00:24:35,They don't hold it open.
00:24:35,00:24:36,That's what I'm asking.
00:24:36,00:24:38,They don't have a poseable thumb stand.
00:24:38,00:24:40,What do you do with a finger?
00:24:40,00:24:41,"Well, they could do each other's."
00:24:41,00:24:46,"Basically, a lot of reptiles keep themselves cool by opening their mouths."
00:24:46,00:24:48,"But they can open the cloacas as well,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"which will help moisture evaporate,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,and it can cool them by up to three degrees.
00:24:52,00:24:55,"That is a lot for Healer Monster parties that must be,"
00:24:55,00:24:56,"""Are you feeling too hot?"""
00:24:56,00:24:56,No.
00:24:56,00:24:58,I think you are.
00:24:58,00:25:01,Shut your asshole at the dinner table.
00:25:01,00:25:05,"Because they're found in the desert of North America, aren't they?"
00:25:05,00:25:09,"Yeah, they have underground mostly, because it's so hot."
00:25:09,00:25:10,They only come out for a few weeks each year.
00:25:10,00:25:12,You just see a bum sticking out.
00:25:12,00:25:15,"But their tail as well, right, is amazing."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"When I was reading about them, I thought,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"""Well, that's a cool thing. I wish we could do that as well."""
00:25:19,00:25:20,"Well, store your fat in a tail."
00:25:20,00:25:24,"Yeah, so it means that they only need a few meals per year, basically,"
00:25:24,00:25:26,"and if they're in trouble, that's their stock sitting there,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,all the fat in their tail.
00:25:28,00:25:29,"There's another thing they can do,"
00:25:29,00:25:34,"and this, I'm afraid, is at that end of the body related to the bum thing."
00:25:34,00:25:36,"They store water in their bladder, right?"
00:25:36,00:25:37,"And then the phrase I found was,"
00:25:37,00:25:40,"""They reabsorb it across the bladder epithelium."""
00:25:40,00:25:46,And what that means is they can have a reverse piss inside themselves back into their system.
00:25:46,00:25:47,It's not mad.
00:25:47,00:25:50,Can they do that just with thought?
00:25:50,00:25:51,Or do they have to shut their hands off?
00:25:51,00:25:54,Squeeze.
00:25:54,00:26:05,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:26:05,00:26:08,"My fact this week is that for many years in the 2000s,"
00:26:08,00:26:13,New Zealand's highest-earning sports personality was Tiger Woods' caddy.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"It's a bit embarrassing, isn't it?"
00:26:15,00:26:19,"Well, who's your greatest sports star by brute force of economics?"
00:26:19,00:26:22,Is this guy who carries stuff around?
00:26:22,00:26:23,"Oh, there's a lot more to it than that."
00:26:23,00:26:25,There's so much more.
00:26:25,00:26:26,It's an incredible job.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"Being a caddy, if you don't carry the things around, you do get fired."
00:26:29,00:26:34,That's undoubtedly the main part.
00:26:34,00:26:35,I'll give you that.
00:26:35,00:26:36,How much are we talking?
00:26:36,00:26:39,"Well, I very specifically worded it as personality."
00:26:39,00:26:41,"Obviously, it's not sports star, you know."
00:26:41,00:26:46,"The 2000s, you would have had Jonah Lomu, you would have had all these characters."
00:26:46,00:26:48,"I didn't want to call, and his name is Steve Williams."
00:26:48,00:26:51,I didn't want to call him very specifically a sports star.
00:26:51,00:26:53,I would say he's famous in the golfing world.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Absolutely.
00:26:54,00:26:59,"The reason he got so rich is because caddies have a salary, right?"
00:26:59,00:27:02,They get paid all year round by their golfers if they're playing the whole year.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"But on top of that, when the golfer wins something,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,a percentage of it goes to the caddy.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"Now, those numbers are sometimes hidden."
00:27:09,00:27:11,It's often thought to be 10% of what they get.
00:27:11,00:27:16,"So if you're winning, you know, a million dollars, that's a good amount."
00:27:16,00:27:18,And he was Tiger Woods's caddy.
00:27:18,00:27:21,"There was an unprecedented, I think I'm right in saying, James, moment in golf,"
00:27:21,00:27:23,where he won all the majors.
00:27:23,00:27:25,He won four back-to-back.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"And Woods, were there signs on the golf course"
00:27:27,00:27:28,that it was going to the caddies head?
00:27:28,00:27:32,"Like, was he turning up with a golden bag and things like this, you know?"
00:27:32,00:27:34,"He had his own caddy, I think."
00:27:34,00:27:38,"Yeah, I don't really do the carrying part."
00:27:38,00:27:40,It's not really for me that.
00:27:40,00:27:44,"Yeah, I think they're all quite humble caddies,"
00:27:44,00:27:46,"actually, having met a few in my life."
00:27:46,00:27:50,"I think, and because it's historical, isn't it?"
00:27:50,00:27:52,"It goes back to, you guys must have found this."
00:27:52,00:27:55,It was like people in Edinburgh or something.
00:27:55,00:27:56,A few hundred years.
00:27:56,00:27:58,"And they used to be kind of general porters in Scotland,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,"who were, the word caddy was applied to just someone."
00:28:00,00:28:02,It was like a delivery driver kind of thing.
00:28:02,00:28:03,Yeah.
00:28:03,00:28:06,It was a kind of person who would pick you up something
00:28:06,00:28:07,and bring it to your house.
00:28:07,00:28:11,And they were unionized and stuff like taxi drivers kind of thing.
00:28:11,00:28:13,"And, you know, if you needed someone to do you a job,"
00:28:13,00:28:15,then you would just get a caddy to do it.
00:28:15,00:28:16,"Right, yeah."
00:28:16,00:28:19,"And the thing they seem very keen to emphasize now,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"which probably people don't know who aren't into golf,"
00:28:21,00:28:24,"is that there is more to it than carrying all the clubs around,"
00:28:24,00:28:25,even though that's the main part.
00:28:25,00:28:25,Yeah.
00:28:25,00:28:28,And I didn't know that they do give lots of advice.
00:28:28,00:28:29,"I'd actually like to know from James,"
00:28:29,00:28:32,"actually, in reality, on the golf pitch."
00:28:32,00:28:34,Jesus.
00:28:34,00:28:36,"You know, how much do they do that?"
00:28:36,00:28:37,"Because the idea is with a caddy,"
00:28:37,00:28:39,"you have to know the whole course,"
00:28:39,00:28:40,like all the bumps and lumps.
00:28:40,00:28:42,Are they like a pilot for a ship?
00:28:42,00:28:44,"You know, you have pilots who know the local terrain"
00:28:44,00:28:47,and advise how to get out of this particular river
00:28:47,00:28:48,without bumping in something.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"Okay, so if you play normal golf with your mates,"
00:28:51,00:28:52,you don't have a caddy.
00:28:52,00:28:52,Okay.
00:28:52,00:28:54,Be very rare to have a caddy.
00:28:54,00:28:56,Would you look like a real tool if you turned up with one?
00:28:56,00:28:57,"Yeah, you would."
00:28:57,00:28:58,"I mean, it would be insane."
00:28:58,00:29:00,"It would be utter, utter insanity."
00:29:00,00:29:04,"However, if you like, let's say you go and play in St Andrews,"
00:29:04,00:29:05,"which is the oldest golf course,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,"one of the oldest golf courses in the world,"
00:29:07,00:29:08,probably the most venerable.
00:29:08,00:29:10,You turn up.
00:29:10,00:29:11,It's a really important moment in your life
00:29:11,00:29:13,because you're a huge golf fan.
00:29:13,00:29:16,They will have caddies there who will carry your bags for you
00:29:16,00:29:18,and give you lots of tips.
00:29:18,00:29:19,"And they will really tell you,"
00:29:19,00:29:21,"okay, on this hole, it looks like you should go to the right,"
00:29:21,00:29:23,"but actually it's better if you go to the left,"
00:29:23,00:29:23,that kind of thing.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Yeah.
00:29:24,00:29:25,"And in the professionals, though,"
00:29:25,00:29:27,"would Tiger Woods have his caddy,"
00:29:27,00:29:28,"you know, give him advice?"
00:29:28,00:29:28,Yeah.
00:29:28,00:29:29,"Or like, they're too good."
00:29:29,00:29:30,"Like, you know, in reality,"
00:29:30,00:29:31,would it be a free shot?
00:29:31,00:29:33,"So before the round start,"
00:29:33,00:29:36,your caddy would walk out and walk the whole course.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"They would make their books,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"which would tell you where all the shots come in from,"
00:29:39,00:29:40,the different yardages.
00:29:40,00:29:42,"They, yeah, they just give you lots of advice."
00:29:42,00:29:44,The suggestions about which irons to use
00:29:44,00:29:46,because you have multiple different ones.
00:29:46,00:29:48,"You have, you know, it goes even deeper than that."
00:29:48,00:29:50,"Like, for example, in Tiger Woods's case,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,there was one time when there was a boulder in the way of his ball.
00:29:52,00:29:55,So he hit his ball and it landed behind the boulder.
00:29:55,00:29:58,"And they worked out that the boulder was loose on the ground,"
00:29:58,00:30:00,which meant it was a loose impediment.
00:30:00,00:30:02,"And his caddy, Sisyphus, was able to..."
00:30:02,00:30:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:03,00:30:05,Temporarily remove it.
00:30:05,00:30:06,"Just for the moment, yeah."
00:30:06,00:30:07,"But no, and so that was his job."
00:30:07,00:30:08,He had to get down.
00:30:08,00:30:11,I think what happened there is they got a load of people
00:30:11,00:30:12,who were watching to move it.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"It was part, actually, Tiger Woods had such a large team"
00:30:14,00:30:15,that it was his team.
00:30:15,00:30:16,"But legally on the rules,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,you can have onlookers come and move an object.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"If it's just sort of resting on the ground, rather."
00:30:21,00:30:22,"Yeah, exactly."
00:30:22,00:30:24,"So because it was loose, he was allowed to move it."
00:30:24,00:30:26,"This Steve Williams, who we're talking about,"
00:30:26,00:30:29,he used to be the caddy for Raymond Floyd.
00:30:29,00:30:31,"One of his jobs was when Raymond hit the ball,"
00:30:32,00:30:33,towards the hole.
00:30:33,00:30:36,Both Raymond and Steve had to stare at the ball
00:30:36,00:30:38,and will it into the hole?
00:30:38,00:30:39,That was part of his job?
00:30:39,00:30:40,Part of his job.
00:30:40,00:30:42,Is that his job description?
00:30:42,00:30:44,"Well, you might get fired if it doesn't go in,"
00:30:44,00:30:46,"and he looks at you and says, ""You weren't willing it."""
00:30:46,00:30:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:47,00:30:48,That was your fault.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"So yeah, so yeah, it's a real..."
00:30:50,00:30:54,"It's like when you watch those car races that are off-road,"
00:30:54,00:30:55,where they've got someone sitting there
00:30:55,00:30:57,"with a little buck telling it, ""It's like that."""
00:30:57,00:30:57,"Really, drivers?"
00:30:57,00:30:58,Yeah.
00:30:58,00:31:01,"Well, so there was a very famous caddy,"
00:31:01,00:31:04,"troop, in the Augusta National Golf Course,"
00:31:04,00:31:07,"which I guess is the biggest deal in the world,"
00:31:07,00:31:08,"as a golf course, one of the biggest deals in the world."
00:31:08,00:31:09,One of the biggest.
00:31:09,00:31:10,A big deal.
00:31:10,00:31:10,Yeah.
00:31:10,00:31:11,It's where the masters happens.
00:31:11,00:31:12,Correct.
00:31:12,00:31:12,America.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"America, yes."
00:31:13,00:31:14,Thank you.
00:31:14,00:31:15,In Georgia.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"Okay, got it, got it."
00:31:16,00:31:18,"And they had a very famous troop of caddies,"
00:31:18,00:31:22,"so it was started in the 1930s, 1934, I think,"
00:31:22,00:31:24,"and the caddies were all sourced from a local area,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,"which was a completely black area,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,and they were all like black kids
00:31:27,00:31:28,who were making a bit of extra money
00:31:28,00:31:30,by carrying their bags around.
00:31:30,00:31:34,"And between 1934 and 1983, I think it was,"
00:31:34,00:31:36,it was like all black caddies who were sourced from there.
00:31:36,00:31:39,"I think the first white caddy there was 1983,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,"when golfers started bringing their own,"
00:31:41,00:31:42,which was very controversial.
00:31:42,00:31:45,But the godfather of the Augusta caddies
00:31:45,00:31:47,"was this guy called Willie Pappy Stokes,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,"who started when he was 12,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,and he ran this caddy's school.
00:31:51,00:31:52,"But yeah, they set a lot of the golfers at the time,"
00:31:52,00:31:56,said it was completely down to the caddies that they won.
00:31:56,00:31:58,"There was a champion called Fuzzy Zella,"
00:31:58,00:31:59,who was very famous.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"Yeah, we all know the champion called Fuzzy Zella."
00:32:02,00:32:03,We all know Fuzzy.
00:32:03,00:32:05,And we all know that he was the only person
00:32:05,00:32:07,ever to win the Masters on his debut.
00:32:07,00:32:11,"And when he did so, he said, it was nothing to do with him,"
00:32:11,00:32:13,"he said he was led around by Jerry Beard,"
00:32:13,00:32:16,"his caddy, like a blind man with a seeing eye dog."
00:32:16,00:32:17,Fuzzy and Beard.
00:32:17,00:32:21,"Is that your takeaway of that, Anna Gollum?"
00:32:21,00:32:22,It's all I can remember.
00:32:22,00:32:25,"Is this true, James?"
00:32:25,00:32:25,I don't know if you...
00:32:25,00:32:28,That's the person who plays golf here.
00:32:28,00:32:30,They're known as the 15th club.
00:32:30,00:32:33,I can understand that because you're only allowed 14 clubs.
00:32:33,00:32:34,Right. And there's this great...
00:32:34,00:32:36,"But you're not allowed to use them for that, are you?"
00:32:36,00:32:39,"Yeah, it's rare circumstances where..."
00:32:39,00:32:45,"They're a bit like the daemon in Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, you know?"
00:32:45,00:32:47,"Yeah, they're always a different animal."
00:32:47,00:32:51,"They're so umbilically tied to the golfer,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"you know, that's a real team thing."
00:32:53,00:32:55,"There's a golfer, right."
00:32:55,00:32:57,"If I'm saying his name wrong, I'm sorry, Ian Woozenham."
00:32:57,00:32:58,Correct.
00:32:58,00:33:02,He was doing extremely well in 2000 in the Open Championship.
00:33:02,00:33:03,He was playing the golf of his life.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"Yeah, he was very far ahead."
00:33:05,00:33:06,"Oh, Woosie."
00:33:06,00:33:06,Woosie.
00:33:06,00:33:09,That is his nickname.
00:33:09,00:33:09,Woosie.
00:33:09,00:33:11,Has Fuzzy ever played Woosie?
00:33:11,00:33:15,"And then at this key moment when he was doing brilliantly,"
00:33:15,00:33:16,"his caddy said to him,"
00:33:16,00:33:19,"""There's too many clubs in the bag."""
00:33:19,00:33:22,And he'd miscounted the number of clubs.
00:33:22,00:33:26,"And the golfer, Woozenham, had to go up to the judge, umpire,"
00:33:27,00:33:29,"manage charge, rules official."
00:33:29,00:33:29,There we go.
00:33:29,00:33:33,"And say, ""I've got 14, I've got 15 clubs."""
00:33:33,00:33:34,"Yeah, this is a shot for every hole, I think."
00:33:34,00:33:38,He was penalized a couple of strokes and he lost his cool.
00:33:38,00:33:42,"And it was all the fault of the caddy, just not counting."
00:33:42,00:33:42,How many?
00:33:42,00:33:44,Because he'd tried two different versions of the same club
00:33:44,00:33:46,and then they'd all just gone into the bag.
00:33:46,00:33:46,That's terrible.
00:33:46,00:33:48,And he was ahead and he would have won big money
00:33:48,00:33:49,and then he didn't.
00:33:49,00:33:50,And then he was forgiven.
00:33:50,00:33:53,"Woozenham forgave him, probably through quite a gritted teeth."
00:33:53,00:33:56,"And then the next, he failed to show up on time for an early tee off."
00:33:56,00:33:59,"I think a few, not long after that, I think he got shown the door."
00:33:59,00:34:01,"Fair, absolutely fair."
00:34:01,00:34:02,They do get fired every now and then.
00:34:02,00:34:06,"There's a guy called Robert Allenby, who's an Australian golfer."
00:34:06,00:34:08,"And he has fired a couple of caddies,"
00:34:08,00:34:11,"but one of them, he fired them halfway through the round."
00:34:11,00:34:13,And so one of the spectators had to come in
00:34:13,00:34:14,and carry his bag for the rest.
00:34:14,00:34:14,Really?
00:34:14,00:34:18,"That's good to be a serious infraction, if it's..."
00:34:18,00:34:20,I think he was a troubled man at the time
00:34:20,00:34:23,and they'd had a bit of a set too.
00:34:23,00:34:23,Okay.
00:34:23,00:34:25,Did the spectator provide the advice?
00:34:25,00:34:27,"Or was he going, ""You hit it sort of over that way?"""
00:34:27,00:34:29,A bit higher than you did before.
00:34:29,00:34:31,"It does sound really scary,"
00:34:31,00:34:33,like the intensity of some of these moments
00:34:33,00:34:35,because of the penalties that you can get.
00:34:35,00:34:37,That's fascinated by the rules of golf.
00:34:37,00:34:40,There's a story from that same period with Tiger Woods
00:34:40,00:34:44,"and with Steve Williams, where it's the final day"
00:34:44,00:34:45,of one of the major tournaments.
00:34:45,00:34:48,And he's going into the bag to get Tiger Woods a ball.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"And he's suddenly like, ""There's way less balls in here."
00:34:50,00:34:52,There's only three balls in here.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"There's meant to be six."""
00:34:53,00:34:54,"And what happened was,"
00:34:54,00:34:57,Tiger Woods had been practicing putting in his hotel room
00:34:57,00:35:00,and forgot to put three balls back inside into the bag.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"Yeah, that's what he was doing in his hotel room."
00:35:02,00:35:06,So he's...
00:35:06,00:35:07,So that's Tiger Woods' fault?
00:35:07,00:35:09,"Tiger Woods' fault, except no, it's Steve's fault."
00:35:09,00:35:11,Steve should have checked the balls before they started.
00:35:11,00:35:12,Now the game has started.
00:35:12,00:35:14,"And the issue is, if you can't say to the guy next to you,"
00:35:14,00:35:15,"""Can I borrow one of your balls?"""
00:35:15,00:35:16,"If he's playing with a different one,"
00:35:16,00:35:20,you will get a penalty and strokes will be added to your count.
00:35:20,00:35:22,"So he's going, ""You've got three balls."
00:35:22,00:35:22,Don't tell Tiger.
00:35:22,00:35:24,"It's absolutely fine."""
00:35:24,00:35:26,"Tiger hits the first ball, scuffs it,"
00:35:26,00:35:27,"goes, ""Oh, this is crap."
00:35:27,00:35:28,"Hands it to a kid."""
00:35:28,00:35:30,"Steve goes, ""I can't take it off the kid."
00:35:30,00:35:32,This is live TV.
00:35:32,00:35:33,"It's going to look so bad."""
00:35:33,00:35:34,So he doesn't do that.
00:35:34,00:35:35,"Then they go, and then later in the game..."
00:35:35,00:35:36,"He's very brave to have to ask,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"""A kid, can I have my ball back?"""
00:35:38,00:35:41,"Yeah, true."
00:35:41,00:35:44,And then he hits it off into a spot
00:35:44,00:35:46,where I think he wants to reset the ball.
00:35:46,00:35:47,"So he goes, ""Give me my next ball."""
00:35:47,00:35:49,Now Steve knows this is the final ball.
00:35:49,00:35:52,So things are going to screw everything over for Tiger Woods
00:35:52,00:35:54,if he doesn't land this next shot.
00:35:54,00:35:55,I'm so stressed.
00:35:55,00:35:55,I know.
00:35:55,00:35:56,That's the thing.
00:35:56,00:35:57,It's like high octane.
00:35:57,00:35:58,It's like a poly-13.
00:35:58,00:35:59,"Anyway, it makes the shot and it's fine."
00:35:59,00:36:01,But you don't really know what's going on.
00:36:01,00:36:02,Is that it?
00:36:02,00:36:04,Does the poly-13 end abruptly as well?
00:36:04,00:36:07,"Yeah, it all works out fine."
00:36:07,00:36:08,"Yeah, it's all fine."
00:36:08,00:36:08,Right.
00:36:08,00:36:09,Okay.
00:36:09,00:36:10,It's intense.
00:36:10,00:36:10,"Yeah, wow."
00:36:10,00:36:12,It's so intense.
00:36:12,00:36:14,There's one other caddy who got fired that I read about.
00:36:14,00:36:16,I don't know if you guys know about him.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"So first of all, they all have nicknames, apparently,"
00:36:18,00:36:19,which is quite cool.
00:36:19,00:36:20,"Literally, every caddy seems to have a nickname"
00:36:20,00:36:23,like John Stovepipe Gordon or Frank Marbleye Stokes.
00:36:23,00:36:26,And there was one called Willie Cemetery-Pertit
00:36:26,00:36:29,who was Dwight Eisenhower's caddy.
00:36:29,00:36:29,Oh.
00:36:29,00:36:31,So his nickname Cemetery.
00:36:31,00:36:32,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:32,00:36:33,So his nickname Cemetery.
00:36:33,00:36:35,"So he was fired in the end for being too old and slow,"
00:36:35,00:36:36,but the way he got...
00:36:36,00:36:39,We all get there very slow.
00:36:39,00:36:41,"James, your days are numbered."
00:36:41,00:36:44,"But the reason he got his,"
00:36:44,00:36:46,"the reason he got his nickname,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,it was given to him by Eisenhower
00:36:48,00:36:51,and it was because he by night was a jazz drummer
00:36:51,00:36:52,and he was leaving a gig
00:36:52,00:36:55,and he was jumped by this gang with knives
00:36:55,00:36:56,who had been sent by his ex-girlfriend
00:36:56,00:36:58,who was upset that he dumped her.
00:36:58,00:37:00,And he was very badly injured.
00:37:00,00:37:01,He was sent to hospital.
00:37:01,00:37:03,People thought he was dead.
00:37:03,00:37:07,He basically woke up in a morgue
00:37:07,00:37:08,staring into the eye of a mortician
00:37:08,00:37:09,"who was about to, you know,"
00:37:09,00:37:12,to cover him in wax or whatever and imbarm him
00:37:12,00:37:13,because he'd been given the wrong medicine.
00:37:13,00:37:15,Everyone thought he had died.
00:37:15,00:37:15,Wow.
00:37:15,00:37:18,"And so from that day on, he was called Deadman"
00:37:18,00:37:19,"until Eisenhower said,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,"""I don't like having a caddy who's called Deadman."
00:37:21,00:37:23,"Shall we go with Cemetery?"""
00:37:23,00:37:26,Isn't that a good nickname story?
00:37:26,00:37:26,That is good.
00:37:26,00:37:27,That's really cool.
00:37:27,00:37:28,"That's a solid one, Keith."
00:37:28,00:37:31,I wonder if he's in the caddy hall of fame.
00:37:31,00:37:31,He's not.
00:37:31,00:37:32,He's not?
00:37:32,00:37:33,Oh man.
00:37:33,00:37:35,I had to look into the caddy hall of fame.
00:37:35,00:37:38,130 men and women have been entered into the hall of fame.
00:37:38,00:37:39,129 men.
00:37:39,00:37:39,Exactly.
00:37:39,00:37:42,Actually 128 men.
00:37:42,00:37:43,"There's two women,"
00:37:43,00:37:45,but one of them isn't a caddy.
00:37:45,00:37:46,So it's a lady.
00:37:46,00:37:49,"So Fanny Soonison, who is a very famous caddy."
00:37:49,00:37:53,She was Nick Valdos' caddy for many years.
00:37:53,00:37:55,She's the only actual female caddy in there.
00:37:55,00:37:57,"The other person's called Laura Cohn,"
00:37:57,00:37:59,and she's who founded the caddy hall of fame.
00:37:59,00:38:01,And so she's in there for honorary purposes.
00:38:01,00:38:03,Just to get herself in there.
00:38:03,00:38:03,Yeah.
00:38:03,00:38:04,That's very funny.
00:38:04,00:38:06,Someone else who's in there is George Lucas.
00:38:06,00:38:07,Oh yes.
00:38:07,00:38:07,Yeah.
00:38:07,00:38:09,It's a caddy hall of fame.
00:38:09,00:38:09,Absolutely.
00:38:09,00:38:12,"George Lucas started his career as a caddy,"
00:38:12,00:38:15,and he is actually the king of the yardage books
00:38:15,00:38:15,"that James mentioned,"
00:38:15,00:38:17,which is the books that now everyone carries around.
00:38:17,00:38:19,Actually now they've been banned.
00:38:19,00:38:20,Actually.
00:38:20,00:38:21,Have they been fully banned?
00:38:21,00:38:23,Like as in in the last maybe six months.
00:38:23,00:38:24,I'm sorry.
00:38:24,00:38:25,What's a yardage book?
00:38:25,00:38:28,It's a thing where a book that was sort of invented
00:38:28,00:38:30,"by a few individual golfers in the 50s or 60s,"
00:38:30,00:38:32,"where they drew up the complete lay of the land,"
00:38:32,00:38:35,"very detailed, all the contours, the distances,"
00:38:35,00:38:36,the angles and everything.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"And then this George Lucas guy was like,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,I'm going to make an official one.
00:38:40,00:38:42,"Spoiler alert, it actually wasn't the same George Lucas."
00:38:42,00:38:45,"I don't think, although I didn't a hundred percent check."
00:38:45,00:38:46,It is a different George Lucas.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"What an incredibly, incredibly misleading fact."
00:38:49,00:38:52,Jesus.
00:38:52,00:38:53,Here we go.
00:38:53,00:38:54,I'm going to put you back.
00:38:54,00:38:55,Oh great.
00:38:55,00:38:56,Okay.
00:38:56,00:38:58,"He's actually more interesting than George Lucas,"
00:38:58,00:38:59,and they could be the same person
00:38:59,00:39:01,because the way he measures all the distances
00:39:01,00:39:03,is he goes around or he went around golf courses
00:39:03,00:39:06,with a laser and he fired lasers
00:39:06,00:39:08,at different spots on the golf course.
00:39:08,00:39:10,"And you know, the time they took to bounce back"
00:39:10,00:39:11,told him the distance it took.
00:39:11,00:39:14,"Which, if that's not a light saber, yeah."
00:39:14,00:39:14,Yeah.
00:39:14,00:39:15,Right.
00:39:15,00:39:16,I don't know what it is.
00:39:16,00:39:18,"Well, he does insist all the golfers he caddies for"
00:39:18,00:39:21,"will go as they're about to hit with the club, doesn't he?"
00:39:21,00:39:22,Yeah.
00:39:22,00:39:22,Wow.
00:39:22,00:39:23,"Yeah, he's wild."
00:39:23,00:39:25,"He's, what's his nickname?"
00:39:25,00:39:25,He has a nickname.
00:39:25,00:39:28,This is George Lucas.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"George, not that one."
00:39:29,00:39:34,It was something like gorgeous.
00:39:34,00:39:34,Like.
00:39:34,00:39:35,"Oh yeah, gorgeous with a J."
00:39:35,00:39:36,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:36,00:39:37,Wow.
00:39:37,00:39:37,Very nice.
00:39:37,00:39:38,Okay.
00:39:38,00:39:40,"I don't know how I got onto this,"
00:39:40,00:39:45,but I was trying to find sports where you can bring a friend.
00:39:45,00:39:47,"Like, like carrying, I suppose."
00:39:47,00:39:48,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:48,00:39:48,Okay.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"So, you know, weightlifting."
00:39:49,00:39:52,You often have someone to like help you with the weights.
00:39:52,00:39:52,No.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"You would know someone to spot you,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,"you know, when you're lifting a big heavy bar,"
00:39:56,00:39:57,they might be able to step in
00:39:57,00:39:58,if you get into difficulties or whatever.
00:39:58,00:39:59,"In professional stuff, do they?"
00:39:59,00:40:00,I don't know.
00:40:00,00:40:03,But they might do.
00:40:03,00:40:03,They might do.
00:40:03,00:40:04,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:04,00:40:07,"Anyway, just the Google, you know,"
00:40:07,00:40:08,what shows up automatically
00:40:08,00:40:09,when you type in sports where you can.
00:40:10,00:40:11,It's quite interesting.
00:40:11,00:40:12,You've got sports where you can be short.
00:40:12,00:40:14,Oh yeah.
00:40:14,00:40:15,Fair for you.
00:40:15,00:40:16,I didn't look it up.
00:40:16,00:40:21,Sports where you can start late.
00:40:21,00:40:22,"And I thought originally,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,I thought that meant like at noon or whatever.
00:40:24,00:40:27,"Actually, it turns out it's sports where you can start."
00:40:27,00:40:28,If you want to be the L.
00:40:28,00:40:29,Frank Baum of.
00:40:29,00:40:30,Exactly.
00:40:30,00:40:30,That's it.
00:40:30,00:40:31,Exactly.
00:40:31,00:40:32,"Exactly, start late."
00:40:32,00:40:33,And wait a minute.
00:40:33,00:40:35,"If you just, the gun's fired, everyone's gone."
00:40:35,00:40:36,Are you gone?
00:40:36,00:40:38,Just give me a second.
00:40:38,00:40:39,I'll start on the next lap.
00:40:39,00:40:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:40,00:40:42,"And most of those articles,"
00:40:42,00:40:43,I did follow this one.
00:40:43,00:40:45,"It's mostly, look, even if you're 12,"
00:40:45,00:40:47,it turns out you can start this sport
00:40:47,00:40:48,and be fine with it in life.
00:40:48,00:40:49,But the one exception
00:40:49,00:40:51,doesn't seem to be equestrianism.
00:40:51,00:40:52,"Yeah, jockies."
00:40:52,00:40:52,So old.
00:40:52,00:40:54,Show jumpers are often in their mid 40s.
00:40:54,00:40:56,There was another New Zealander
00:40:56,00:40:57,"called Julie Braum,"
00:40:57,00:41:00,who debuted at the Rio Olympics age 62.
00:41:00,00:41:01,"And a lot of the horses are old, too."
00:41:01,00:41:02,Are they?
00:41:02,00:41:03,They're teenagers.
00:41:03,00:41:04,In horses.
00:41:04,00:41:04,In horses.
00:41:04,00:41:05,They're quite old for a horse.
00:41:05,00:41:06,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:06,00:41:09,We've spoken to a lot of sports people
00:41:09,00:41:11,for our other podcasts that we won't go into.
00:41:11,00:41:12,"No, I don't want to mention it here."
00:41:12,00:41:12,It's embarrassing.
00:41:12,00:41:14,It was last year when we did all that plug-in.
00:41:14,00:41:16,"But occasionally,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,"like, I think shooters tended to be a bit late."
00:41:18,00:41:20,"And occasionally, you do come up with someone"
00:41:20,00:41:23,who started when they're at university and stuff.
00:41:23,00:41:26,"Like, you get rowers who start at university and..."
00:41:26,00:41:26,Yeah.
00:41:26,00:41:28,"So it's time to get into it, isn't it?"
00:41:28,00:41:29,Yeah.
00:41:29,00:41:31,"Often in the Paralympics, you start later,"
00:41:31,00:41:33,which is quite hard to decide to do that.
00:41:33,00:41:34,That's a slightly weird thing
00:41:34,00:41:36,"that I wasn't expecting to learn about caddying,"
00:41:36,00:41:39,"which is, I assumed that maybe it was an alternative career"
00:41:39,00:41:41,"once you tried to be a golfer,"
00:41:41,00:41:44,and then you pivoted into that as a secondary job.
00:41:44,00:41:46,But Steve Williams started doing it at six.
00:41:46,00:41:50,"And a lot of caddies started when they were very, very young,"
00:41:50,00:41:52,and that was the primary job.
00:41:52,00:41:53,Is it?
00:41:53,00:41:53,"Like, it's a job."
00:41:53,00:41:54,That is interesting.
00:41:54,00:41:55,It's a skill.
00:41:55,00:41:55,It's a...
00:41:55,00:41:57,It's got this whole...
00:41:57,00:41:58,"The money is so variable,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,"depending on whether you're Tiger Woods' caddy or not,"
00:42:00,00:42:01,basically.
00:42:01,00:42:01,Yeah.
00:42:01,00:42:02,And there have been some controversies.
00:42:02,00:42:04,"Like, there was a golfer some years ago"
00:42:04,00:42:06,"who he won $1.3 million on an event,"
00:42:06,00:42:08,"and he paid his caddy $5,000."
00:42:08,00:42:10,And that was a real controversy.
00:42:10,00:42:11,What is it? How'd you do this?
00:42:11,00:42:12,"That was that Jim Furrick, was it?"
00:42:12,00:42:14,It was Matt Kucha.
00:42:14,00:42:15,"Oh, Matt Kucha, that's right."
00:42:15,00:42:16,Matt Kucha.
00:42:16,00:42:19,And there was a little bit of backlash to that at the time.
00:42:19,00:42:20,"But he said, ""Look, we had an arrangement."
00:42:20,00:42:21,He's very happy with it.
00:42:21,00:42:22,He's earned five grand a week.
00:42:22,00:42:22,"Well done, him."""
00:42:22,00:42:24,He's really happy with that.
00:42:24,00:42:28,"Honestly, still people bring that up to Kucha."
00:42:28,00:42:29,Really?
00:42:29,00:42:30,"In interviews and stuff, yeah."
00:42:30,00:42:32,"So, is it that discreet?"
00:42:32,00:42:33,Because Dan was saying you have to pay some of the prize money
00:42:33,00:42:35,"to them, but it doesn't matter."
00:42:35,00:42:37,"I think his normal caddy wasn't there,"
00:42:37,00:42:38,"so he brought in a new person and said,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,"""I'll pay you this flat sum."""
00:42:40,00:42:41,"Right, so there's not a rule"
00:42:41,00:42:42,which is like you have to pay them 10%.
00:42:42,00:42:46,"Just on rich sports people and jockeys,"
00:42:46,00:42:50,you can be super rich and old as a jockey.
00:42:50,00:42:52,And do you know the--
00:42:52,00:42:52,Keep talking.
00:42:52,00:42:54,"So, I happened to come across a list"
00:42:54,00:42:56,of the 50 most well-paid jockeys in the world.
00:42:56,00:42:57,"Okay, current."
00:42:57,00:42:58,And current.
00:42:58,00:43:02,"And 29 of them are Japanese,"
00:43:02,00:43:04,with 29 out of the top 50 are Japanese.
00:43:04,00:43:06,It's huge in Japan because it's one of the only
00:43:06,00:43:08,four sports you can gamble on legally.
00:43:08,00:43:11,"So, they get loads of money."
00:43:11,00:43:14,"And the top guy, Yutaka Takei, is 56,"
00:43:14,00:43:17,and he's earned a billion dollars.
00:43:17,00:43:18,But what?
00:43:18,00:43:20,I think a lot of that money was when he was a sumo wrestler
00:43:20,00:43:22,before he got the azempic.
00:43:22,00:43:25,You're absolutely correct.
00:43:31,00:43:34,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:43:34,00:43:36,and that is Anna.
00:43:36,00:43:39,My fact this week is that if 88 elephants
00:43:39,00:43:42,"balanced on a 50p piece on a parrotfish's beak,"
00:43:42,00:43:44,the beak would not break.
00:43:44,00:43:48,What part is the 50p piece playing in this?
00:43:48,00:43:52,"It feels like an unnecessary intermediary layer, does it?"
00:43:52,00:43:55,"I'll tell you, I'll tell you what part it's playing."
00:43:55,00:43:57,"Pressure, it depends on area."
00:43:57,00:43:58,"And I think I have to say,"
00:43:58,00:44:00,"and I have to come out and say it at the top,"
00:44:00,00:44:01,"because otherwise, someone's going to mention it."
00:44:01,00:44:03,"I was clicking through some stuff,"
00:44:03,00:44:05,and I ended up weeding an article in Scientific American
00:44:05,00:44:07,called Fun Facts About Teeth.
00:44:07,00:44:09,"And yes, I'm a senior QI researcher,"
00:44:09,00:44:10,and it's a long time since I read an article
00:44:10,00:44:12,called Fun Facts About X.
00:44:12,00:44:14,"But it was a good article, and it was in this article,"
00:44:14,00:44:16,and it said it's about an inch.
00:44:16,00:44:19,"So, if you have them balancing on it, it's where inch."
00:44:19,00:44:22,"So, I thought 50p is about an inch, probably."
00:44:22,00:44:23,One of the old ones.
00:44:23,00:44:25,I had the 50p on its side.
00:44:25,00:44:27,"Did you hit it on its edge, but it's not."
00:44:27,00:44:28,"No, sorry."
00:44:28,00:44:30,"No, I think that would break it."
00:44:30,00:44:31,Sorry.
00:44:31,00:44:32,"No, it's 50p laid down flat."
00:44:32,00:44:35,Then I've got a big apology to make to my parrot fish.
00:44:35,00:44:39,And this is just the power.
00:44:39,00:44:41,We're going to cut to live to see the experiment in action.
00:44:41,00:44:42,Abort!
00:44:42,00:44:44,Abort!
00:44:44,00:44:47,Have you factored in the weight of the 50p?
00:44:47,00:44:49,Because it's exactly 88 elephants.
00:44:49,00:44:50,I haven't.
00:44:50,00:44:55,"Okay, it's 87.9999 elephants, and the 50p piece."
00:44:55,00:44:57,Asian or African elephants?
00:44:57,00:44:59,Bullocks.
00:44:59,00:45:01,"Are we talking full grown males, or are we talking newly hatched?"
00:45:01,00:45:05,"All right, I'm just going to give you the amounts."
00:45:05,00:45:07,"Okay, let's just take away the stupid metaphor,"
00:45:07,00:45:11,and I'll tell you that one square inch can take 530 tons of pressure.
00:45:11,00:45:11,You happy?
00:45:11,00:45:12,"Okay, what's a parrot fish?"
00:45:12,00:45:18,"So, it's a fish, and they have these beaks,"
00:45:18,00:45:22,"so they're the fish you often see on coral reefs gnawing away,"
00:45:22,00:45:24,and they're quite beautiful.
00:45:24,00:45:26,What should move the elephants out of the way?
00:45:27,00:45:30,[Laughter]
00:45:30,00:45:32,"Yeah, it wasn't a great dive."
00:45:32,00:45:34,The reef was covered in elephant dung.
00:45:34,00:45:35,It was horrible.
00:45:35,00:45:38,That's why they're dying out.
00:45:38,00:45:38,Yeah.
00:45:38,00:45:43,"They have, they're very beautiful, except for their faces, I would say,"
00:45:43,00:45:44,and maybe it's just a personal thing.
00:45:44,00:45:46,I get that a lot as well.
00:45:46,00:45:49,[Laughter]
00:45:49,00:45:51,"Because they've got these weird beaks,"
00:45:51,00:45:54,"and it looks a little bit like, if you've ever seen,"
00:45:54,00:45:57,"what's it called, the sheet-ped fish, which has almost human, giant human teeth."
00:45:57,00:45:58,Yeah.
00:45:58,00:46:01,"But their beaks are made from about a thousand teeth,"
00:46:01,00:46:05,"arranged in 15 rows, but they've been compressed and compressed and compressed,"
00:46:05,00:46:09,and sort of a molecular level of woven to make them incredibly hard.
00:46:09,00:46:12,"It's the stiffest biomineral ever found,"
00:46:12,00:46:14,"which, of course, is not the same as the hardest."
00:46:14,00:46:15,It's only the second hardest.
00:46:15,00:46:18,What's the difference between stiff and hard?
00:46:18,00:46:20,The questioner took me a sitting long time to work that out.
00:46:20,00:46:21,Did you have something you did?
00:46:21,00:46:24,"Harder means if you, like, get a diamond on it."
00:46:24,00:46:26,One of them will scratch the other.
00:46:26,00:46:26,Yes.
00:46:26,00:46:27,"Basically, yeah."
00:46:27,00:46:27,Okay.
00:46:27,00:46:28,That's oddness.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"Diffness, I think, is more about how bendable it is."
00:46:30,00:46:33,"So if you try and dent it with your fingernail,"
00:46:33,00:46:37,"it will dent the least out of any, what did you call it, biomineral?"
00:46:37,00:46:39,"Biomineral, yeah, basically just a thing that's made by nature."
00:46:39,00:46:41,"It's fluorapatite, right?"
00:46:41,00:46:43,"Yes, fluorapatite."
00:46:43,00:46:46,And fluorapatite is the same stuff as you get on your teeth
00:46:46,00:46:48,if you use fluoride toothpaste.
00:46:48,00:46:49,Really?
00:46:49,00:46:52,"Your teeth create fluorapatite, which makes them so strong."
00:46:52,00:46:54,I did not know that.
00:46:54,00:46:59,"But I would not be able to, for example, as these fish do, chew coral."
00:46:59,00:47:03,"No, because most of your teeth are made of dentine and other stuff,"
00:47:03,00:47:07,but you do get small amounts of fluorapatite in your teeth if you use fluorine.
00:47:07,00:47:08,That is very cool.
00:47:08,00:47:09,But don't try the elephant trick.
00:47:09,00:47:14,"Okay, so these parrotfish, they're very good in a way for coral reefs,"
00:47:14,00:47:16,"despite the fact they eat large chunks of coral reef,"
00:47:16,00:47:20,"because the reef gets algae growing all over it, doesn't it?"
00:47:20,00:47:24,And that slightly inhibits the growth and the natural functioning of it.
00:47:24,00:47:27,"So along comes Mr. Parrotfish and just crunch, crunch, crunch."
00:47:27,00:47:30,Because it wants to eat the algae.
00:47:30,00:47:32,"Weird thing is the parrotfish don't want to eat the coral,"
00:47:32,00:47:34,"they just want to eat the algae on it, but it's bloody hard to scrape off, isn't it?"
00:47:34,00:47:36,"Yeah, there are loads of species."
00:47:36,00:47:40,Some of them just scrape off and some of them do more gouging.
00:47:40,00:47:43,"And they do all kinds of varieties, but they're massive."
00:47:43,00:47:46,"So each adult green humphead parrotfish,"
00:47:46,00:47:48,"which is a particular species of parrotfish, they're the biggies."
00:47:48,00:47:50,They can get about a metre and a half long.
00:47:50,00:47:55,They can eat five tonnes of reef per year.
00:47:55,00:47:56,It's a lot.
00:47:56,00:47:57,It's so much.
00:47:57,00:47:58,Yeah.
00:47:58,00:48:01,"And then they poo it out, we've mentioned before, as sand basically."
00:48:01,00:48:02,Beautiful white sand.
00:48:02,00:48:04,"Beautiful white sand, they're responsible for so much."
00:48:04,00:48:06,They poo out hundreds of pounds per year.
00:48:06,00:48:10,"A single parrotfish can produce up to 90 kilograms of sand each year,"
00:48:10,00:48:14,which is enough to fill the most popular parasol holder on Amazon.
00:48:14,00:48:18,"At the bottom of a parasol, you have a really heavy sort of thing."
00:48:18,00:48:21,"But it's not always heavy because otherwise, how do you get it to the beach?"
00:48:21,00:48:23,What you do is you bring it to the beach and you fill it with sand
00:48:23,00:48:26,and that makes it heavy and stops your parasol from blowing away.
00:48:26,00:48:26,Sorry.
00:48:26,00:48:27,Anyway.
00:48:27,00:48:28,"Well, you're the only producer of that."
00:48:28,00:48:30,That actually is quite disappointing to me.
00:48:30,00:48:32,One parrotfish would fill that in a year.
00:48:32,00:48:34,"Well, that's less than I thought."
00:48:34,00:48:37,At first I thought you were talking about one of those parasols
00:48:37,00:48:39,that ladies had in lack of my fair lady.
00:48:39,00:48:40,Exactly.
00:48:40,00:48:41,"Yeah, but you mean a big one?"
00:48:41,00:48:45,"Yeah, I don't think we've said before about parrotfish."
00:48:45,00:48:47,One of the other brilliant things about them
00:48:47,00:48:51,"is that they have two sets of jaws, like the alien in alien."
00:48:51,00:48:55,"They open the mouth, then uh-oh, there's a little mouth inside."
00:48:55,00:48:56,Second one.
00:48:56,00:48:56,Okay.
00:48:56,00:48:57,Yeah.
00:48:57,00:48:57,What are they using it for?
00:48:57,00:48:58,What's a word for that?
00:48:58,00:48:59,"There is a word for that, isn't there?"
00:48:59,00:49:00,It's pharyngeal teeth.
00:49:00,00:49:01,Pharyngeal.
00:49:01,00:49:02,Pharyngeal.
00:49:02,00:49:07,"So I think moray eels have them and a few other things,"
00:49:07,00:49:08,but they're really rare.
00:49:08,00:49:11,"If you're diving a wreath with pharyngeal teeth, that's a moray."
00:49:11,00:49:13,Look at that.
00:49:13,00:49:14,"James, that's beautiful."
00:49:14,00:49:15,Brilliant.
00:49:16,00:49:18,And those are the teeth which grind up the coral
00:49:18,00:49:20,"and turn it into sand, basically."
00:49:20,00:49:21,"Yeah, okay, right."
00:49:21,00:49:22,So the main teeth just bite off chunks
00:49:22,00:49:25,and the pharyngeal teeth are the ones that do the fine milling of the coral.
00:49:25,00:49:26,Yeah.
00:49:26,00:49:28,"You mentioned the giant bump-head parrotfish, the big ones."
00:49:28,00:49:29,Yeah.
00:49:29,00:49:32,"And they, so they fight each other by headbutting,"
00:49:32,00:49:35,which I think was only filmed recently for the first time.
00:49:35,00:49:39,"And it's just, it's quite funny to watch because they've,"
00:49:39,00:49:40,they've got quite thin heads.
00:49:40,00:49:42,"Like if you look at them face on, they're almost two-dimensional."
00:49:42,00:49:45,So you watch them going after each other and they miss each other.
00:49:46,00:49:47,Three-quarters of the time.
00:49:47,00:49:50,They just whizz past each other and spiral back around
00:49:50,00:49:52,and then eventually bump into each other.
00:49:52,00:49:53,It's like jousting.
00:49:53,00:49:53,Yes.
00:49:53,00:49:54,Yeah.
00:49:54,00:49:55,Did that happen a lot in jousting?
00:49:55,00:49:56,You just whizz straight past.
00:49:56,00:49:59,I saw some jousting last summer at a castle.
00:49:59,00:49:59,Of course.
00:49:59,00:50:00,Oh yeah.
00:50:00,00:50:01,"I was like, what do you mean, of course you did?"
00:50:01,00:50:02,You're a renaissance man.
00:50:02,00:50:06,"Oh, you really flipped that into a coffin."
00:50:06,00:50:07,That was amazing.
00:50:07,00:50:08,"Yeah, no, it was great."
00:50:08,00:50:09,"But they, they didn't, they didn't."
00:50:09,00:50:10,Was it not violent?
00:50:10,00:50:11,"Oh, it was."
00:50:11,00:50:12,"Oh, that's why you liked it."
00:50:12,00:50:14,"Well, I blindfolded myself for the violent bit."
00:50:14,00:50:16,"But I, no, it was, it wasn't too violent."
00:50:16,00:50:17,"There wasn't, that wasn't enough gore."
00:50:17,00:50:20,"It was, you know, everyone, everyone walked away."
00:50:20,00:50:20,Okay.
00:50:20,00:50:21,What was it?
00:50:21,00:50:22,"Like, it was a."
00:50:22,00:50:25,"It was, it was just a, I think it was Hever Castle in Kent."
00:50:25,00:50:26,Oh yeah.
00:50:26,00:50:26,Beautiful.
00:50:26,00:50:27,Ambulance Old House.
00:50:27,00:50:31,And they were just having a sort of medieval fairy.
00:50:31,00:50:33,And there was jousting.
00:50:33,00:50:35,"And we all, there was a great hype man,"
00:50:35,00:50:37,"dressed as Henry VIII, who was doing a lot of crowd work."
00:50:37,00:50:39,"And then they did a good, good bash at each other."
00:50:39,00:50:40,It was really fun.
00:50:40,00:50:40,Yes.
00:50:40,00:50:43,"And was it, as with the giant bumper parrot fish,"
00:50:43,00:50:45,that the winner got to shag the woman at the end?
00:50:45,00:50:48,That does explain why they sent us all home.
00:50:48,00:50:51,Wow.
00:50:51,00:50:52,So that's how that ends.
00:50:52,00:50:53,That's how that ends.
00:50:53,00:50:53,"Yes, yes."
00:50:53,00:50:54,It is.
00:50:54,00:50:57,"Although they all start out, or almost all parrot fish,"
00:50:57,00:50:59,"start out as women, don't they?"
00:50:59,00:51:00,As females.
00:51:00,00:51:02,"There are a few that are born male,"
00:51:02,00:51:04,"known as primary males, but quite rare."
00:51:04,00:51:08,"And then as they get older, they get sexually mature."
00:51:08,00:51:12,"And the biggest female in the group has a sex change, I think."
00:51:12,00:51:14,"Well, it's one male and then a load of females."
00:51:14,00:51:15,So it's a harem situation.
00:51:15,00:51:18,"And then one day the male wakes up and finds out,"
00:51:18,00:51:22,"oh, hello, my biggest girlfriend has turned into another bloke"
00:51:22,00:51:23,who's now challenging me.
00:51:23,00:51:24,This is a nightmare scenario.
00:51:24,00:51:26,And the thing I find amazing about it
00:51:26,00:51:28,"is that if you've got the harem,"
00:51:28,00:51:30,"which they do seem to be referred to as,"
00:51:30,00:51:33,"a female and a male, but then the male dies,"
00:51:33,00:51:35,another female will know to change sex.
00:51:35,00:51:37,And how does that happen?
00:51:37,00:51:37,Is that unbelievable?
00:51:37,00:51:39,Does she think about it or does she kind of go inside?
00:51:43,00:51:44,Do some molding.
00:51:44,00:51:47,There is a different kind of parrotfish.
00:51:47,00:51:48,Just so these are not the only fish
00:51:48,00:51:49,that get called parrotfish.
00:51:49,00:51:51,"This is a, I never know how to say it, Cichlid."
00:51:51,00:51:54,"I always call them chicklid,"
00:51:54,00:51:55,but I don't think they are chicklids.
00:51:55,00:51:57,That's a word that I always mispronounce.
00:51:57,00:51:59,Cichlid is what I...
00:51:59,00:52:00,There's land on that.
00:52:00,00:52:01,C-I-C-H-L-I-D.
00:52:01,00:52:02,But they are called the parrotfish.
00:52:02,00:52:04,These were invented in the 80s.
00:52:04,00:52:05,What?
00:52:05,00:52:06,I just find that so weird.
00:52:06,00:52:07,Like sea monkeys.
00:52:07,00:52:10,They were a hybrid of two different Cichlids.
00:52:10,00:52:11,Cichlids.
00:52:12,00:52:15,"And I was on Tropical Fish Magazine website,"
00:52:15,00:52:19,which said it was as improbable as Steve Urkel
00:52:19,00:52:20,and Madonna getting together.
00:52:20,00:52:24,"That's one for the oldies, isn't it?"
00:52:24,00:52:25,Who's Steve Urkel?
00:52:25,00:52:25,Steve...
00:52:25,00:52:27,"Well, Dan knows who Steve Urkel is."
00:52:27,00:52:29,"No, I don't actually know what show he was from."
00:52:29,00:52:29,I can't remember.
00:52:29,00:52:30,"Oh, God."
00:52:30,00:52:33,"But he was like a very annoying, sort of nerdy American..."
00:52:33,00:52:34,Point Dexter sort of.
00:52:34,00:52:35,"Oh, right."
00:52:35,00:52:36,And who's Madonna?
00:52:36,00:52:40,"Which is the Virgin Mary,"
00:52:40,00:52:41,which is why it would be so surprising for her
00:52:41,00:52:43,to cop off with Steve Urkel.
00:52:43,00:52:46,But they get bred because they're breedable ones.
00:52:46,00:52:48,These are for aquarium nuts because
00:52:48,00:52:49,they're on Tropical Fish Magazine.
00:52:49,00:52:51,"They get bred jelly bean parrotfish,"
00:52:51,00:52:54,which have been soaked in a dye and artificially coloured.
00:52:54,00:52:56,Some of them have tattoos.
00:52:56,00:52:58,So they're soaked in a dye and then permanently
00:52:58,00:52:59,they say that colour?
00:52:59,00:52:59,Yeah.
00:52:59,00:52:59,Wow.
00:52:59,00:53:01,Some of them have tattoos on.
00:53:01,00:53:03,Like you get people who tattoo their fish.
00:53:03,00:53:05,It feels bizarrely unnecessary because of all the fish.
00:53:05,00:53:08,Parrotfish are famously beautiful patterns and colours.
00:53:08,00:53:09,But everyone is different.
00:53:09,00:53:10,"And those are proper parrotfish, not these."
00:53:10,00:53:11,These are the proper parrotfish.
00:53:11,00:53:12,"Okay, sorry."
00:53:12,00:53:14,"Oh, so maybe these ones are a bit more dull"
00:53:14,00:53:15,and they wanted to be more like the proper ones.
00:53:15,00:53:16,So they tattooed them.
00:53:16,00:53:17,Very weird.
00:53:17,00:53:17,But yeah.
00:53:17,00:53:18,That is amazing.
00:53:18,00:53:20,And they get even more colourful when they're pissed off.
00:53:20,00:53:22,"So depending on territory,"
00:53:22,00:53:24,they'll get even more attractive.
00:53:24,00:53:25,"Yeah, vibrant."
00:53:25,00:53:27,"There's quite a few species of them as well, right?"
00:53:27,00:53:30,There's between 60 and 90 subspecies of a parrotfish.
00:53:30,00:53:32,"So when we're talking about one,"
00:53:32,00:53:33,"it might, a thing we're saying might not occur"
00:53:33,00:53:35,in another subspecies.
00:53:35,00:53:36,But they do do that thing that we've mentioned
00:53:36,00:53:37,"on the show before as well,"
00:53:37,00:53:40,where they create a mucus bag when they go to sleep.
00:53:41,00:53:43,So it's a sack that they just sleep in overnight.
00:53:43,00:53:44,"It just looks amazing, doesn't it?"
00:53:44,00:53:46,It looks incredible.
00:53:46,00:53:47,And that means that they sleep so long.
00:53:47,00:53:48,They're so lazy.
00:53:48,00:53:50,They sleep 10 hours a night.
00:53:50,00:53:51,"Oh, I imagine."
00:53:51,00:53:52,I know.
00:53:52,00:53:54,You just need to learn to build your own mucus bubble.
00:53:54,00:53:55,And you try that.
00:53:55,00:53:56,"I have been trying, Anna."
00:53:56,00:54:00,It's pretty disgusting.
00:54:00,00:54:01,We need to clean this room every time you're in it.
00:54:01,00:54:02,Every night.
00:54:02,00:54:03,"Yeah, yeah."
00:54:03,00:54:05,"It takes an hour, I think."
00:54:05,00:54:08,"The idea is that they do it to stop parasites, right?"
00:54:09,00:54:11,And the way that they work that out is scientists
00:54:11,00:54:14,got a load of them in a pool or something.
00:54:14,00:54:16,"And when they made their sleeping bags,"
00:54:16,00:54:18,"once they'd fallen asleep,"
00:54:18,00:54:22,the scientists sort of very slowly pulled the blankets off them
00:54:22,00:54:23,so they didn't have them anymore.
00:54:23,00:54:25,And then they put parasites in
00:54:25,00:54:26,"and found who got better than the most,"
00:54:26,00:54:28,"and they got way, way more."
00:54:28,00:54:29,That's interesting.
00:54:29,00:54:32,Because there's also a theory that they are using it
00:54:32,00:54:34,"so that if anyone is trying to pull the blankets off,"
00:54:34,00:54:35,they've got time to escape
00:54:35,00:54:38,rather than just being outright sitting there to be eaten.
00:54:38,00:54:40,I'm sure there's multiple reasons behind it.
00:54:40,00:54:40,Yeah.
00:54:40,00:54:43,"So it's for big predators and small ones, in effect."
00:54:43,00:54:44,"In a way, yeah."
00:54:44,00:54:45,That's what pajamas are for.
00:54:45,00:54:46,That's great.
00:54:46,00:54:50,"Your pajamas are covered in metal spikes, aren't they?"
00:54:50,00:54:51,But no parasites on Andy's.
00:54:51,00:54:52,"No, exactly."
00:54:52,00:54:55,"There was a test on the moray eels, actually,"
00:54:55,00:54:56,an experiment.
00:54:56,00:54:58,Just while we're on the experiments done on these things.
00:54:58,00:55:00,"So on the pharyngeal jaws,"
00:55:00,00:55:03,the cool thing about them for the moray eels
00:55:03,00:55:06,is that it means they don't need to feed in water.
00:55:07,00:55:10,"Oh, well, they can grab something like a mosquito or something."
00:55:10,00:55:13,"Kind of, or a little bit of prey outside."
00:55:13,00:55:14,But I find this so weird.
00:55:14,00:55:16,"Basically, it's to do with the mechanics of how you eat."
00:55:16,00:55:18,"Like, all other fish need to be in water,"
00:55:18,00:55:20,to have the mechanics of water so that they can feed.
00:55:20,00:55:24,We would find it difficult to eat if we were submerged in water.
00:55:24,00:55:24,Do you know what I mean?
00:55:24,00:55:26,"Like, the mechanics of physics doesn't work as well."
00:55:26,00:55:29,"So the scientists who did this on the eels,"
00:55:29,00:55:31,they trained the eels.
00:55:31,00:55:34,They took five years training seven eels
00:55:34,00:55:38,"to slither up a ramp, grab a mouthful of fish"
00:55:38,00:55:41,"from outside the water, and then go back into the water."
00:55:41,00:55:43,"I don't think there was evidence that they were doing this before,"
00:55:43,00:55:44,"that they were eating outside water,"
00:55:44,00:55:46,but I think they were trying to show how these jaws worked.
00:55:46,00:55:48,What if that knowledge spreads among the eel community?
00:55:48,00:55:49,And now...
00:55:49,00:55:50,They all leave the ocean.
00:55:50,00:55:54,"Yeah, I mean, again, that's the start of a horror movie, isn't it?"
00:55:54,00:55:55,Like beachgoers...
00:55:55,00:55:56,"Oh, you mean disasters for us?"
00:55:56,00:55:59,"I was thinking disasters for the eels, but you're afraid of the..."
00:55:59,00:56:00,I just think we shouldn't be teaching animals
00:56:00,00:56:03,to come out of the water and bite live prey
00:56:03,00:56:05,and go back in.
00:56:05,00:56:05,Yeah?
00:56:05,00:56:06,Sorry if that makes me old-fashioned.
00:56:06,00:56:12,Guy who's seen a jousting match at a castle.
00:56:12,00:56:20,"Okay, that's it."
