2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,360
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,440
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
 I am sitting here with James Harkin,

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,280
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Tyshinski.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,520
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,080
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,240
 and in a particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,080
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,200
 L. Frank Baum based one of

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,000
 the witches in the Wizard of Oz on his mother-in-law.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,800
 >> I didn't know that he was a 1970s stand-up comedian.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,440
 >> It sounds like such a sexist fact, doesn't it?

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,040
 >> Yeah.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,520
 >> But if we tell you who the mother-in-law involved is,

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,640
 it won't sound sexist.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,920
 >> And also which witch it was.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,160
 >> And which witch it was, yeah, that's more important.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,200
 It's the beautiful and benevolent Glinda,

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,160
 who is the good witch of the North.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,000
 >> Gotcha, you thought it was the green one.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,240
 >> No, I don't know what color she is, I've never seen the film.

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,480
 Is it black and white?

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,840
 >> She's famously, the wicked one, is famously green.

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,280
 >> Okay.

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,440
 >> And it also is black and white, and then not.

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,720
 It was sort of the introduction of

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,720
 Technicolor to Cinema World, really.

31
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,320
 >> Is it?

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,760
 So it's not like follow the black and white road,

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,520
 they didn't do that.

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,800
 >> No, they invented the color process

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,480
 halfway through the first screening of the film.

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,720
 >> Yeah, very exciting, so quickly.

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,920
 >> Just randomly.

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,920
 >> He had this mother-in-law who was called Matilda Elector Jocelyn Gage.

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,520
 And it turns out that she was a very, very awesome woman,

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,960
 as well as being his mother-in-law.

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
 She was one of the three leaders of the women's rights movement in the US.

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
 So you might have heard of Susan B. Antony.

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,720
 There was also Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and there was this lady,

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,520
 Matilda Elector Jocelyn Gage.

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,680
 >> She was very cool.

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,320
 >> Yeah, she gave him lots of ideas for the story.

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
 In fact, she maybe even gave him the idea of becoming an author.

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,480
 And she came up with the idea of putting a cyclone in the story,

49
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,400
 which spoiler alert is what sends them to Oz.

50
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,960
 >> This is a spoiler alert from a guy who hasn't seen the film.

51
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,600
 >> I couldn't work out, and therefore I have a theory on how she suggested the cyclone.

52
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,840
 She died in March 1898, which is just when he started writing.

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,800
 And I wonder if he was having a massive mental block where he just spent years,

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,280
 like, I've got this idea, but I've got no idea how to transport them.

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,160
 And then on her death bed, she said, I've got it, cyclone, and that was it.

56
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,640
 Because she literally died as he was starting the book.

57
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,560
 So it must have been the first idea that was had.

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,800
 >> I wonder if she just already half written this book.

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
 And then when she died, he picked it up and went, oh, this is good.

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,200
 Because she was also an expert on witches.

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,120
 >> Oh, yes, she was, the real kind.

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,200
 >> Yeah, because when she did a lot of her sort of feminism and all that kind of stuff,

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,960
 people just kept calling her Satanic and the heretic and stuff like that.

64
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,160
 And they would call her a witch, which is obviously a way of demeaning women in those days.

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,600
 And as such, she decided, OK, I'm going to study them.

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,520
 And she was a real expert on witches.

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,040
 >> Yeah.

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,600
 >> So that's another part that she had to do.

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,040
 >> That's a very good point.

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,160
 >> She inspired a term.

71
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,360
 So she not only was a suffragette, she also was looking at any kind of discrimination

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
 that was going on in the States at the time.

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,640
 And she wrote a pamphlet and it was called Women as Inventors.

74
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,360
 And she basically said, here are all the women who have not been given their credit

75
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,000
 for all the inventions that they've done.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,800
 And years later, the term, the Matilda Effect, is used to describe exactly that.

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 So women who have been brushed aside from history and should get the credit.

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,880
 Now, interestingly, there's a male equivalent to this, which is called the Matthew Effect.

79
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,960
 And the Matthew Effect is when a male scientist who is distinguished and older often gets the credit

80
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,360
 if he has a co-writer who is younger and new to the field.

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,240
 That was invented by a guy called Robert K. Merton.

82
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,560
 Interestingly, his wife, Harriet Zuckerman, appears on the Matilda Effect list

83
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,560
 because she provided all the data that led to him inventing the Matthew Effect.

84
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,080
 Yeah.

85
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,200
 >> Can I ask the Matilda Effect, if you're talking about a really awesome woman

86
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,320
 who is like one of the main leaders of the women's rights movement,

87
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,040
 but you start the fact off about her son-in-law who wrote a children's book,

88
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,680
 is that kind of similar?

89
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
 >> I think you're banked the right stuff, yeah.

90
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
 >> Do you guys know what the reverse Matilda Effect is?

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,760
 >> Okay, so it's where women get loads of extra credit for stuff that they hadn't done?

92
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,880
 >> You'd think it was that, but--

93
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,920
 >> Is it this podcast?

94
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,600
 >> Wow.

95
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,880
 >> That is the reverse though, isn't it?

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,680
 >> Oh, wow.

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
 I mean, it is logically the reverse.

98
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,160
 I'm afraid that's not the thing that's been labeled the reverse Matilda Effect.

99
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,080
 This was a quite interesting study that was done in Poland last year, actually,

100
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,320
 where a Polish scientist ran this study where they showed over 800 school children

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,160
 a bunch of presentations about the history of math and science and STEM stuff,

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,880
 and then as part of it, they mentioned people who'd invented certain mathematical or

103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
 scientific physics-based things, but these were made-up inventions.

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,040
 They were made-up people, and for one group of students,

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,400
 they had a woman be the inventor,

106
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
 and for the other group of students, they had a man be the inventor,

107
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
 and it turned out when they asked the students afterwards,

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
 when they'd mentioned that a woman was the inventor,

109
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
 the people just weren't interested in the subject.

110
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
 They were like, "Well, that sounds like a shit subject,"

111
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
 and they didn't want to study it anymore.

112
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,200
 >> Oh.

113
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
 >> And so we need to stop talking about women in science

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,160
 in order to get women into science, and it was the girls and boys.

115
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,400
 >> It was awesome.

116
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,480
 >> They were both like, "Ugh, women did this."

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,040
 >> And it was the same level of coolness of invention

118
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
 they were discussing for both the women and the men.

119
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
 >> It was the same invention itself.

120
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,760
 >> Oh, it was the same, it wasn't, okay, okay, okay.

121
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
 >> It wasn't like someone invented a doily,

122
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,160
 and this man invented the space rocket.

123
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,720
 You'd run some great studies there.

124
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
 >> But I think a doily is a cool, I've come into contact much more with the doily

125
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,440
 than the space rocket.

126
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,400
 A doily has probably avoided more human misery than a space rocket.

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
 >> No, it is more up your street, I agree with that.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,440
 >> I can imagine you starting your doily ex company

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
 when you become a billionaire.

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,760
 >> The world's most revolutionary doily.

131
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,760
 >> So before he was a writer,

132
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,320
 L. Frank Baum worked in shops,

133
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,000
 and he did amazing sort of window displays, didn't he?

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,240
 Really, that's what he was famous for at the time.

135
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,760
 >> Didn't you have a magazine?

136
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,320
 How famous can you be for writing a magazine about window displays?

137
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,720
 >> I think in the areas where he had window displays,

138
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
 people would copy his ideas,

139
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,600
 and then he had the magazine,

140
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
 and he came up with lots of different ways of doing things.

141
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,160
 Like he thought that if you had an American flag in your window display,

142
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,880
 you shouldn't have a fan blowing it,

143
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
 because that's not the correct way for an American flag to be flown.

144
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,920
 It should be on the end of a massive stick with someone waving it,

145
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,520
 like a figure of eight.

146
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,320
 And he came up with a mechanical system

147
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,200
 to get a flag to go that way instead of being blown with a fan.

148
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,160
 >> Oh, incredible.

149
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
 >> So he just came up with loads of amazing innovations

150
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,160
 that we all know today, like that.

151
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,400
 >> And then put it in his magazine.

152
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
 >> And then he put it in his magazine

153
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,040
 and said, "This is what you should be doing, guys,

154
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,480
 not your stupid fan thing."

155
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,960
 >> Yeah, okay.

156
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,640
 >> I didn't know he did the window displays.

157
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,520
 I thought he just wrote about them.

158
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:01,840
 >> Oh, no.

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,600
 We should say the magazine was called "The Show Window,"

160
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,040
 which then became a book called

161
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,320
 "The Art of Decorating Dry Goods, Windows, and Interiors,"

162
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,080
 which was almost the last thing he published

163
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,200
 before "The Wizard of Oz," actually.

164
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,880
 >> I think it was in the same year, wasn't it?

165
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
 >> That was 1900.

166
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
 So it was maybe a year or two before.

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
 >> I wonder if he's got anyone out there who, if they say,

168
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
 "What do you think of L. Frank Baum?"

169
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
 They go, "I prefer his early stuff."

170
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,320
 >> He had a shop called Baum's Bazaar,

171
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,160
 which was a complete disaster,

172
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
 because it was lots of tap, basically.

173
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,760
 It was sort of a...

174
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,360
 Do you call it a bizarre stuff?

175
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,080
 Very nice.

176
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,280
 Didn't want to let that go unmarked.

177
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,640
 >> You know, I probably would have cut that out,

178
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,000
 but now that you've made a point of it,

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
 I think let's keep that in now.

180
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,120
 >> Let's shine a harsh light on that, then.

181
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,240
 >> Thank you, Andy.

182
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,960
 >> And it sold also.

183
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
 It was a very novelty-based shop.

184
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
 It was not a dry goods emporium.

185
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,040
 It was, you know, like chocolates and...

186
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
 >> It was based on Woolworths, wasn't it?

187
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,880
 >> Yeah, it was any old stuff, like lanterns,

188
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,800
 paper lanterns, strange glassware, anyway.

189
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,720
 He opened it shortly before a very harsh drought

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
 decimated the entire region.

191
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,680
 And the appetite for paper lanterns and amusing glassware

192
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
 just went through the floor.

193
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,400
 And lots of people were ruined.

194
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
 And I think that was the point at which,

195
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,800
 I think his mother-in-law, I think Matilda,

196
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,600
 was very concerned about his prospects.

197
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 She didn't originally want her daughter to marry him,

198
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,120
 because he was a bit of a bum.

199
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,880
 >> Well, he was just a very bad businessman.

200
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,680
 [LAUGHTER]

201
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,440
 >> Brilliant. Brilliant.

202
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
 >> See, that's how you do it.

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,320
 >> That was good.

204
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,200
 Thank you for the lesson.

205
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,160
 >> Say it loudly, and then a loud laugh to follow it up.

206
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
 Yeah, he saw he was very bad at business,

207
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,600
 and that bazaar, in fact, had to be renamed Gage's Bazaar.

208
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,680
 And this was another member of his wife's family

209
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,920
 who helped him out, who I think was Helen Gage,

210
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,800
 his sister-in-law.

211
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
 So he drove the shop into the ground,

212
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
 and his sister-in-law was like, oh my God, poor Frank,

213
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,840
 he's screwed up again.

214
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,160
 And so she bought up all the remaining stock,

215
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
 renamed it Gage's Bazaar, and made it a very successful stock.

216
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,320
 >> Really? That's so good.

217
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
 We haven't mentioned his wife, Maud, daughter of Matilda.

218
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,880
 She came into his life, as it was a quite quick marriage.

219
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,120
 They were introduced by Bounds Auntie.

220
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
 He immediately said, I'm going to be marrying you one day.

221
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,200
 They married a few months later.

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,760
 But she was quite brutal from some of the stories

223
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
 about how she ran the house in certain ways,

224
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
 because she sort of did everything in the house.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,280
 >> Do you mean the donut incident?

226
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,640
 >> Yeah, the donut incident.

227
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
 >> Let's talk about this.

228
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,160
 >> It's incredible.

229
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,160
 So he comes home one day, Frank, with a box of donuts.

230
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,640
 >> Right.

231
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,280
 >> But he hasn't consulted her about buying these donuts.

232
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
 She is furious.

233
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,480
 She's the one who decides what food enters the house.

234
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
 She wants only good food in the house.

235
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
 So if he was going to do anything like that,

236
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
 it had to go through her, and it was not going to go to waste.

237
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,880
 So he was going to have to eat all of these donuts.

238
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
 He couldn't manage it by the fourth day.

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,000
 >> It's very much a Matilda and Bruce Bogtrotter situation,

240
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,400
 isn't it?

241
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,600
 He has to eat the whole cake.

242
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,240
 Do you remember that?

243
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
 >> Oh, yes, yes, exactly.

244
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
 >> It's that.

245
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,960
 >> So by the fourth day, they start going moldy,

246
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
 and he thinks, I can't eat these anymore.

247
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,480
 So he sneaks out into the backyard,

248
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
 and he buries them under the ground.

249
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,960
 >> Right.

250
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,040
 >> She knows something's up, so she goes into the garden.

251
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,400
 She digs them back up.

252
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,280
 She presents them back to him and says,

253
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,400
 "You never buy donuts again," and he doesn't.

254
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,360
 And she says--

255
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
 >> Can I ask, how many donuts did he buy

256
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,240
 that he couldn't eat them in four days?

257
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,800
 >> Exactly.

258
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
 >> Well, he's got one of those Krispy Kreme full packs,

259
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:17,840
 isn't he?

260
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,800
 There are like a dozen in there.

261
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,360
 >> Anna, I've seen you go through those packs.

262
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,920
 >> James, we don't need to talk about my history with Toda.

263
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,560
 >> No, you're right.

264
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
 That is the whole in the story.

265
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,520
 >> Yeah.

266
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,760
 >> I reckon I could get through 50 in four days.

267
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,400
 No problem.

268
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,200
 >> Well, you'd have a happier marriage.

269
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,560
 >> Than he did, clearly.

270
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,880
 I love the sheer list of his failures.

271
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,520
 He's one of the--

272
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,400
 Actually, he is one of these guys who makes you think,

273
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,080
 if I haven't made it by age X,

274
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,640
 like, you know, if you haven't started by the age of three,

275
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,800
 you're not going to be a tennis pro, for example.

276
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 Boom, until mid-30s, we're still just knocking about

277
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
 doing random stuff.

278
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
 >> So, is he giving you hope?

279
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,920
 >> He's giving me a lot of hope.

280
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,440
 He was a chicken breeder.

281
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,320
 He managed to fail selling oil in America

282
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,600
 in the 1880s and '90s.

283
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 He just couldn't hack it.

284
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,640
 How do you fail a petrol company?

285
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,760
 Just ridiculous, yeah.

286
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
 >> I thought the saddest story about Frank

287
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,840
 was, did you read about when he tried to be an actor?

288
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,400
 >> No.

289
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
 >> I will save him.

290
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
 He tried so much.

291
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,680
 The reason I know I'm not him,

292
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
 I'm not going to suddenly be successful at 40,

293
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,840
 is that he, like, had a new fan every year

294
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,040
 and he threw himself into it.

295
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
 And his dad bought a bunch of theaters

296
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
 and he decided I'll be an actor.

297
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
 So he kept on asking producers to cast him.

298
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,080
 And eventually, one said,

299
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,720
 "Oh, yeah, I'll definitely cast you in loads of leading roles,

300
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
 but you need to provide all the costumes

301
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200
 for all of the possible leading roles you could be cast in."

302
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,280
 So when he told his mum and dad,

303
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
 his dad said, "No."

304
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,760
 The mum said, "Oh, come on, he's got a job.

305
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,560
 Buy this stuff."

306
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
 So they spent thousands and thousands of dollars

307
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,840
 buying up all the leading roles,

308
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,560
 like, you know, Romeo, Macbeth, all the costumes.

309
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
 He turned up with the theater troupe.

310
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,720
 On the first day, the actor was playing Romeo, said,

311
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
 "Oh, my doublet's a bit broken.

312
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
 Can I just borrow that costume of yours?"

313
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,480
 Oh, my God.

314
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,800
 "Within four days, every single costume

315
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
 had been taken from him and not returned."

316
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
 Did he play anyone in the play in the end?

317
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,920
 He got some tiny little extra parts.

318
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,960
 [LAUGHTER]

319
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,840
 He got so many.

320
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,480
 No.

321
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,280
 That's amazing.

322
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,720
 Speaking of costumes, by the way,

323
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,520
 obviously a movie, The Wizard of Oz.

324
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,640
 Yeah, yes.

325
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,400
 The Cowardly Lion costume was very, very heavy.

326
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,920
 But the really interesting thing about it

327
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
 is because it was made of real lion fur

328
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,320
 and because lions have distinctive fur patterns,

329
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
 they had to use the same one

330
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,400
 all the way through.

331
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,560
 Because if they wore a different lion,

332
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
 they'd be like, "Oh, that's just a different lion's costume

333
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,760
 because it's a different pattern."

334
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
 Wait, as in would a viewer, a casual viewer of the film,

335
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
 think, "Where did the lion go?

336
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
 [LAUGHTER]

337
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,880
 Who's this?

338
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
 Who's just a new character they've just introduced?"

339
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
 Well, on the other hand, you might say,

340
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
 "Good work," to say, "Let's try and make it

341
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,880
 as much fun to do it to as possible."

342
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
 And probably to kill as few lions as you need to.

343
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
 I agree with all of this.

344
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
 I don't know if you needed to kill one.

345
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
 If I'm going to be totally honest,

346
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,960
 was the real lion fur completely necessary?

347
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,720
 Because actually, I'm thinking about the character of the film.

348
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
 He looks nothing like a lion.

349
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
 [LAUGHTER]

350
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,200
 They could have just put a yellow carpet on him, couldn't they?

351
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,960
 And then, "Oh, we'll just keep using the same yellow..."

352
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,240
 Actually, use the second yellow carpet.

353
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,960
 It doesn't matter.

354
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,200
 I had no idea that that was an actual lion's costume.

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,920
 That was a real lion's fur.

356
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,120
 "What? How about perm?

357
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,960
 Lions don't have that natural perm."

358
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
 Like, the head bit was separate.

359
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,160
 The head bit was moulded.

360
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,440
 But the actual fur bit was real fur.

361
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,000
 Oh, right.

362
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,200
 The one with the furringed.

363
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
 Another interesting thing about that

364
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
 is that it went up for auction in 2014.

365
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,840
 And one way of authenticating it

366
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,920
 is they looked at the patterns on the movie

367
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,280
 and they could see it was the same

368
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,200
 on the costume that they had.

369
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,240
 So they knew it was real.

370
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,640
 Ah.

371
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,040
 And it sold for $3 million,

372
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,840
 which makes it the third highest priced outfit

373
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
 ever sold from a Hollywood film.

374
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,480
 Incredible.

375
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,360
 And the winner is...

376
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,720
 Can we guess the others?

377
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,560
 I think you can guess one of them.

378
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
 Batman's costume with the nipples on from the TV.

379
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,360
 The TV version.

380
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,160
 Very true.

381
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,880
 Very good, no.

382
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,080
 Jim Carrey's wig in Dumb and Dumber, the four haircuts.

383
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,800
 Oh, I'm going to say Ruby Slippers, surely.

384
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
 So they're not from that movie.

385
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
 Marilyn Monroe's dress from...

386
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,360
 Is it the 70-year-rich?

387
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,800
 The winner from the 70-year-rich.

388
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
 $4.6 million that sold for.

389
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
 Rosebud, the sleigh from...

390
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,280
 No, you won't get the other one.

391
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,000
 That's not a costume.

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,320
 That was an actor in that.

393
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
 Not that you won't know it, but you won't have guessed it.

394
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,600
 It's Audrey Hepburn's dress from My Fair Lady.

395
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,480
 Oh, from My Fair Lady?

396
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,200
 Wow.

397
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,480
 Yeah, that's incredible.

398
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,080
 Andy, back to your point very quickly about...

399
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,560
 He was going through lots of different careers

400
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,960
 and he finally had enough and he was like,

401
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,080
 "I'm going to become a proper writer."

402
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,480
 And he sits down finally to write The Wizard of Oz.

403
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
 I really like this because you do often wonder

404
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,120
 if you've written something that is going to change the world.

405
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,200
 I always wondered, does an author have that feeling?

406
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,000
 He clearly did.

407
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,480
 He got to the end of it and he had his pencil

408
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,240
 that he'd used to write the manuscript with

409
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
 and it was right down to the nub.

410
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,720
 And he immediately framed that pencil

411
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,680
 because he knew that he'd written something that was great.

412
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
 It was next to his window display pencil

413
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,080
 and it had his exotic chicken pencils in it.

414
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:07,680
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

415
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,360
 My fact is that the journey towards modern weight loss drugs

416
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,440
 begins with the venom of a Gila monster.

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
 Do you mean a Gila monster?

418
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
 I do and that is how I've seen it written down.

419
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,680
 It's because I don't live in Utah.

420
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
 I've never heard it called a Gila monster.

421
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,920
 We have had this discussion before we came on Mike

422
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
 and I always called it a Gila monster

423
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,640
 but apparently you've been wrong.

424
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,600
 No, it's not.

425
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 I don't even think you need to do the...

426
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
 Yeah, I don't know where that came from.

427
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,000
 I think it's just...

428
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,880
 What do you meant to say?

429
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,600
 Just Gila, right?

430
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,880
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

431
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,600
 It's healing people and it's a Gila monster.

432
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
 Oh my god.

433
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
 We blowed the shit wide open.

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,560
 Wow, wow, wow.

435
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,760
 You've got to reword the fact.

436
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,720
 That's terrific.

437
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
 So I read this on a great blog called Astral Codex 10

438
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,080
 and it was from a piece about Ozempic

439
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,560
 and it was about this whole class of weight loss drugs

440
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,680
 and where they come from.

441
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,080
 They're called GLP1 drugs.

442
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,840
 They were invented for diabetes

443
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,680
 and then the scientists noticed no, everyone's losing weight.

444
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,920
 Human and rat who were trying this on, they're all losing weight.

445
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
 The basic thing about these drugs is

446
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
 and the reason they work for weight loss

447
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,200
 is that when you eat a meal,

448
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,280
 you're intestine detects that you've eaten

449
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,960
 and it releases this hormone which is called

450
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,600
 glucagon like peptide 1, GLP1.

451
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
 That hormone tells your body you're full

452
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
 and commences operations to sort of deal with it.

453
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
 So, you know, your body will, you know,

454
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,080
 it tells you pancreas to release insulin.

455
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,640
 It pushes sugar down and so on.

456
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,400
 But the problem is, originally, you couldn't make a synthetic version

457
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,640
 of that exact chemical, the GLP1,

458
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,320
 because it decays within a minute.

459
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,520
 So if you were going to use that as a drug,

460
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,920
 you would have to inject yourself with it every hour.

461
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,120
 You know, it's not an effective way

462
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
 of tricking your body into thinking you're full.

463
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,440
 But in 1992, scientists found that healer monster venom.

464
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,600
 I pulled out of the full Espanola, healer monster venom.

465
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
 It has this chemical in it which does a similar thing.

466
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,960
 It triggers all the processes that GLP1 does,

467
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,320
 but it lasts two hours.

468
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,200
 And so they started playing around with the structure of that

469
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,880
 and making a synthetic version of that.

470
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,360
 And they came up with something called exenotide,

471
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,120
 which was sold to treat diabetes.

472
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,400
 And then other scientists piled in

473
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,560
 and started, you know, the thing which led to his M pic.

474
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,080
 Yeah, I really like.

475
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,640
 So it was 1984, Dr. Daniel Drucker.

476
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,680
 I have a lot of connection to that.

477
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,920
 I was born in '84, called Daniel as well.

478
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,840
 Got it spooky.

479
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,880
 It's really weird, isn't it?

480
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,120
 Jesus Christ.

481
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,080
 I love that he found out this thing about the healer monster

482
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,360
 and thought, I need to test it,

483
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,200
 but they didn't have any of its DNA in the bank.

484
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,960
 So any that they did wasn't usable.

485
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,120
 So he had to get in contact with a zoo.

486
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
 He had to go and actually get one in person

487
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,920
 and had to apply for them to go and find one.

488
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
 He didn't go and get one.

489
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,800
 Well, they actually, it fluted him on a plane.

490
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,040
 Yeah.

491
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,720
 Yeah, it was good too.

492
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,280
 We'd go in the zoo and sneak one out and just come.

493
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,240
 But he sort of talks about how it was very different back then

494
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,800
 when you were trying to get any of these kind of DNAs

495
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,480
 that you had a theory about.

496
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,280
 And that's what it was.

497
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,920
 He said, I think this could be to help diabetes.

498
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,040
 And they went, fine, that's good enough.

499
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,000
 We'll go and get you one.

500
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,320
 It came in a cage with a metal bottom

501
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
 because they're so good at digging healer monsters

502
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,560
 that they thought if we put it in any other cage,

503
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,840
 it will just dig its way out.

504
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
 Dig its way through the bottom of the plane.

505
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,240
 Oh my God, imagine if that's what caused a terrible tragedy.

506
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,520
 So then he did this work.

507
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,760
 And then there was a guy called John Eng

508
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,520
 who synthesized a version.

509
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,960
 So this Daniel Drucker was working with actual healer monsters.

510
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,440
 And then John Eng came up with this version,

511
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,840
 which was fake, not fake, but you know what I mean.

512
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,240
 It was synthetic.

513
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,440
 Yeah, synthetic.

514
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,840
 And he had never seen a healer monster in his entire,

515
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
 he probably pronounced it Gila monster like that.

516
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,040
 He'd never seen one in his whole life at that stage.

517
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,320
 Also, we should say, obviously,

518
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,440
 as Epic has become one of the most valuable,

519
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,360
 remarkable drugs in the world.

520
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
 It does sound like the beginning of a horror film, doesn't it?

521
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,480
 Like, it was great.

522
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,680
 We all started inventing this synthetic lizard saliva

523
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,480
 and the effects were great at first.

524
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,680
 We should also say that Novo Nodesk, who make as Epic,

525
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,960
 they say that the Gila monster study has nothing to do with Epic.

526
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,080
 And that it was an important step in the making of this kind of drugs.

527
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,040
 But their work was separate to the Gila monster.

528
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,240
 Well, actually, I don't know if you know this,

529
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,760
 but the Gila effect, James, is the name for when Gila monsters

530
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,680
 are not given due credit for the inventions that they make.

531
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,480
 There isn't an enormous bank of Gila monsters

532
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
 somewhere in Denmark being systemically drained of their venom.

533
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,800
 Yeah, yeah.

534
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,200
 That's not.

535
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,360
 But it did take about 20 years between the Gila monster discovery,

536
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,600
 all the way for it to be approved by the American pharmaceutical companies.

537
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,120
 Yeah, that's because it was two different.

538
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,480
 Yeah, it was a long journey.

539
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,720
 And yeah, so that happened April 28th, 2005, which is my birthday.

540
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,040
 Yeah, that's stunning.

541
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,960
 Your 21st birthday when you became a man is the, my God.

542
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
 And here's one more thing just to say.

543
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,920
 Like these new drugs that people are taking to make them thinner,

544
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,640
 it gives you this GLP1, which helps you not want to eat.

545
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,880
 You can get GLP1 naturally.

546
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
 Good news for everyone.

547
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,640
 But unfortunately, you have to eat basically healthy foods and exercise.

548
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,480
 Well, guys, it doesn't have to be that healthy.

549
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
 You could literally just eat porridge instead of taking a Zempik.

550
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,600
 And it does the same thing.

551
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
 And that's an exaggeration because it's not nearly as powerful.

552
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,160
 But I did find it really interesting, the role of fiber.

553
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,600
 I had no idea what fiber did as an appetite suppressant.

554
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,960
 So it does the same thing when you eat fiber.

555
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,280
 It goes through your digestive system really slowly.

556
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,560
 You can't really digest it.

557
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,880
 So usually the stuff you eat, like Andy said,

558
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
 it triggers the release of this GLP, which tells your body,

559
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,040
 "I'm full. Don't eat anymore."

560
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,480
 But then it goes away really fast.

561
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,440
 If you eat loads of fiber, some brown bread, some porridge,

562
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,080
 then that takes ages getting to your colon.

563
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,280
 And then that triggers way more release of it later on.

564
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,760
 So as Zempik does, it will tell you,

565
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,240
 "I'm full two hours, three hours after you've eaten."

566
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,360
 There's a weird thing about Zempik,

567
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,480
 which is that it works inside the brain.

568
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,960
 So the anti-diabetic effect happens in your intestine

569
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
 because that's where the GLP1 is released.

570
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,640
 And that is what triggers the body to slow down its release of sugar.

571
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,040
 For example, to prevent a big sugar spike.

572
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,840
 But scientists didn't know for a long time

573
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,120
 exactly how Zempik controls the mental sensation of hunger.

574
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,960
 And it shouldn't be possible for it to happen

575
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,440
 because there's the thing in your body, the blood-brain barrier,

576
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,440
 which is meant to keep your brain just working on nice, clean blood

577
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
 with no other stuff in it.

578
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,200
 Just stops any big molecules from getting in.

579
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,680
 And Zempik, the drug, is a big molecule.

580
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,360
 So what the hell is going on?

581
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
 And it turns out that if a little bit gets in

582
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,240
 and that activates a bit of the brain stem,

583
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,360
 which in turn acts as a kind of transmitter, relay station,

584
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,520
 for other bits of the brain,

585
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
 that then makes your brain generate its own GLP1

586
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,160
 because it's not only made in the intestine.

587
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,080
 So that's why you feel less hungry.

588
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,440
 That's really weird.

589
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,000
 So there's another thing that I was going to mention

590
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
 off the back of - I wonder if Fibro would do this for you,

591
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,960
 and I don't think it does.

592
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,120
 One of the side effects of taking a Zempik and other weight loss drugs

593
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,600
 is a lot of people have reported the stopping of what they call food noise

594
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
 and food noise.

595
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,680
 I've never personally had it, but if you need -

596
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,200
 I've sat next to you while you're eating,

597
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,960
 and you do have a lot of food noise.

598
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,320
 I have outward food noise.

599
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
 Yeah, not inside food noise.

600
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,800
 And inside food noise is if you can't help,

601
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,320
 but keep eating and keep eating,

602
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,840
 it's your head talking to you going,

603
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,040
 "We need food. We need food right now.

604
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,600
 Do you see that place?

605
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
 Why don't you get some food?"

606
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
 And it's this thing that people really suffer from

607
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,200
 when they're trying to be all done.

608
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,240
 I don't think it's always necessarily like a voice saying it.

609
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,600
 It could be just a feeling.

610
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,080
 Exactly.

611
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,200
 They call it the noise.

612
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,720
 And supposedly, a Zempik knocks out the noise as well as suppressing the -

613
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
 But is that just because you feel full?

614
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,720
 And so your body, your brains can stop saying it?

615
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,920
 I think people who are full still have the noise going,

616
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,200
 "We could probably get a bit more."

617
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,480
 "We could probably get a bit more."

618
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
 "We could probably get a bit more."

619
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,800
 Another doughnut.

620
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,240
 "Come on, you can do it."

621
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,560
 It's great that mould off the top, but it's still good.

622
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,600
 It is the case that it's not just about when you're full,

623
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,640
 because it stops other cravings, I think.

624
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,080
 So it's supposed to be quite good for people who are addicted to other things.

625
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,880
 Yes.

626
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,680
 And unfortunately, people who are addicted to exercise,

627
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,760
 it seems to stop you from wanting to exercise.

628
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,920
 You don't need to anymore, you've been.

629
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,280
 We haven't actually mentioned the real major player in the Zempik story.

630
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,600
 And that is the great theme tune it has.

631
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,960
 You know, Magic by Van Kled Pilot.

632
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,840
 So that it's, "Oh, whoa, whoa, it's magic."

633
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,480
 You know that one?

634
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,800
 Okay.

635
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,840
 Okay, Andy doesn't know it.

636
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,080
 Well, we might not be able to put that in for legal reasons,

637
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,920
 but we'll Google it if we haven't.

638
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,240
 But they changed it to, "Okay, so, oh, oh, it's magic."

639
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,720
 Oh.

640
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,120
 They changed it to, "Oh, oh, oh, ozempik."

641
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,680
 And so, everyone was singing it.

642
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,200
 And they were saying that psychologically,

643
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,600
 they think it worked really well, because it's such an upbeat song.

644
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,480
 It makes you feel good, but you all at the certain age know

645
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,800
 that the word that ozempik represents is magic,

646
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,560
 and magic is now in your head.

647
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,720
 And so, the lead singer of Pilot had no idea that this was happening.

648
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,000
 He just started getting messages going,

649
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,680
 "I'm hearing your song everywhere in America."

650
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,200
 And he was like, "What's going on?"

651
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,520
 Because they're able to license the song out,

652
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,800
 no one had to ask him for its use of adverts and...

653
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,240
 Okay, so it sounds like we can use it.

654
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,920
 Sing the whole thing.

655
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,280
 Unfortunately, it'll be owned by a huge multinational music company.

656
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,320
 That's the issue, yeah.

657
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
 But so, he himself is so on board with it

658
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
 that he's even gone back to Abbey Road

659
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,280
 to record the ozempik version of the song.

660
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,440
 Is it possible that all of the science behind ozempik is nonsense,

661
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,280
 and the only way it works is that that theme tune

662
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
 has replaced food noise in people's heads?

663
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,680
 That could be it.

664
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,120
 Shall we go on to Healer Monsters?

665
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,400
 I said at the start, we're blowing shit wide open.

666
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,920
 They do open their bums to keep cool.

667
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,400
 Clever.

668
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,880
 Can they do it?

669
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,680
 Can they just, with thought, or like with muscle movement?

670
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,960
 They don't hold it open.

671
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,840
 They don't hold it open.

672
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,560
 That's what I'm asking.

673
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,320
 They don't have a poseable thumb stand.

674
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,240
 What do you do with a finger?

675
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,280
 Well, they could do each other's.

676
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,560
 Basically, a lot of reptiles keep themselves cool by opening their mouths.

677
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,880
 But they can open the cloacas as well,

678
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,400
 which will help moisture evaporate,

679
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
 and it can cool them by up to three degrees.

680
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,680
 That is a lot for Healer Monster parties that must be,

681
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,560
 "Are you feeling too hot?"

682
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:56,880
 No.

683
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,720
 I think you are.

684
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,440
 Shut your asshole at the dinner table.

685
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,840
 Because they're found in the desert of North America, aren't they?

686
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,280
 Yeah, they have underground mostly, because it's so hot.

687
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,720
 They only come out for a few weeks each year.

688
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,000
 You just see a bum sticking out.

689
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,120
 But their tail as well, right, is amazing.

690
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
 When I was reading about them, I thought,

691
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,200
 "Well, that's a cool thing. I wish we could do that as well."

692
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,880
 Well, store your fat in a tail.

693
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080
 Yeah, so it means that they only need a few meals per year, basically,

694
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,640
 and if they're in trouble, that's their stock sitting there,

695
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,080
 all the fat in their tail.

696
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
 There's another thing they can do,

697
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,240
 and this, I'm afraid, is at that end of the body related to the bum thing.

698
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
 They store water in their bladder, right?

699
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,920
 And then the phrase I found was,

700
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,640
 "They reabsorb it across the bladder epithelium."

701
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,880
 And what that means is they can have a reverse piss inside themselves back into their system.

702
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,760
 It's not mad.

703
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
 Can they do that just with thought?

704
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
 Or do they have to shut their hands off?

705
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,640
 Squeeze.

706
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:05,280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

707
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,800
 My fact this week is that for many years in the 2000s,

708
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,440
 New Zealand's highest-earning sports personality was Tiger Woods' caddy.

709
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
 It's a bit embarrassing, isn't it?

710
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,920
 Well, who's your greatest sports star by brute force of economics?

711
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,160
 Is this guy who carries stuff around?

712
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,680
 Oh, there's a lot more to it than that.

713
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,360
 There's so much more.

714
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,480
 It's an incredible job.

715
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,360
 Being a caddy, if you don't carry the things around, you do get fired.

716
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,000
 That's undoubtedly the main part.

717
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,200
 I'll give you that.

718
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
 How much are we talking?

719
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,440
 Well, I very specifically worded it as personality.

720
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,680
 Obviously, it's not sports star, you know.

721
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,160
 The 2000s, you would have had Jonah Lomu, you would have had all these characters.

722
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,800
 I didn't want to call, and his name is Steve Williams.

723
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,360
 I didn't want to call him very specifically a sports star.

724
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
 I would say he's famous in the golfing world.

725
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,320
 Absolutely.

726
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,040
 The reason he got so rich is because caddies have a salary, right?

727
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,960
 They get paid all year round by their golfers if they're playing the whole year.

728
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,600
 But on top of that, when the golfer wins something,

729
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,280
 a percentage of it goes to the caddy.

730
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
 Now, those numbers are sometimes hidden.

731
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,680
 It's often thought to be 10% of what they get.

732
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,480
 So if you're winning, you know, a million dollars, that's a good amount.

733
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,240
 And he was Tiger Woods's caddy.

734
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,920
 There was an unprecedented, I think I'm right in saying, James, moment in golf,

735
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,600
 where he won all the majors.

736
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,120
 He won four back-to-back.

737
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,200
 And Woods, were there signs on the golf course

738
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,720
 that it was going to the caddies head?

739
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,560
 Like, was he turning up with a golden bag and things like this, you know?

740
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,160
 He had his own caddy, I think.

741
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,240
 Yeah, I don't really do the carrying part.

742
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
 It's not really for me that.

743
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,800
 Yeah, I think they're all quite humble caddies,

744
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,560
 actually, having met a few in my life.

745
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,240
 I think, and because it's historical, isn't it?

746
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,560
 It goes back to, you guys must have found this.

747
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,520
 It was like people in Edinburgh or something.

748
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,320
 A few hundred years.

749
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
 And they used to be kind of general porters in Scotland,

750
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,960
 who were, the word caddy was applied to just someone.

751
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
 It was like a delivery driver kind of thing.

752
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,840
 Yeah.

753
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,160
 It was a kind of person who would pick you up something

754
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,200
 and bring it to your house.

755
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,360
 And they were unionized and stuff like taxi drivers kind of thing.

756
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,920
 And, you know, if you needed someone to do you a job,

757
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,600
 then you would just get a caddy to do it.

758
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,640
 Right, yeah.

759
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,120
 And the thing they seem very keen to emphasize now,

760
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,440
 which probably people don't know who aren't into golf,

761
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,160
 is that there is more to it than carrying all the clubs around,

762
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,520
 even though that's the main part.

763
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,680
 Yeah.

764
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,560
 And I didn't know that they do give lots of advice.

765
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,920
 I'd actually like to know from James,

766
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,240
 actually, in reality, on the golf pitch.

767
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
 Jesus.

768
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,640
 You know, how much do they do that?

769
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,760
 Because the idea is with a caddy,

770
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,520
 you have to know the whole course,

771
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
 like all the bumps and lumps.

772
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,480
 Are they like a pilot for a ship?

773
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
 You know, you have pilots who know the local terrain

774
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,360
 and advise how to get out of this particular river

775
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,720
 without bumping in something.

776
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,440
 Okay, so if you play normal golf with your mates,

777
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,480
 you don't have a caddy.

778
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,800
 Okay.

779
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,240
 Be very rare to have a caddy.

780
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,800
 Would you look like a real tool if you turned up with one?

781
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,520
 Yeah, you would.

782
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,880
 I mean, it would be insane.

783
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,800
 It would be utter, utter insanity.

784
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,400
 However, if you like, let's say you go and play in St Andrews,

785
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,520
 which is the oldest golf course,

786
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,200
 one of the oldest golf courses in the world,

787
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,880
 probably the most venerable.

788
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,080
 You turn up.

789
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,920
 It's a really important moment in your life

790
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,360
 because you're a huge golf fan.

791
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,560
 They will have caddies there who will carry your bags for you

792
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,160
 and give you lots of tips.

793
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,440
 And they will really tell you,

794
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,600
 okay, on this hole, it looks like you should go to the right,

795
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,120
 but actually it's better if you go to the left,

796
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,760
 that kind of thing.

797
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,240
 Yeah.

798
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,920
 And in the professionals, though,

799
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,280
 would Tiger Woods have his caddy,

800
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,480
 you know, give him advice?

801
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:28,720
 Yeah.

802
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,680
 Or like, they're too good.

803
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,640
 Like, you know, in reality,

804
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,440
 would it be a free shot?

805
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,760
 So before the round start,

806
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,080
 your caddy would walk out and walk the whole course.

807
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,760
 They would make their books,

808
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,600
 which would tell you where all the shots come in from,

809
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,720
 the different yardages.

810
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,880
 They, yeah, they just give you lots of advice.

811
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,960
 The suggestions about which irons to use

812
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,240
 because you have multiple different ones.

813
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,640
 You have, you know, it goes even deeper than that.

814
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,160
 Like, for example, in Tiger Woods's case,

815
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,800
 there was one time when there was a boulder in the way of his ball.

816
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,200
 So he hit his ball and it landed behind the boulder.

817
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,320
 And they worked out that the boulder was loose on the ground,

818
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
 which meant it was a loose impediment.

819
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,560
 And his caddy, Sisyphus, was able to...

820
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,760
 [LAUGHTER]

821
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,040
 Temporarily remove it.

822
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,240
 Just for the moment, yeah.

823
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,680
 But no, and so that was his job.

824
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,320
 He had to get down.

825
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,360
 I think what happened there is they got a load of people

826
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,480
 who were watching to move it.

827
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,560
 It was part, actually, Tiger Woods had such a large team

828
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,280
 that it was his team.

829
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,480
 But legally on the rules,

830
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,280
 you can have onlookers come and move an object.

831
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,600
 If it's just sort of resting on the ground, rather.

832
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,400
 Yeah, exactly.

833
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,880
 So because it was loose, he was allowed to move it.

834
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,560
 This Steve Williams, who we're talking about,

835
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,120
 he used to be the caddy for Raymond Floyd.

836
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,280
 One of his jobs was when Raymond hit the ball,

837
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,680
 towards the hole.

838
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,800
 Both Raymond and Steve had to stare at the ball

839
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,480
 and will it into the hole?

840
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
 That was part of his job?

841
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,400
 Part of his job.

842
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,160
 Is that his job description?

843
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,320
 Well, you might get fired if it doesn't go in,

844
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,400
 and he looks at you and says, "You weren't willing it."

845
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,440
 [LAUGHTER]

846
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,400
 That was your fault.

847
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,720
 So yeah, so yeah, it's a real...

848
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,240
 It's like when you watch those car races that are off-road,

849
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,440
 where they've got someone sitting there

850
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,120
 with a little buck telling it, "It's like that."

851
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,760
 Really, drivers?

852
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,000
 Yeah.

853
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,760
 Well, so there was a very famous caddy,

854
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,880
 troop, in the Augusta National Golf Course,

855
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,040
 which I guess is the biggest deal in the world,

856
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,800
 as a golf course, one of the biggest deals in the world.

857
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,360
 One of the biggest.

858
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,000
 A big deal.

859
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,400
 Yeah.

860
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,600
 It's where the masters happens.

861
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,080
 Correct.

862
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,800
 America.

863
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,520
 America, yes.

864
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,320
 Thank you.

865
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,120
 In Georgia.

866
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,240
 Okay, got it, got it.

867
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
 And they had a very famous troop of caddies,

868
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,480
 so it was started in the 1930s, 1934, I think,

869
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,240
 and the caddies were all sourced from a local area,

870
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,840
 which was a completely black area,

871
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
 and they were all like black kids

872
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,720
 who were making a bit of extra money

873
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,080
 by carrying their bags around.

874
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,160
 And between 1934 and 1983, I think it was,

875
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,720
 it was like all black caddies who were sourced from there.

876
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,520
 I think the first white caddy there was 1983,

877
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,040
 when golfers started bringing their own,

878
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,320
 which was very controversial.

879
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,600
 But the godfather of the Augusta caddies

880
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,680
 was this guy called Willie Pappy Stokes,

881
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,360
 who started when he was 12,

882
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,200
 and he ran this caddy's school.

883
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,960
 But yeah, they set a lot of the golfers at the time,

884
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,240
 said it was completely down to the caddies that they won.

885
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,480
 There was a champion called Fuzzy Zella,

886
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,920
 who was very famous.

887
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,560
 Yeah, we all know the champion called Fuzzy Zella.

888
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,440
 We all know Fuzzy.

889
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,520
 And we all know that he was the only person

890
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,600
 ever to win the Masters on his debut.

891
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
 And when he did so, he said, it was nothing to do with him,

892
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,840
 he said he was led around by Jerry Beard,

893
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,800
 his caddy, like a blind man with a seeing eye dog.

894
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,520
 Fuzzy and Beard.

895
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,600
 Is that your takeaway of that, Anna Gollum?

896
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,720
 It's all I can remember.

897
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,120
 Is this true, James?

898
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,600
 I don't know if you...

899
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,560
 That's the person who plays golf here.

900
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
 They're known as the 15th club.

901
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,600
 I can understand that because you're only allowed 14 clubs.

902
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,880
 Right. And there's this great...

903
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,960
 But you're not allowed to use them for that, are you?

904
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,280
 Yeah, it's rare circumstances where...

905
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,840
 They're a bit like the daemon in Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, you know?

906
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
 Yeah, they're always a different animal.

907
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,360
 They're so umbilically tied to the golfer,

908
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
 you know, that's a real team thing.

909
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,520
 There's a golfer, right.

910
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,760
 If I'm saying his name wrong, I'm sorry, Ian Woozenham.

911
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,480
 Correct.

912
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,320
 He was doing extremely well in 2000 in the Open Championship.

913
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
 He was playing the golf of his life.

914
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,520
 Yeah, he was very far ahead.

915
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,160
 Oh, Woosie.

916
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,560
 Woosie.

917
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
 That is his nickname.

918
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,600
 Woosie.

919
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,520
 Has Fuzzy ever played Woosie?

920
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,920
 And then at this key moment when he was doing brilliantly,

921
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,880
 his caddy said to him,

922
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,680
 "There's too many clubs in the bag."

923
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,240
 And he'd miscounted the number of clubs.

924
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,560
 And the golfer, Woozenham, had to go up to the judge, umpire,

925
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,040
 manage charge, rules official.

926
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,840
 There we go.

927
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,200
 And say, "I've got 14, I've got 15 clubs."

928
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
 Yeah, this is a shot for every hole, I think.

929
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,720
 He was penalized a couple of strokes and he lost his cool.

930
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,240
 And it was all the fault of the caddy, just not counting.

931
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,640
 How many?

932
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
 Because he'd tried two different versions of the same club

933
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,480
 and then they'd all just gone into the bag.

934
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:46,960
 That's terrible.

935
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,880
 And he was ahead and he would have won big money

936
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,760
 and then he didn't.

937
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,720
 And then he was forgiven.

938
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,200
 Woozenham forgave him, probably through quite a gritted teeth.

939
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,480
 And then the next, he failed to show up on time for an early tee off.

940
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,440
 I think a few, not long after that, I think he got shown the door.

941
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,360
 Fair, absolutely fair.

942
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,880
 They do get fired every now and then.

943
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,880
 There's a guy called Robert Allenby, who's an Australian golfer.

944
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
 And he has fired a couple of caddies,

945
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,280
 but one of them, he fired them halfway through the round.

946
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,120
 And so one of the spectators had to come in

947
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
 and carry his bag for the rest.

948
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,720
 Really?

949
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,080
 That's good to be a serious infraction, if it's...

950
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,560
 I think he was a troubled man at the time

951
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,120
 and they'd had a bit of a set too.

952
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,520
 Okay.

953
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,120
 Did the spectator provide the advice?

954
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
 Or was he going, "You hit it sort of over that way?"

955
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,440
 A bit higher than you did before.

956
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,920
 It does sound really scary,

957
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
 like the intensity of some of these moments

958
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,440
 because of the penalties that you can get.

959
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,200
 That's fascinated by the rules of golf.

960
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,240
 There's a story from that same period with Tiger Woods

961
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,160
 and with Steve Williams, where it's the final day

962
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,520
 of one of the major tournaments.

963
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,400
 And he's going into the bag to get Tiger Woods a ball.

964
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,720
 And he's suddenly like, "There's way less balls in here.

965
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,720
 There's only three balls in here.

966
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,920
 There's meant to be six."

967
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,720
 And what happened was,

968
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,200
 Tiger Woods had been practicing putting in his hotel room

969
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,320
 and forgot to put three balls back inside into the bag.

970
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,080
 Yeah, that's what he was doing in his hotel room.

971
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,400
 So he's...

972
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,680
 So that's Tiger Woods' fault?

973
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
 Tiger Woods' fault, except no, it's Steve's fault.

974
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
 Steve should have checked the balls before they started.

975
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,800
 Now the game has started.

976
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,560
 And the issue is, if you can't say to the guy next to you,

977
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,440
 "Can I borrow one of your balls?"

978
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,640
 If he's playing with a different one,

979
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,960
 you will get a penalty and strokes will be added to your count.

980
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,080
 So he's going, "You've got three balls.

981
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,880
 Don't tell Tiger.

982
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,240
 It's absolutely fine."

983
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,640
 Tiger hits the first ball, scuffs it,

984
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,520
 goes, "Oh, this is crap.

985
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,800
 Hands it to a kid."

986
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
 Steve goes, "I can't take it off the kid.

987
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,000
 This is live TV.

988
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,440
 It's going to look so bad."

989
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,720
 So he doesn't do that.

990
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,760
 Then they go, and then later in the game...

991
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,880
 He's very brave to have to ask,

992
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,240
 "A kid, can I have my ball back?"

993
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,200
 Yeah, true.

994
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,560
 And then he hits it off into a spot

995
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,160
 where I think he wants to reset the ball.

996
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,760
 So he goes, "Give me my next ball."

997
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,360
 Now Steve knows this is the final ball.

998
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,160
 So things are going to screw everything over for Tiger Woods

999
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,560
 if he doesn't land this next shot.

1000
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,200
 I'm so stressed.

1001
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,520
 I know.

1002
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,320
 That's the thing.

1003
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,280
 It's like high octane.

1004
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
 It's like a poly-13.

1005
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,840
 Anyway, it makes the shot and it's fine.

1006
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,920
 But you don't really know what's going on.

1007
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,400
 Is that it?

1008
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
 Does the poly-13 end abruptly as well?

1009
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,760
 Yeah, it all works out fine.

1010
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,480
 Yeah, it's all fine.

1011
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,960
 Right.

1012
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,680
 Okay.

1013
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,400
 It's intense.

1014
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,800
 Yeah, wow.

1015
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,000
 It's so intense.

1016
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,560
 There's one other caddy who got fired that I read about.

1017
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,240
 I don't know if you guys know about him.

1018
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,160
 So first of all, they all have nicknames, apparently,

1019
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,040
 which is quite cool.

1020
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,560
 Literally, every caddy seems to have a nickname

1021
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,920
 like John Stovepipe Gordon or Frank Marbleye Stokes.

1022
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,800
 And there was one called Willie Cemetery-Pertit

1023
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,200
 who was Dwight Eisenhower's caddy.

1024
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,520
 Oh.

1025
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
 So his nickname Cemetery.

1026
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1027
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,360
 So his nickname Cemetery.

1028
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,440
 So he was fired in the end for being too old and slow,

1029
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,640
 but the way he got...

1030
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,120
 We all get there very slow.

1031
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,600
 James, your days are numbered.

1032
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,080
 But the reason he got his,

1033
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,800
 the reason he got his nickname,

1034
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,240
 it was given to him by Eisenhower

1035
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,600
 and it was because he by night was a jazz drummer

1036
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,800
 and he was leaving a gig

1037
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
 and he was jumped by this gang with knives

1038
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
 who had been sent by his ex-girlfriend

1039
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
 who was upset that he dumped her.

1040
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,480
 And he was very badly injured.

1041
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
 He was sent to hospital.

1042
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,120
 People thought he was dead.

1043
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,200
 He basically woke up in a morgue

1044
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
 staring into the eye of a mortician

1045
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,920
 who was about to, you know,

1046
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,640
 to cover him in wax or whatever and imbarm him

1047
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,920
 because he'd been given the wrong medicine.

1048
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,040
 Everyone thought he had died.

1049
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,440
 Wow.

1050
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,480
 And so from that day on, he was called Deadman

1051
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,600
 until Eisenhower said,

1052
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,840
 "I don't like having a caddy who's called Deadman.

1053
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
 Shall we go with Cemetery?"

1054
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,240
 Isn't that a good nickname story?

1055
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,880
 That is good.

1056
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,600
 That's really cool.

1057
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,480
 That's a solid one, Keith.

1058
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,360
 I wonder if he's in the caddy hall of fame.

1059
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,840
 He's not.

1060
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,640
 He's not?

1061
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,440
 Oh man.

1062
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,120
 I had to look into the caddy hall of fame.

1063
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,560
 130 men and women have been entered into the hall of fame.

1064
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,360
 129 men.

1065
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,920
 Exactly.

1066
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,320
 Actually 128 men.

1067
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,440
 There's two women,

1068
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,200
 but one of them isn't a caddy.

1069
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,720
 So it's a lady.

1070
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,920
 So Fanny Soonison, who is a very famous caddy.

1071
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,440
 She was Nick Valdos' caddy for many years.

1072
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,280
 She's the only actual female caddy in there.

1073
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
 The other person's called Laura Cohn,

1074
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,520
 and she's who founded the caddy hall of fame.

1075
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,760
 And so she's in there for honorary purposes.

1076
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,120
 Just to get herself in there.

1077
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,360
 Yeah.

1078
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,720
 That's very funny.

1079
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,800
 Someone else who's in there is George Lucas.

1080
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,280
 Oh yes.

1081
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,840
 Yeah.

1082
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,280
 It's a caddy hall of fame.

1083
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,920
 Absolutely.

1084
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,800
 George Lucas started his career as a caddy,

1085
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,200
 and he is actually the king of the yardage books

1086
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,920
 that James mentioned,

1087
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
 which is the books that now everyone carries around.

1088
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,840
 Actually now they've been banned.

1089
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,160
 Actually.

1090
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,120
 Have they been fully banned?

1091
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,360
 Like as in in the last maybe six months.

1092
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,080
 I'm sorry.

1093
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,120
 What's a yardage book?

1094
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,560
 It's a thing where a book that was sort of invented

1095
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,720
 by a few individual golfers in the 50s or 60s,

1096
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,960
 where they drew up the complete lay of the land,

1097
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,360
 very detailed, all the contours, the distances,

1098
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,720
 the angles and everything.

1099
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,640
 And then this George Lucas guy was like,

1100
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
 I'm going to make an official one.

1101
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,480
 Spoiler alert, it actually wasn't the same George Lucas.

1102
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,040
 I don't think, although I didn't a hundred percent check.

1103
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,080
 It is a different George Lucas.

1104
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,360
 What an incredibly, incredibly misleading fact.

1105
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,560
 Jesus.

1106
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,280
 Here we go.

1107
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,480
 I'm going to put you back.

1108
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,440
 Oh great.

1109
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,000
 Okay.

1110
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
 He's actually more interesting than George Lucas,

1111
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,600
 and they could be the same person

1112
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
 because the way he measures all the distances

1113
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,920
 is he goes around or he went around golf courses

1114
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,720
 with a laser and he fired lasers

1115
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,800
 at different spots on the golf course.

1116
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,320
 And you know, the time they took to bounce back

1117
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,840
 told him the distance it took.

1118
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,080
 Which, if that's not a light saber, yeah.

1119
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,720
 Yeah.

1120
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,360
 Right.

1121
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,400
 I don't know what it is.

1122
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,640
 Well, he does insist all the golfers he caddies for

1123
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,760
 will go as they're about to hit with the club, doesn't he?

1124
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,320
 Yeah.

1125
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,560
 Wow.

1126
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,040
 Yeah, he's wild.

1127
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,120
 He's, what's his nickname?

1128
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,920
 He has a nickname.

1129
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,400
 This is George Lucas.

1130
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,440
 George, not that one.

1131
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,240
 It was something like gorgeous.

1132
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,560
 Like.

1133
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,920
 Oh yeah, gorgeous with a J.

1134
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1135
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,200
 Wow.

1136
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,680
 Very nice.

1137
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,560
 Okay.

1138
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,160
 I don't know how I got onto this,

1139
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,360
 but I was trying to find sports where you can bring a friend.

1140
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,920
 Like, like carrying, I suppose.

1141
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1142
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,320
 Okay.

1143
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,520
 So, you know, weightlifting.

1144
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,240
 You often have someone to like help you with the weights.

1145
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,480
 No.

1146
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,400
 You would know someone to spot you,

1147
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,160
 you know, when you're lifting a big heavy bar,

1148
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280
 they might be able to step in

1149
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
 if you get into difficulties or whatever.

1150
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,920
 In professional stuff, do they?

1151
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,720
 I don't know.

1152
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,040
 But they might do.

1153
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,680
 They might do.

1154
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,080
 Yeah, yeah.

1155
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,360
 Anyway, just the Google, you know,

1156
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,240
 what shows up automatically

1157
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,840
 when you type in sports where you can.

1158
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,280
 It's quite interesting.

1159
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,960
 You've got sports where you can be short.

1160
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,080
 Oh yeah.

1161
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
 Fair for you.

1162
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,960
 I didn't look it up.

1163
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,120
 Sports where you can start late.

1164
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,160
 And I thought originally,

1165
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,720
 I thought that meant like at noon or whatever.

1166
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,280
 Actually, it turns out it's sports where you can start.

1167
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,240
 If you want to be the L.

1168
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,280
 Frank Baum of.

1169
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,000
 Exactly.

1170
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,480
 That's it.

1171
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,040
 Exactly.

1172
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,560
 Exactly, start late.

1173
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,200
 And wait a minute.

1174
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,680
 If you just, the gun's fired, everyone's gone.

1175
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,400
 Are you gone?

1176
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,160
 Just give me a second.

1177
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,680
 I'll start on the next lap.

1178
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,800
 Yeah, yeah.

1179
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,160
 And most of those articles,

1180
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,040
 I did follow this one.

1181
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,520
 It's mostly, look, even if you're 12,

1182
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,120
 it turns out you can start this sport

1183
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,800
 and be fine with it in life.

1184
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,680
 But the one exception

1185
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,120
 doesn't seem to be equestrianism.

1186
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,000
 Yeah, jockies.

1187
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,560
 So old.

1188
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,480
 Show jumpers are often in their mid 40s.

1189
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,640
 There was another New Zealander

1190
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,440
 called Julie Braum,

1191
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,160
 who debuted at the Rio Olympics age 62.

1192
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,840
 And a lot of the horses are old, too.

1193
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,560
 Are they?

1194
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,440
 They're teenagers.

1195
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,240
 In horses.

1196
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,800
 In horses.

1197
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,760
 They're quite old for a horse.

1198
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,480
 Yeah, yeah.

1199
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,280
 We've spoken to a lot of sports people

1200
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,200
 for our other podcasts that we won't go into.

1201
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,400
 No, I don't want to mention it here.

1202
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,960
 It's embarrassing.

1203
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,800
 It was last year when we did all that plug-in.

1204
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,160
 But occasionally,

1205
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,960
 like, I think shooters tended to be a bit late.

1206
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,800
 And occasionally, you do come up with someone

1207
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,360
 who started when they're at university and stuff.

1208
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,160
 Like, you get rowers who start at university and...

1209
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,320
 Yeah.

1210
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,560
 So it's time to get into it, isn't it?

1211
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,200
 Yeah.

1212
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
 Often in the Paralympics, you start later,

1213
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
 which is quite hard to decide to do that.

1214
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,240
 That's a slightly weird thing

1215
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,400
 that I wasn't expecting to learn about caddying,

1216
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,840
 which is, I assumed that maybe it was an alternative career

1217
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,520
 once you tried to be a golfer,

1218
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,400
 and then you pivoted into that as a secondary job.

1219
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,720
 But Steve Williams started doing it at six.

1220
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,960
 And a lot of caddies started when they were very, very young,

1221
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,640
 and that was the primary job.

1222
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,120
 Is it?

1223
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,920
 Like, it's a job.

1224
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,480
 That is interesting.

1225
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,360
 It's a skill.

1226
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:55,680
 It's a...

1227
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,120
 It's got this whole...

1228
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,240
 The money is so variable,

1229
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,480
 depending on whether you're Tiger Woods' caddy or not,

1230
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,120
 basically.

1231
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,440
 Yeah.

1232
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,720
 And there have been some controversies.

1233
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,080
 Like, there was a golfer some years ago

1234
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,400
 who he won $1.3 million on an event,

1235
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
 and he paid his caddy $5,000.

1236
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,960
 And that was a real controversy.

1237
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,520
 What is it? How'd you do this?

1238
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,960
 That was that Jim Furrick, was it?

1239
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,640
 It was Matt Kucha.

1240
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,840
 Oh, Matt Kucha, that's right.

1241
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,400
 Matt Kucha.

1242
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,440
 And there was a little bit of backlash to that at the time.

1243
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,800
 But he said, "Look, we had an arrangement.

1244
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,440
 He's very happy with it.

1245
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,400
 He's earned five grand a week.

1246
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,960
 Well done, him."

1247
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,240
 He's really happy with that.

1248
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,880
 Honestly, still people bring that up to Kucha.

1249
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,280
 Really?

1250
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,320
 In interviews and stuff, yeah.

1251
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,000
 So, is it that discreet?

1252
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,840
 Because Dan was saying you have to pay some of the prize money

1253
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,600
 to them, but it doesn't matter.

1254
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,040
 I think his normal caddy wasn't there,

1255
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,640
 so he brought in a new person and said,

1256
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,160
 "I'll pay you this flat sum."

1257
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,280
 Right, so there's not a rule

1258
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,480
 which is like you have to pay them 10%.

1259
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,560
 Just on rich sports people and jockeys,

1260
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,720
 you can be super rich and old as a jockey.

1261
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,160
 And do you know the--

1262
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,720
 Keep talking.

1263
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,080
 So, I happened to come across a list

1264
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,560
 of the 50 most well-paid jockeys in the world.

1265
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,680
 Okay, current.

1266
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,800
 And current.

1267
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,080
 And 29 of them are Japanese,

1268
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,720
 with 29 out of the top 50 are Japanese.

1269
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,560
 It's huge in Japan because it's one of the only

1270
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,880
 four sports you can gamble on legally.

1271
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,040
 So, they get loads of money.

1272
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,320
 And the top guy, Yutaka Takei, is 56,

1273
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,280
 and he's earned a billion dollars.

1274
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,160
 But what?

1275
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,800
 I think a lot of that money was when he was a sumo wrestler

1276
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,000
 before he got the azempic.

1277
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,600
 You're absolutely correct.

1278
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,480
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1279
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,080
 and that is Anna.

1280
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,120
 My fact this week is that if 88 elephants

1281
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,960
 balanced on a 50p piece on a parrotfish's beak,

1282
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,880
 the beak would not break.

1283
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,880
 What part is the 50p piece playing in this?

1284
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,960
 It feels like an unnecessary intermediary layer, does it?

1285
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,280
 I'll tell you, I'll tell you what part it's playing.

1286
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,520
 Pressure, it depends on area.

1287
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,640
 And I think I have to say,

1288
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,400
 and I have to come out and say it at the top,

1289
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,920
 because otherwise, someone's going to mention it.

1290
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
 I was clicking through some stuff,

1291
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,840
 and I ended up weeding an article in Scientific American

1292
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,360
 called Fun Facts About Teeth.

1293
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,200
 And yes, I'm a senior QI researcher,

1294
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,800
 and it's a long time since I read an article

1295
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,480
 called Fun Facts About X.

1296
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,960
 But it was a good article, and it was in this article,

1297
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,800
 and it said it's about an inch.

1298
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,840
 So, if you have them balancing on it, it's where inch.

1299
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,400
 So, I thought 50p is about an inch, probably.

1300
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,440
 One of the old ones.

1301
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,200
 I had the 50p on its side.

1302
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,920
 Did you hit it on its edge, but it's not.

1303
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,960
 No, sorry.

1304
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,160
 No, I think that would break it.

1305
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,040
 Sorry.

1306
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,720
 No, it's 50p laid down flat.

1307
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,200
 Then I've got a big apology to make to my parrot fish.

1308
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,040
 And this is just the power.

1309
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,520
 We're going to cut to live to see the experiment in action.

1310
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,960
 Abort!

1311
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,080
 Abort!

1312
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,520
 Have you factored in the weight of the 50p?

1313
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,680
 Because it's exactly 88 elephants.

1314
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,320
 I haven't.

1315
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,360
 Okay, it's 87.9999 elephants, and the 50p piece.

1316
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,120
 Asian or African elephants?

1317
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,040
 Bullocks.

1318
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,680
 Are we talking full grown males, or are we talking newly hatched?

1319
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,200
 All right, I'm just going to give you the amounts.

1320
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,600
 Okay, let's just take away the stupid metaphor,

1321
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,120
 and I'll tell you that one square inch can take 530 tons of pressure.

1322
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,680
 You happy?

1323
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,640
 Okay, what's a parrot fish?

1324
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,960
 So, it's a fish, and they have these beaks,

1325
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,400
 so they're the fish you often see on coral reefs gnawing away,

1326
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,320
 and they're quite beautiful.

1327
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,960
 What should move the elephants out of the way?

1328
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,800
 [Laughter]

1329
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,160
 Yeah, it wasn't a great dive.

1330
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,800
 The reef was covered in elephant dung.

1331
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,520
 It was horrible.

1332
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,400
 That's why they're dying out.

1333
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:38,560
 Yeah.

1334
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,280
 They have, they're very beautiful, except for their faces, I would say,

1335
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,960
 and maybe it's just a personal thing.

1336
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,160
 I get that a lot as well.

1337
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,920
 [Laughter]

1338
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,520
 Because they've got these weird beaks,

1339
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,640
 and it looks a little bit like, if you've ever seen,

1340
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,840
 what's it called, the sheet-ped fish, which has almost human, giant human teeth.

1341
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,560
 Yeah.

1342
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,920
 But their beaks are made from about a thousand teeth,

1343
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,360
 arranged in 15 rows, but they've been compressed and compressed and compressed,

1344
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,840
 and sort of a molecular level of woven to make them incredibly hard.

1345
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,480
 It's the stiffest biomineral ever found,

1346
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,320
 which, of course, is not the same as the hardest.

1347
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,600
 It's only the second hardest.

1348
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,160
 What's the difference between stiff and hard?

1349
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,640
 The questioner took me a sitting long time to work that out.

1350
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,520
 Did you have something you did?

1351
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,480
 Harder means if you, like, get a diamond on it.

1352
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,080
 One of them will scratch the other.

1353
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,480
 Yes.

1354
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,120
 Basically, yeah.

1355
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,440
 Okay.

1356
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,240
 That's oddness.

1357
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,800
 Diffness, I think, is more about how bendable it is.

1358
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,680
 So if you try and dent it with your fingernail,

1359
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,360
 it will dent the least out of any, what did you call it, biomineral?

1360
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,760
 Biomineral, yeah, basically just a thing that's made by nature.

1361
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,600
 It's fluorapatite, right?

1362
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,280
 Yes, fluorapatite.

1363
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,240
 And fluorapatite is the same stuff as you get on your teeth

1364
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,320
 if you use fluoride toothpaste.

1365
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,680
 Really?

1366
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,400
 Your teeth create fluorapatite, which makes them so strong.

1367
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,240
 I did not know that.

1368
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,920
 But I would not be able to, for example, as these fish do, chew coral.

1369
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,280
 No, because most of your teeth are made of dentine and other stuff,

1370
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,040
 but you do get small amounts of fluorapatite in your teeth if you use fluorine.

1371
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,000
 That is very cool.

1372
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,280
 But don't try the elephant trick.

1373
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,000
 Okay, so these parrotfish, they're very good in a way for coral reefs,

1374
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,480
 despite the fact they eat large chunks of coral reef,

1375
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,560
 because the reef gets algae growing all over it, doesn't it?

1376
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,560
 And that slightly inhibits the growth and the natural functioning of it.

1377
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,920
 So along comes Mr. Parrotfish and just crunch, crunch, crunch.

1378
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,400
 Because it wants to eat the algae.

1379
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,160
 Weird thing is the parrotfish don't want to eat the coral,

1380
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,640
 they just want to eat the algae on it, but it's bloody hard to scrape off, isn't it?

1381
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,160
 Yeah, there are loads of species.

1382
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,240
 Some of them just scrape off and some of them do more gouging.

1383
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,840
 And they do all kinds of varieties, but they're massive.

1384
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,320
 So each adult green humphead parrotfish,

1385
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,560
 which is a particular species of parrotfish, they're the biggies.

1386
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,960
 They can get about a metre and a half long.

1387
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,440
 They can eat five tonnes of reef per year.

1388
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,720
 It's a lot.

1389
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,760
 It's so much.

1390
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,320
 Yeah.

1391
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,600
 And then they poo it out, we've mentioned before, as sand basically.

1392
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,320
 Beautiful white sand.

1393
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,240
 Beautiful white sand, they're responsible for so much.

1394
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,800
 They poo out hundreds of pounds per year.

1395
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,720
 A single parrotfish can produce up to 90 kilograms of sand each year,

1396
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,240
 which is enough to fill the most popular parasol holder on Amazon.

1397
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,400
 At the bottom of a parasol, you have a really heavy sort of thing.

1398
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,360
 But it's not always heavy because otherwise, how do you get it to the beach?

1399
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,680
 What you do is you bring it to the beach and you fill it with sand

1400
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,160
 and that makes it heavy and stops your parasol from blowing away.

1401
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,720
 Sorry.

1402
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,200
 Anyway.

1403
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,640
 Well, you're the only producer of that.

1404
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,320
 That actually is quite disappointing to me.

1405
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,480
 One parrotfish would fill that in a year.

1406
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,800
 Well, that's less than I thought.

1407
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,520
 At first I thought you were talking about one of those parasols

1408
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,520
 that ladies had in lack of my fair lady.

1409
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,320
 Exactly.

1410
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,920
 Yeah, but you mean a big one?

1411
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,200
 Yeah, I don't think we've said before about parrotfish.

1412
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,200
 One of the other brilliant things about them

1413
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,840
 is that they have two sets of jaws, like the alien in alien.

1414
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,920
 They open the mouth, then uh-oh, there's a little mouth inside.

1415
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,400
 Second one.

1416
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:56,800
 Okay.

1417
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,120
 Yeah.

1418
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,760
 What are they using it for?

1419
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,640
 What's a word for that?

1420
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,680
 There is a word for that, isn't there?

1421
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,480
 It's pharyngeal teeth.

1422
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,680
 Pharyngeal.

1423
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,320
 Pharyngeal.

1424
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,440
 So I think moray eels have them and a few other things,

1425
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,400
 but they're really rare.

1426
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,760
 If you're diving a wreath with pharyngeal teeth, that's a moray.

1427
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,280
 Look at that.

1428
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,720
 James, that's beautiful.

1429
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,200
 Brilliant.

1430
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,960
 And those are the teeth which grind up the coral

1431
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,400
 and turn it into sand, basically.

1432
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,040
 Yeah, okay, right.

1433
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,560
 So the main teeth just bite off chunks

1434
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,920
 and the pharyngeal teeth are the ones that do the fine milling of the coral.

1435
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,560
 Yeah.

1436
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,880
 You mentioned the giant bump-head parrotfish, the big ones.

1437
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,520
 Yeah.

1438
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,480
 And they, so they fight each other by headbutting,

1439
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,520
 which I think was only filmed recently for the first time.

1440
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,040
 And it's just, it's quite funny to watch because they've,

1441
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,240
 they've got quite thin heads.

1442
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,800
 Like if you look at them face on, they're almost two-dimensional.

1443
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,680
 So you watch them going after each other and they miss each other.

1444
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,600
 Three-quarters of the time.

1445
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,320
 They just whizz past each other and spiral back around

1446
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,000
 and then eventually bump into each other.

1447
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,200
 It's like jousting.

1448
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:53,840
 Yes.

1449
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,080
 Yeah.

1450
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,440
 Did that happen a lot in jousting?

1451
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,960
 You just whizz straight past.

1452
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,360
 I saw some jousting last summer at a castle.

1453
00:49:59,360 --> 00:49:59,600
 Of course.

1454
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,000
 Oh yeah.

1455
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,840
 I was like, what do you mean, of course you did?

1456
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,800
 You're a renaissance man.

1457
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,560
 Oh, you really flipped that into a coffin.

1458
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,360
 That was amazing.

1459
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,720
 Yeah, no, it was great.

1460
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,600
 But they, they didn't, they didn't.

1461
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,720
 Was it not violent?

1462
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,520
 Oh, it was.

1463
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,640
 Oh, that's why you liked it.

1464
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,160
 Well, I blindfolded myself for the violent bit.

1465
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,240
 But I, no, it was, it wasn't too violent.

1466
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,920
 There wasn't, that wasn't enough gore.

1467
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,160
 It was, you know, everyone, everyone walked away.

1468
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,720
 Okay.

1469
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,280
 What was it?

1470
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,320
 Like, it was a.

1471
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,600
 It was, it was just a, I think it was Hever Castle in Kent.

1472
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,160
 Oh yeah.

1473
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:26,480
 Beautiful.

1474
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,600
 Ambulance Old House.

1475
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,520
 And they were just having a sort of medieval fairy.

1476
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,440
 And there was jousting.

1477
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,040
 And we all, there was a great hype man,

1478
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,440
 dressed as Henry VIII, who was doing a lot of crowd work.

1479
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,760
 And then they did a good, good bash at each other.

1480
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,560
 It was really fun.

1481
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:40,880
 Yes.

1482
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,200
 And was it, as with the giant bumper parrot fish,

1483
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
 that the winner got to shag the woman at the end?

1484
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,240
 That does explain why they sent us all home.

1485
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,440
 Wow.

1486
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,320
 So that's how that ends.

1487
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,120
 That's how that ends.

1488
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,680
 Yes, yes.

1489
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,640
 It is.

1490
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,520
 Although they all start out, or almost all parrot fish,

1491
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,200
 start out as women, don't they?

1492
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,160
 As females.

1493
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,320
 There are a few that are born male,

1494
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,640
 known as primary males, but quite rare.

1495
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,960
 And then as they get older, they get sexually mature.

1496
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,080
 And the biggest female in the group has a sex change, I think.

1497
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,160
 Well, it's one male and then a load of females.

1498
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,840
 So it's a harem situation.

1499
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,400
 And then one day the male wakes up and finds out,

1500
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,240
 oh, hello, my biggest girlfriend has turned into another bloke

1501
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,120
 who's now challenging me.

1502
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,640
 This is a nightmare scenario.

1503
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,720
 And the thing I find amazing about it

1504
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,800
 is that if you've got the harem,

1505
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,640
 which they do seem to be referred to as,

1506
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,040
 a female and a male, but then the male dies,

1507
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,760
 another female will know to change sex.

1508
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,120
 And how does that happen?

1509
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:37,760
 Is that unbelievable?

1510
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,920
 Does she think about it or does she kind of go inside?

1511
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,160
 Do some molding.

1512
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,040
 There is a different kind of parrotfish.

1513
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,480
 Just so these are not the only fish

1514
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,360
 that get called parrotfish.

1515
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,600
 This is a, I never know how to say it, Cichlid.

1516
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,000
 I always call them chicklid,

1517
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,760
 but I don't think they are chicklids.

1518
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,840
 That's a word that I always mispronounce.

1519
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,040
 Cichlid is what I...

1520
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,000
 There's land on that.

1521
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,280
 C-I-C-H-L-I-D.

1522
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,800
 But they are called the parrotfish.

1523
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,960
 These were invented in the 80s.

1524
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,520
 What?

1525
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,640
 I just find that so weird.

1526
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,760
 Like sea monkeys.

1527
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,960
 They were a hybrid of two different Cichlids.

1528
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,520
 Cichlids.

1529
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,840
 And I was on Tropical Fish Magazine website,

1530
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,360
 which said it was as improbable as Steve Urkel

1531
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,880
 and Madonna getting together.

1532
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,400
 That's one for the oldies, isn't it?

1533
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,280
 Who's Steve Urkel?

1534
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:25,920
 Steve...

1535
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,520
 Well, Dan knows who Steve Urkel is.

1536
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,200
 No, I don't actually know what show he was from.

1537
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,760
 I can't remember.

1538
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,080
 Oh, God.

1539
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,520
 But he was like a very annoying, sort of nerdy American...

1540
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,960
 Point Dexter sort of.

1541
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,840
 Oh, right.

1542
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,640
 And who's Madonna?

1543
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,320
 Which is the Virgin Mary,

1544
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,840
 which is why it would be so surprising for her

1545
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,440
 to cop off with Steve Urkel.

1546
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,240
 But they get bred because they're breedable ones.

1547
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,400
 These are for aquarium nuts because

1548
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,680
 they're on Tropical Fish Magazine.

1549
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,600
 They get bred jelly bean parrotfish,

1550
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,800
 which have been soaked in a dye and artificially coloured.

1551
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,560
 Some of them have tattoos.

1552
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,320
 So they're soaked in a dye and then permanently

1553
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,040
 they say that colour?

1554
00:52:59,040 --> 00:52:59,520
 Yeah.

1555
00:52:59,520 --> 00:52:59,920
 Wow.

1556
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,280
 Some of them have tattoos on.

1557
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,200
 Like you get people who tattoo their fish.

1558
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,040
 It feels bizarrely unnecessary because of all the fish.

1559
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,080
 Parrotfish are famously beautiful patterns and colours.

1560
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,360
 But everyone is different.

1561
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,800
 And those are proper parrotfish, not these.

1562
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,920
 These are the proper parrotfish.

1563
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,640
 Okay, sorry.

1564
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,080
 Oh, so maybe these ones are a bit more dull

1565
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,680
 and they wanted to be more like the proper ones.

1566
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,800
 So they tattooed them.

1567
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,440
 Very weird.

1568
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:17,760
 But yeah.

1569
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,400
 That is amazing.

1570
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,640
 And they get even more colourful when they're pissed off.

1571
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,720
 So depending on territory,

1572
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,160
 they'll get even more attractive.

1573
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,440
 Yeah, vibrant.

1574
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,040
 There's quite a few species of them as well, right?

1575
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,640
 There's between 60 and 90 subspecies of a parrotfish.

1576
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,000
 So when we're talking about one,

1577
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,840
 it might, a thing we're saying might not occur

1578
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,440
 in another subspecies.

1579
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,880
 But they do do that thing that we've mentioned

1580
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,760
 on the show before as well,

1581
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,560
 where they create a mucus bag when they go to sleep.

1582
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,600
 So it's a sack that they just sleep in overnight.

1583
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,720
 It just looks amazing, doesn't it?

1584
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,000
 It looks incredible.

1585
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,840
 And that means that they sleep so long.

1586
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,560
 They're so lazy.

1587
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,160
 They sleep 10 hours a night.

1588
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,120
 Oh, I imagine.

1589
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,160
 I know.

1590
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,480
 You just need to learn to build your own mucus bubble.

1591
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,600
 And you try that.

1592
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,800
 I have been trying, Anna.

1593
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,080
 It's pretty disgusting.

1594
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,840
 We need to clean this room every time you're in it.

1595
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,880
 Every night.

1596
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,840
 Yeah, yeah.

1597
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,120
 It takes an hour, I think.

1598
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,880
 The idea is that they do it to stop parasites, right?

1599
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,840
 And the way that they work that out is scientists

1600
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,560
 got a load of them in a pool or something.

1601
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,720
 And when they made their sleeping bags,

1602
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,400
 once they'd fallen asleep,

1603
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,240
 the scientists sort of very slowly pulled the blankets off them

1604
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,920
 so they didn't have them anymore.

1605
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,360
 And then they put parasites in

1606
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,960
 and found who got better than the most,

1607
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,480
 and they got way, way more.

1608
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,280
 That's interesting.

1609
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,080
 Because there's also a theory that they are using it

1610
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,320
 so that if anyone is trying to pull the blankets off,

1611
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,440
 they've got time to escape

1612
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,240
 rather than just being outright sitting there to be eaten.

1613
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,240
 I'm sure there's multiple reasons behind it.

1614
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:40,800
 Yeah.

1615
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,360
 So it's for big predators and small ones, in effect.

1616
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,480
 In a way, yeah.

1617
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,760
 That's what pajamas are for.

1618
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,240
 That's great.

1619
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,400
 Your pajamas are covered in metal spikes, aren't they?

1620
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,840
 But no parasites on Andy's.

1621
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,480
 No, exactly.

1622
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,840
 There was a test on the moray eels, actually,

1623
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,400
 an experiment.

1624
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
 Just while we're on the experiments done on these things.

1625
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,640
 So on the pharyngeal jaws,

1626
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,920
 the cool thing about them for the moray eels

1627
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,400
 is that it means they don't need to feed in water.

1628
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,960
 Oh, well, they can grab something like a mosquito or something.

1629
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,040
 Kind of, or a little bit of prey outside.

1630
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,320
 But I find this so weird.

1631
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,000
 Basically, it's to do with the mechanics of how you eat.

1632
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,240
 Like, all other fish need to be in water,

1633
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,160
 to have the mechanics of water so that they can feed.

1634
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,000
 We would find it difficult to eat if we were submerged in water.

1635
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,560
 Do you know what I mean?

1636
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,160
 Like, the mechanics of physics doesn't work as well.

1637
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,040
 So the scientists who did this on the eels,

1638
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,120
 they trained the eels.

1639
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,480
 They took five years training seven eels

1640
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,080
 to slither up a ramp, grab a mouthful of fish

1641
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,200
 from outside the water, and then go back into the water.

1642
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,360
 I don't think there was evidence that they were doing this before,

1643
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,400
 that they were eating outside water,

1644
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,480
 but I think they were trying to show how these jaws worked.

1645
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,960
 What if that knowledge spreads among the eel community?

1646
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,600
 And now...

1647
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,880
 They all leave the ocean.

1648
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,480
 Yeah, I mean, again, that's the start of a horror movie, isn't it?

1649
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,760
 Like beachgoers...

1650
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,960
 Oh, you mean disasters for us?

1651
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,360
 I was thinking disasters for the eels, but you're afraid of the...

1652
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,800
 I just think we shouldn't be teaching animals

1653
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,840
 to come out of the water and bite live prey

1654
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,120
 and go back in.

1655
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,440
 Yeah?

1656
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,880
 Sorry if that makes me old-fashioned.

1657
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,000
 Guy who's seen a jousting match at a castle.

1658
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:20,880
 Okay, that's it.

1659
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,000
 That is all of our facts.
