 [MUSIC]

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.360
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.440
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.920
 I am sitting here with James Harkin,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.280
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Tyshinski.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.520
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.080
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.240
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.080
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.200
 L. Frank Baum based one of

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 the witches in the Wizard of Oz on his mother-in-law.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.800
 >> I didn't know that he was a 1970s stand-up comedian.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.440
 >> It sounds like such a sexist fact, doesn't it?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.040
 >> Yeah.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.520
 >> But if we tell you who the mother-in-law involved is,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.640
 it won't sound sexist.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.920
 >> And also which witch it was.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.160
 >> And which witch it was, yeah, that's more important.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.200
 It's the beautiful and benevolent Glinda,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.160
 who is the good witch of the North.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.000
 >> Gotcha, you thought it was the green one.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.240
 >> No, I don't know what color she is, I've never seen the film.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.480
 Is it black and white?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.840
 >> She's famously, the wicked one, is famously green.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.280
 >> Okay.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.440
 >> And it also is black and white, and then not.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.720
 It was sort of the introduction of

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 Technicolor to Cinema World, really.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.320
 >> Is it?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.760
 So it's not like follow the black and white road,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.520
 they didn't do that.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.800
 >> No, they invented the color process

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.480
 halfway through the first screening of the film.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.720
 >> Yeah, very exciting, so quickly.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.920
 >> Just randomly.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 >> He had this mother-in-law who was called Matilda Elector Jocelyn Gage.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.520
 And it turns out that she was a very, very awesome woman,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.960
 as well as being his mother-in-law.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 She was one of the three leaders of the women's rights movement in the US.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.520
 So you might have heard of Susan B. Antony.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.720
 There was also Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and there was this lady,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.520
 Matilda Elector Jocelyn Gage.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.680
 >> She was very cool.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.320
 >> Yeah, she gave him lots of ideas for the story.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.600
 In fact, she maybe even gave him the idea of becoming an author.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.480
 And she came up with the idea of putting a cyclone in the story,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.400
 which spoiler alert is what sends them to Oz.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.960
 >> This is a spoiler alert from a guy who hasn't seen the film.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.600
 >> I couldn't work out, and therefore I have a theory on how she suggested the cyclone.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 She died in March 1898, which is just when he started writing.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.800
 And I wonder if he was having a massive mental block where he just spent years,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.280
 like, I've got this idea, but I've got no idea how to transport them.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.160
 And then on her death bed, she said, I've got it, cyclone, and that was it.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.640
 Because she literally died as he was starting the book.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.560
 So it must have been the first idea that was had.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.800
 >> I wonder if she just already half written this book.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.840
 And then when she died, he picked it up and went, oh, this is good.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.200
 Because she was also an expert on witches.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.120
 >> Oh, yes, she was, the real kind.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.200
 >> Yeah, because when she did a lot of her sort of feminism and all that kind of stuff,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.960
 people just kept calling her Satanic and the heretic and stuff like that.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.160
 And they would call her a witch, which is obviously a way of demeaning women in those days.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.600
 And as such, she decided, OK, I'm going to study them.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.520
 And she was a real expert on witches.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.040
 >> Yeah.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.600
 >> So that's another part that she had to do.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.040
 >> That's a very good point.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.160
 >> She inspired a term.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.360
 So she not only was a suffragette, she also was looking at any kind of discrimination

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.280
 that was going on in the States at the time.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.640
 And she wrote a pamphlet and it was called Women as Inventors.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.360
 And she basically said, here are all the women who have not been given their credit

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.000
 for all the inventions that they've done.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.800
 And years later, the term, the Matilda Effect, is used to describe exactly that.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.800
 So women who have been brushed aside from history and should get the credit.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.880
 Now, interestingly, there's a male equivalent to this, which is called the Matthew Effect.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.960
 And the Matthew Effect is when a male scientist who is distinguished and older often gets the credit

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.360
 if he has a co-writer who is younger and new to the field.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.240
 That was invented by a guy called Robert K. Merton.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.560
 Interestingly, his wife, Harriet Zuckerman, appears on the Matilda Effect list

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.560
 because she provided all the data that led to him inventing the Matthew Effect.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.080
 Yeah.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.200
 >> Can I ask the Matilda Effect, if you're talking about a really awesome woman

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.320
 who is like one of the main leaders of the women's rights movement,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.040
 but you start the fact off about her son-in-law who wrote a children's book,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.680
 is that kind of similar?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.160
 >> I think you're banked the right stuff, yeah.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.120
 >> Do you guys know what the reverse Matilda Effect is?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.760
 >> Okay, so it's where women get loads of extra credit for stuff that they hadn't done?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.880
 >> You'd think it was that, but--

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.920
 >> Is it this podcast?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.600
 >> Wow.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.880
 >> That is the reverse though, isn't it?

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.680
 >> Oh, wow.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.880
 I mean, it is logically the reverse.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.160
 I'm afraid that's not the thing that's been labeled the reverse Matilda Effect.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.080
 This was a quite interesting study that was done in Poland last year, actually,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.320
 where a Polish scientist ran this study where they showed over 800 school children

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.160
 a bunch of presentations about the history of math and science and STEM stuff,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.880
 and then as part of it, they mentioned people who'd invented certain mathematical or

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.160
 scientific physics-based things, but these were made-up inventions.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.040
 They were made-up people, and for one group of students,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.400
 they had a woman be the inventor,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.720
 and for the other group of students, they had a man be the inventor,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.120
 and it turned out when they asked the students afterwards,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.360
 when they'd mentioned that a woman was the inventor,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.120
 the people just weren't interested in the subject.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.280
 They were like, "Well, that sounds like a shit subject,"

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.560
 and they didn't want to study it anymore.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.200
 >> Oh.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.000
 >> And so we need to stop talking about women in science

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.160
 in order to get women into science, and it was the girls and boys.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.400
 >> It was awesome.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.480
 >> They were both like, "Ugh, women did this."

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.040
 >> And it was the same level of coolness of invention

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.800
 they were discussing for both the women and the men.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.160
 >> It was the same invention itself.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.760
 >> Oh, it was the same, it wasn't, okay, okay, okay.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.760
 >> It wasn't like someone invented a doily,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.160
 and this man invented the space rocket.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.720
 You'd run some great studies there.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.400
 >> But I think a doily is a cool, I've come into contact much more with the doily

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.440
 than the space rocket.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.400
 A doily has probably avoided more human misery than a space rocket.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.000
 >> No, it is more up your street, I agree with that.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.440
 >> I can imagine you starting your doily ex company

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.400
 when you become a billionaire.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.760
 >> The world's most revolutionary doily.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.760
 >> So before he was a writer,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.320
 L. Frank Baum worked in shops,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.000
 and he did amazing sort of window displays, didn't he?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.240
 Really, that's what he was famous for at the time.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.760
 >> Didn't you have a magazine?

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.320
 How famous can you be for writing a magazine about window displays?

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.720
 >> I think in the areas where he had window displays,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.240
 people would copy his ideas,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.600
 and then he had the magazine,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.840
 and he came up with lots of different ways of doing things.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.160
 Like he thought that if you had an American flag in your window display,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.880
 you shouldn't have a fan blowing it,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.720
 because that's not the correct way for an American flag to be flown.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.920
 It should be on the end of a massive stick with someone waving it,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.520
 like a figure of eight.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.320
 And he came up with a mechanical system

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.200
 to get a flag to go that way instead of being blown with a fan.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.160
 >> Oh, incredible.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.880
 >> So he just came up with loads of amazing innovations

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.160
 that we all know today, like that.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.400
 >> And then put it in his magazine.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.600
 >> And then he put it in his magazine

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.040
 and said, "This is what you should be doing, guys,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.480
 not your stupid fan thing."

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.960
 >> Yeah, okay.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.640
 >> I didn't know he did the window displays.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.520
 I thought he just wrote about them.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.840
 >> Oh, no.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.600
 We should say the magazine was called "The Show Window,"

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.040
 which then became a book called

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.320
 "The Art of Decorating Dry Goods, Windows, and Interiors,"

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.080
 which was almost the last thing he published

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.200
 before "The Wizard of Oz," actually.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.880
 >> I think it was in the same year, wasn't it?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.080
 >> That was 1900.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.360
 So it was maybe a year or two before.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.680
 >> I wonder if he's got anyone out there who, if they say,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.120
 "What do you think of L. Frank Baum?"

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.720
 They go, "I prefer his early stuff."

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.320
 >> He had a shop called Baum's Bazaar,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.160
 which was a complete disaster,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.880
 because it was lots of tap, basically.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.760
 It was sort of a...

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.360
 Do you call it a bizarre stuff?

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.080
 Very nice.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.280
 Didn't want to let that go unmarked.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.640
 >> You know, I probably would have cut that out,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.000
 but now that you've made a point of it,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.200
 I think let's keep that in now.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.120
 >> Let's shine a harsh light on that, then.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.240
 >> Thank you, Andy.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.960
 >> And it sold also.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.720
 It was a very novelty-based shop.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.560
 It was not a dry goods emporium.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.040
 It was, you know, like chocolates and...

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.720
 >> It was based on Woolworths, wasn't it?

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.880
 >> Yeah, it was any old stuff, like lanterns,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.800
 paper lanterns, strange glassware, anyway.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.720
 He opened it shortly before a very harsh drought

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.920
 decimated the entire region.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.680
 And the appetite for paper lanterns and amusing glassware

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.120
 just went through the floor.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.400
 And lots of people were ruined.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.400
 And I think that was the point at which,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.800
 I think his mother-in-law, I think Matilda,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.600
 was very concerned about his prospects.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.600
 She didn't originally want her daughter to marry him,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.120
 because he was a bit of a bum.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.880
 >> Well, he was just a very bad businessman.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.440
 >> Brilliant. Brilliant.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.120
 >> See, that's how you do it.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.320
 >> That was good.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.200
 Thank you for the lesson.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.160
 >> Say it loudly, and then a loud laugh to follow it up.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.240
 Yeah, he saw he was very bad at business,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.600
 and that bazaar, in fact, had to be renamed Gage's Bazaar.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.680
 And this was another member of his wife's family

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.920
 who helped him out, who I think was Helen Gage,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.800
 his sister-in-law.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.800
 So he drove the shop into the ground,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.720
 and his sister-in-law was like, oh my God, poor Frank,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.840
 he's screwed up again.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.160
 And so she bought up all the remaining stock,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.640
 renamed it Gage's Bazaar, and made it a very successful stock.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.320
 >> Really? That's so good.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.600
 We haven't mentioned his wife, Maud, daughter of Matilda.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.880
 She came into his life, as it was a quite quick marriage.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.120
 They were introduced by Bounds Auntie.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.680
 He immediately said, I'm going to be marrying you one day.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.200
 They married a few months later.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.760
 But she was quite brutal from some of the stories

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.080
 about how she ran the house in certain ways,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.000
 because she sort of did everything in the house.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.280
 >> Do you mean the donut incident?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.640
 >> Yeah, the donut incident.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.520
 >> Let's talk about this.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.160
 >> It's incredible.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.160
 So he comes home one day, Frank, with a box of donuts.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.640
 >> Right.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.280
 >> But he hasn't consulted her about buying these donuts.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.560
 She is furious.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.480
 She's the one who decides what food enters the house.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.240
 She wants only good food in the house.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.160
 So if he was going to do anything like that,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.720
 it had to go through her, and it was not going to go to waste.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.880
 So he was going to have to eat all of these donuts.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.720
 He couldn't manage it by the fourth day.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.000
 >> It's very much a Matilda and Bruce Bogtrotter situation,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.400
 isn't it?

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.600
 He has to eat the whole cake.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.240
 Do you remember that?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.440
 >> Oh, yes, yes, exactly.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.240
 >> It's that.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.960
 >> So by the fourth day, they start going moldy,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.400
 and he thinks, I can't eat these anymore.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.480
 So he sneaks out into the backyard,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.400
 and he buries them under the ground.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:56.960
 >> Right.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.040
 >> She knows something's up, so she goes into the garden.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.400
 She digs them back up.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.280
 She presents them back to him and says,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.400
 "You never buy donuts again," and he doesn't.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.360
 And she says--

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.160
 >> Can I ask, how many donuts did he buy

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.240
 that he couldn't eat them in four days?

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:14.800
 >> Exactly.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.680
 >> Well, he's got one of those Krispy Kreme full packs,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:17.840
 isn't he?

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.800
 There are like a dozen in there.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.360
 >> Anna, I've seen you go through those packs.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.920
 >> James, we don't need to talk about my history with Toda.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.560
 >> No, you're right.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.880
 That is the whole in the story.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.520
 >> Yeah.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.760
 >> I reckon I could get through 50 in four days.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.400
 No problem.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.200
 >> Well, you'd have a happier marriage.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.560
 >> Than he did, clearly.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.880
 I love the sheer list of his failures.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.520
 He's one of the--

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.400
 Actually, he is one of these guys who makes you think,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.080
 if I haven't made it by age X,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.640
 like, you know, if you haven't started by the age of three,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.800
 you're not going to be a tennis pro, for example.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.800
 Boom, until mid-30s, we're still just knocking about

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.600
 doing random stuff.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.800
 >> So, is he giving you hope?

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.920
 >> He's giving me a lot of hope.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.440
 He was a chicken breeder.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.320
 He managed to fail selling oil in America

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.600
 in the 1880s and '90s.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 He just couldn't hack it.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.640
 How do you fail a petrol company?

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.760
 Just ridiculous, yeah.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.680
 >> I thought the saddest story about Frank

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.840
 was, did you read about when he tried to be an actor?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.400
 >> No.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.200
 >> I will save him.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.480
 He tried so much.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.680
 The reason I know I'm not him,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.680
 I'm not going to suddenly be successful at 40,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.840
 is that he, like, had a new fan every year

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.040
 and he threw himself into it.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.880
 And his dad bought a bunch of theaters

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.640
 and he decided I'll be an actor.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.720
 So he kept on asking producers to cast him.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.080
 And eventually, one said,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.720
 "Oh, yeah, I'll definitely cast you in loads of leading roles,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.640
 but you need to provide all the costumes

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.200
 for all of the possible leading roles you could be cast in."

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.280
 So when he told his mum and dad,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.280
 his dad said, "No."

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.760
 The mum said, "Oh, come on, he's got a job.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.560
 Buy this stuff."

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.480
 So they spent thousands and thousands of dollars

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.840
 buying up all the leading roles,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.560
 like, you know, Romeo, Macbeth, all the costumes.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.320
 He turned up with the theater troupe.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.720
 On the first day, the actor was playing Romeo, said,

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.000
 "Oh, my doublet's a bit broken.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.920
 Can I just borrow that costume of yours?"

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.480
 Oh, my God.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.800
 "Within four days, every single costume

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.800
 had been taken from him and not returned."

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.160
 Did he play anyone in the play in the end?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.920
 He got some tiny little extra parts.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.840
 He got so many.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.480
 No.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.280
 That's amazing.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.720
 Speaking of costumes, by the way,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.520
 obviously a movie, The Wizard of Oz.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.640
 Yeah, yes.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.400
 The Cowardly Lion costume was very, very heavy.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.920
 But the really interesting thing about it

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.120
 is because it was made of real lion fur

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.320
 and because lions have distinctive fur patterns,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.680
 they had to use the same one

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.400
 all the way through.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.560
 Because if they wore a different lion,

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.560
 they'd be like, "Oh, that's just a different lion's costume

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.760
 because it's a different pattern."

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.320
 Wait, as in would a viewer, a casual viewer of the film,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.560
 think, "Where did the lion go?

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.880
 Who's this?

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.040
 Who's just a new character they've just introduced?"

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.200
 Well, on the other hand, you might say,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.120
 "Good work," to say, "Let's try and make it

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.880
 as much fun to do it to as possible."

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.320
 And probably to kill as few lions as you need to.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.720
 I agree with all of this.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.320
 I don't know if you needed to kill one.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.480
 If I'm going to be totally honest,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.960
 was the real lion fur completely necessary?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.720
 Because actually, I'm thinking about the character of the film.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.160
 He looks nothing like a lion.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.200
 They could have just put a yellow carpet on him, couldn't they?

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.960
 And then, "Oh, we'll just keep using the same yellow..."

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.240
 Actually, use the second yellow carpet.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:10.960
 It doesn't matter.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.200
 I had no idea that that was an actual lion's costume.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:13.920
 That was a real lion's fur.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.120
 "What? How about perm?

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.960
 Lions don't have that natural perm."

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.960
 Like, the head bit was separate.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.160
 The head bit was moulded.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.440
 But the actual fur bit was real fur.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.000
 Oh, right.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.200
 The one with the furringed.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.560
 Another interesting thing about that

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.760
 is that it went up for auction in 2014.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.840
 And one way of authenticating it

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.920
 is they looked at the patterns on the movie

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.280
 and they could see it was the same

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.200
 on the costume that they had.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.240
 So they knew it was real.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.640
 Ah.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.040
 And it sold for $3 million,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.840
 which makes it the third highest priced outfit

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.840
 ever sold from a Hollywood film.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.480
 Incredible.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.360
 And the winner is...

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.720
 Can we guess the others?

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.560
 I think you can guess one of them.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.560
 Batman's costume with the nipples on from the TV.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.360
 The TV version.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.160
 Very true.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.880
 Very good, no.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.080
 Jim Carrey's wig in Dumb and Dumber, the four haircuts.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.800
 Oh, I'm going to say Ruby Slippers, surely.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.480
 So they're not from that movie.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.160
 Marilyn Monroe's dress from...

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.360
 Is it the 70-year-rich?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.800
 The winner from the 70-year-rich.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.120
 $4.6 million that sold for.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.560
 Rosebud, the sleigh from...

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.280
 No, you won't get the other one.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.000
 That's not a costume.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.320
 That was an actor in that.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.360
 Not that you won't know it, but you won't have guessed it.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.600
 It's Audrey Hepburn's dress from My Fair Lady.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.480
 Oh, from My Fair Lady?

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.200
 Wow.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.480
 Yeah, that's incredible.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.080
 Andy, back to your point very quickly about...

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.560
 He was going through lots of different careers

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.960
 and he finally had enough and he was like,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.080
 "I'm going to become a proper writer."

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.480
 And he sits down finally to write The Wizard of Oz.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.720
 I really like this because you do often wonder

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.120
 if you've written something that is going to change the world.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.200
 I always wondered, does an author have that feeling?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.000
 He clearly did.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.480
 He got to the end of it and he had his pencil

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.240
 that he'd used to write the manuscript with

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.160
 and it was right down to the nub.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.720
 And he immediately framed that pencil

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.680
 because he knew that he'd written something that was great.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.680
 It was next to his window display pencil

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.080
 and it had his exotic chicken pencils in it.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:07.680
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.360
 My fact is that the journey towards modern weight loss drugs

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.440
 begins with the venom of a Gila monster.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.600
 Do you mean a Gila monster?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.160
 I do and that is how I've seen it written down.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.680
 It's because I don't live in Utah.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.680
 I've never heard it called a Gila monster.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.920
 We have had this discussion before we came on Mike

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.440
 and I always called it a Gila monster

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.640
 but apparently you've been wrong.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.600
 No, it's not.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 I don't even think you need to do the...

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.880
 Yeah, I don't know where that came from.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.000
 I think it's just...

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.880
 What do you meant to say?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.600
 Just Gila, right?

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.880
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.600
 It's healing people and it's a Gila monster.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.800
 Oh my god.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.000
 We blowed the shit wide open.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.560
 Wow, wow, wow.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.760
 You've got to reword the fact.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.720
 That's terrific.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.480
 So I read this on a great blog called Astral Codex 10

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.080
 and it was from a piece about Ozempic

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.560
 and it was about this whole class of weight loss drugs

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.680
 and where they come from.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.080
 They're called GLP1 drugs.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.840
 They were invented for diabetes

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.680
 and then the scientists noticed no, everyone's losing weight.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.920
 Human and rat who were trying this on, they're all losing weight.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.800
 The basic thing about these drugs is

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.880
 and the reason they work for weight loss

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.200
 is that when you eat a meal,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.280
 you're intestine detects that you've eaten

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.960
 and it releases this hormone which is called

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.600
 glucagon like peptide 1, GLP1.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.560
 That hormone tells your body you're full

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.560
 and commences operations to sort of deal with it.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.560
 So, you know, your body will, you know,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.080
 it tells you pancreas to release insulin.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.640
 It pushes sugar down and so on.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.400
 But the problem is, originally, you couldn't make a synthetic version

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.640
 of that exact chemical, the GLP1,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.320
 because it decays within a minute.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.520
 So if you were going to use that as a drug,

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.920
 you would have to inject yourself with it every hour.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.120
 You know, it's not an effective way

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.040
 of tricking your body into thinking you're full.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.440
 But in 1992, scientists found that healer monster venom.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.600
 I pulled out of the full Espanola, healer monster venom.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.320
 It has this chemical in it which does a similar thing.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.960
 It triggers all the processes that GLP1 does,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.320
 but it lasts two hours.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.200
 And so they started playing around with the structure of that

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.880
 and making a synthetic version of that.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.360
 And they came up with something called exenotide,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.120
 which was sold to treat diabetes.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.400
 And then other scientists piled in

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.560
 and started, you know, the thing which led to his M pic.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.080
 Yeah, I really like.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.640
 So it was 1984, Dr. Daniel Drucker.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.680
 I have a lot of connection to that.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.920
 I was born in '84, called Daniel as well.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.840
 Got it spooky.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.880
 It's really weird, isn't it?

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.120
 Jesus Christ.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.080
 I love that he found out this thing about the healer monster

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.360
 and thought, I need to test it,

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.200
 but they didn't have any of its DNA in the bank.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.960
 So any that they did wasn't usable.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.120
 So he had to get in contact with a zoo.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.320
 He had to go and actually get one in person

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.920
 and had to apply for them to go and find one.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.960
 He didn't go and get one.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.800
 Well, they actually, it fluted him on a plane.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.040
 Yeah.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.720
 Yeah, it was good too.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.280
 We'd go in the zoo and sneak one out and just come.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.240
 But he sort of talks about how it was very different back then

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.800
 when you were trying to get any of these kind of DNAs

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.480
 that you had a theory about.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.280
 And that's what it was.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.920
 He said, I think this could be to help diabetes.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.040
 And they went, fine, that's good enough.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.000
 We'll go and get you one.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.320
 It came in a cage with a metal bottom

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.480
 because they're so good at digging healer monsters

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.560
 that they thought if we put it in any other cage,

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.840
 it will just dig its way out.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.520
 Dig its way through the bottom of the plane.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.240
 Oh my God, imagine if that's what caused a terrible tragedy.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.520
 So then he did this work.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.760
 And then there was a guy called John Eng

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.520
 who synthesized a version.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.960
 So this Daniel Drucker was working with actual healer monsters.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.440
 And then John Eng came up with this version,

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.840
 which was fake, not fake, but you know what I mean.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.240
 It was synthetic.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.440
 Yeah, synthetic.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.840
 And he had never seen a healer monster in his entire,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.840
 he probably pronounced it Gila monster like that.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.040
 He'd never seen one in his whole life at that stage.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.320
 Also, we should say, obviously,

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.440
 as Epic has become one of the most valuable,

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.360
 remarkable drugs in the world.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.520
 It does sound like the beginning of a horror film, doesn't it?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.480
 Like, it was great.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.680
 We all started inventing this synthetic lizard saliva

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.480
 and the effects were great at first.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.680
 We should also say that Novo Nodesk, who make as Epic,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.960
 they say that the Gila monster study has nothing to do with Epic.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.080
 And that it was an important step in the making of this kind of drugs.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.040
 But their work was separate to the Gila monster.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.240
 Well, actually, I don't know if you know this,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.760
 but the Gila effect, James, is the name for when Gila monsters

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.680
 are not given due credit for the inventions that they make.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.480
 There isn't an enormous bank of Gila monsters

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.400
 somewhere in Denmark being systemically drained of their venom.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.200
 That's not.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.360
 But it did take about 20 years between the Gila monster discovery,

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.600
 all the way for it to be approved by the American pharmaceutical companies.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.120
 Yeah, that's because it was two different.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.480
 Yeah, it was a long journey.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.720
 And yeah, so that happened April 28th, 2005, which is my birthday.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.040
 Yeah, that's stunning.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.960
 Your 21st birthday when you became a man is the, my God.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.880
 And here's one more thing just to say.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.920
 Like these new drugs that people are taking to make them thinner,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.640
 it gives you this GLP1, which helps you not want to eat.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.880
 You can get GLP1 naturally.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.120
 Good news for everyone.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.640
 But unfortunately, you have to eat basically healthy foods and exercise.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.480
 Well, guys, it doesn't have to be that healthy.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.320
 You could literally just eat porridge instead of taking a Zempik.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.600
 And it does the same thing.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.600
 And that's an exaggeration because it's not nearly as powerful.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.160
 But I did find it really interesting, the role of fiber.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.600
 I had no idea what fiber did as an appetite suppressant.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.960
 So it does the same thing when you eat fiber.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.280
 It goes through your digestive system really slowly.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.560
 You can't really digest it.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.880
 So usually the stuff you eat, like Andy said,

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.280
 it triggers the release of this GLP, which tells your body,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.040
 "I'm full. Don't eat anymore."

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.480
 But then it goes away really fast.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.440
 If you eat loads of fiber, some brown bread, some porridge,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.080
 then that takes ages getting to your colon.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.280
 And then that triggers way more release of it later on.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.760
 So as Zempik does, it will tell you,

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.240
 "I'm full two hours, three hours after you've eaten."

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.360
 There's a weird thing about Zempik,

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.480
 which is that it works inside the brain.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.960
 So the anti-diabetic effect happens in your intestine

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.400
 because that's where the GLP1 is released.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.640
 And that is what triggers the body to slow down its release of sugar.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.040
 For example, to prevent a big sugar spike.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.840
 But scientists didn't know for a long time

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.120
 exactly how Zempik controls the mental sensation of hunger.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.960
 And it shouldn't be possible for it to happen

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.440
 because there's the thing in your body, the blood-brain barrier,

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.440
 which is meant to keep your brain just working on nice, clean blood

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.960
 with no other stuff in it.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.200
 Just stops any big molecules from getting in.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.680
 And Zempik, the drug, is a big molecule.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.360
 So what the hell is going on?

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.840
 And it turns out that if a little bit gets in

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.240
 and that activates a bit of the brain stem,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.360
 which in turn acts as a kind of transmitter, relay station,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.520
 for other bits of the brain,

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.000
 that then makes your brain generate its own GLP1

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.160
 because it's not only made in the intestine.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.080
 So that's why you feel less hungry.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.440
 That's really weird.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.000
 So there's another thing that I was going to mention

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.080
 off the back of - I wonder if Fibro would do this for you,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.960
 and I don't think it does.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.120
 One of the side effects of taking a Zempik and other weight loss drugs

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.600
 is a lot of people have reported the stopping of what they call food noise

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.480
 and food noise.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.680
 I've never personally had it, but if you need -

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.200
 I've sat next to you while you're eating,

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.960
 and you do have a lot of food noise.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.320
 I have outward food noise.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.320
 Yeah, not inside food noise.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.800
 And inside food noise is if you can't help,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.320
 but keep eating and keep eating,

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.840
 it's your head talking to you going,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.040
 "We need food. We need food right now.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:15.600
 Do you see that place?

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.640
 Why don't you get some food?"

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.640
 And it's this thing that people really suffer from

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.200
 when they're trying to be all done.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.240
 I don't think it's always necessarily like a voice saying it.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.600
 It could be just a feeling.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.080
 Exactly.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.200
 They call it the noise.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.720
 And supposedly, a Zempik knocks out the noise as well as suppressing the -

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.400
 But is that just because you feel full?

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.720
 And so your body, your brains can stop saying it?

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.920
 I think people who are full still have the noise going,

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.200
 "We could probably get a bit more."

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.480
 "We could probably get a bit more."

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.000
 "We could probably get a bit more."

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.800
 Another doughnut.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.240
 "Come on, you can do it."

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.560
 It's great that mould off the top, but it's still good.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.600
 It is the case that it's not just about when you're full,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.640
 because it stops other cravings, I think.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.080
 So it's supposed to be quite good for people who are addicted to other things.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:54.880
 Yes.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.680
 And unfortunately, people who are addicted to exercise,

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.760
 it seems to stop you from wanting to exercise.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.920
 You don't need to anymore, you've been.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.280
 We haven't actually mentioned the real major player in the Zempik story.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.600
 And that is the great theme tune it has.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.960
 You know, Magic by Van Kled Pilot.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.840
 So that it's, "Oh, whoa, whoa, it's magic."

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.480
 You know that one?

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:16.800
 Okay.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.840
 Okay, Andy doesn't know it.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.080
 Well, we might not be able to put that in for legal reasons,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.920
 but we'll Google it if we haven't.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.240
 But they changed it to, "Okay, so, oh, oh, it's magic."

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.720
 Oh.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.120
 They changed it to, "Oh, oh, oh, ozempik."

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.680
 And so, everyone was singing it.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.200
 And they were saying that psychologically,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.600
 they think it worked really well, because it's such an upbeat song.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.480
 It makes you feel good, but you all at the certain age know

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.800
 that the word that ozempik represents is magic,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.560
 and magic is now in your head.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.720
 And so, the lead singer of Pilot had no idea that this was happening.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.000
 He just started getting messages going,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.680
 "I'm hearing your song everywhere in America."

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.200
 And he was like, "What's going on?"

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.520
 Because they're able to license the song out,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.800
 no one had to ask him for its use of adverts and...

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.240
 Okay, so it sounds like we can use it.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.920
 Sing the whole thing.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.280
 Unfortunately, it'll be owned by a huge multinational music company.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.320
 That's the issue, yeah.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.320
 But so, he himself is so on board with it

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.000
 that he's even gone back to Abbey Road

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.280
 to record the ozempik version of the song.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.440
 Is it possible that all of the science behind ozempik is nonsense,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.280
 and the only way it works is that that theme tune

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.280
 has replaced food noise in people's heads?

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.680
 That could be it.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.120
 Shall we go on to Healer Monsters?

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.400
 I said at the start, we're blowing shit wide open.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.920
 They do open their bums to keep cool.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.400
 Clever.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:30.880
 Can they do it?

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.680
 Can they just, with thought, or like with muscle movement?

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.960
 They don't hold it open.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.840
 They don't hold it open.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.560
 That's what I'm asking.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.320
 They don't have a poseable thumb stand.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.240
 What do you do with a finger?

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.280
 Well, they could do each other's.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.560
 Basically, a lot of reptiles keep themselves cool by opening their mouths.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.880
 But they can open the cloacas as well,

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.400
 which will help moisture evaporate,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.320
 and it can cool them by up to three degrees.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.680
 That is a lot for Healer Monster parties that must be,

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.560
 "Are you feeling too hot?"

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:56.880
 No.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.720
 I think you are.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.440
 Shut your asshole at the dinner table.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.840
 Because they're found in the desert of North America, aren't they?

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.280
 Yeah, they have underground mostly, because it's so hot.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.720
 They only come out for a few weeks each year.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.000
 You just see a bum sticking out.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.120
 But their tail as well, right, is amazing.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.120
 When I was reading about them, I thought,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.200
 "Well, that's a cool thing. I wish we could do that as well."

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.880
 Well, store your fat in a tail.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.080
 Yeah, so it means that they only need a few meals per year, basically,

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.640
 and if they're in trouble, that's their stock sitting there,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.080
 all the fat in their tail.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.520
 There's another thing they can do,

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.240
 and this, I'm afraid, is at that end of the body related to the bum thing.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.240
 They store water in their bladder, right?

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.920
 And then the phrase I found was,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.640
 "They reabsorb it across the bladder epithelium."

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.880
 And what that means is they can have a reverse piss inside themselves back into their system.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.760
 It's not mad.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.000
 Can they do that just with thought?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.600
 Or do they have to shut their hands off?

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.640
 Squeeze.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:05.280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.800
 My fact this week is that for many years in the 2000s,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.440
 New Zealand's highest-earning sports personality was Tiger Woods' caddy.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.520
 It's a bit embarrassing, isn't it?

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.920
 Well, who's your greatest sports star by brute force of economics?

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.160
 Is this guy who carries stuff around?

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.680
 Oh, there's a lot more to it than that.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.360
 There's so much more.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.480
 It's an incredible job.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.360
 Being a caddy, if you don't carry the things around, you do get fired.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.000
 That's undoubtedly the main part.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.200
 I'll give you that.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.400
 How much are we talking?

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.440
 Well, I very specifically worded it as personality.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.680
 Obviously, it's not sports star, you know.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.160
 The 2000s, you would have had Jonah Lomu, you would have had all these characters.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.800
 I didn't want to call, and his name is Steve Williams.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.360
 I didn't want to call him very specifically a sports star.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.520
 I would say he's famous in the golfing world.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.320
 Absolutely.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.040
 The reason he got so rich is because caddies have a salary, right?

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.960
 They get paid all year round by their golfers if they're playing the whole year.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.600
 But on top of that, when the golfer wins something,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.280
 a percentage of it goes to the caddy.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.280
 Now, those numbers are sometimes hidden.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.680
 It's often thought to be 10% of what they get.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.480
 So if you're winning, you know, a million dollars, that's a good amount.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.240
 And he was Tiger Woods's caddy.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.920
 There was an unprecedented, I think I'm right in saying, James, moment in golf,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.600
 where he won all the majors.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.120
 He won four back-to-back.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.200
 And Woods, were there signs on the golf course

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.720
 that it was going to the caddies head?

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.560
 Like, was he turning up with a golden bag and things like this, you know?

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.160
 He had his own caddy, I think.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.240
 Yeah, I don't really do the carrying part.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.480
 It's not really for me that.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.800
 Yeah, I think they're all quite humble caddies,

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.560
 actually, having met a few in my life.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.240
 I think, and because it's historical, isn't it?

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.560
 It goes back to, you guys must have found this.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.520
 It was like people in Edinburgh or something.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.320
 A few hundred years.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.480
 And they used to be kind of general porters in Scotland,

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.960
 who were, the word caddy was applied to just someone.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.960
 It was like a delivery driver kind of thing.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.840
 Yeah.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.160
 It was a kind of person who would pick you up something

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.200
 and bring it to your house.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.360
 And they were unionized and stuff like taxi drivers kind of thing.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.920
 And, you know, if you needed someone to do you a job,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.600
 then you would just get a caddy to do it.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.640
 Right, yeah.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.120
 And the thing they seem very keen to emphasize now,

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.440
 which probably people don't know who aren't into golf,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.160
 is that there is more to it than carrying all the clubs around,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.520
 even though that's the main part.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:25.680
 Yeah.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.560
 And I didn't know that they do give lots of advice.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.920
 I'd actually like to know from James,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.240
 actually, in reality, on the golf pitch.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.240
 Jesus.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.640
 You know, how much do they do that?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.760
 Because the idea is with a caddy,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.520
 you have to know the whole course,

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.960
 like all the bumps and lumps.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.480
 Are they like a pilot for a ship?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.640
 You know, you have pilots who know the local terrain

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.360
 and advise how to get out of this particular river

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.720
 without bumping in something.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.440
 Okay, so if you play normal golf with your mates,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.480
 you don't have a caddy.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.800
 Okay.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.240
 Be very rare to have a caddy.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.800
 Would you look like a real tool if you turned up with one?

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.520
 Yeah, you would.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.880
 I mean, it would be insane.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.800
 It would be utter, utter insanity.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.400
 However, if you like, let's say you go and play in St Andrews,

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.520
 which is the oldest golf course,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.200
 one of the oldest golf courses in the world,

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.880
 probably the most venerable.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.080
 You turn up.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.920
 It's a really important moment in your life

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.360
 because you're a huge golf fan.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.560
 They will have caddies there who will carry your bags for you

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.160
 and give you lots of tips.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.440
 And they will really tell you,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.600
 okay, on this hole, it looks like you should go to the right,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.120
 but actually it's better if you go to the left,

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:23.760
 that kind of thing.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.240
 Yeah.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.920
 And in the professionals, though,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.280
 would Tiger Woods have his caddy,

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.480
 you know, give him advice?

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:28.720
 Yeah.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.680
 Or like, they're too good.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.640
 Like, you know, in reality,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.440
 would it be a free shot?

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.760
 So before the round start,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.080
 your caddy would walk out and walk the whole course.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.760
 They would make their books,

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.600
 which would tell you where all the shots come in from,

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.720
 the different yardages.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.880
 They, yeah, they just give you lots of advice.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.960
 The suggestions about which irons to use

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.240
 because you have multiple different ones.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.640
 You have, you know, it goes even deeper than that.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.160
 Like, for example, in Tiger Woods's case,

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.800
 there was one time when there was a boulder in the way of his ball.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.200
 So he hit his ball and it landed behind the boulder.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.320
 And they worked out that the boulder was loose on the ground,

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.480
 which meant it was a loose impediment.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.560
 And his caddy, Sisyphus, was able to...

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.040
 Temporarily remove it.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.240
 Just for the moment, yeah.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.680
 But no, and so that was his job.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.320
 He had to get down.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.360
 I think what happened there is they got a load of people

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.480
 who were watching to move it.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.560
 It was part, actually, Tiger Woods had such a large team

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.280
 that it was his team.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.480
 But legally on the rules,

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.280
 you can have onlookers come and move an object.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.600
 If it's just sort of resting on the ground, rather.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.880
 So because it was loose, he was allowed to move it.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.560
 This Steve Williams, who we're talking about,

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.120
 he used to be the caddy for Raymond Floyd.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.280
 One of his jobs was when Raymond hit the ball,

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.680
 towards the hole.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.800
 Both Raymond and Steve had to stare at the ball

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.480
 and will it into the hole?

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.680
 That was part of his job?

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.400
 Part of his job.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.160
 Is that his job description?

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.320
 Well, you might get fired if it doesn't go in,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.400
 and he looks at you and says, "You weren't willing it."

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.400
 That was your fault.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.720
 So yeah, so yeah, it's a real...

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.240
 It's like when you watch those car races that are off-road,

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.440
 where they've got someone sitting there

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.120
 with a little buck telling it, "It's like that."

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:57.760
 Really, drivers?

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.000
 Yeah.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.760
 Well, so there was a very famous caddy,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.880
 troop, in the Augusta National Golf Course,

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.040
 which I guess is the biggest deal in the world,

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.800
 as a golf course, one of the biggest deals in the world.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.360
 One of the biggest.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.000
 A big deal.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.400
 Yeah.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.600
 It's where the masters happens.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.080
 Correct.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:12.800
 America.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.520
 America, yes.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.320
 Thank you.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.120
 In Georgia.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.240
 Okay, got it, got it.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.640
 And they had a very famous troop of caddies,

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.480
 so it was started in the 1930s, 1934, I think,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.240
 and the caddies were all sourced from a local area,

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.840
 which was a completely black area,

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.120
 and they were all like black kids

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.720
 who were making a bit of extra money

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.080
 by carrying their bags around.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.160
 And between 1934 and 1983, I think it was,

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.720
 it was like all black caddies who were sourced from there.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.520
 I think the first white caddy there was 1983,

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.040
 when golfers started bringing their own,

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.320
 which was very controversial.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.600
 But the godfather of the Augusta caddies

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.680
 was this guy called Willie Pappy Stokes,

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.360
 who started when he was 12,

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.200
 and he ran this caddy's school.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.960
 But yeah, they set a lot of the golfers at the time,

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.240
 said it was completely down to the caddies that they won.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.480
 There was a champion called Fuzzy Zella,

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.920
 who was very famous.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.560
 Yeah, we all know the champion called Fuzzy Zella.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.440
 We all know Fuzzy.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.520
 And we all know that he was the only person

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.600
 ever to win the Masters on his debut.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.760
 And when he did so, he said, it was nothing to do with him,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.840
 he said he was led around by Jerry Beard,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.800
 his caddy, like a blind man with a seeing eye dog.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.520
 Fuzzy and Beard.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.600
 Is that your takeaway of that, Anna Gollum?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.720
 It's all I can remember.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.120
 Is this true, James?

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:25.600
 I don't know if you...

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.560
 That's the person who plays golf here.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.080
 They're known as the 15th club.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.600
 I can understand that because you're only allowed 14 clubs.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.880
 Right. And there's this great...

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.960
 But you're not allowed to use them for that, are you?

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.280
 Yeah, it's rare circumstances where...

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:45.840
 They're a bit like the daemon in Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, you know?

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.360
 Yeah, they're always a different animal.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.360
 They're so umbilically tied to the golfer,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.120
 you know, that's a real team thing.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.520
 There's a golfer, right.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.760
 If I'm saying his name wrong, I'm sorry, Ian Woozenham.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.480
 Correct.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.320
 He was doing extremely well in 2000 in the Open Championship.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.920
 He was playing the golf of his life.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.520
 Yeah, he was very far ahead.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.160
 Oh, Woosie.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:06.560
 Woosie.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.120
 That is his nickname.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.600
 Woosie.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.520
 Has Fuzzy ever played Woosie?

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.920
 And then at this key moment when he was doing brilliantly,

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.880
 his caddy said to him,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.680
 "There's too many clubs in the bag."

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.240
 And he'd miscounted the number of clubs.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.560
 And the golfer, Woozenham, had to go up to the judge, umpire,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.040
 manage charge, rules official.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.840
 There we go.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.200
 And say, "I've got 14, I've got 15 clubs."

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.960
 Yeah, this is a shot for every hole, I think.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.720
 He was penalized a couple of strokes and he lost his cool.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.240
 And it was all the fault of the caddy, just not counting.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:42.640
 How many?

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.640
 Because he'd tried two different versions of the same club

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.480
 and then they'd all just gone into the bag.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:46.960
 That's terrible.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.880
 And he was ahead and he would have won big money

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.760
 and then he didn't.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.720
 And then he was forgiven.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.200
 Woozenham forgave him, probably through quite a gritted teeth.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.480
 And then the next, he failed to show up on time for an early tee off.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.440
 I think a few, not long after that, I think he got shown the door.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.360
 Fair, absolutely fair.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.880
 They do get fired every now and then.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.880
 There's a guy called Robert Allenby, who's an Australian golfer.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.560
 And he has fired a couple of caddies,

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.280
 but one of them, he fired them halfway through the round.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.120
 And so one of the spectators had to come in

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.400
 and carry his bag for the rest.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:14.720
 Really?

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.080
 That's good to be a serious infraction, if it's...

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.560
 I think he was a troubled man at the time

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.120
 and they'd had a bit of a set too.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:23.520
 Okay.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.120
 Did the spectator provide the advice?

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.120
 Or was he going, "You hit it sort of over that way?"

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.440
 A bit higher than you did before.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.920
 It does sound really scary,

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.920
 like the intensity of some of these moments

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.440
 because of the penalties that you can get.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.200
 That's fascinated by the rules of golf.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.240
 There's a story from that same period with Tiger Woods

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.160
 and with Steve Williams, where it's the final day

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.520
 of one of the major tournaments.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.400
 And he's going into the bag to get Tiger Woods a ball.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.720
 And he's suddenly like, "There's way less balls in here.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.720
 There's only three balls in here.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.920
 There's meant to be six."

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.720
 And what happened was,

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:57.200
 Tiger Woods had been practicing putting in his hotel room

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.320
 and forgot to put three balls back inside into the bag.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.080
 Yeah, that's what he was doing in his hotel room.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.400
 So he's...

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.680
 So that's Tiger Woods' fault?

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.680
 Tiger Woods' fault, except no, it's Steve's fault.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.680
 Steve should have checked the balls before they started.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.800
 Now the game has started.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.560
 And the issue is, if you can't say to the guy next to you,

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.440
 "Can I borrow one of your balls?"

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.640
 If he's playing with a different one,

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.960
 you will get a penalty and strokes will be added to your count.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.080
 So he's going, "You've got three balls.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:22.880
 Don't tell Tiger.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.240
 It's absolutely fine."

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.640
 Tiger hits the first ball, scuffs it,

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.520
 goes, "Oh, this is crap.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.800
 Hands it to a kid."

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.880
 Steve goes, "I can't take it off the kid.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.000
 This is live TV.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.440
 It's going to look so bad."

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.720
 So he doesn't do that.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.760
 Then they go, and then later in the game...

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.880
 He's very brave to have to ask,

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.240
 "A kid, can I have my ball back?"

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.200
 Yeah, true.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.560
 And then he hits it off into a spot

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.160
 where I think he wants to reset the ball.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.760
 So he goes, "Give me my next ball."

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.360
 Now Steve knows this is the final ball.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.160
 So things are going to screw everything over for Tiger Woods

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.560
 if he doesn't land this next shot.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.200
 I'm so stressed.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:55.520
 I know.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.320
 That's the thing.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.280
 It's like high octane.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.320
 It's like a poly-13.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.840
 Anyway, it makes the shot and it's fine.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.920
 But you don't really know what's going on.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.400
 Is that it?

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.400
 Does the poly-13 end abruptly as well?

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.760
 Yeah, it all works out fine.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.480
 Yeah, it's all fine.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:08.960
 Right.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.680
 Okay.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.400
 It's intense.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:10.800
 Yeah, wow.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.000
 It's so intense.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.560
 There's one other caddy who got fired that I read about.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.240
 I don't know if you guys know about him.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.160
 So first of all, they all have nicknames, apparently,

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.040
 which is quite cool.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.560
 Literally, every caddy seems to have a nickname

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.920
 like John Stovepipe Gordon or Frank Marbleye Stokes.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.800
 And there was one called Willie Cemetery-Pertit

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.200
 who was Dwight Eisenhower's caddy.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:29.520
 Oh.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.040
 So his nickname Cemetery.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.360
 So his nickname Cemetery.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.440
 So he was fired in the end for being too old and slow,

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.640
 but the way he got...

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.120
 We all get there very slow.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.600
 James, your days are numbered.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.080
 But the reason he got his,

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.800
 the reason he got his nickname,

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.240
 it was given to him by Eisenhower

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.600
 and it was because he by night was a jazz drummer

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.800
 and he was leaving a gig

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.200
 and he was jumped by this gang with knives

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.800
 who had been sent by his ex-girlfriend

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.800
 who was upset that he dumped her.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.480
 And he was very badly injured.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.760
 He was sent to hospital.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.120
 People thought he was dead.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.200
 He basically woke up in a morgue

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.880
 staring into the eye of a mortician

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.920
 who was about to, you know,

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.640
 to cover him in wax or whatever and imbarm him

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.920
 because he'd been given the wrong medicine.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.040
 Everyone thought he had died.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:15.440
 Wow.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.480
 And so from that day on, he was called Deadman

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.600
 until Eisenhower said,

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.840
 "I don't like having a caddy who's called Deadman.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.840
 Shall we go with Cemetery?"

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.240
 Isn't that a good nickname story?

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:26.880
 That is good.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.600
 That's really cool.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.480
 That's a solid one, Keith.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.360
 I wonder if he's in the caddy hall of fame.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:31.840
 He's not.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.640
 He's not?

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.440
 Oh man.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.120
 I had to look into the caddy hall of fame.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.560
 130 men and women have been entered into the hall of fame.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.360
 129 men.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:39.920
 Exactly.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.320
 Actually 128 men.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.440
 There's two women,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.200
 but one of them isn't a caddy.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.720
 So it's a lady.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.920
 So Fanny Soonison, who is a very famous caddy.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.440
 She was Nick Valdos' caddy for many years.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.280
 She's the only actual female caddy in there.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.280
 The other person's called Laura Cohn,

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.520
 and she's who founded the caddy hall of fame.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.760
 And so she's in there for honorary purposes.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.120
 Just to get herself in there.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.360
 Yeah.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.720
 That's very funny.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.800
 Someone else who's in there is George Lucas.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.280
 Oh yes.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.840
 Yeah.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.280
 It's a caddy hall of fame.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:09.920
 Absolutely.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.800
 George Lucas started his career as a caddy,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.200
 and he is actually the king of the yardage books

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:15.920
 that James mentioned,

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.920
 which is the books that now everyone carries around.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.840
 Actually now they've been banned.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.160
 Actually.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.120
 Have they been fully banned?

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.360
 Like as in in the last maybe six months.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.080
 I'm sorry.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.120
 What's a yardage book?

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.560
 It's a thing where a book that was sort of invented

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.720
 by a few individual golfers in the 50s or 60s,

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.960
 where they drew up the complete lay of the land,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.360
 very detailed, all the contours, the distances,

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.720
 the angles and everything.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.640
 And then this George Lucas guy was like,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.320
 I'm going to make an official one.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.480
 Spoiler alert, it actually wasn't the same George Lucas.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.040
 I don't think, although I didn't a hundred percent check.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.080
 It is a different George Lucas.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.360
 What an incredibly, incredibly misleading fact.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.560
 Jesus.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.280
 Here we go.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.480
 I'm going to put you back.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.440
 Oh great.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.000
 Okay.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.560
 He's actually more interesting than George Lucas,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.600
 and they could be the same person

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.600
 because the way he measures all the distances

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.920
 is he goes around or he went around golf courses

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.720
 with a laser and he fired lasers

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.800
 at different spots on the golf course.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.320
 And you know, the time they took to bounce back

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.840
 told him the distance it took.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.080
 Which, if that's not a light saber, yeah.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.720
 Yeah.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.360
 Right.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.400
 I don't know what it is.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.640
 Well, he does insist all the golfers he caddies for

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.760
 will go as they're about to hit with the club, doesn't he?

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.320
 Yeah.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:22.560
 Wow.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.040
 Yeah, he's wild.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.120
 He's, what's his nickname?

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.920
 He has a nickname.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.400
 This is George Lucas.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.440
 George, not that one.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.240
 It was something like gorgeous.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:34.560
 Like.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.920
 Oh yeah, gorgeous with a J.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.200
 Wow.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:37.680
 Very nice.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.560
 Okay.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.160
 I don't know how I got onto this,

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.360
 but I was trying to find sports where you can bring a friend.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.920
 Like, like carrying, I suppose.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.320
 Okay.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.520
 So, you know, weightlifting.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.240
 You often have someone to like help you with the weights.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:52.480
 No.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.400
 You would know someone to spot you,

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.160
 you know, when you're lifting a big heavy bar,

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.280
 they might be able to step in

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.560
 if you get into difficulties or whatever.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.920
 In professional stuff, do they?

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.720
 I don't know.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.040
 But they might do.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.680
 They might do.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.360
 Anyway, just the Google, you know,

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.240
 what shows up automatically

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.840
 when you type in sports where you can.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.280
 It's quite interesting.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.960
 You've got sports where you can be short.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.080
 Oh yeah.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.360
 Fair for you.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.960
 I didn't look it up.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.120
 Sports where you can start late.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.160
 And I thought originally,

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.720
 I thought that meant like at noon or whatever.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.280
 Actually, it turns out it's sports where you can start.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.240
 If you want to be the L.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.280
 Frank Baum of.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.000
 Exactly.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.480
 That's it.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.040
 Exactly.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.560
 Exactly, start late.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.200
 And wait a minute.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.680
 If you just, the gun's fired, everyone's gone.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.400
 Are you gone?

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.160
 Just give me a second.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.680
 I'll start on the next lap.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.160
 And most of those articles,

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.040
 I did follow this one.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.520
 It's mostly, look, even if you're 12,

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.120
 it turns out you can start this sport

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.800
 and be fine with it in life.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.680
 But the one exception

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.120
 doesn't seem to be equestrianism.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.000
 Yeah, jockies.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.560
 So old.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.480
 Show jumpers are often in their mid 40s.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.640
 There was another New Zealander

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.440
 called Julie Braum,

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.160
 who debuted at the Rio Olympics age 62.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.840
 And a lot of the horses are old, too.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.560
 Are they?

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.440
 They're teenagers.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.240
 In horses.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:04.800
 In horses.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.760
 They're quite old for a horse.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.280
 We've spoken to a lot of sports people

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.200
 for our other podcasts that we won't go into.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.400
 No, I don't want to mention it here.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:12.960
 It's embarrassing.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.800
 It was last year when we did all that plug-in.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.160
 But occasionally,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.960
 like, I think shooters tended to be a bit late.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.800
 And occasionally, you do come up with someone

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.360
 who started when they're at university and stuff.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.160
 Like, you get rowers who start at university and...

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:26.320
 Yeah.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.560
 So it's time to get into it, isn't it?

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.200
 Yeah.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.200
 Often in the Paralympics, you start later,

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.200
 which is quite hard to decide to do that.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.240
 That's a slightly weird thing

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.400
 that I wasn't expecting to learn about caddying,

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.840
 which is, I assumed that maybe it was an alternative career

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.520
 once you tried to be a golfer,

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.400
 and then you pivoted into that as a secondary job.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.720
 But Steve Williams started doing it at six.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:50.960
 And a lot of caddies started when they were very, very young,

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.640
 and that was the primary job.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.120
 Is it?

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:53.920
 Like, it's a job.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.480
 That is interesting.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.360
 It's a skill.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:55.680
 It's a...

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.120
 It's got this whole...

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.240
 The money is so variable,

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.480
 depending on whether you're Tiger Woods' caddy or not,

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.120
 basically.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:01.440
 Yeah.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.720
 And there have been some controversies.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.080
 Like, there was a golfer some years ago

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.400
 who he won $1.3 million on an event,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.000
 and he paid his caddy $5,000.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.960
 And that was a real controversy.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.520
 What is it? How'd you do this?

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.960
 That was that Jim Furrick, was it?

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.640
 It was Matt Kucha.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.840
 Oh, Matt Kucha, that's right.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.400
 Matt Kucha.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.440
 And there was a little bit of backlash to that at the time.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.800
 But he said, "Look, we had an arrangement.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.440
 He's very happy with it.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.400
 He's earned five grand a week.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:22.960
 Well done, him."

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.240
 He's really happy with that.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.880
 Honestly, still people bring that up to Kucha.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.280
 Really?

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.320
 In interviews and stuff, yeah.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.000
 So, is it that discreet?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.840
 Because Dan was saying you have to pay some of the prize money

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.600
 to them, but it doesn't matter.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.040
 I think his normal caddy wasn't there,

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.640
 so he brought in a new person and said,

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.160
 "I'll pay you this flat sum."

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.280
 Right, so there's not a rule

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.480
 which is like you have to pay them 10%.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.560
 Just on rich sports people and jockeys,

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.720
 you can be super rich and old as a jockey.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.160
 And do you know the--

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:52.720
 Keep talking.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.080
 So, I happened to come across a list

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.560
 of the 50 most well-paid jockeys in the world.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.680
 Okay, current.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.800
 And current.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.080
 And 29 of them are Japanese,

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.720
 with 29 out of the top 50 are Japanese.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.560
 It's huge in Japan because it's one of the only

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.880
 four sports you can gamble on legally.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.040
 So, they get loads of money.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.320
 And the top guy, Yutaka Takei, is 56,

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.280
 and he's earned a billion dollars.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.160
 But what?

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.800
 I think a lot of that money was when he was a sumo wrestler

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.000
 before he got the azempic.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.600
 You're absolutely correct.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.480
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.080
 and that is Anna.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.120
 My fact this week is that if 88 elephants

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.960
 balanced on a 50p piece on a parrotfish's beak,

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.880
 the beak would not break.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.880
 What part is the 50p piece playing in this?

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.960
 It feels like an unnecessary intermediary layer, does it?

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.280
 I'll tell you, I'll tell you what part it's playing.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.520
 Pressure, it depends on area.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.640
 And I think I have to say,

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.400
 and I have to come out and say it at the top,

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.920
 because otherwise, someone's going to mention it.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.520
 I was clicking through some stuff,

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.840
 and I ended up weeding an article in Scientific American

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.360
 called Fun Facts About Teeth.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.200
 And yes, I'm a senior QI researcher,

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.800
 and it's a long time since I read an article

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.480
 called Fun Facts About X.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.960
 But it was a good article, and it was in this article,

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.800
 and it said it's about an inch.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.840
 So, if you have them balancing on it, it's where inch.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.400
 So, I thought 50p is about an inch, probably.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.440
 One of the old ones.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.200
 I had the 50p on its side.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.920
 Did you hit it on its edge, but it's not.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.960
 No, sorry.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.160
 No, I think that would break it.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.040
 Sorry.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.720
 No, it's 50p laid down flat.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.200
 Then I've got a big apology to make to my parrot fish.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.040
 And this is just the power.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.520
 We're going to cut to live to see the experiment in action.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.960
 Abort!

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.080
 Abort!

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.520
 Have you factored in the weight of the 50p?

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.680
 Because it's exactly 88 elephants.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.320
 I haven't.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.360
 Okay, it's 87.9999 elephants, and the 50p piece.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.120
 Asian or African elephants?

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.040
 Bullocks.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.680
 Are we talking full grown males, or are we talking newly hatched?

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.200
 All right, I'm just going to give you the amounts.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.600
 Okay, let's just take away the stupid metaphor,

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.120
 and I'll tell you that one square inch can take 530 tons of pressure.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:11.680
 You happy?

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.640
 Okay, what's a parrot fish?

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.960
 So, it's a fish, and they have these beaks,

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.400
 so they're the fish you often see on coral reefs gnawing away,

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.320
 and they're quite beautiful.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.960
 What should move the elephants out of the way?

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.800
 [Laughter]

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.160
 Yeah, it wasn't a great dive.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.800
 The reef was covered in elephant dung.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.520
 It was horrible.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.400
 That's why they're dying out.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:38.560
 Yeah.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.280
 They have, they're very beautiful, except for their faces, I would say,

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.960
 and maybe it's just a personal thing.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.160
 I get that a lot as well.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.920
 [Laughter]

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.520
 Because they've got these weird beaks,

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.640
 and it looks a little bit like, if you've ever seen,

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.840
 what's it called, the sheet-ped fish, which has almost human, giant human teeth.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.560
 Yeah.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.920
 But their beaks are made from about a thousand teeth,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.360
 arranged in 15 rows, but they've been compressed and compressed and compressed,

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.840
 and sort of a molecular level of woven to make them incredibly hard.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.480
 It's the stiffest biomineral ever found,

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.320
 which, of course, is not the same as the hardest.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.600
 It's only the second hardest.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.160
 What's the difference between stiff and hard?

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.640
 The questioner took me a sitting long time to work that out.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.520
 Did you have something you did?

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.480
 Harder means if you, like, get a diamond on it.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.080
 One of them will scratch the other.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:26.480
 Yes.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.120
 Basically, yeah.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.440
 Okay.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.240
 That's oddness.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.800
 Diffness, I think, is more about how bendable it is.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.680
 So if you try and dent it with your fingernail,

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.360
 it will dent the least out of any, what did you call it, biomineral?

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.760
 Biomineral, yeah, basically just a thing that's made by nature.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.600
 It's fluorapatite, right?

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.280
 Yes, fluorapatite.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.240
 And fluorapatite is the same stuff as you get on your teeth

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.320
 if you use fluoride toothpaste.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.680
 Really?

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.400
 Your teeth create fluorapatite, which makes them so strong.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.240
 I did not know that.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.920
 But I would not be able to, for example, as these fish do, chew coral.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.280
 No, because most of your teeth are made of dentine and other stuff,

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.040
 but you do get small amounts of fluorapatite in your teeth if you use fluorine.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.000
 That is very cool.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.280
 But don't try the elephant trick.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.000
 Okay, so these parrotfish, they're very good in a way for coral reefs,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.480
 despite the fact they eat large chunks of coral reef,

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.560
 because the reef gets algae growing all over it, doesn't it?

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.560
 And that slightly inhibits the growth and the natural functioning of it.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.920
 So along comes Mr. Parrotfish and just crunch, crunch, crunch.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.400
 Because it wants to eat the algae.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.160
 Weird thing is the parrotfish don't want to eat the coral,

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.640
 they just want to eat the algae on it, but it's bloody hard to scrape off, isn't it?

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.160
 Yeah, there are loads of species.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.240
 Some of them just scrape off and some of them do more gouging.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.840
 And they do all kinds of varieties, but they're massive.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.320
 So each adult green humphead parrotfish,

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.560
 which is a particular species of parrotfish, they're the biggies.

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.960
 They can get about a metre and a half long.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.440
 They can eat five tonnes of reef per year.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.720
 It's a lot.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.760
 It's so much.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.320
 Yeah.

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.600
 And then they poo it out, we've mentioned before, as sand basically.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.320
 Beautiful white sand.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.240
 Beautiful white sand, they're responsible for so much.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.800
 They poo out hundreds of pounds per year.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.720
 A single parrotfish can produce up to 90 kilograms of sand each year,

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.240
 which is enough to fill the most popular parasol holder on Amazon.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.400
 At the bottom of a parasol, you have a really heavy sort of thing.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.360
 But it's not always heavy because otherwise, how do you get it to the beach?

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.680
 What you do is you bring it to the beach and you fill it with sand

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.160
 and that makes it heavy and stops your parasol from blowing away.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:26.720
 Sorry.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.200
 Anyway.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.640
 Well, you're the only producer of that.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.320
 That actually is quite disappointing to me.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.480
 One parrotfish would fill that in a year.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.800
 Well, that's less than I thought.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.520
 At first I thought you were talking about one of those parasols

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.520
 that ladies had in lack of my fair lady.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.320
 Exactly.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.920
 Yeah, but you mean a big one?

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.200
 Yeah, I don't think we've said before about parrotfish.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.200
 One of the other brilliant things about them

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.840
 is that they have two sets of jaws, like the alien in alien.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.920
 They open the mouth, then uh-oh, there's a little mouth inside.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:56.400
 Second one.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:56.800
 Okay.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.120
 Yeah.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:57.760
 What are they using it for?

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.640
 What's a word for that?

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.680
 There is a word for that, isn't there?

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.480
 It's pharyngeal teeth.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.680
 Pharyngeal.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.320
 Pharyngeal.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.440
 So I think moray eels have them and a few other things,

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.400
 but they're really rare.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.760
 If you're diving a wreath with pharyngeal teeth, that's a moray.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.280
 Look at that.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.720
 James, that's beautiful.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.200
 Brilliant.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.960
 And those are the teeth which grind up the coral

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.400
 and turn it into sand, basically.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.040
 Yeah, okay, right.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.560
 So the main teeth just bite off chunks

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.920
 and the pharyngeal teeth are the ones that do the fine milling of the coral.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.560
 Yeah.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.880
 You mentioned the giant bump-head parrotfish, the big ones.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.520
 Yeah.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.480
 And they, so they fight each other by headbutting,

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.520
 which I think was only filmed recently for the first time.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.040
 And it's just, it's quite funny to watch because they've,

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.240
 they've got quite thin heads.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.800
 Like if you look at them face on, they're almost two-dimensional.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.680
 So you watch them going after each other and they miss each other.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.600
 Three-quarters of the time.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.320
 They just whizz past each other and spiral back around

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.000
 and then eventually bump into each other.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.200
 It's like jousting.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:53.840
 Yes.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:54.080
 Yeah.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.440
 Did that happen a lot in jousting?

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.960
 You just whizz straight past.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.360
 I saw some jousting last summer at a castle.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:49:59.600
 Of course.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.000
 Oh yeah.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.840
 I was like, what do you mean, of course you did?

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.800
 You're a renaissance man.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.560
 Oh, you really flipped that into a coffin.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.360
 That was amazing.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.720
 Yeah, no, it was great.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.600
 But they, they didn't, they didn't.

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.720
 Was it not violent?

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.520
 Oh, it was.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.640
 Oh, that's why you liked it.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.160
 Well, I blindfolded myself for the violent bit.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.240
 But I, no, it was, it wasn't too violent.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.920
 There wasn't, that wasn't enough gore.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.160
 It was, you know, everyone, everyone walked away.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:20.720
 Okay.

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.280
 What was it?

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.320
 Like, it was a.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.600
 It was, it was just a, I think it was Hever Castle in Kent.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.160
 Oh yeah.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:26.480
 Beautiful.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.600
 Ambulance Old House.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.520
 And they were just having a sort of medieval fairy.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.440
 And there was jousting.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.040
 And we all, there was a great hype man,

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.440
 dressed as Henry VIII, who was doing a lot of crowd work.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.760
 And then they did a good, good bash at each other.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.560
 It was really fun.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:40.880
 Yes.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.200
 And was it, as with the giant bumper parrot fish,

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.200
 that the winner got to shag the woman at the end?

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.240
 That does explain why they sent us all home.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.440
 Wow.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.320
 So that's how that ends.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.120
 That's how that ends.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:53.680
 Yes, yes.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.640
 It is.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.520
 Although they all start out, or almost all parrot fish,

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.200
 start out as women, don't they?

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.160
 As females.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.320
 There are a few that are born male,

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.640
 known as primary males, but quite rare.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.960
 And then as they get older, they get sexually mature.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.080
 And the biggest female in the group has a sex change, I think.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.160
 Well, it's one male and then a load of females.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.840
 So it's a harem situation.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.400
 And then one day the male wakes up and finds out,

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.240
 oh, hello, my biggest girlfriend has turned into another bloke

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.120
 who's now challenging me.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.640
 This is a nightmare scenario.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.720
 And the thing I find amazing about it

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.800
 is that if you've got the harem,

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.640
 which they do seem to be referred to as,

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.040
 a female and a male, but then the male dies,

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.760
 another female will know to change sex.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.120
 And how does that happen?

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.760
 Is that unbelievable?

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.920
 Does she think about it or does she kind of go inside?

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.160
 Do some molding.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.040
 There is a different kind of parrotfish.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.480
 Just so these are not the only fish

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.360
 that get called parrotfish.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.600
 This is a, I never know how to say it, Cichlid.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.000
 I always call them chicklid,

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.760
 but I don't think they are chicklids.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.840
 That's a word that I always mispronounce.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.040
 Cichlid is what I...

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.000
 There's land on that.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.280
 C-I-C-H-L-I-D.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.800
 But they are called the parrotfish.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.960
 These were invented in the 80s.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.520
 What?

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.640
 I just find that so weird.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.760
 Like sea monkeys.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.960
 They were a hybrid of two different Cichlids.

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.520
 Cichlids.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.840
 And I was on Tropical Fish Magazine website,

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:19.360
 which said it was as improbable as Steve Urkel

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.880
 and Madonna getting together.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.400
 That's one for the oldies, isn't it?

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.280
 Who's Steve Urkel?

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:25.920
 Steve...

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.520
 Well, Dan knows who Steve Urkel is.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.200
 No, I don't actually know what show he was from.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:29.760
 I can't remember.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.080
 Oh, God.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.520
 But he was like a very annoying, sort of nerdy American...

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.960
 Point Dexter sort of.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:35.840
 Oh, right.

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.640
 And who's Madonna?

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:40.320
 Which is the Virgin Mary,

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.840
 which is why it would be so surprising for her

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.440
 to cop off with Steve Urkel.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.240
 But they get bred because they're breedable ones.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.400
 These are for aquarium nuts because

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.680
 they're on Tropical Fish Magazine.

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.600
 They get bred jelly bean parrotfish,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.800
 which have been soaked in a dye and artificially coloured.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.560
 Some of them have tattoos.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.320
 So they're soaked in a dye and then permanently

00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.040
 they say that colour?

00:52:59.040 --> 00:52:59.520
 Yeah.

00:52:59.520 --> 00:52:59.920
 Wow.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.280
 Some of them have tattoos on.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.200
 Like you get people who tattoo their fish.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.040
 It feels bizarrely unnecessary because of all the fish.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.080
 Parrotfish are famously beautiful patterns and colours.

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.360
 But everyone is different.

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.800
 And those are proper parrotfish, not these.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.920
 These are the proper parrotfish.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.640
 Okay, sorry.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.080
 Oh, so maybe these ones are a bit more dull

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.680
 and they wanted to be more like the proper ones.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.800
 So they tattooed them.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.440
 Very weird.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:17.760
 But yeah.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.400
 That is amazing.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.640
 And they get even more colourful when they're pissed off.

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.720
 So depending on territory,

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.160
 they'll get even more attractive.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.440
 Yeah, vibrant.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.040
 There's quite a few species of them as well, right?

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.640
 There's between 60 and 90 subspecies of a parrotfish.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.000
 So when we're talking about one,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.840
 it might, a thing we're saying might not occur

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.440
 in another subspecies.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.880
 But they do do that thing that we've mentioned

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.760
 on the show before as well,

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.560
 where they create a mucus bag when they go to sleep.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.600
 So it's a sack that they just sleep in overnight.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.720
 It just looks amazing, doesn't it?

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.000
 It looks incredible.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.840
 And that means that they sleep so long.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.560
 They're so lazy.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.160
 They sleep 10 hours a night.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.120
 Oh, I imagine.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.160
 I know.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.480
 You just need to learn to build your own mucus bubble.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.600
 And you try that.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.800
 I have been trying, Anna.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.080
 It's pretty disgusting.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.840
 We need to clean this room every time you're in it.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.880
 Every night.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.120
 It takes an hour, I think.

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.880
 The idea is that they do it to stop parasites, right?

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.840
 And the way that they work that out is scientists

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.560
 got a load of them in a pool or something.

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.720
 And when they made their sleeping bags,

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.400
 once they'd fallen asleep,

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.240
 the scientists sort of very slowly pulled the blankets off them

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.920
 so they didn't have them anymore.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.360
 And then they put parasites in

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.960
 and found who got better than the most,

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.480
 and they got way, way more.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.280
 That's interesting.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.080
 Because there's also a theory that they are using it

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.320
 so that if anyone is trying to pull the blankets off,

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.440
 they've got time to escape

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.240
 rather than just being outright sitting there to be eaten.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.240
 I'm sure there's multiple reasons behind it.

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:40.800
 Yeah.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.360
 So it's for big predators and small ones, in effect.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.480
 In a way, yeah.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.760
 That's what pajamas are for.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.240
 That's great.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:50.400
 Your pajamas are covered in metal spikes, aren't they?

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.840
 But no parasites on Andy's.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.480
 No, exactly.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.840
 There was a test on the moray eels, actually,

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:56.400
 an experiment.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.400
 Just while we're on the experiments done on these things.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.640
 So on the pharyngeal jaws,

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:03.920
 the cool thing about them for the moray eels

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.400
 is that it means they don't need to feed in water.

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.960
 Oh, well, they can grab something like a mosquito or something.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.040
 Kind of, or a little bit of prey outside.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.320
 But I find this so weird.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.000
 Basically, it's to do with the mechanics of how you eat.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.240
 Like, all other fish need to be in water,

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.160
 to have the mechanics of water so that they can feed.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.000
 We would find it difficult to eat if we were submerged in water.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:24.560
 Do you know what I mean?

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.160
 Like, the mechanics of physics doesn't work as well.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.040
 So the scientists who did this on the eels,

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.120
 they trained the eels.

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.480
 They took five years training seven eels

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.080
 to slither up a ramp, grab a mouthful of fish

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.200
 from outside the water, and then go back into the water.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.360
 I don't think there was evidence that they were doing this before,

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.400
 that they were eating outside water,

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.480
 but I think they were trying to show how these jaws worked.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.960
 What if that knowledge spreads among the eel community?

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.600
 And now...

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.880
 They all leave the ocean.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.480
 Yeah, I mean, again, that's the start of a horror movie, isn't it?

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.760
 Like beachgoers...

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:56.960
 Oh, you mean disasters for us?

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.360
 I was thinking disasters for the eels, but you're afraid of the...

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.800
 I just think we shouldn't be teaching animals

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.840
 to come out of the water and bite live prey

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.120
 and go back in.

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:05.440
 Yeah?

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.880
 Sorry if that makes me old-fashioned.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:12.000
 Guy who's seen a jousting match at a castle.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:20.880
 Okay, that's it.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.360
