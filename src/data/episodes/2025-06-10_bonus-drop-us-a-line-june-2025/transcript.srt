00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,280
 Howdy club fish members. How you doing?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,800
 Dan here. We have a compilation episode for you today

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,720
 This is the best bits of the stuff that didn't make it into the main episodes little outtakes

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,520
 Little extra bits of info that didn't quite fit the narrative of the show all bunged together here for you

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,880
 Starring the four fishers plus John Lloyd the QI Supremo

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,140
 So hope you enjoy that this should be hitting the club fish page on Tuesday

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,280
 Which means we are just under two weeks away from doing our next live show

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,720
 Which is happening in Sheffield at the crossed wires festival just gonna say that if you are thinking of coming

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,480
 We are on the edge of selling out and so don't leave it till last minute cuz there might not be any tickets left

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,080
 You can find them by going to know such thing as a fish calm. It'll be a really fun night

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,600
 I think the show is about 85 minutes. We're gonna be doing really fun things like we're gonna enter

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,180
 Someone into the fish Hall of Fame a local from Sheffield who has been mentioned previously on the episode

13
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,680
 So they'll be up on stage with us or at least that's the plan. We might try out something new all together

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,640
 It's always fun doing these live shows and we'd love to see you there. So come along

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,600
 But for now enjoy the compilation episode. Here we go

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
 I

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:31,540
 Had a quick hunt by the way cuz Murray's plums

18
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,600
 Nice to have something named after you. Yeah, Andy

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,000
 I wanted to see if we had any other fruits that were relevant to us

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,600
 The other three of us. So I found harken peaches

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,520
 Yeah, it says harken peaches now. It's Ian as opposed to iron for yeah, so harken peaches like listen peaches

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,480
 Yeah, as I tell the harken the tail and I so I was just reading up to see if there were any similarities

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
 So I found someone who actually

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,440
 Farms them and they say that normally harken trees are pretty finicky producers

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,120
 Okay, I'm a finicky producer when it comes to TV production. Yeah, you're covered in a lovely soft fuzz

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
 I

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:19,160
 Know you you don't have a toshinsky, but you have an Anna which is an Anna's apple, which is Anna Bolin's

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:31,380
 Let's not make assumptions. That's a leap. That's a leap. I'm not really maybe named after her head

29
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,600
 Well in some of the photos it is quite a flat apple. They didn't take photos at the time

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,540
 What oh right of the apple?

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,920
 In some photos there's different shapes to it. So yeah, I got excited

32
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,780
 Two of ambulance homes in the last month ambulance following me around at the moment. No, you're following her around

33
00:02:50,780 --> 00:03:00,320
 These other detectors, okay like the weird ways people have tried to detect neutrinos because lots of countries have got their own ones around the place

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,360
 So there's one in Japan, which is a tank of 50,000 tons of ultra pure water under a mountain

35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,240
 That's called the super cameo candy and scientists have to get rafts around the surface of this

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,800
 What on the ultra pure water? They were around on it. I shot that clean the rafts before they go in

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,280
 They probably have one of those little, you know a little puddle of clean water that you walk through so that you don't get verucous

38
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,360
 Yeah, definitely, and they'll have a pool robot on the inside just getting anything else

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,240
 A guy with his top off in a long net

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,920
 Then there was the first detector built in the 60s by Raymond Davis Jr. And John Buckle was a tank with half a million litres of dry cleaning fluid in it

41
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,160
 Oh, yeah, what yeah, it has more uses I guess

42
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know if I know what dry you mean like washing fluid

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,280
 It's a it's a chemical you use isn't it? I can't remember what it's called now

44
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,000
 Never been to dry cleaners wouldn't know but cool glad it's got another even better application. Absolutely. Yeah

45
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,440
 That's really cool. And there's one called dune in America

46
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:13,080
 It's underground it is underground like the worms, but there are two detectors 800 miles apart one is pointing at the other one

47
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,080
 You know plums have stones in them. Yeah, they're unique to the species that stone

48
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,040
 You know all the like the little bumps and stuff that you get in them like a fingerprint like a fingerprint

49
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
 So, you know, which plum has burgled you

50
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,560
 What do you mean unique to the species sorry so if you get a little plum stone, yeah, it's got loads of wrinkles on it

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,640
 Yeah, and you have a book which has all the different patterns

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,480
 You'll be able to tell which species of plum it comes from or which variety why we matches the same dense in the stone

53
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,040
 Yeah, exactly. And so in the Marie Rose ship

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,080
 We sank when 16th century and then they raised it in when up 20th century

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,600
 They found all these stones all these plum stones and they could tell exactly what species they were and they went

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,840
 Or what variety they were and they went back to the national fruit

57
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,360
 Center which I think we might have mentioned before

58
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,480
 Yes, I checked it against modern fruits and they could see exactly what they were. Oh my goodness

59
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,040
 That's insane. That is why they share fingerprints

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,760
 So if you're one species of plum then you can blame the burglary on your mate

61
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,320
 Who's the same species because you've left the same pretty. It's almost like every family would have the same or something like that

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,440
 Professor plum

63
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,040
 Yeah, so

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,560
 Plums blue gold they're called in Serbia. Yeah

65
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,340
 They have 40 million plum trees and at least three plum festivals every year in Serbia

66
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,120
 And if you have

67
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,440
 Serbian drink the national drink and that's plum flavored usually

68
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,480
 Oh, God, is that is that the thing they give you at the free at the end of every meal whenever you go to one of those countries?

69
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,080
 Yeah, if you're in like Serbia Montenegro some parts of Bosnia and

70
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,740
 They give you that have it because if you don't you're insulting them, but you're gonna regret it the next like all of those things

71
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,680
 Where it claims to be favored with X but it tastes like petrol like yeah, it tastes really strong quite chemical

72
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,480
 Yeah, there's often a thing where I don't know if this is your experience

73
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,200
 But where if you're there with someone of the opposite sex in my experience

74
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,440
 My wife would be given a reasonably nice spirit and I would be given something. It was absolute lighter

75
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:38,400
 Slightly bloke a thing to get and she's got a little bit of plum brandy or something and I'm just drinking pure diesel

76
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,480
 I must admit whenever I've been with Serbians and the slivovics has come out

77
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,400
 Usually everyone's getting involved. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,760
 They must think of you as particularly manly

79
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,040
 What they've seen my plans

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,960
 The Venice in general is a I didn't I had no idea how it's built

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,360
 So I knew it was Laguni. I knew it's in the middle of a lagoon

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,620
 I knew that sort of you know, and there wasn't a road or rail link until the middle of the 19th century

83
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,320
 Yeah, but it was built what I didn't know is that it is how it's on stills

84
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,640
 So every building is built on these wooden poles

85
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:25,240
 Which have been driven down into the sediment and if you drive down enough poles, it's like nine or ten per square meter

86
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,840
 You can just put stone on top of that and it all

87
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:37,000
 Here's the church of San Marco required 10,000 oak trees to be put into converted into poles for one church

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,560
 It's a big church the whole of Venice must be way even more than that

89
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,400
 It's millions. Yeah, millions and millions of these poles. It's like they say it's an inverted forest

90
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,760
 It's so cool. And this was literally 1500 years ago, wasn't it? I mean, this is in the fifth century or whatever

91
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,240
 Which is extraordinary that they were able to do that

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,200
 I think and the good thing is because they're underwater and they're all underwater, right?

93
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,520
 So you've got the the rocks on top, but the poles themselves never go above the water

94
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,880
 And that means they don't rot because there's no oxygen to make them rock

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,320
 So they stay on the water and they're still now the ones from 1500 years ago is still good

96
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,940
 They're not they're not kind of falling apart. It's amazing

97
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:21,320
 And there was a job the batty Pali the pile hitters that was their job was to pound pound the piles into the ground

98
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,320
 You need a big hammer for that. Don't you? How are you doing that?

99
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,120
 What you do I didn't often work experience on a farm once and I had to

100
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,740
 When you're building a fence you have this big metal drum which is open at one end and it's got two handles

101
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,200
 It's like a milk churn, basically, but you put it upside down

102
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,140
 You put it over the steak you're banging into the ground a steak banging and you just lift it up and bang down

103
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,660
 It goes it's such hard work and water that must be really difficult with a whole sort of tree

104
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,260
 You basically you've got to be so strong. You've got to be so strong

105
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,700
 Yeah, yeah, and they had their traditional song which was all about venison its glory and death to the Turks like good traditional stuff

106
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,620
 And even now in Venice, there's a phrase nattista. They're about the pie

107
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,020
 Which means a head that is good to pound down the piles. Are you a bit thick?

108
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,020
 You know, nice

109
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,940
 And now we're gonna talk about why you only lasted an afternoon of work experience on that farm

110
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,020
 Yeah, I was slated for a seven-year contract of steak banging, but I got tired. It's really hard work

111
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:23,900
 Um, you know George Foreman's grill. Yeah most famous grill of all time. It's shifted like over a hundred million units

112
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,580
 Is it a barbecue? No, no, it's like it's a grill you sort of you a toasty maker

113
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,840
 It's like it's like it is like what it's like it looks exactly like one

114
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,000
 But it's for meats and it's and it's positioned on an angle so that all of the juices sort of run down and away

115
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,080
 So it's yeah, I miss and he's made more he made because he's passed away now more money off the back of that than his entire

116
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,340
 Boxing career by substantial amount. He's made like between 200 and 500 million off of it because he was getting 40% of the deal

117
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,060
 But most people mistook him as the creator of it

118
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,500
 But in fact, it was this brilliant innovator who was called Michael Bohm who was the person who started it

119
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,920
 He went to George Foreman and Hulk Hogan to say which one of you could do it

120
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,880
 Oh, he went to the same agent who had both of them. Yeah, Foreman got it in the end

121
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,800
 And but this guy no one believed him that he invented it

122
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,320
 So he used to walk around with the patent on to him any time that someone said you're not the inventor

123
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,760
 He was a am I not have a look at my patients talking to him at a party

124
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,740
 T-shirt saying I invented the George Foreman grill is making is deterring me

125
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 He's not talking to you at a party

126
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:35,760
 Yeah, meet her on Francois meet her on recent one. Yeah, very recent. He had a wife

127
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,540
 But he also had a mistress in the dark

128
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,860
 He basically lived a double life and it was his wife Danielle who insisted that it was kept secret from the press and

129
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,860
 basically the press all knew about it, but they

130
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,580
 Like decided they wouldn't print anything that ultra the ultra conservative about exposing their leaders

131
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,880
 They really are they're very very cautious about it

132
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,880
 They are I suppose that it's weird because they're conservative about that

133
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,940
 But they are much more liberal as we famously know about relationships

134
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,380
 So meter on situation was so interesting before he became president

135
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,620
 He lived in a house with his wife and his wife's lover who has like just had a separate room in their house

136
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,980
 And when he became president

137
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,480
 But he when he did become president they like his staff moved to the woman and who he was having this affair with into a house

138
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,560
 It was nice and near him

139
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,400
 So he could go and sit there all the time and they employed a guy to make sure that no one printed anything about them

140
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,000
 So there was this guy called Francois de Grosse of

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 And whenever any journalists sort of sniffed around said we're gonna do an article about this separate life

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,400
 You have at one stage they got a journalist and kidnapped him and locked him in the cellar for a week saying

143
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
 And then it's like it's a bigger story

144
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,740
 Yeah, and then in 2021 it turned out that he wasn't living a double life after all he was living a triple life

145
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,300
 And there was another woman called Claire who was 50 years his junior

146
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,460
 Who that he was having an affair with the whole time as well

147
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,860
 I actually think he was having lots of shags along the way

148
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,340
 But yeah, Claire again, it was it's so interesting. It's just like very different

149
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,860
 Standards that I can't judge

150
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,460
 So she Claire had followed him for four years from when she was 18 to when she was 22

151
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:25,640
 Yeah, and then eventually invited him around her house and they had basically what seems like quite a nice relationship for the last 10 years of his life

152
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,400
 Alongside his marriage, right? It's one interpretation and then other people could say that it wasn't appropriate

153
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,800
 Yeah, you could say that there's a massive massive power imbalance. You could say that yes

154
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,240
 Although she's definitely more physically able and the staff all said it was great because she could go on official visits with him

155
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,120
 And because she was so young even in France no one suspected that they were together

156
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,700
 So she used to accompany him brilliant in many ways the perfect crime

157
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,300
 I want to stress the word Christ

158
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:03,520
 But all of this stuff about method acting and the method I love it all goes back to Stanislavski

159
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,300
 Yes, the Russian guy Russian acting coach

160
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
 Yeah

161
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,340
 Constant in Stanislavski and he founded this realistic acting stuff and the problem all acting was very unrealistic on film

162
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,920
 Because it was silent film so you have to have big theatrical gestures and movements and and theater as well

163
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,040
 You would exactly yeah, and you can't and then it all changes when the close-up is invented

164
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,720
 Suddenly you zoom right in on someone's face and they're going

165
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,400
 They look like they're overacting

166
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,500
 Crazily and so you have to then you could do the less is more school

167
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:39,940
 But and Stanislavski founded this sort of realistic acting. Yeah, and you would go in and you'd be an actor in Stanislavski's

168
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,720
 Moscow theater and

169
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,740
 You would do your lines, and he would just go I don't believe you and you do them again

170
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,780
 He go I don't believe you I don't believe you I don't believe you

171
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,280
 And you just say that again and again and again until it was right

172
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,720
 That's genuinely flashback to my clown school days

173
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,960
 What you're doing and they won't let you go but Stanislavski in fairness he walked the walk

174
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,620
 So he did that method himself and whenever he was acting a part

175
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,480
 He would go for a walk in the altar like he had a big sort of theater in Crimea

176
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,500
 And he would go for a walk in his character every single morning

177
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,080
 Everyone would laugh at him and point at him

178
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,020
 But he didn't really mind because he was just trying to get into character. I really respect the lack of

179
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,460
 Social fear yeah, you have to have to do that like Daniel A. Lewis just having the guts to do it

180
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,540
 And I really liked the fact I thought he was a bit of a dick for doing it

181
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,520
 But then you read interviews and he said he does it for fun

182
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,400
 Which I can really empathize with is like he says I do it to play also if the director saying yeah

183
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,980
 We'll pay for you to like live in Prague and learn check

184
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,940
 But you know the fate the famous story and the great story about method acting I found something out about that

185
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,520
 You know the Dustin Hoffman Laurence Olivier tale

186
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,360
 Which is that when they were filming Marathon Man with Dustin Hoffman in the 80s was it and

187
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,120
 Dustin Hoffman staggers in one day and there's one bit of Marathon Man where the lead character the Dustin Hoffman is playing

188
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,360
 It has to have been a wake for three days straight and he staggers in and says to Laurence Olivier

189
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,600
 I've stayed awake for three days preparing for this character

190
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,900
 I feel like absolute shit and he's haggling his hairs all over the place and Laurence Olivier just turned him

191
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,980
 Put his hand on his shoulder and said my dear, why don't you try acting?

192
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,500
 Anyway famous story famous Dustin Hoffman has said he wasn't actually doing it to prepare

193
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,740
 He'd just been out on the booze for three nights straight

194
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,180
 Okay, and I think they maybe he's trying to sound cool now because he said he comes across as the loser in that story

195
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,140
 Whereas Laurence Olivier is the aloof. It was also dead. So there's no you can't come back and say he's lying

196
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,360
 Exactly, I love there's a story which is sort of method acting

197
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,180
 Steve Martin when he did Roxanne the movie. He has a giant nose, right Pinocchio long

198
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,560
 They were in a small town and they were filming and he finished a day really needed a drink

199
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,260
 So it takes a long time to take the prosthetic off. So he's like I'm just going for a drink

200
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,440
 But then he sort of got cold feet while he was out kind of got this giant nose

201
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,620
 I'm gonna walk into a bar. No one knows really who I am out here and

202
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,820
 He gets into a bar and it does the classic piano stops playing

203
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,360
 Everyone turns around and he's freaking out thinking. Oh girl. What am I doing?

204
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,160
 I'm gonna get my ass kicked walks up to the bar and a gruesome looking dude

205
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,720
 According to him walks up to him and says hey

206
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,320
 Why the long face?

207
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,600
 Come on great a story

208
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,280
 It's better on paper

209
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:32,160
 Avant de Gaulle, she's an interesting character. Charles de Gaulle's wife exactly. Yeah, so she was the first lady of France and

210
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,820
 She there was a story that while sort of his retirement was imminent

211
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,780
 She was at Buckingham Palace and I guess asked her what are you most looking forward to in your retirement?

212
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,260
 She said a penis

213
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,620
 I mean, it's almost the origin of that joke

214
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,320
 She was saying happiness, but it was oh god, and then Steve Martin walked in

215
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,880
 History's jokes, but but um, yeah, she's a very interesting character

216
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,920
 She while we're talking about censorship as the top bit of this fact

217
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,480
 She was very much against things like displays of nudity and sex and tried to have things past so that they wouldn't be shown in public

218
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,600
 Mini skirts were a problem for her as well. She wanted the lengthening of a skirt to have to actually be legally a certain length

219
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,720
 And then there's this amazing thing, you know, there was an assassination attempt on

220
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,780
 On shot. Oh, well, there was one of both of them. I mean he was one of the most almost

221
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,900
 So 1962 they get ambushed while they're in their car and it's machine gun fire

222
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,180
 They both survive her first words after she got out of the car were a penis

223
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:43,540
 Please cut out the earlier reference

224
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:56,620
 The first question was how are my chickens and it's because she just bought some chickens in jelly at some fare at some

225
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:04,340
 That still was more concerned to her machine gun bullets might have absolutely

226
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,180
 They're in the boot of the car. Yeah

227
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,400
 What could have happened like even if your chicken gets shot by a bullet?

228
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,240
 Maybe the rare chickens that you only get out at one fair once a year, you know, I get it

229
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,100
 Fair enough. I'll be your question to the cockle van

230
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,780
 more like cockle boot

231
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:27,060
 Driving in a van with an A. There you go. Yes. There's a joke in that somewhere. Absolutely

232
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,940
 Mongolia barbecue is quite cool. It's called boo dog

233
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,580
 What you do is you take your right in the dog and leaps into the fire

234
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,400
 Bobs your uncle. I think if you told the dog about this, they get frightened. So you get your animal

235
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,180
 Let's say it's a marmot and you cut it open from its head to its groin slice it right down

236
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,100
 You take out all the insides you season them and then you stuff them back in again

237
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,940
 Oh with stones and veggies and you put it over a fire

238
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,320
 And you just leave it over the fire for ages and ages and then you cut bring it out and you eat all the insides and

239
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:07,060
 The stones are now really really hot and you pass them around the group everyone gets to hold the stones in their hand

240
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,660
 Well, I was gonna ask you that

241
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,460
 Oh

242
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
 Why would you want to do that?

243
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,460
 That's quite cold in Mongolia. It does at times. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, this is more put on your hand

244
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,300
 It's like a hot plate just keeps it. Oh, yeah, good call. Apparently it's supposed to help against stress

245
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,940
 Okay, very hot stones. I feel stressed

246
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,900
 How fast is the fastest submarine

247
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,220
 Give it an MPH if you want this is the underwater sea record also, and I'll say 50. Oh

248
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:49,100
 Yeah, that's some 50 miles an hour. It's gonna say 200. I'm so less. There's a lot of water resistance, isn't there?

249
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,100
 And they're so big and fat. I'm gonna say 30. Okay. No, that's mad 40

250
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,240
 Andy is the closest but he's absolutely miles away. It's 51.4

251
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,740
 I

252
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,140
 Think Glenkeen the little mermaid illustrator. There's something interesting about him. He is similar to one of us. Oh

253
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,740
 He has something that one of us have really loves his wife. No, it's not them

254
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:27,940
 No, you two have James and Anna. Oh, okay, a Bolton accent. It's not Anna

255
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,540
 A superiority complex

256
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:39,660
 Um, it's that he can't picture things in his mind's eye

257
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,860
 He has a illustrator. He has a Fantasia. Oh, Fantasia is another Disney film. Oh, sorry

258
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,860
 Is he is mind-blind?

259
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,140
 He has to draw things because he can't see them in his mind. So literally every time he thinks he has to draw it

260
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,060
 No, it's not but he makes it very difficult to draw things

261
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,980
 Can I say if it's Asia was really hard because you can't imagine it before you put it on paper?

262
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,380
 So you start drawing stuff and then halfway through you're like this is nothing like what it's supposed to be

263
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,180
 That's exactly right. And he says the same thing. They're not drawing from memory

264
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,260
 They're creating so they have to scribble tweak until they have what they want

265
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,460
 But he's he's one of the best animators ever. He's from the the new golden age of animation

266
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,540
 He drew the beast from Beauty and the Beast. So it can't be that hard James. I mean

267
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,660
 This guy's drawing the best

268
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,420
 Can we talk about the the little mermaid in Copenhagen sure thing

269
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:40,700
 So there's a statue of the little mermaid in Copenhagen, which I think is one of the most suffering statues of all time, right?

270
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,660
 So, yeah, she's she's in the harbor. She's sitting on a rock. She's beautiful

271
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,380
 She's washing her hair or something whatever, but she's hands Christian Anderson's little mermaid because that's his original story

272
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,980
 Which is very different. It's a bit more gruesome in the ending. You know, it's not quite as Disney-ish, but it's you know

273
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,540
 It's a classic fairy tale

274
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,440
 Anyway, this statue has been absolutely through the ring. All right, she was decapitated in 1964 and

275
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,500
 1998 her right arm was cut off in the 80s

276
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,300
 She was partially decapitated in 1990 in 2003. She was blown up with dynamite

277
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,160
 This statue has just had it people haven't go at this statue all the time

278
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,460
 I think it's exciting. Oh, just because she's so famous. She's such an icon. Well, it's all sorts of reasons

279
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,260
 So what there was one group of radical feminists who claimed

280
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,140
 That they had done it to sort of point out to create a simple

281
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:32,320
 They claimed they're kind of a head to create a symbol of the sexually fixated and male misogynist dream of women as being bodies without heads

282
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
 I point well made I think

283
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,940
 Didn't they then find that actually they didn't have enough evidence and they probably didn't do it

284
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,940
 So they set a murder squad on the case which I love, you know, they all like every single time she's been defaced

285
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
 They get the murders

286
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:54,220
 But basically in 1990 an anonymous tip tip-off guy rang up a TV camera man

287
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,620
 Freelance TV camera man called Michael Poulsen and said go and check out the Little Mermaid's head

288
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:03,420
 It's gone and he got to the scene of the crime and though two people apparently roller skating away saying too late and

289
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:10,380
 Then on day four the head turned up and it was returned by a masked figure to a TV station

290
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,340
 And the return happened to be filmed by a freelance TV camera man called Michael Poulsen

291
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:23,500
 who was the one who got the original beheading scoop and he made lots of money selling both sets of shots and he was arrested as

292
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,840
 Having maybe and doing it himself and did he get found guilty or he was released

293
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,180
 He was questioned and then released so it wasn't him in the end

294
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,420
 But it was thought that the whole thing would be done as a kind of thing to get some PR

295
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:41,180
 But that wasn't it. No, I don't know if they got the 1991. Is it hard to decapitate a statue? Oh, yeah

296
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,500
 So that's a lot of that bronze is hard to bronze is hard. Yeah, I'm surprised that they managed to do it

297
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,100
 Yeah, it seems to have just been hacked sword off every time whenever I've been there

298
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,340
 There's always a lot of tourists nearby so like you'd have to do in the middle of a night or something

299
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,580
 Yeah, I think they do. Yeah, I think it was exciting for her because biggest statue must be mostly so boring

300
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,980
 There was an article in 2017 written in June and said literally by June that year

301
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,060
 She'd already Warner Birker held a sex toy and been covered in paint twice. I mean, what a gig

302
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,340
 Yeah, unless you're a racist as a statue, you see no action basically

303
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,220
 But she's not she's not racist. No, no, no, but I'm just saying the only other stat

304
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:27,900
 Yes, arguably I don't know what people's motivation was but probably when she was wearing a Birker holding a sex toy

305
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,360
 She was racist at that moment. I don't know. I don't know. She was doing them both at the same time

306
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
 I don't know if that makes it better

307
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,540
 Is she complicit to

308
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:44,760
 You know the Millennium dome. Yeah, man, think of it from above, right? Yeah, what does it look circle like a yeah

309
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,940
 What else does it feature some like there's like some wires that go down to that?

310
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,940
 Yes, there's that and you can actually walk over the top of it now

311
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,740
 It's a cool tourist thing you can do. There's a massive hole in the side of the Millennium dome

312
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:04,600
 That no one ever talks about okay, and what it is is it's got it's a huge tower like a ventilation tower for the

313
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,500
 Blackwall tunnel which runs under London and they needed to have a vent tower

314
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 No way they said but that's where we want to build the Millennium dome

315
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,300
 They said well, sorry

316
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,360
 That's where our big towers going and it's just in the middle of the Millennium dome and they convinced them by saying don't worry

317
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,860
 No one will notice

318
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,780
 It turns out you're the first person to notice. We just not pay attention to it. Look at it

319
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,280
 It's got a massive hole in the top

320
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,820
 That's really weird. This big tunnel in Norway has a ventilation. Oh, yeah, this net

321
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:36,480
 Yeah, I think halfway through we mentioned in the podcast few weeks ago that you need to have these big fans in tunnels to make sure that the

322
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,060
 Air goes through but not just Andy standing in every tunnel saying

323
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:51,100
 But the one in Norway it comes out and like the top of a mountain somewhere

324
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,160
 I tried to find out on Google Maps and I could find the area, but I couldn't see the the hole

325
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
 With a big cork

326
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,720
 I was thinking exactly the same thing well done and going one step further

327
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,880
 I think what a cool film or adventure to go in there and crawl all the way through

328
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,400
 But when the Great Western Railway was built

329
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,720
 There's quite a lot of tunnels there and there's a guy called Dionysus Lardner who said

330
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,200
 I mean, they knew how to name babies in those days

331
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,800
 But he said that if you put any train in a tunnel as long as like say let's say the box tunnel

332
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,280
 Which is one of the big ones in the Great Western Railway

333
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,400
 They said that the train would use up so much oxygen when it was moving that there wouldn't be anything for the passengers to breathe

334
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
 And then one would just die

335
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,280
 What and he was he saying that he was saying that and he isn't right about those tunnels

336
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,960
 But he is right that you do need a lot of ventilation in those tunnels. Yeah, yeah tough gig

337
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,240
 And I do our tunnel that there's a sort of railway legend about

338
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,280
 Which was this was designed by is embarking on Brunel. It was in the 19th century

339
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,780
 It is the box tunnel near bath. Do you know that time? That's one I just mentioned. Oh, okay. Sorry. All right, so

340
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,200
 This was built

341
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,880
 With an idea that it was done deliberately so that light would shine from one end to the other through right?

342
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,200
 It's like one of these big legends because first beyond his birthday is meant to be on his birthday

343
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:31,000
 And the idea was not really confirmed until 200 years later when it was shut down and they were able to properly look through it on a morning

344
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,200
 I don't think it's been confirmed that it's for sure like that was the reason. Oh, no

345
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,480
 No, exactly, but the but the legend that the Sun would be seen on either side of the tunnel

346
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,460
 It was a thing and that was done because it was said it was

347
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,280
 Architecturally built so that it would do that on the birthday of Brunel and that was the 9th of April, which is today

348
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:57,720
 We asked the railway company once if we could go and film it

349
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,760
 Oh, really for qi and they said for some reason they would stop the entire rail network just so we

350
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,480
 They stop it a lot of the time anyway for much worse reasons

351
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,600
 And is it that if you hold the prism in the right place, it shows you where the Ark of the Covenant is buried

352
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,360
 Yes, yeah, yeah, so we need to find it before the Nazis do

353
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,360
 This I'm just jumping back to this submarine that went around the world

354
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,640
 It was a pretty amazing like the psychology of what do you do when you keep people for 60 days?

355
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,280
 Which is roughly how long they were under they had psychologists on board to monitor that and work out what was going on

356
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,800
 They did things like make people quit smoking because everyone was smoking up until recently

357
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:45,640
 It's only been banned smoking on submarines. So yeah, so they they did days of testing psychologically

358
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,080
 What does it do when you stop smoking? It did bad things. Everyone was really irritable

359
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,040
 So they allowed them to start smoking again

360
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,040
 They treated it a bit like a bit of a sightseeing tour the whole of the trip

361
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,160
 So anytime they got near land the periscope would go up and everyone was allowed a turn of just having a look

362
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,720
 They got to Easter Island and everyone had a good old look

363
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,280
 They pulled up to certain islands

364
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,800
 Whereas some of the members on board had family living there and asked them to out like locate the house on the shore

365
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,320
 So one guy actually spotted his mom and dad's house through the periscope

366
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,520
 Yeah, and I think that's why this guy this Filipino guy found them

367
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,240
 Wasn't it because they take him the same route as Ferdinand Magellan did when he went around the world

368
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,000
 And at one stage they saw that they were near like a statue of Magellan or something

369
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,680
 And so they put the periscope up up so everyone could see the statue and that's where he was

370
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,920
 There's one detail where his story wasn't believed or so we're told

371
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,200
 Because this happened to have happened on April Fool's Day

372
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,960
 And so when he came back and said I saw a sea monster

373
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,000
 And I was like, okay, yeah, sure thing. Nice one. You wouldn't believe it

374
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,040
 You know, would you believe it every other day of the year someone comes to me say they've seen a sea monster

375
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,960
 There's like literally no day of the year except maybe Christmas is a present to them that I say, oh, yeah, really cool

376
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,400
 Yeah, probably April Fool's Day is the one day where you go. Okay. Well, that's just too obvious to be an April Fool's

377
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,040
 It must be true. Yeah

378
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:17,280
 Ascension Island was an absolutely key part of the Falklands War wasn't it? They use his staging post

379
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,280
 Oh, was it? Yeah, because that's one of the three. There are three islands aren't they? Ascension Tristan de Cunha and

380
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,080
 The UK took over Ascension Island when Napoleon was in St. Helena because they thought that

381
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:39,200
 Yeah, he might escape. Yeah, it's a very convenient only 2,000 mile away hop, skip and a jump to save Napoleon and we can't let it happen

382
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,320
 It's lots given that it's so remote so many people visited it

383
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,880
 For example, the guy who discovered it was a Portuguese called Juan de Nova

384
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,680
 Who's known for some reason in St. Helena as John Newcastle and

385
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:02,400
 He was on his way to India on the and one of the crewmen on his voyage was a marigo Vespucci after whom America is named

386
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
 Oh, really? And then there's

387
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,640
 Captain Joshua Slocum the first man to sail single-handed round the world

388
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,040
 Who dropped in there on in 1898 and he sailed the whole way around the world

389
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,640
 You may have done this before without being able to swim which is an extraordinary fact, isn't it?

390
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,500
 Well, I think it helps gives you more of an incentive to sail. What do you think?

391
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,560
 Yeah, like we've got to get back there because if we don't get that I think a lot of sailors, you know way back

392
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,760
 Deliberately didn't learn to swim because they they didn't want to prolong the drowning

393
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,520
 Really rather have a quick quick one. Yeah

394
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,320
 One of the great forges of all time Elmira de Hore he was an artist himself

395
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,160
 And but he wasn't a very good one. Well, he's kind of okay

396
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:53,880
 But when he showed one of his paintings to woman called Lady Malcolm Campbell, she saw her and she said oh is that a Picasso and he was like

397
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,680
 No, no, it's me and I can't really sell it but Picasso seems to be selling quite well

398
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,120
 So from now on I'm just gonna paint my stuff and pretend it's from a Picasso. Nice

399
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,240
 And he became really massive throughout the 40s

400
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,800
 He was making all sorts of these forgeries of Picasso and Matisse

401
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:18,840
 So he created so many Modigliani forgeries that it's still now it's impossible to compile a catalogue of Modigliani's work

402
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,560
 Really? Yeah, because we don't know which ones are his and which ones are the Horeys

403
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:30,200
 And his collection is run now and he was such a big forger that people want to see his paintings

404
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,880
 And it's run by a guy called Mark Forgey

405
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,680
 On the attribution of you know, who did what a Nazi officer saw Gernica when Picasso was

406
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,840
 There and he said did you do that and Picasso said no you did it nice

407
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,320
 His only political painting really

408
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,760
 Really went off his paintings during this because he was obsessed with himself and drawing his women and how tortured they were

409
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,320
 And what horrible time they were having because he was having affairs and basically he went out with Dora Ma

410
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:12,440
 Who was very political she politicized him. He did Gernica. It became a huge anti-war symbol, didn't it?

411
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,360
 There was a painting of there was a huge sort of like

412
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:23,900
 Aircraft bombing of a village in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, right? By the by their allies of ashes by the Nazis and the Italians

413
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,680
 Which was in fact a birthday present sweetly from Göring to Hitler sweet, so sweet

414
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,360
 I just I wonder what were the circumstances and the situation in which Picasso replied that to a Nazi

415
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,800
 Was we talking post-war here? Are we talking like he wasn't in Nazi Germany, right?

416
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,240
 That's a pretty bold thing to say to a Nazi is all I'm saying. Well, I presumably during the war wasn't it?

417
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,660
 Occupation wild. What was the next sentence on the Nazi side because I think he was in Paris when the Nazis came into Paris

418
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,200
 Wasn't he I think yes, it reminds me of

419
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,280
 the famous story about Sigmund Freud when he was

420
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,960
 Asked to in order to get out of of Germany under the

421
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,600
 Nazis he was asked to sign a disclaimer saying that he hadn't been badly treated and

422
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,740
 He wrote I can heartily recommend the Gestapo to anyone

423
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,180
 Do you know which national anthem contains the word moss this is a question for Randy really?

424
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,700
 Is it a biggie Japan

425
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:45,160
 Anna's got it. Wow. They bloody love musto may your world go on for thousands of years until pebbles merge into one giant rock and

426
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,360
 Covered with moss. That's the dream

427
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,600
 In a national anthem survey 79% of Americans know the first line of the star-spangled banner

428
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,540
 But only 37% of Canadians know the first line to oh Canada

429
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,760
 Which is really pathetic considering the first line of oh Canada is oh Canada

430
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:16,040
 Can I just learn the fact tangentially terminate - one best sound effects editing in 1992?

431
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
 And I think there was this famous moment where

432
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,440
 T1,000 who I believe is one of the characters

433
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,960
 Goes through some metal bars and the sound effect was achieved by pouring dog food out of a can and it's it's quite cool

434
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:35,760
 To watch when you know that but I didn't know the director of that had such a good money-saving cheat for two separate scenes where

435
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,620
 The terminator all T1,000 I think can disguise himself as someone else

436
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:45,720
 And so you see a character looking at their reflection and then that character turns around and the reflection still looking at them

437
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,420
 And you realize it's T1,000. Do you know how he achieved that effect?

438
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,160
 With a window I'll give you a clue. Have you ever seen the film?

439
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,440
 Yes, it's the same concept as the big reveal in that he used Arnold Schwarzenegger's twin. He used identical

440
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,120
 He used identical twins twice in this film

441
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:16,240
 There's an identical twin so there's Don and Dan Stanton played a character called Lewis and then T1,000 pretending to be him

442
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,640
 And then Linda Hamilton, who I think was a famous part in that had an identical twin called Leslie Hamilton

443
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:28,800
 And whenever he needed, you know, one of them to do something body-doubly, isn't it? Was he hiring actors entirely based on that way?

444
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,040
 Yeah

445
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
 So heads of state and cows

446
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,760
 President Taft of America kept a cow called Pauline on the White House lawn. Do you remember that?

447
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,520
 No, I didn't remember it. No, so I was collecting names of naming animals of odd names

448
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,020
 So Byron had a pet wolf called Lion

449
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,120
 Either reveal is bad right when you mean it

450
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,400
 Einstein had a cat called Tiger

451
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,520
 Climbs Gustav Klint had a cat called Catskate. He said and the Times journalist Andrew Billan

452
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,320
 I read the other day is called he's got a cat called Vommie, which is Bode's ill, doesn't it?

453
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
 And I did I did really like this

454
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,880
 Elgar the composer spent a lot of time with the Hereford Cathedral organist dog who's called Dan

455
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,520
 Anyway, when Dan fell into the river wine swam upstream to find a landing place

456
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,760
 Somebody suggested that Elgar set the whole adventure to music and he did he said I've done it

457
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
 It was called the enigma variations

458
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,440
 Inspired by Dan the dog who fell into the river

459
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:42,680
 Dan I think he's just replaced you as my favorite Dan. Oh, I thought that changed long ago. Yeah. That's very cool

460
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,640
 I love whoever that journalist was what a billing he got to share just then out of nowhere

461
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:54,260
 He's a really good guy

462
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:03,000
 What's Swindon famous for the Oxford United's big rivals? Yeah, I could say about the football team

463
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,560
 What do they make in Swindon? Dianna Dawes is famous. She's a Swindon girl and

464
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,800
 The mayor was introducing it once he was terribly nervous because

465
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,820
 Her maiden name was Dianna Fluck like Peter Fluck

466
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,780
 And he said it's a gentleman may introduce

467
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,360
 That lady used to be called Diana Clunter

468
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:37,760
 Alright, there you go, that is all of our outtakes

469
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,360
 If you want to write to any of us about the things that were said in this episode podcast at qi.com

470
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,800
 All those emails go to Andy he goes through them and some of them make their way to drop us a line of which

471
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,360
 There'll be another episode popping into your club fish feed in the next couple of weeks

472
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,560
 So do write in if you want to have yours read out on the show one

473
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,400
 Correction from the outtakes which we thought worth keeping in any way

474
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,160
 Sometimes we just tell stories out loud because someone has said something while we're on a tangent

475
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,480
 And I just wanted to add a few corrections that brilliantly funny Steve Martin story that I told earlier

476
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,520
 So just in case you're thinking can't wait for this episode to end

477
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,480
 I absolutely want to get out there and start spreading the story

478
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,360
 There's a few corrections to add about it one is that he was filming Roxanne and he did go into a bar

479
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,920
 However, it wasn't because it was the end of the day and he was looking for a drink

480
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,960
 It's because they were halfway through the filming day. He had the prosthetics on he really needed the bathroom

481
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,520
 There wasn't one around someone pointed him to that place

482
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,800
 He walked in and then the story is pretty much the same. He gets looks from all the locals

483
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,840
 He's thinking oh am I welcome here or not and a man walks up to him looks him up and down and says why the long face

484
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,320
 There you go. You can now go out into the wild and spread that hilarious story

485
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,000
 All right, that is it everyone

486
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,680
 We are gonna be back as I say with a drop us a line in a couple of weeks

487
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,760
 We will see you all then and hopefully some of you in Sheffield

488
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,640
 No such thing as a fish calm check that out and find yourself some tickets. All right guys. Take care

489
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,060
 Hope you all doing well. We'll speak to you soon. Goodbye

490
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,060

00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,060
