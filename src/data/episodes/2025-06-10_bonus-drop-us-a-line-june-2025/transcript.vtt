WEBVTT

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.280
 Howdy club fish members. How you doing?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.800
 Dan here. We have a compilation episode for you today

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.720
 This is the best bits of the stuff that didn't make it into the main episodes little outtakes

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.520
 Little extra bits of info that didn't quite fit the narrative of the show all bunged together here for you

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.880
 Starring the four fishers plus John Lloyd the QI Supremo

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 So hope you enjoy that this should be hitting the club fish page on Tuesday

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.280
 Which means we are just under two weeks away from doing our next live show

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.720
 Which is happening in Sheffield at the crossed wires festival just gonna say that if you are thinking of coming

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.480
 We are on the edge of selling out and so don't leave it till last minute cuz there might not be any tickets left

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.080
 You can find them by going to know such thing as a fish calm. It'll be a really fun night

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.600
 I think the show is about 85 minutes. We're gonna be doing really fun things like we're gonna enter

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 Someone into the fish Hall of Fame a local from Sheffield who has been mentioned previously on the episode

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.680
 So they'll be up on stage with us or at least that's the plan. We might try out something new all together

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.640
 It's always fun doing these live shows and we'd love to see you there. So come along

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.600
 But for now enjoy the compilation episode. Here we go

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:31.540
 Had a quick hunt by the way cuz Murray's plums

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.600
 Nice to have something named after you. Yeah, Andy

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.000
 I wanted to see if we had any other fruits that were relevant to us

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.600
 The other three of us. So I found harken peaches

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.520
 Yeah, it says harken peaches now. It's Ian as opposed to iron for yeah, so harken peaches like listen peaches

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.480
 Yeah, as I tell the harken the tail and I so I was just reading up to see if there were any similarities

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.480
 So I found someone who actually

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.440
 Farms them and they say that normally harken trees are pretty finicky producers

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.120
 Okay, I'm a finicky producer when it comes to TV production. Yeah, you're covered in a lovely soft fuzz

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.120
 I

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:19.160
 Know you you don't have a toshinsky, but you have an Anna which is an Anna's apple, which is Anna Bolin's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:31.380
 Let's not make assumptions. That's a leap. That's a leap. I'm not really maybe named after her head

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.600
 Well in some of the photos it is quite a flat apple. They didn't take photos at the time

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.540
 What oh right of the apple?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.920
 In some photos there's different shapes to it. So yeah, I got excited

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.780
 Two of ambulance homes in the last month ambulance following me around at the moment. No, you're following her around

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:00.320
 These other detectors, okay like the weird ways people have tried to detect neutrinos because lots of countries have got their own ones around the place

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.360
 So there's one in Japan, which is a tank of 50,000 tons of ultra pure water under a mountain

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.240
 That's called the super cameo candy and scientists have to get rafts around the surface of this

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.800
 What on the ultra pure water? They were around on it. I shot that clean the rafts before they go in

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.280
 They probably have one of those little, you know a little puddle of clean water that you walk through so that you don't get verucous

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.360
 Yeah, definitely, and they'll have a pool robot on the inside just getting anything else

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.240
 A guy with his top off in a long net

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.920
 Then there was the first detector built in the 60s by Raymond Davis Jr. And John Buckle was a tank with half a million litres of dry cleaning fluid in it

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.160
 Oh, yeah, what yeah, it has more uses I guess

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know if I know what dry you mean like washing fluid

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.280
 It's a it's a chemical you use isn't it? I can't remember what it's called now

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.000
 Never been to dry cleaners wouldn't know but cool glad it's got another even better application. Absolutely. Yeah

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.440
 That's really cool. And there's one called dune in America

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:13.080
 It's underground it is underground like the worms, but there are two detectors 800 miles apart one is pointing at the other one

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.080
 You know plums have stones in them. Yeah, they're unique to the species that stone

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.040
 You know all the like the little bumps and stuff that you get in them like a fingerprint like a fingerprint

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.040
 So, you know, which plum has burgled you

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.560
 What do you mean unique to the species sorry so if you get a little plum stone, yeah, it's got loads of wrinkles on it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.640
 Yeah, and you have a book which has all the different patterns

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.480
 You'll be able to tell which species of plum it comes from or which variety why we matches the same dense in the stone

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.040
 Yeah, exactly. And so in the Marie Rose ship

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.080
 We sank when 16th century and then they raised it in when up 20th century

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.600
 They found all these stones all these plum stones and they could tell exactly what species they were and they went

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.840
 Or what variety they were and they went back to the national fruit

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.360
 Center which I think we might have mentioned before

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.480
 Yes, I checked it against modern fruits and they could see exactly what they were. Oh my goodness

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.040
 That's insane. That is why they share fingerprints

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.760
 So if you're one species of plum then you can blame the burglary on your mate

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.320
 Who's the same species because you've left the same pretty. It's almost like every family would have the same or something like that

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.440
 Professor plum

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.040
 Yeah, so

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.560
 Plums blue gold they're called in Serbia. Yeah

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.340
 They have 40 million plum trees and at least three plum festivals every year in Serbia

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.120
 And if you have

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.440
 Serbian drink the national drink and that's plum flavored usually

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.480
 Oh, God, is that is that the thing they give you at the free at the end of every meal whenever you go to one of those countries?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.080
 Yeah, if you're in like Serbia Montenegro some parts of Bosnia and

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.740
 They give you that have it because if you don't you're insulting them, but you're gonna regret it the next like all of those things

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.680
 Where it claims to be favored with X but it tastes like petrol like yeah, it tastes really strong quite chemical

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.480
 Yeah, there's often a thing where I don't know if this is your experience

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.200
 But where if you're there with someone of the opposite sex in my experience

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.440
 My wife would be given a reasonably nice spirit and I would be given something. It was absolute lighter

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:38.400
 Slightly bloke a thing to get and she's got a little bit of plum brandy or something and I'm just drinking pure diesel

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.480
 I must admit whenever I've been with Serbians and the slivovics has come out

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.400
 Usually everyone's getting involved. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.760
 They must think of you as particularly manly

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.040
 What they've seen my plans

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.960
 The Venice in general is a I didn't I had no idea how it's built

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.360
 So I knew it was Laguni. I knew it's in the middle of a lagoon

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.620
 I knew that sort of you know, and there wasn't a road or rail link until the middle of the 19th century

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.320
 Yeah, but it was built what I didn't know is that it is how it's on stills

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.640
 So every building is built on these wooden poles

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.240
 Which have been driven down into the sediment and if you drive down enough poles, it's like nine or ten per square meter

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.840
 You can just put stone on top of that and it all

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:37.000
 Here's the church of San Marco required 10,000 oak trees to be put into converted into poles for one church

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.560
 It's a big church the whole of Venice must be way even more than that

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.400
 It's millions. Yeah, millions and millions of these poles. It's like they say it's an inverted forest

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.760
 It's so cool. And this was literally 1500 years ago, wasn't it? I mean, this is in the fifth century or whatever

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.240
 Which is extraordinary that they were able to do that

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.200
 I think and the good thing is because they're underwater and they're all underwater, right?

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.520
 So you've got the the rocks on top, but the poles themselves never go above the water

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.880
 And that means they don't rot because there's no oxygen to make them rock

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.320
 So they stay on the water and they're still now the ones from 1500 years ago is still good

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.940
 They're not they're not kind of falling apart. It's amazing

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:21.320
 And there was a job the batty Pali the pile hitters that was their job was to pound pound the piles into the ground

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.320
 You need a big hammer for that. Don't you? How are you doing that?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.120
 What you do I didn't often work experience on a farm once and I had to

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.740
 When you're building a fence you have this big metal drum which is open at one end and it's got two handles

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.200
 It's like a milk churn, basically, but you put it upside down

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.140
 You put it over the steak you're banging into the ground a steak banging and you just lift it up and bang down

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.660
 It goes it's such hard work and water that must be really difficult with a whole sort of tree

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.260
 You basically you've got to be so strong. You've got to be so strong

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:55.700
 Yeah, yeah, and they had their traditional song which was all about venison its glory and death to the Turks like good traditional stuff

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.620
 And even now in Venice, there's a phrase nattista. They're about the pie

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.020
 Which means a head that is good to pound down the piles. Are you a bit thick?

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.020
 You know, nice

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.940
 And now we're gonna talk about why you only lasted an afternoon of work experience on that farm

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:16.020
 Yeah, I was slated for a seven-year contract of steak banging, but I got tired. It's really hard work

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:23.900
 Um, you know George Foreman's grill. Yeah most famous grill of all time. It's shifted like over a hundred million units

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.580
 Is it a barbecue? No, no, it's like it's a grill you sort of you a toasty maker

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.840
 It's like it's like it is like what it's like it looks exactly like one

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.000
 But it's for meats and it's and it's positioned on an angle so that all of the juices sort of run down and away

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.080
 So it's yeah, I miss and he's made more he made because he's passed away now more money off the back of that than his entire

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:49.340
 Boxing career by substantial amount. He's made like between 200 and 500 million off of it because he was getting 40% of the deal

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.060
 But most people mistook him as the creator of it

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.500
 But in fact, it was this brilliant innovator who was called Michael Bohm who was the person who started it

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.920
 He went to George Foreman and Hulk Hogan to say which one of you could do it

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.880
 Oh, he went to the same agent who had both of them. Yeah, Foreman got it in the end

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.800
 And but this guy no one believed him that he invented it

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.320
 So he used to walk around with the patent on to him any time that someone said you're not the inventor

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.760
 He was a am I not have a look at my patients talking to him at a party

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.740
 T-shirt saying I invented the George Foreman grill is making is deterring me

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.320
 He's not talking to you at a party

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:35.760
 Yeah, meet her on Francois meet her on recent one. Yeah, very recent. He had a wife

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.540
 But he also had a mistress in the dark

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:43.860
 He basically lived a double life and it was his wife Danielle who insisted that it was kept secret from the press and

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.860
 basically the press all knew about it, but they

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.580
 Like decided they wouldn't print anything that ultra the ultra conservative about exposing their leaders

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.880
 They really are they're very very cautious about it

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.880
 They are I suppose that it's weird because they're conservative about that

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.940
 But they are much more liberal as we famously know about relationships

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.380
 So meter on situation was so interesting before he became president

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:13.620
 He lived in a house with his wife and his wife's lover who has like just had a separate room in their house

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.980
 And when he became president

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:26.480
 But he when he did become president they like his staff moved to the woman and who he was having this affair with into a house

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.560
 It was nice and near him

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.400
 So he could go and sit there all the time and they employed a guy to make sure that no one printed anything about them

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.000
 So there was this guy called Francois de Grosse of

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 And whenever any journalists sort of sniffed around said we're gonna do an article about this separate life

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.400
 You have at one stage they got a journalist and kidnapped him and locked him in the cellar for a week saying

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.400
 And then it's like it's a bigger story

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.740
 Yeah, and then in 2021 it turned out that he wasn't living a double life after all he was living a triple life

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.300
 And there was another woman called Claire who was 50 years his junior

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.460
 Who that he was having an affair with the whole time as well

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.860
 I actually think he was having lots of shags along the way

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.340
 But yeah, Claire again, it was it's so interesting. It's just like very different

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.860
 Standards that I can't judge

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.460
 So she Claire had followed him for four years from when she was 18 to when she was 22

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:25.640
 Yeah, and then eventually invited him around her house and they had basically what seems like quite a nice relationship for the last 10 years of his life

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:32.400
 Alongside his marriage, right? It's one interpretation and then other people could say that it wasn't appropriate

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.800
 Yeah, you could say that there's a massive massive power imbalance. You could say that yes

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.240
 Although she's definitely more physically able and the staff all said it was great because she could go on official visits with him

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.120
 And because she was so young even in France no one suspected that they were together

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.700
 So she used to accompany him brilliant in many ways the perfect crime

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.300
 I want to stress the word Christ

00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:03.520
 But all of this stuff about method acting and the method I love it all goes back to Stanislavski

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.300
 Yes, the Russian guy Russian acting coach

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.300
 Yeah

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:13.340
 Constant in Stanislavski and he founded this realistic acting stuff and the problem all acting was very unrealistic on film

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.920
 Because it was silent film so you have to have big theatrical gestures and movements and and theater as well

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.040
 You would exactly yeah, and you can't and then it all changes when the close-up is invented

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.720
 Suddenly you zoom right in on someone's face and they're going

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.400
 They look like they're overacting

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.500
 Crazily and so you have to then you could do the less is more school

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:39.940
 But and Stanislavski founded this sort of realistic acting. Yeah, and you would go in and you'd be an actor in Stanislavski's

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.720
 Moscow theater and

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.740
 You would do your lines, and he would just go I don't believe you and you do them again

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.780
 He go I don't believe you I don't believe you I don't believe you

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.280
 And you just say that again and again and again until it was right

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.720
 That's genuinely flashback to my clown school days

00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.960
 What you're doing and they won't let you go but Stanislavski in fairness he walked the walk

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.620
 So he did that method himself and whenever he was acting a part

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.480
 He would go for a walk in the altar like he had a big sort of theater in Crimea

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.500
 And he would go for a walk in his character every single morning

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.080
 Everyone would laugh at him and point at him

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.020
 But he didn't really mind because he was just trying to get into character. I really respect the lack of

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:24.460
 Social fear yeah, you have to have to do that like Daniel A. Lewis just having the guts to do it

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.540
 And I really liked the fact I thought he was a bit of a dick for doing it

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.520
 But then you read interviews and he said he does it for fun

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.400
 Which I can really empathize with is like he says I do it to play also if the director saying yeah

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.980
 We'll pay for you to like live in Prague and learn check

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.940
 But you know the fate the famous story and the great story about method acting I found something out about that

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.520
 You know the Dustin Hoffman Laurence Olivier tale

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.360
 Which is that when they were filming Marathon Man with Dustin Hoffman in the 80s was it and

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:58.120
 Dustin Hoffman staggers in one day and there's one bit of Marathon Man where the lead character the Dustin Hoffman is playing

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.360
 It has to have been a wake for three days straight and he staggers in and says to Laurence Olivier

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.600
 I've stayed awake for three days preparing for this character

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.900
 I feel like absolute shit and he's haggling his hairs all over the place and Laurence Olivier just turned him

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.980
 Put his hand on his shoulder and said my dear, why don't you try acting?

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.500
 Anyway famous story famous Dustin Hoffman has said he wasn't actually doing it to prepare

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.740
 He'd just been out on the booze for three nights straight

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:31.180
 Okay, and I think they maybe he's trying to sound cool now because he said he comes across as the loser in that story

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:37.140
 Whereas Laurence Olivier is the aloof. It was also dead. So there's no you can't come back and say he's lying

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.360
 Exactly, I love there's a story which is sort of method acting

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.180
 Steve Martin when he did Roxanne the movie. He has a giant nose, right Pinocchio long

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.560
 They were in a small town and they were filming and he finished a day really needed a drink

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.260
 So it takes a long time to take the prosthetic off. So he's like I'm just going for a drink

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.440
 But then he sort of got cold feet while he was out kind of got this giant nose

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.620
 I'm gonna walk into a bar. No one knows really who I am out here and

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.820
 He gets into a bar and it does the classic piano stops playing

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.360
 Everyone turns around and he's freaking out thinking. Oh girl. What am I doing?

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.160
 I'm gonna get my ass kicked walks up to the bar and a gruesome looking dude

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.720
 According to him walks up to him and says hey

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.320
 Why the long face?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.600
 Come on great a story

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.280
 It's better on paper

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:32.160
 Avant de Gaulle, she's an interesting character. Charles de Gaulle's wife exactly. Yeah, so she was the first lady of France and

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.820
 She there was a story that while sort of his retirement was imminent

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.780
 She was at Buckingham Palace and I guess asked her what are you most looking forward to in your retirement?

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.260
 She said a penis

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.620
 I mean, it's almost the origin of that joke

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:53.320
 She was saying happiness, but it was oh god, and then Steve Martin walked in

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.880
 History's jokes, but but um, yeah, she's a very interesting character

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.920
 She while we're talking about censorship as the top bit of this fact

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.480
 She was very much against things like displays of nudity and sex and tried to have things past so that they wouldn't be shown in public

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.600
 Mini skirts were a problem for her as well. She wanted the lengthening of a skirt to have to actually be legally a certain length

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.720
 And then there's this amazing thing, you know, there was an assassination attempt on

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.780
 On shot. Oh, well, there was one of both of them. I mean he was one of the most almost

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:32.900
 So 1962 they get ambushed while they're in their car and it's machine gun fire

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.180
 They both survive her first words after she got out of the car were a penis

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:43.540
 Please cut out the earlier reference

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:56.620
 The first question was how are my chickens and it's because she just bought some chickens in jelly at some fare at some

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:04.340
 That still was more concerned to her machine gun bullets might have absolutely

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.180
 They're in the boot of the car. Yeah

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.400
 What could have happened like even if your chicken gets shot by a bullet?

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.240
 Maybe the rare chickens that you only get out at one fair once a year, you know, I get it

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.100
 Fair enough. I'll be your question to the cockle van

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.780
 more like cockle boot

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:27.060
 Driving in a van with an A. There you go. Yes. There's a joke in that somewhere. Absolutely

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.940
 Mongolia barbecue is quite cool. It's called boo dog

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.580
 What you do is you take your right in the dog and leaps into the fire

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:41.400
 Bobs your uncle. I think if you told the dog about this, they get frightened. So you get your animal

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.180
 Let's say it's a marmot and you cut it open from its head to its groin slice it right down

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.100
 You take out all the insides you season them and then you stuff them back in again

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.940
 Oh with stones and veggies and you put it over a fire

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.320
 And you just leave it over the fire for ages and ages and then you cut bring it out and you eat all the insides and

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:07.060
 The stones are now really really hot and you pass them around the group everyone gets to hold the stones in their hand

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.660
 Well, I was gonna ask you that

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.460
 Oh

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.460
 Why would you want to do that?

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:19.460
 That's quite cold in Mongolia. It does at times. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, this is more put on your hand

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.300
 It's like a hot plate just keeps it. Oh, yeah, good call. Apparently it's supposed to help against stress

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.940
 Okay, very hot stones. I feel stressed

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.900
 How fast is the fastest submarine

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:42.220
 Give it an MPH if you want this is the underwater sea record also, and I'll say 50. Oh

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:49.100
 Yeah, that's some 50 miles an hour. It's gonna say 200. I'm so less. There's a lot of water resistance, isn't there?

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.100
 And they're so big and fat. I'm gonna say 30. Okay. No, that's mad 40

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.240
 Andy is the closest but he's absolutely miles away. It's 51.4

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.740
 I

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:10.140
 Think Glenkeen the little mermaid illustrator. There's something interesting about him. He is similar to one of us. Oh

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.740
 He has something that one of us have really loves his wife. No, it's not them

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:27.940
 No, you two have James and Anna. Oh, okay, a Bolton accent. It's not Anna

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.540
 A superiority complex

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:39.660
 Um, it's that he can't picture things in his mind's eye

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:45.860
 He has a illustrator. He has a Fantasia. Oh, Fantasia is another Disney film. Oh, sorry

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.860
 Is he is mind-blind?

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.140
 He has to draw things because he can't see them in his mind. So literally every time he thinks he has to draw it

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.060
 No, it's not but he makes it very difficult to draw things

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.980
 Can I say if it's Asia was really hard because you can't imagine it before you put it on paper?

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:05.380
 So you start drawing stuff and then halfway through you're like this is nothing like what it's supposed to be

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.180
 That's exactly right. And he says the same thing. They're not drawing from memory

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.260
 They're creating so they have to scribble tweak until they have what they want

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.460
 But he's he's one of the best animators ever. He's from the the new golden age of animation

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.540
 He drew the beast from Beauty and the Beast. So it can't be that hard James. I mean

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.660
 This guy's drawing the best

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.420
 Can we talk about the the little mermaid in Copenhagen sure thing

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:40.700
 So there's a statue of the little mermaid in Copenhagen, which I think is one of the most suffering statues of all time, right?

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.660
 So, yeah, she's she's in the harbor. She's sitting on a rock. She's beautiful

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:50.380
 She's washing her hair or something whatever, but she's hands Christian Anderson's little mermaid because that's his original story

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.980
 Which is very different. It's a bit more gruesome in the ending. You know, it's not quite as Disney-ish, but it's you know

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.540
 It's a classic fairy tale

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.440
 Anyway, this statue has been absolutely through the ring. All right, she was decapitated in 1964 and

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.500
 1998 her right arm was cut off in the 80s

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.300
 She was partially decapitated in 1990 in 2003. She was blown up with dynamite

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.160
 This statue has just had it people haven't go at this statue all the time

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.460
 I think it's exciting. Oh, just because she's so famous. She's such an icon. Well, it's all sorts of reasons

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.260
 So what there was one group of radical feminists who claimed

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.140
 That they had done it to sort of point out to create a simple

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:32.320
 They claimed they're kind of a head to create a symbol of the sexually fixated and male misogynist dream of women as being bodies without heads

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.320
 I point well made I think

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.940
 Didn't they then find that actually they didn't have enough evidence and they probably didn't do it

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.940
 So they set a murder squad on the case which I love, you know, they all like every single time she's been defaced

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.940
 They get the murders

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:54.220
 But basically in 1990 an anonymous tip tip-off guy rang up a TV camera man

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.620
 Freelance TV camera man called Michael Poulsen and said go and check out the Little Mermaid's head

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:03.420
 It's gone and he got to the scene of the crime and though two people apparently roller skating away saying too late and

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:10.380
 Then on day four the head turned up and it was returned by a masked figure to a TV station

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:16.340
 And the return happened to be filmed by a freelance TV camera man called Michael Poulsen

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:23.500
 who was the one who got the original beheading scoop and he made lots of money selling both sets of shots and he was arrested as

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:28.840
 Having maybe and doing it himself and did he get found guilty or he was released

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.180
 He was questioned and then released so it wasn't him in the end

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.420
 But it was thought that the whole thing would be done as a kind of thing to get some PR

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:41.180
 But that wasn't it. No, I don't know if they got the 1991. Is it hard to decapitate a statue? Oh, yeah

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:46.500
 So that's a lot of that bronze is hard to bronze is hard. Yeah, I'm surprised that they managed to do it

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.100
 Yeah, it seems to have just been hacked sword off every time whenever I've been there

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.340
 There's always a lot of tourists nearby so like you'd have to do in the middle of a night or something

00:23:54.340 --> 00:24:01.580
 Yeah, I think they do. Yeah, I think it was exciting for her because biggest statue must be mostly so boring

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.980
 There was an article in 2017 written in June and said literally by June that year

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:11.060
 She'd already Warner Birker held a sex toy and been covered in paint twice. I mean, what a gig

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:16.340
 Yeah, unless you're a racist as a statue, you see no action basically

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.220
 But she's not she's not racist. No, no, no, but I'm just saying the only other stat

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:27.900
 Yes, arguably I don't know what people's motivation was but probably when she was wearing a Birker holding a sex toy

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.360
 She was racist at that moment. I don't know. I don't know. She was doing them both at the same time

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.360
 I don't know if that makes it better

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.540
 Is she complicit to

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:44.760
 You know the Millennium dome. Yeah, man, think of it from above, right? Yeah, what does it look circle like a yeah

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.940
 What else does it feature some like there's like some wires that go down to that?

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.940
 Yes, there's that and you can actually walk over the top of it now

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.740
 It's a cool tourist thing you can do. There's a massive hole in the side of the Millennium dome

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:04.600
 That no one ever talks about okay, and what it is is it's got it's a huge tower like a ventilation tower for the

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.500
 Blackwall tunnel which runs under London and they needed to have a vent tower

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.500
 No way they said but that's where we want to build the Millennium dome

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.300
 They said well, sorry

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.360
 That's where our big towers going and it's just in the middle of the Millennium dome and they convinced them by saying don't worry

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.860
 No one will notice

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.780
 It turns out you're the first person to notice. We just not pay attention to it. Look at it

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.280
 It's got a massive hole in the top

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.820
 That's really weird. This big tunnel in Norway has a ventilation. Oh, yeah, this net

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:36.480
 Yeah, I think halfway through we mentioned in the podcast few weeks ago that you need to have these big fans in tunnels to make sure that the

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.060
 Air goes through but not just Andy standing in every tunnel saying

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:51.100
 But the one in Norway it comes out and like the top of a mountain somewhere

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.160
 I tried to find out on Google Maps and I could find the area, but I couldn't see the the hole

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.040
 With a big cork

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.720
 I was thinking exactly the same thing well done and going one step further

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.880
 I think what a cool film or adventure to go in there and crawl all the way through

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.400
 But when the Great Western Railway was built

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.720
 There's quite a lot of tunnels there and there's a guy called Dionysus Lardner who said

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:24.200
 I mean, they knew how to name babies in those days

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.800
 But he said that if you put any train in a tunnel as long as like say let's say the box tunnel

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.280
 Which is one of the big ones in the Great Western Railway

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:39.400
 They said that the train would use up so much oxygen when it was moving that there wouldn't be anything for the passengers to breathe

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.400
 And then one would just die

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.280
 What and he was he saying that he was saying that and he isn't right about those tunnels

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.960
 But he is right that you do need a lot of ventilation in those tunnels. Yeah, yeah tough gig

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.240
 And I do our tunnel that there's a sort of railway legend about

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:02.280
 Which was this was designed by is embarking on Brunel. It was in the 19th century

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:08.780
 It is the box tunnel near bath. Do you know that time? That's one I just mentioned. Oh, okay. Sorry. All right, so

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.200
 This was built

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:18.880
 With an idea that it was done deliberately so that light would shine from one end to the other through right?

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.200
 It's like one of these big legends because first beyond his birthday is meant to be on his birthday

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:31.000
 And the idea was not really confirmed until 200 years later when it was shut down and they were able to properly look through it on a morning

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.200
 I don't think it's been confirmed that it's for sure like that was the reason. Oh, no

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.480
 No, exactly, but the but the legend that the Sun would be seen on either side of the tunnel

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.460
 It was a thing and that was done because it was said it was

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:50.280
 Architecturally built so that it would do that on the birthday of Brunel and that was the 9th of April, which is today

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:57.720
 We asked the railway company once if we could go and film it

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:03.760
 Oh, really for qi and they said for some reason they would stop the entire rail network just so we

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.480
 They stop it a lot of the time anyway for much worse reasons

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.600
 And is it that if you hold the prism in the right place, it shows you where the Ark of the Covenant is buried

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.360
 Yes, yeah, yeah, so we need to find it before the Nazis do

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.360
 This I'm just jumping back to this submarine that went around the world

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:28.640
 It was a pretty amazing like the psychology of what do you do when you keep people for 60 days?

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:34.280
 Which is roughly how long they were under they had psychologists on board to monitor that and work out what was going on

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.800
 They did things like make people quit smoking because everyone was smoking up until recently

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:45.640
 It's only been banned smoking on submarines. So yeah, so they they did days of testing psychologically

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.080
 What does it do when you stop smoking? It did bad things. Everyone was really irritable

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.040
 So they allowed them to start smoking again

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.040
 They treated it a bit like a bit of a sightseeing tour the whole of the trip

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.160
 So anytime they got near land the periscope would go up and everyone was allowed a turn of just having a look

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.720
 They got to Easter Island and everyone had a good old look

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.280
 They pulled up to certain islands

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.800
 Whereas some of the members on board had family living there and asked them to out like locate the house on the shore

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.320
 So one guy actually spotted his mom and dad's house through the periscope

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.520
 Yeah, and I think that's why this guy this Filipino guy found them

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:28.240
 Wasn't it because they take him the same route as Ferdinand Magellan did when he went around the world

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:34.000
 And at one stage they saw that they were near like a statue of Magellan or something

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.680
 And so they put the periscope up up so everyone could see the statue and that's where he was

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.920
 There's one detail where his story wasn't believed or so we're told

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.200
 Because this happened to have happened on April Fool's Day

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.960
 And so when he came back and said I saw a sea monster

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.000
 And I was like, okay, yeah, sure thing. Nice one. You wouldn't believe it

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.040
 You know, would you believe it every other day of the year someone comes to me say they've seen a sea monster

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.960
 There's like literally no day of the year except maybe Christmas is a present to them that I say, oh, yeah, really cool

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:07.400
 Yeah, probably April Fool's Day is the one day where you go. Okay. Well, that's just too obvious to be an April Fool's

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.040
 It must be true. Yeah

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:17.280
 Ascension Island was an absolutely key part of the Falklands War wasn't it? They use his staging post

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:23.280
 Oh, was it? Yeah, because that's one of the three. There are three islands aren't they? Ascension Tristan de Cunha and

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:31.080
 The UK took over Ascension Island when Napoleon was in St. Helena because they thought that

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:39.200
 Yeah, he might escape. Yeah, it's a very convenient only 2,000 mile away hop, skip and a jump to save Napoleon and we can't let it happen

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:44.320
 It's lots given that it's so remote so many people visited it

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:50.880
 For example, the guy who discovered it was a Portuguese called Juan de Nova

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.680
 Who's known for some reason in St. Helena as John Newcastle and

00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:02.400
 He was on his way to India on the and one of the crewmen on his voyage was a marigo Vespucci after whom America is named

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.400
 Oh, really? And then there's

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.640
 Captain Joshua Slocum the first man to sail single-handed round the world

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:14.040
 Who dropped in there on in 1898 and he sailed the whole way around the world

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.640
 You may have done this before without being able to swim which is an extraordinary fact, isn't it?

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.500
 Well, I think it helps gives you more of an incentive to sail. What do you think?

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.560
 Yeah, like we've got to get back there because if we don't get that I think a lot of sailors, you know way back

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.760
 Deliberately didn't learn to swim because they they didn't want to prolong the drowning

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.520
 Really rather have a quick quick one. Yeah

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:42.320
 One of the great forges of all time Elmira de Hore he was an artist himself

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.160
 And but he wasn't a very good one. Well, he's kind of okay

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.880
 But when he showed one of his paintings to woman called Lady Malcolm Campbell, she saw her and she said oh is that a Picasso and he was like

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.680
 No, no, it's me and I can't really sell it but Picasso seems to be selling quite well

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.120
 So from now on I'm just gonna paint my stuff and pretend it's from a Picasso. Nice

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.240
 And he became really massive throughout the 40s

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.800
 He was making all sorts of these forgeries of Picasso and Matisse

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:18.840
 So he created so many Modigliani forgeries that it's still now it's impossible to compile a catalogue of Modigliani's work

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.560
 Really? Yeah, because we don't know which ones are his and which ones are the Horeys

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:30.200
 And his collection is run now and he was such a big forger that people want to see his paintings

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.880
 And it's run by a guy called Mark Forgey

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:44.680
 On the attribution of you know, who did what a Nazi officer saw Gernica when Picasso was

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.840
 There and he said did you do that and Picasso said no you did it nice

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:54.320
 His only political painting really

00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:00.760
 Really went off his paintings during this because he was obsessed with himself and drawing his women and how tortured they were

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.320
 And what horrible time they were having because he was having affairs and basically he went out with Dora Ma

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:12.440
 Who was very political she politicized him. He did Gernica. It became a huge anti-war symbol, didn't it?

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.360
 There was a painting of there was a huge sort of like

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:23.900
 Aircraft bombing of a village in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, right? By the by their allies of ashes by the Nazis and the Italians

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:29.680
 Which was in fact a birthday present sweetly from Göring to Hitler sweet, so sweet

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:38.360
 I just I wonder what were the circumstances and the situation in which Picasso replied that to a Nazi

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:44.800
 Was we talking post-war here? Are we talking like he wasn't in Nazi Germany, right?

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:50.240
 That's a pretty bold thing to say to a Nazi is all I'm saying. Well, I presumably during the war wasn't it?

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:57.660
 Occupation wild. What was the next sentence on the Nazi side because I think he was in Paris when the Nazis came into Paris

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.200
 Wasn't he I think yes, it reminds me of

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.280
 the famous story about Sigmund Freud when he was

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.960
 Asked to in order to get out of of Germany under the

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:16.600
 Nazis he was asked to sign a disclaimer saying that he hadn't been badly treated and

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.740
 He wrote I can heartily recommend the Gestapo to anyone

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.180
 Do you know which national anthem contains the word moss this is a question for Randy really?

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:36.700
 Is it a biggie Japan

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:45.160
 Anna's got it. Wow. They bloody love musto may your world go on for thousands of years until pebbles merge into one giant rock and

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.360
 Covered with moss. That's the dream

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:56.600
 In a national anthem survey 79% of Americans know the first line of the star-spangled banner

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.540
 But only 37% of Canadians know the first line to oh Canada

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:06.760
 Which is really pathetic considering the first line of oh Canada is oh Canada

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:16.040
 Can I just learn the fact tangentially terminate - one best sound effects editing in 1992?

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.040
 And I think there was this famous moment where

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.440
 T1,000 who I believe is one of the characters

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:27.960
 Goes through some metal bars and the sound effect was achieved by pouring dog food out of a can and it's it's quite cool

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:35.760
 To watch when you know that but I didn't know the director of that had such a good money-saving cheat for two separate scenes where

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.620
 The terminator all T1,000 I think can disguise himself as someone else

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:45.720
 And so you see a character looking at their reflection and then that character turns around and the reflection still looking at them

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.420
 And you realize it's T1,000. Do you know how he achieved that effect?

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.160
 With a window I'll give you a clue. Have you ever seen the film?

00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:01.440
 Yes, it's the same concept as the big reveal in that he used Arnold Schwarzenegger's twin. He used identical

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:08.120
 He used identical twins twice in this film

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:16.240
 There's an identical twin so there's Don and Dan Stanton played a character called Lewis and then T1,000 pretending to be him

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.640
 And then Linda Hamilton, who I think was a famous part in that had an identical twin called Leslie Hamilton

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:28.800
 And whenever he needed, you know, one of them to do something body-doubly, isn't it? Was he hiring actors entirely based on that way?

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.040
 Yeah

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.040
 So heads of state and cows

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:37.760
 President Taft of America kept a cow called Pauline on the White House lawn. Do you remember that?

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.520
 No, I didn't remember it. No, so I was collecting names of naming animals of odd names

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.020
 So Byron had a pet wolf called Lion

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:52.120
 Either reveal is bad right when you mean it

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.400
 Einstein had a cat called Tiger

00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:01.520
 Climbs Gustav Klint had a cat called Catskate. He said and the Times journalist Andrew Billan

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.320
 I read the other day is called he's got a cat called Vommie, which is Bode's ill, doesn't it?

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.960
 And I did I did really like this

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:15.880
 Elgar the composer spent a lot of time with the Hereford Cathedral organist dog who's called Dan

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:22.520
 Anyway, when Dan fell into the river wine swam upstream to find a landing place

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:28.760
 Somebody suggested that Elgar set the whole adventure to music and he did he said I've done it

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.760
 It was called the enigma variations

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:34.440
 Inspired by Dan the dog who fell into the river

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:42.680
 Dan I think he's just replaced you as my favorite Dan. Oh, I thought that changed long ago. Yeah. That's very cool

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.640
 I love whoever that journalist was what a billing he got to share just then out of nowhere

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:54.260
 He's a really good guy

00:37:54.260 --> 00:38:03.000
 What's Swindon famous for the Oxford United's big rivals? Yeah, I could say about the football team

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.560
 What do they make in Swindon? Dianna Dawes is famous. She's a Swindon girl and

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.800
 The mayor was introducing it once he was terribly nervous because

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.820
 Her maiden name was Dianna Fluck like Peter Fluck

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.780
 And he said it's a gentleman may introduce

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.360
 That lady used to be called Diana Clunter

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:37.760
 Alright, there you go, that is all of our outtakes

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:43.360
 If you want to write to any of us about the things that were said in this episode podcast at qi.com

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.800
 All those emails go to Andy he goes through them and some of them make their way to drop us a line of which

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.360
 There'll be another episode popping into your club fish feed in the next couple of weeks

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.560
 So do write in if you want to have yours read out on the show one

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.400
 Correction from the outtakes which we thought worth keeping in any way

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.160
 Sometimes we just tell stories out loud because someone has said something while we're on a tangent

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:12.480
 And I just wanted to add a few corrections that brilliantly funny Steve Martin story that I told earlier

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.520
 So just in case you're thinking can't wait for this episode to end

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.480
 I absolutely want to get out there and start spreading the story

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:26.360
 There's a few corrections to add about it one is that he was filming Roxanne and he did go into a bar

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.920
 However, it wasn't because it was the end of the day and he was looking for a drink

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.960
 It's because they were halfway through the filming day. He had the prosthetics on he really needed the bathroom

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.520
 There wasn't one around someone pointed him to that place

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.800
 He walked in and then the story is pretty much the same. He gets looks from all the locals

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.840
 He's thinking oh am I welcome here or not and a man walks up to him looks him up and down and says why the long face

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.320
 There you go. You can now go out into the wild and spread that hilarious story

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.000
 All right, that is it everyone

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.680
 We are gonna be back as I say with a drop us a line in a couple of weeks

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.760
 We will see you all then and hopefully some of you in Sheffield

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.640
 No such thing as a fish calm check that out and find yourself some tickets. All right guys. Take care

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.060
 Hope you all doing well. We'll speak to you soon. Goodbye

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.060
 You

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.060
 You

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.060
 You

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.060
 You

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.640
 (upbeat music)
