00:01:09,00:01:13,But for now enjoy the compilation episode. Here we go
00:01:13,00:01:15,I
00:01:15,00:01:31,Had a quick hunt by the way cuz Murray's plums
00:01:31,00:01:34,"Nice to have something named after you. Yeah, Andy"
00:01:34,00:01:38,I wanted to see if we had any other fruits that were relevant to us
00:01:38,00:01:41,The other three of us. So I found harken peaches
00:01:42,00:01:48,"Yeah, it says harken peaches now. It's Ian as opposed to iron for yeah, so harken peaches like listen peaches"
00:01:48,00:01:53,"Yeah, as I tell the harken the tail and I so I was just reading up to see if there were any similarities"
00:01:53,00:01:55,So I found someone who actually
00:01:55,00:02:01,Farms them and they say that normally harken trees are pretty finicky producers
00:02:01,00:02:07,"Okay, I'm a finicky producer when it comes to TV production. Yeah, you're covered in a lovely soft fuzz"
00:02:08,00:02:10,I
00:02:10,00:02:19,"Know you you don't have a toshinsky, but you have an Anna which is an Anna's apple, which is Anna Bolin's"
00:02:19,00:02:31,Let's not make assumptions. That's a leap. That's a leap. I'm not really maybe named after her head
00:02:31,00:02:36,Well in some of the photos it is quite a flat apple. They didn't take photos at the time
00:02:36,00:02:39,What oh right of the apple?
00:02:39,00:02:44,"In some photos there's different shapes to it. So yeah, I got excited"
00:02:44,00:02:50,"Two of ambulance homes in the last month ambulance following me around at the moment. No, you're following her around"
00:02:50,00:03:00,"These other detectors, okay like the weird ways people have tried to detect neutrinos because lots of countries have got their own ones around the place"
00:03:00,00:03:06,"So there's one in Japan, which is a tank of 50,000 tons of ultra pure water under a mountain"
00:03:06,00:03:11,That's called the super cameo candy and scientists have to get rafts around the surface of this
00:03:11,00:03:15,What on the ultra pure water? They were around on it. I shot that clean the rafts before they go in
00:03:15,00:03:22,"They probably have one of those little, you know a little puddle of clean water that you walk through so that you don't get verucous"
00:03:22,00:03:26,"Yeah, definitely, and they'll have a pool robot on the inside just getting anything else"
00:03:26,00:03:29,A guy with his top off in a long net
00:03:32,00:03:40,Then there was the first detector built in the 60s by Raymond Davis Jr. And John Buckle was a tank with half a million litres of dry cleaning fluid in it
00:03:40,00:03:44,"Oh, yeah, what yeah, it has more uses I guess"
00:03:44,00:03:49,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know if I know what dry you mean like washing fluid"
00:03:49,00:03:54,It's a it's a chemical you use isn't it? I can't remember what it's called now
00:03:54,00:04:00,Never been to dry cleaners wouldn't know but cool glad it's got another even better application. Absolutely. Yeah
00:04:00,00:04:03,That's really cool. And there's one called dune in America
00:04:03,00:04:13,"It's underground it is underground like the worms, but there are two detectors 800 miles apart one is pointing at the other one"
00:04:13,00:04:20,"You know plums have stones in them. Yeah, they're unique to the species that stone"
00:04:20,00:04:25,You know all the like the little bumps and stuff that you get in them like a fingerprint like a fingerprint
00:04:25,00:04:27,"So, you know, which plum has burgled you"
00:04:28,00:04:34,"What do you mean unique to the species sorry so if you get a little plum stone, yeah, it's got loads of wrinkles on it"
00:04:34,00:04:38,"Yeah, and you have a book which has all the different patterns"
00:04:38,00:04:44,You'll be able to tell which species of plum it comes from or which variety why we matches the same dense in the stone
00:04:44,00:04:49,"Yeah, exactly. And so in the Marie Rose ship"
00:04:49,00:04:55,We sank when 16th century and then they raised it in when up 20th century
00:04:56,00:05:02,They found all these stones all these plum stones and they could tell exactly what species they were and they went
00:05:02,00:05:05,Or what variety they were and they went back to the national fruit
00:05:05,00:05:08,Center which I think we might have mentioned before
00:05:08,00:05:13,"Yes, I checked it against modern fruits and they could see exactly what they were. Oh my goodness"
00:05:13,00:05:17,That's insane. That is why they share fingerprints
00:05:17,00:05:21,So if you're one species of plum then you can blame the burglary on your mate
00:05:21,00:05:27,Who's the same species because you've left the same pretty. It's almost like every family would have the same or something like that
00:05:27,00:05:30,Professor plum
00:05:30,00:05:35,"Yeah, so"
00:05:35,00:05:38,Plums blue gold they're called in Serbia. Yeah
00:05:38,00:05:44,They have 40 million plum trees and at least three plum festivals every year in Serbia
00:05:44,00:05:47,And if you have
00:05:50,00:05:54,Serbian drink the national drink and that's plum flavored usually
00:05:54,00:05:59,"Oh, God, is that is that the thing they give you at the free at the end of every meal whenever you go to one of those countries?"
00:05:59,00:06:04,"Yeah, if you're in like Serbia Montenegro some parts of Bosnia and"
00:06:04,00:06:11,"They give you that have it because if you don't you're insulting them, but you're gonna regret it the next like all of those things"
00:06:11,00:06:16,"Where it claims to be favored with X but it tastes like petrol like yeah, it tastes really strong quite chemical"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"Yeah, there's often a thing where I don't know if this is your experience"
00:06:19,00:06:24,But where if you're there with someone of the opposite sex in my experience
00:06:24,00:06:30,My wife would be given a reasonably nice spirit and I would be given something. It was absolute lighter
00:06:30,00:06:38,Slightly bloke a thing to get and she's got a little bit of plum brandy or something and I'm just drinking pure diesel
00:06:38,00:06:43,I must admit whenever I've been with Serbians and the slivovics has come out
00:06:43,00:06:47,"Usually everyone's getting involved. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah"
00:06:48,00:06:50,They must think of you as particularly manly
00:06:50,00:06:56,What they've seen my plans
00:06:56,00:07:01,The Venice in general is a I didn't I had no idea how it's built
00:07:01,00:07:05,So I knew it was Laguni. I knew it's in the middle of a lagoon
00:07:05,00:07:10,"I knew that sort of you know, and there wasn't a road or rail link until the middle of the 19th century"
00:07:10,00:07:14,"Yeah, but it was built what I didn't know is that it is how it's on stills"
00:07:14,00:07:18,So every building is built on these wooden poles
00:07:18,00:07:25,"Which have been driven down into the sediment and if you drive down enough poles, it's like nine or ten per square meter"
00:07:25,00:07:27,You can just put stone on top of that and it all
00:07:27,00:07:37,"Here's the church of San Marco required 10,000 oak trees to be put into converted into poles for one church"
00:07:37,00:07:41,It's a big church the whole of Venice must be way even more than that
00:07:41,00:07:46,"It's millions. Yeah, millions and millions of these poles. It's like they say it's an inverted forest"
00:07:46,00:07:51,"It's so cool. And this was literally 1500 years ago, wasn't it? I mean, this is in the fifth century or whatever"
00:07:51,00:07:54,Which is extraordinary that they were able to do that
00:07:54,00:07:59,"I think and the good thing is because they're underwater and they're all underwater, right?"
00:07:59,00:08:03,"So you've got the the rocks on top, but the poles themselves never go above the water"
00:08:03,00:08:06,And that means they don't rot because there's no oxygen to make them rock
00:08:07,00:08:12,So they stay on the water and they're still now the ones from 1500 years ago is still good
00:08:12,00:08:14,They're not they're not kind of falling apart. It's amazing
00:08:14,00:08:21,And there was a job the batty Pali the pile hitters that was their job was to pound pound the piles into the ground
00:08:21,00:08:24,You need a big hammer for that. Don't you? How are you doing that?
00:08:24,00:08:28,What you do I didn't often work experience on a farm once and I had to
00:08:28,00:08:34,When you're building a fence you have this big metal drum which is open at one end and it's got two handles
00:08:34,00:08:37,"It's like a milk churn, basically, but you put it upside down"
00:08:37,00:08:42,You put it over the steak you're banging into the ground a steak banging and you just lift it up and bang down
00:08:42,00:08:46,It goes it's such hard work and water that must be really difficult with a whole sort of tree
00:08:46,00:08:49,You basically you've got to be so strong. You've got to be so strong
00:08:49,00:08:55,"Yeah, yeah, and they had their traditional song which was all about venison its glory and death to the Turks like good traditional stuff"
00:08:55,00:08:59,"And even now in Venice, there's a phrase nattista. They're about the pie"
00:08:59,00:09:03,Which means a head that is good to pound down the piles. Are you a bit thick?
00:09:03,00:09:05,"You know, nice"
00:09:05,00:09:09,And now we're gonna talk about why you only lasted an afternoon of work experience on that farm
00:09:09,00:09:16,"Yeah, I was slated for a seven-year contract of steak banging, but I got tired. It's really hard work"
00:09:16,00:09:23,"Um, you know George Foreman's grill. Yeah most famous grill of all time. It's shifted like over a hundred million units"
00:09:23,00:09:27,"Is it a barbecue? No, no, it's like it's a grill you sort of you a toasty maker"
00:09:27,00:09:30,It's like it's like it is like what it's like it looks exactly like one
00:09:30,00:09:36,But it's for meats and it's and it's positioned on an angle so that all of the juices sort of run down and away
00:09:36,00:09:43,"So it's yeah, I miss and he's made more he made because he's passed away now more money off the back of that than his entire"
00:09:43,00:09:49,Boxing career by substantial amount. He's made like between 200 and 500 million off of it because he was getting 40% of the deal
00:09:49,00:09:52,But most people mistook him as the creator of it
00:09:52,00:09:57,"But in fact, it was this brilliant innovator who was called Michael Bohm who was the person who started it"
00:09:57,00:10:02,He went to George Foreman and Hulk Hogan to say which one of you could do it
00:10:02,00:10:06,"Oh, he went to the same agent who had both of them. Yeah, Foreman got it in the end"
00:10:06,00:10:09,And but this guy no one believed him that he invented it
00:10:09,00:10:15,So he used to walk around with the patent on to him any time that someone said you're not the inventor
00:10:15,00:10:18,He was a am I not have a look at my patients talking to him at a party
00:10:18,00:10:24,T-shirt saying I invented the George Foreman grill is making is deterring me
00:10:25,00:10:27,He's not talking to you at a party
00:10:27,00:10:35,"Yeah, meet her on Francois meet her on recent one. Yeah, very recent. He had a wife"
00:10:35,00:10:37,But he also had a mistress in the dark
00:10:37,00:10:43,He basically lived a double life and it was his wife Danielle who insisted that it was kept secret from the press and
00:10:43,00:10:46,"basically the press all knew about it, but they"
00:10:46,00:10:52,Like decided they wouldn't print anything that ultra the ultra conservative about exposing their leaders
00:10:53,00:10:56,They really are they're very very cautious about it
00:10:56,00:10:59,They are I suppose that it's weird because they're conservative about that
00:10:59,00:11:03,But they are much more liberal as we famously know about relationships
00:11:03,00:11:07,So meter on situation was so interesting before he became president
00:11:07,00:11:13,He lived in a house with his wife and his wife's lover who has like just had a separate room in their house
00:11:13,00:11:15,And when he became president
00:11:20,00:11:26,But he when he did become president they like his staff moved to the woman and who he was having this affair with into a house
00:11:26,00:11:27,It was nice and near him
00:11:27,00:11:33,So he could go and sit there all the time and they employed a guy to make sure that no one printed anything about them
00:11:33,00:11:37,So there was this guy called Francois de Grosse of
00:11:37,00:11:43,And whenever any journalists sort of sniffed around said we're gonna do an article about this separate life
00:11:43,00:11:47,You have at one stage they got a journalist and kidnapped him and locked him in the cellar for a week saying
00:11:49,00:11:51,And then it's like it's a bigger story
00:11:51,00:11:56,"Yeah, and then in 2021 it turned out that he wasn't living a double life after all he was living a triple life"
00:11:56,00:12:01,And there was another woman called Claire who was 50 years his junior
00:12:01,00:12:04,Who that he was having an affair with the whole time as well
00:12:04,00:12:06,I actually think he was having lots of shags along the way
00:12:06,00:12:11,"But yeah, Claire again, it was it's so interesting. It's just like very different"
00:12:11,00:12:13,Standards that I can't judge
00:12:13,00:12:18,So she Claire had followed him for four years from when she was 18 to when she was 22
00:12:18,00:12:25,"Yeah, and then eventually invited him around her house and they had basically what seems like quite a nice relationship for the last 10 years of his life"
00:12:25,00:12:32,"Alongside his marriage, right? It's one interpretation and then other people could say that it wasn't appropriate"
00:12:32,00:12:36,"Yeah, you could say that there's a massive massive power imbalance. You could say that yes"
00:12:36,00:12:42,Although she's definitely more physically able and the staff all said it was great because she could go on official visits with him
00:12:42,00:12:47,And because she was so young even in France no one suspected that they were together
00:12:47,00:12:50,So she used to accompany him brilliant in many ways the perfect crime
00:12:50,00:12:54,I want to stress the word Christ
00:12:54,00:13:03,But all of this stuff about method acting and the method I love it all goes back to Stanislavski
00:13:03,00:13:06,"Yes, the Russian guy Russian acting coach"
00:13:06,00:13:07,Yeah
00:13:07,00:13:13,Constant in Stanislavski and he founded this realistic acting stuff and the problem all acting was very unrealistic on film
00:13:13,00:13:18,Because it was silent film so you have to have big theatrical gestures and movements and and theater as well
00:13:18,00:13:23,"You would exactly yeah, and you can't and then it all changes when the close-up is invented"
00:13:23,00:13:25,Suddenly you zoom right in on someone's face and they're going
00:13:25,00:13:29,They look like they're overacting
00:13:29,00:13:32,Crazily and so you have to then you could do the less is more school
00:13:32,00:13:39,"But and Stanislavski founded this sort of realistic acting. Yeah, and you would go in and you'd be an actor in Stanislavski's"
00:13:39,00:13:42,Moscow theater and
00:13:42,00:13:46,"You would do your lines, and he would just go I don't believe you and you do them again"
00:13:46,00:13:49,He go I don't believe you I don't believe you I don't believe you
00:13:49,00:13:52,And you just say that again and again and again until it was right
00:13:52,00:13:54,That's genuinely flashback to my clown school days
00:13:54,00:14:00,What you're doing and they won't let you go but Stanislavski in fairness he walked the walk
00:14:00,00:14:05,So he did that method himself and whenever he was acting a part
00:14:05,00:14:10,He would go for a walk in the altar like he had a big sort of theater in Crimea
00:14:10,00:14:13,And he would go for a walk in his character every single morning
00:14:13,00:14:15,Everyone would laugh at him and point at him
00:14:15,00:14:19,But he didn't really mind because he was just trying to get into character. I really respect the lack of
00:14:19,00:14:24,"Social fear yeah, you have to have to do that like Daniel A. Lewis just having the guts to do it"
00:14:24,00:14:27,And I really liked the fact I thought he was a bit of a dick for doing it
00:14:27,00:14:29,But then you read interviews and he said he does it for fun
00:14:29,00:14:34,Which I can really empathize with is like he says I do it to play also if the director saying yeah
00:14:34,00:14:36,We'll pay for you to like live in Prague and learn check
00:14:40,00:14:44,But you know the fate the famous story and the great story about method acting I found something out about that
00:14:44,00:14:47,You know the Dustin Hoffman Laurence Olivier tale
00:14:47,00:14:52,Which is that when they were filming Marathon Man with Dustin Hoffman in the 80s was it and
00:14:52,00:14:58,Dustin Hoffman staggers in one day and there's one bit of Marathon Man where the lead character the Dustin Hoffman is playing
00:14:58,00:15:03,It has to have been a wake for three days straight and he staggers in and says to Laurence Olivier
00:15:03,00:15:07,I've stayed awake for three days preparing for this character
00:15:07,00:15:12,I feel like absolute shit and he's haggling his hairs all over the place and Laurence Olivier just turned him
00:15:12,00:15:16,"Put his hand on his shoulder and said my dear, why don't you try acting?"
00:15:16,00:15:23,Anyway famous story famous Dustin Hoffman has said he wasn't actually doing it to prepare
00:15:23,00:15:25,He'd just been out on the booze for three nights straight
00:15:25,00:15:31,"Okay, and I think they maybe he's trying to sound cool now because he said he comes across as the loser in that story"
00:15:31,00:15:37,Whereas Laurence Olivier is the aloof. It was also dead. So there's no you can't come back and say he's lying
00:15:37,00:15:41,"Exactly, I love there's a story which is sort of method acting"
00:15:41,00:15:46,"Steve Martin when he did Roxanne the movie. He has a giant nose, right Pinocchio long"
00:15:46,00:15:49,They were in a small town and they were filming and he finished a day really needed a drink
00:15:49,00:15:53,So it takes a long time to take the prosthetic off. So he's like I'm just going for a drink
00:15:53,00:15:57,But then he sort of got cold feet while he was out kind of got this giant nose
00:15:57,00:16:00,I'm gonna walk into a bar. No one knows really who I am out here and
00:16:00,00:16:04,He gets into a bar and it does the classic piano stops playing
00:16:05,00:16:09,Everyone turns around and he's freaking out thinking. Oh girl. What am I doing?
00:16:09,00:16:13,I'm gonna get my ass kicked walks up to the bar and a gruesome looking dude
00:16:13,00:16:15,According to him walks up to him and says hey
00:16:15,00:16:18,Why the long face?
00:16:18,00:16:21,Come on great a story
00:16:21,00:16:24,It's better on paper
00:16:24,00:16:32,"Avant de Gaulle, she's an interesting character. Charles de Gaulle's wife exactly. Yeah, so she was the first lady of France and"
00:16:32,00:16:37,She there was a story that while sort of his retirement was imminent
00:16:37,00:16:41,She was at Buckingham Palace and I guess asked her what are you most looking forward to in your retirement?
00:16:41,00:16:44,She said a penis
00:16:44,00:16:47,"I mean, it's almost the origin of that joke"
00:16:47,00:16:53,"She was saying happiness, but it was oh god, and then Steve Martin walked in"
00:16:58,00:17:02,"History's jokes, but but um, yeah, she's a very interesting character"
00:17:02,00:17:05,She while we're talking about censorship as the top bit of this fact
00:17:05,00:17:12,She was very much against things like displays of nudity and sex and tried to have things past so that they wouldn't be shown in public
00:17:12,00:17:19,Mini skirts were a problem for her as well. She wanted the lengthening of a skirt to have to actually be legally a certain length
00:17:19,00:17:23,"And then there's this amazing thing, you know, there was an assassination attempt on"
00:17:24,00:17:27,"On shot. Oh, well, there was one of both of them. I mean he was one of the most almost"
00:17:27,00:17:32,So 1962 they get ambushed while they're in their car and it's machine gun fire
00:17:32,00:17:37,They both survive her first words after she got out of the car were a penis
00:17:37,00:17:43,Please cut out the earlier reference
00:17:48,00:17:56,The first question was how are my chickens and it's because she just bought some chickens in jelly at some fare at some
00:17:56,00:18:04,That still was more concerned to her machine gun bullets might have absolutely
00:18:04,00:18:07,They're in the boot of the car. Yeah
00:18:07,00:18:10,What could have happened like even if your chicken gets shot by a bullet?
00:18:10,00:18:14,"Maybe the rare chickens that you only get out at one fair once a year, you know, I get it"
00:18:14,00:18:18,Fair enough. I'll be your question to the cockle van
00:18:18,00:18:20,more like cockle boot
00:18:20,00:18:27,Driving in a van with an A. There you go. Yes. There's a joke in that somewhere. Absolutely
00:18:27,00:18:30,Mongolia barbecue is quite cool. It's called boo dog
00:18:30,00:18:35,What you do is you take your right in the dog and leaps into the fire
00:18:35,00:18:41,"Bobs your uncle. I think if you told the dog about this, they get frightened. So you get your animal"
00:18:41,00:18:46,Let's say it's a marmot and you cut it open from its head to its groin slice it right down
00:18:46,00:18:51,You take out all the insides you season them and then you stuff them back in again
00:18:51,00:18:54,Oh with stones and veggies and you put it over a fire
00:18:54,00:19:00,And you just leave it over the fire for ages and ages and then you cut bring it out and you eat all the insides and
00:19:00,00:19:07,The stones are now really really hot and you pass them around the group everyone gets to hold the stones in their hand
00:19:07,00:19:09,"Well, I was gonna ask you that"
00:19:10,00:19:11,Oh
00:19:11,00:19:13,Why would you want to do that?
00:19:13,00:19:19,"That's quite cold in Mongolia. It does at times. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, this is more put on your hand"
00:19:19,00:19:24,"It's like a hot plate just keeps it. Oh, yeah, good call. Apparently it's supposed to help against stress"
00:19:24,00:19:27,"Okay, very hot stones. I feel stressed"
00:19:27,00:19:32,How fast is the fastest submarine
00:19:35,00:19:42,"Give it an MPH if you want this is the underwater sea record also, and I'll say 50. Oh"
00:19:42,00:19:49,"Yeah, that's some 50 miles an hour. It's gonna say 200. I'm so less. There's a lot of water resistance, isn't there?"
00:19:49,00:19:54,"And they're so big and fat. I'm gonna say 30. Okay. No, that's mad 40"
00:19:54,00:19:59,Andy is the closest but he's absolutely miles away. It's 51.4
00:19:59,00:20:02,I
00:20:02,00:20:10,Think Glenkeen the little mermaid illustrator. There's something interesting about him. He is similar to one of us. Oh
00:20:10,00:20:15,"He has something that one of us have really loves his wife. No, it's not them"
00:20:15,00:20:27,"No, you two have James and Anna. Oh, okay, a Bolton accent. It's not Anna"
00:20:27,00:20:31,A superiority complex
00:20:31,00:20:39,"Um, it's that he can't picture things in his mind's eye"
00:20:39,00:20:45,"He has a illustrator. He has a Fantasia. Oh, Fantasia is another Disney film. Oh, sorry"
00:20:45,00:20:47,Is he is mind-blind?
00:20:47,00:20:52,He has to draw things because he can't see them in his mind. So literally every time he thinks he has to draw it
00:20:52,00:20:56,"No, it's not but he makes it very difficult to draw things"
00:20:56,00:20:59,Can I say if it's Asia was really hard because you can't imagine it before you put it on paper?
00:21:00,00:21:05,So you start drawing stuff and then halfway through you're like this is nothing like what it's supposed to be
00:21:05,00:21:08,That's exactly right. And he says the same thing. They're not drawing from memory
00:21:08,00:21:11,They're creating so they have to scribble tweak until they have what they want
00:21:11,00:21:16,But he's he's one of the best animators ever. He's from the the new golden age of animation
00:21:16,00:21:20,He drew the beast from Beauty and the Beast. So it can't be that hard James. I mean
00:21:20,00:21:23,This guy's drawing the best
00:21:29,00:21:33,Can we talk about the the little mermaid in Copenhagen sure thing
00:21:33,00:21:40,"So there's a statue of the little mermaid in Copenhagen, which I think is one of the most suffering statues of all time, right?"
00:21:40,00:21:44,"So, yeah, she's she's in the harbor. She's sitting on a rock. She's beautiful"
00:21:44,00:21:50,"She's washing her hair or something whatever, but she's hands Christian Anderson's little mermaid because that's his original story"
00:21:50,00:21:54,"Which is very different. It's a bit more gruesome in the ending. You know, it's not quite as Disney-ish, but it's you know"
00:21:54,00:21:56,It's a classic fairy tale
00:21:56,00:22:01,"Anyway, this statue has been absolutely through the ring. All right, she was decapitated in 1964 and"
00:22:01,00:22:04,1998 her right arm was cut off in the 80s
00:22:04,00:22:09,She was partially decapitated in 1990 in 2003. She was blown up with dynamite
00:22:09,00:22:13,This statue has just had it people haven't go at this statue all the time
00:22:13,00:22:17,"I think it's exciting. Oh, just because she's so famous. She's such an icon. Well, it's all sorts of reasons"
00:22:17,00:22:21,So what there was one group of radical feminists who claimed
00:22:22,00:22:26,That they had done it to sort of point out to create a simple
00:22:26,00:22:32,They claimed they're kind of a head to create a symbol of the sexually fixated and male misogynist dream of women as being bodies without heads
00:22:32,00:22:34,I point well made I think
00:22:34,00:22:38,Didn't they then find that actually they didn't have enough evidence and they probably didn't do it
00:22:38,00:22:43,"So they set a murder squad on the case which I love, you know, they all like every single time she's been defaced"
00:22:43,00:22:45,They get the murders
00:22:47,00:22:54,But basically in 1990 an anonymous tip tip-off guy rang up a TV camera man
00:22:54,00:22:57,Freelance TV camera man called Michael Poulsen and said go and check out the Little Mermaid's head
00:22:57,00:23:03,It's gone and he got to the scene of the crime and though two people apparently roller skating away saying too late and
00:23:03,00:23:10,Then on day four the head turned up and it was returned by a masked figure to a TV station
00:23:10,00:23:16,And the return happened to be filmed by a freelance TV camera man called Michael Poulsen
00:23:16,00:23:23,who was the one who got the original beheading scoop and he made lots of money selling both sets of shots and he was arrested as
00:23:23,00:23:28,Having maybe and doing it himself and did he get found guilty or he was released
00:23:28,00:23:31,He was questioned and then released so it wasn't him in the end
00:23:31,00:23:35,But it was thought that the whole thing would be done as a kind of thing to get some PR
00:23:35,00:23:41,"But that wasn't it. No, I don't know if they got the 1991. Is it hard to decapitate a statue? Oh, yeah"
00:23:41,00:23:46,"So that's a lot of that bronze is hard to bronze is hard. Yeah, I'm surprised that they managed to do it"
00:23:46,00:23:50,"Yeah, it seems to have just been hacked sword off every time whenever I've been there"
00:23:50,00:23:54,There's always a lot of tourists nearby so like you'd have to do in the middle of a night or something
00:23:54,00:24:01,"Yeah, I think they do. Yeah, I think it was exciting for her because biggest statue must be mostly so boring"
00:24:01,00:24:05,There was an article in 2017 written in June and said literally by June that year
00:24:05,00:24:11,"She'd already Warner Birker held a sex toy and been covered in paint twice. I mean, what a gig"
00:24:11,00:24:16,"Yeah, unless you're a racist as a statue, you see no action basically"
00:24:16,00:24:21,"But she's not she's not racist. No, no, no, but I'm just saying the only other stat"
00:24:21,00:24:27,"Yes, arguably I don't know what people's motivation was but probably when she was wearing a Birker holding a sex toy"
00:24:27,00:24:31,She was racist at that moment. I don't know. I don't know. She was doing them both at the same time
00:24:31,00:24:33,I don't know if that makes it better
00:24:33,00:24:35,Is she complicit to
00:24:37,00:24:44,"You know the Millennium dome. Yeah, man, think of it from above, right? Yeah, what does it look circle like a yeah"
00:24:44,00:24:48,What else does it feature some like there's like some wires that go down to that?
00:24:48,00:24:52,"Yes, there's that and you can actually walk over the top of it now"
00:24:52,00:24:56,It's a cool tourist thing you can do. There's a massive hole in the side of the Millennium dome
00:24:56,00:25:04,"That no one ever talks about okay, and what it is is it's got it's a huge tower like a ventilation tower for the"
00:25:04,00:25:08,Blackwall tunnel which runs under London and they needed to have a vent tower
00:25:08,00:25:11,No way they said but that's where we want to build the Millennium dome
00:25:11,00:25:12,"They said well, sorry"
00:25:12,00:25:17,That's where our big towers going and it's just in the middle of the Millennium dome and they convinced them by saying don't worry
00:25:17,00:25:18,No one will notice
00:25:18,00:25:22,It turns out you're the first person to notice. We just not pay attention to it. Look at it
00:25:22,00:25:24,It's got a massive hole in the top
00:25:24,00:25:29,"That's really weird. This big tunnel in Norway has a ventilation. Oh, yeah, this net"
00:25:29,00:25:36,"Yeah, I think halfway through we mentioned in the podcast few weeks ago that you need to have these big fans in tunnels to make sure that the"
00:25:36,00:25:40,Air goes through but not just Andy standing in every tunnel saying
00:25:40,00:25:51,But the one in Norway it comes out and like the top of a mountain somewhere
00:25:51,00:25:55,"I tried to find out on Google Maps and I could find the area, but I couldn't see the the hole"
00:25:56,00:25:58,With a big cork
00:25:58,00:26:03,I was thinking exactly the same thing well done and going one step further
00:26:03,00:26:07,I think what a cool film or adventure to go in there and crawl all the way through
00:26:07,00:26:11,But when the Great Western Railway was built
00:26:11,00:26:16,There's quite a lot of tunnels there and there's a guy called Dionysus Lardner who said
00:26:16,00:26:24,"I mean, they knew how to name babies in those days"
00:26:25,00:26:30,But he said that if you put any train in a tunnel as long as like say let's say the box tunnel
00:26:30,00:26:33,Which is one of the big ones in the Great Western Railway
00:26:33,00:26:39,They said that the train would use up so much oxygen when it was moving that there wouldn't be anything for the passengers to breathe
00:26:39,00:26:41,And then one would just die
00:26:41,00:26:46,What and he was he saying that he was saying that and he isn't right about those tunnels
00:26:46,00:26:50,"But he is right that you do need a lot of ventilation in those tunnels. Yeah, yeah tough gig"
00:26:52,00:26:56,And I do our tunnel that there's a sort of railway legend about
00:26:56,00:27:02,Which was this was designed by is embarking on Brunel. It was in the 19th century
00:27:02,00:27:08,"It is the box tunnel near bath. Do you know that time? That's one I just mentioned. Oh, okay. Sorry. All right, so"
00:27:08,00:27:11,This was built
00:27:11,00:27:18,With an idea that it was done deliberately so that light would shine from one end to the other through right?
00:27:18,00:27:23,It's like one of these big legends because first beyond his birthday is meant to be on his birthday
00:27:23,00:27:31,And the idea was not really confirmed until 200 years later when it was shut down and they were able to properly look through it on a morning
00:27:31,00:27:36,"I don't think it's been confirmed that it's for sure like that was the reason. Oh, no"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"No, exactly, but the but the legend that the Sun would be seen on either side of the tunnel"
00:27:40,00:27:43,It was a thing and that was done because it was said it was
00:27:43,00:27:50,"Architecturally built so that it would do that on the birthday of Brunel and that was the 9th of April, which is today"
00:27:50,00:27:57,We asked the railway company once if we could go and film it
00:27:57,00:28:03,"Oh, really for qi and they said for some reason they would stop the entire rail network just so we"
00:28:03,00:28:08,They stop it a lot of the time anyway for much worse reasons
00:28:09,00:28:14,"And is it that if you hold the prism in the right place, it shows you where the Ark of the Covenant is buried"
00:28:14,00:28:17,"Yes, yeah, yeah, so we need to find it before the Nazis do"
00:28:17,00:28:22,This I'm just jumping back to this submarine that went around the world
00:28:22,00:28:28,It was a pretty amazing like the psychology of what do you do when you keep people for 60 days?
00:28:28,00:28:34,Which is roughly how long they were under they had psychologists on board to monitor that and work out what was going on
00:28:34,00:28:39,They did things like make people quit smoking because everyone was smoking up until recently
00:28:39,00:28:45,"It's only been banned smoking on submarines. So yeah, so they they did days of testing psychologically"
00:28:45,00:28:50,What does it do when you stop smoking? It did bad things. Everyone was really irritable
00:28:50,00:28:53,So they allowed them to start smoking again
00:28:53,00:28:58,They treated it a bit like a bit of a sightseeing tour the whole of the trip
00:28:58,00:29:03,So anytime they got near land the periscope would go up and everyone was allowed a turn of just having a look
00:29:03,00:29:06,They got to Easter Island and everyone had a good old look
00:29:06,00:29:09,They pulled up to certain islands
00:29:09,00:29:14,Whereas some of the members on board had family living there and asked them to out like locate the house on the shore
00:29:14,00:29:18,So one guy actually spotted his mom and dad's house through the periscope
00:29:18,00:29:22,"Yeah, and I think that's why this guy this Filipino guy found them"
00:29:22,00:29:28,Wasn't it because they take him the same route as Ferdinand Magellan did when he went around the world
00:29:28,00:29:34,And at one stage they saw that they were near like a statue of Magellan or something
00:29:34,00:29:37,And so they put the periscope up up so everyone could see the statue and that's where he was
00:29:37,00:29:42,There's one detail where his story wasn't believed or so we're told
00:29:42,00:29:46,Because this happened to have happened on April Fool's Day
00:29:46,00:29:48,And so when he came back and said I saw a sea monster
00:29:48,00:29:53,"And I was like, okay, yeah, sure thing. Nice one. You wouldn't believe it"
00:29:53,00:29:57,"You know, would you believe it every other day of the year someone comes to me say they've seen a sea monster"
00:29:57,00:30:01,"There's like literally no day of the year except maybe Christmas is a present to them that I say, oh, yeah, really cool"
00:30:01,00:30:07,"Yeah, probably April Fool's Day is the one day where you go. Okay. Well, that's just too obvious to be an April Fool's"
00:30:07,00:30:10,It must be true. Yeah
00:30:10,00:30:17,Ascension Island was an absolutely key part of the Falklands War wasn't it? They use his staging post
00:30:17,00:30:23,"Oh, was it? Yeah, because that's one of the three. There are three islands aren't they? Ascension Tristan de Cunha and"
00:30:23,00:30:31,The UK took over Ascension Island when Napoleon was in St. Helena because they thought that
00:30:31,00:30:39,"Yeah, he might escape. Yeah, it's a very convenient only 2,000 mile away hop, skip and a jump to save Napoleon and we can't let it happen"
00:30:39,00:30:44,It's lots given that it's so remote so many people visited it
00:30:44,00:30:50,"For example, the guy who discovered it was a Portuguese called Juan de Nova"
00:30:51,00:30:54,Who's known for some reason in St. Helena as John Newcastle and
00:30:54,00:31:02,He was on his way to India on the and one of the crewmen on his voyage was a marigo Vespucci after whom America is named
00:31:02,00:31:04,"Oh, really? And then there's"
00:31:04,00:31:08,Captain Joshua Slocum the first man to sail single-handed round the world
00:31:08,00:31:14,Who dropped in there on in 1898 and he sailed the whole way around the world
00:31:14,00:31:17,"You may have done this before without being able to swim which is an extraordinary fact, isn't it?"
00:31:18,00:31:22,"Well, I think it helps gives you more of an incentive to sail. What do you think?"
00:31:22,00:31:27,"Yeah, like we've got to get back there because if we don't get that I think a lot of sailors, you know way back"
00:31:27,00:31:31,Deliberately didn't learn to swim because they they didn't want to prolong the drowning
00:31:31,00:31:35,Really rather have a quick quick one. Yeah
00:31:35,00:31:42,One of the great forges of all time Elmira de Hore he was an artist himself
00:31:42,00:31:46,"And but he wasn't a very good one. Well, he's kind of okay"
00:31:46,00:31:53,"But when he showed one of his paintings to woman called Lady Malcolm Campbell, she saw her and she said oh is that a Picasso and he was like"
00:31:53,00:31:58,"No, no, it's me and I can't really sell it but Picasso seems to be selling quite well"
00:31:58,00:32:03,So from now on I'm just gonna paint my stuff and pretend it's from a Picasso. Nice
00:32:03,00:32:07,And he became really massive throughout the 40s
00:32:07,00:32:10,He was making all sorts of these forgeries of Picasso and Matisse
00:32:11,00:32:18,So he created so many Modigliani forgeries that it's still now it's impossible to compile a catalogue of Modigliani's work
00:32:18,00:32:23,"Really? Yeah, because we don't know which ones are his and which ones are the Horeys"
00:32:23,00:32:30,And his collection is run now and he was such a big forger that people want to see his paintings
00:32:30,00:32:32,And it's run by a guy called Mark Forgey
00:32:37,00:32:44,"On the attribution of you know, who did what a Nazi officer saw Gernica when Picasso was"
00:32:44,00:32:49,There and he said did you do that and Picasso said no you did it nice
00:32:49,00:32:54,His only political painting really
00:32:54,00:33:00,Really went off his paintings during this because he was obsessed with himself and drawing his women and how tortured they were
00:33:00,00:33:05,And what horrible time they were having because he was having affairs and basically he went out with Dora Ma
00:33:05,00:33:12,"Who was very political she politicized him. He did Gernica. It became a huge anti-war symbol, didn't it?"
00:33:12,00:33:15,There was a painting of there was a huge sort of like
00:33:15,00:33:23,"Aircraft bombing of a village in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, right? By the by their allies of ashes by the Nazis and the Italians"
00:33:23,00:33:29,"Which was in fact a birthday present sweetly from Göring to Hitler sweet, so sweet"
00:33:32,00:33:38,I just I wonder what were the circumstances and the situation in which Picasso replied that to a Nazi
00:33:38,00:33:44,"Was we talking post-war here? Are we talking like he wasn't in Nazi Germany, right?"
00:33:44,00:33:50,"That's a pretty bold thing to say to a Nazi is all I'm saying. Well, I presumably during the war wasn't it?"
00:33:50,00:33:57,Occupation wild. What was the next sentence on the Nazi side because I think he was in Paris when the Nazis came into Paris
00:33:57,00:34:01,"Wasn't he I think yes, it reminds me of"
00:34:02,00:34:05,the famous story about Sigmund Freud when he was
00:34:05,00:34:10,Asked to in order to get out of of Germany under the
00:34:10,00:34:16,Nazis he was asked to sign a disclaimer saying that he hadn't been badly treated and
00:34:16,00:34:20,He wrote I can heartily recommend the Gestapo to anyone
00:34:26,00:34:31,Do you know which national anthem contains the word moss this is a question for Randy really?
00:34:31,00:34:36,Is it a biggie Japan
00:34:36,00:34:45,Anna's got it. Wow. They bloody love musto may your world go on for thousands of years until pebbles merge into one giant rock and
00:34:45,00:34:47,Covered with moss. That's the dream
00:34:50,00:34:56,In a national anthem survey 79% of Americans know the first line of the star-spangled banner
00:34:56,00:35:01,But only 37% of Canadians know the first line to oh Canada
00:35:01,00:35:06,Which is really pathetic considering the first line of oh Canada is oh Canada
00:35:06,00:35:16,Can I just learn the fact tangentially terminate - one best sound effects editing in 1992?
00:35:16,00:35:18,And I think there was this famous moment where
00:35:18,00:35:21,"T1,000 who I believe is one of the characters"
00:35:21,00:35:27,Goes through some metal bars and the sound effect was achieved by pouring dog food out of a can and it's it's quite cool
00:35:27,00:35:35,To watch when you know that but I didn't know the director of that had such a good money-saving cheat for two separate scenes where
00:35:35,00:35:39,"The terminator all T1,000 I think can disguise himself as someone else"
00:35:39,00:35:45,And so you see a character looking at their reflection and then that character turns around and the reflection still looking at them
00:35:45,00:35:49,"And you realize it's T1,000. Do you know how he achieved that effect?"
00:35:49,00:35:54,With a window I'll give you a clue. Have you ever seen the film?
00:35:54,00:36:01,"Yes, it's the same concept as the big reveal in that he used Arnold Schwarzenegger's twin. He used identical"
00:36:01,00:36:08,He used identical twins twice in this film
00:36:08,00:36:16,"There's an identical twin so there's Don and Dan Stanton played a character called Lewis and then T1,000 pretending to be him"
00:36:16,00:36:21,"And then Linda Hamilton, who I think was a famous part in that had an identical twin called Leslie Hamilton"
00:36:21,00:36:28,"And whenever he needed, you know, one of them to do something body-doubly, isn't it? Was he hiring actors entirely based on that way?"
00:36:28,00:36:30,Yeah
00:36:30,00:36:32,So heads of state and cows
00:36:32,00:36:37,President Taft of America kept a cow called Pauline on the White House lawn. Do you remember that?
00:36:37,00:36:43,"No, I didn't remember it. No, so I was collecting names of naming animals of odd names"
00:36:43,00:36:47,So Byron had a pet wolf called Lion
00:36:47,00:36:52,Either reveal is bad right when you mean it
00:36:52,00:36:55,Einstein had a cat called Tiger
00:36:55,00:37:01,Climbs Gustav Klint had a cat called Catskate. He said and the Times journalist Andrew Billan
00:37:01,00:37:06,"I read the other day is called he's got a cat called Vommie, which is Bode's ill, doesn't it?"
00:37:06,00:37:08,And I did I did really like this
00:37:08,00:37:15,Elgar the composer spent a lot of time with the Hereford Cathedral organist dog who's called Dan
00:37:15,00:37:22,"Anyway, when Dan fell into the river wine swam upstream to find a landing place"
00:37:22,00:37:28,Somebody suggested that Elgar set the whole adventure to music and he did he said I've done it
00:37:28,00:37:30,It was called the enigma variations
00:37:30,00:37:34,Inspired by Dan the dog who fell into the river
00:37:35,00:37:42,"Dan I think he's just replaced you as my favorite Dan. Oh, I thought that changed long ago. Yeah. That's very cool"
00:37:42,00:37:47,I love whoever that journalist was what a billing he got to share just then out of nowhere
00:37:47,00:37:54,He's a really good guy
00:37:54,00:38:03,"What's Swindon famous for the Oxford United's big rivals? Yeah, I could say about the football team"
00:38:03,00:38:08,What do they make in Swindon? Dianna Dawes is famous. She's a Swindon girl and
00:38:08,00:38:12,The mayor was introducing it once he was terribly nervous because
00:38:12,00:38:17,Her maiden name was Dianna Fluck like Peter Fluck
00:38:17,00:38:22,And he said it's a gentleman may introduce
00:38:22,00:38:26,That lady used to be called Diana Clunter
00:38:26,00:38:37,"Alright, there you go, that is all of our outtakes"
00:38:37,00:38:43,If you want to write to any of us about the things that were said in this episode podcast at qi.com
00:38:43,00:38:48,All those emails go to Andy he goes through them and some of them make their way to drop us a line of which
00:38:48,00:38:53,There'll be another episode popping into your club fish feed in the next couple of weeks
00:38:53,00:38:57,So do write in if you want to have yours read out on the show one
00:38:57,00:39:01,Correction from the outtakes which we thought worth keeping in any way
00:39:01,00:39:06,Sometimes we just tell stories out loud because someone has said something while we're on a tangent
00:39:06,00:39:12,And I just wanted to add a few corrections that brilliantly funny Steve Martin story that I told earlier
00:39:12,00:39:16,So just in case you're thinking can't wait for this episode to end
00:39:16,00:39:19,I absolutely want to get out there and start spreading the story
00:39:19,00:39:26,There's a few corrections to add about it one is that he was filming Roxanne and he did go into a bar
00:39:26,00:39:29,"However, it wasn't because it was the end of the day and he was looking for a drink"
00:39:29,00:39:34,It's because they were halfway through the filming day. He had the prosthetics on he really needed the bathroom
00:39:34,00:39:37,There wasn't one around someone pointed him to that place
00:39:37,00:39:42,He walked in and then the story is pretty much the same. He gets looks from all the locals
00:39:42,00:39:48,He's thinking oh am I welcome here or not and a man walks up to him looks him up and down and says why the long face
00:39:49,00:39:53,There you go. You can now go out into the wild and spread that hilarious story
00:39:53,00:39:55,"All right, that is it everyone"
