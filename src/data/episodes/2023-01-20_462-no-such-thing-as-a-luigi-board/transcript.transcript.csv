00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:14,00:00:16,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:19,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:00:19,00:00:21,"from Up The Creek in Greenwich, London!"
00:00:21,00:00:24,(audience cheering)
00:00:24,00:00:26,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:26,00:00:28,"I am sitting here with Anna Toshensky,"
00:00:28,00:00:30,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:30,00:00:33,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:33,00:00:36,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:36,00:00:39,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:43,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:43,00:00:46,- My fact is that some shows at the Roman Coliseum
00:00:46,00:00:49,featured sausage dogs.
00:00:49,00:00:50,(audience laughing)
00:00:50,00:00:52,- People fighting sausage dogs?
00:00:52,00:00:53,- It's so unclear.
00:00:53,00:00:55,It's so unclear what the actual thing is.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Maybe.
00:00:56,00:00:58,"I mean, the thing is they would be quite far away."
00:00:58,00:00:59,- You wouldn't get great visibility
00:00:59,00:01:01,on a sausage dog from that distance.
00:01:01,00:01:03,"If you were in the back, you'd have no idea"
00:01:03,00:01:04,what was going on.
00:01:04,00:01:05,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:01:05,00:01:07,- But maybe it was a swarm of sausage dogs
00:01:07,00:01:08,against one Christian.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"You know, that is possible."
00:01:10,00:01:12,- Would you rather fight a thousand
00:01:12,00:01:13,Christian-sized sausage dogs?
00:01:13,00:01:15,(audience laughing)
00:01:15,00:01:18,- A thousand Christian-sized sausage dogs?
00:01:18,00:01:20,(audience laughing)
00:01:20,00:01:21,Or what?
00:01:21,00:01:23,- Or not.
00:01:23,00:01:25,(audience laughing)
00:01:25,00:01:26,- They often didn't get a choice.
00:01:26,00:01:28,"Fun fact, in the Coliseum,"
00:01:29,00:01:30,so we should say there's a study.
00:01:30,00:01:33,There's been an archeological study done recently
00:01:33,00:01:35,"and these are Daxons, Vena dogs,"
00:01:35,00:01:35,whatever you want to call them.
00:01:35,00:01:38,"And they were the kind of precursor,"
00:01:38,00:01:39,the prototypes of these dogs
00:01:39,00:01:41,'cause the modern breed only emerged
00:01:41,00:01:42,in about the 18th and 19th century.
00:01:42,00:01:45,But they were basically this kind of dog.
00:01:45,00:01:46,"- If you went back in time when you saw one,"
00:01:46,00:01:47,you would think it was a sausage dog.
00:01:47,00:01:48,- Exactly.
00:01:48,00:01:50,The thing is we genuinely don't know what they thought.
00:01:50,00:01:51,The archeologists have been crawling
00:01:51,00:01:54,in the sewers under the Coliseum for a year.
00:01:54,00:01:57,They spent a year crawling in the mud on their stomachs
00:01:57,00:01:58,and they found lots of stuff.
00:01:58,00:01:59,"They found seven coins,"
00:01:59,00:02:03,which does not feel like a good return on investment.
00:02:03,00:02:06,"- It's not a good wage, is it, for the year?"
00:02:06,00:02:07,- And they found some bones.
00:02:07,00:02:08,They found some leopard bones.
00:02:08,00:02:10,They found some lions and ostrich bones.
00:02:10,00:02:11,But they also found these dogs.
00:02:11,00:02:14,"And we don't know were they part of staged battles,"
00:02:14,00:02:16,"which is great fun, or were they acrobats,"
00:02:16,00:02:16,which is also fun.
00:02:16,00:02:17,- Which is amazing.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"- There isn't a slightly more boring explanation,"
00:02:21,00:02:23,which is that they might have been used
00:02:23,00:02:24,to kind of hunt rats.
00:02:24,00:02:27,"- Okay, 'cause when you're at the Coliseum,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,"loads of people there, you're eating lots of snacks."
00:02:29,00:02:32,"It could be that they tried to stop the rodents,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"but I mean, I'd rather think of them as acrobats."
00:02:34,00:02:35,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:35,00:02:37,That's all speculation.
00:02:37,00:02:39,Did we not write stuff down back then?
00:02:39,00:02:40,Because I'm pretty sure we did.
00:02:40,00:02:43,How is it that sausage dogs have escaped history?
00:02:43,00:02:44,Yet we are--
00:02:44,00:02:45,- That's a great question.
00:02:45,00:02:46,- There was a lot going on at the Coliseum.
00:02:46,00:02:50,It was some mad shit for about 500 years.
00:02:50,00:02:51,You couldn't write every single thing down every day.
00:02:51,00:02:54,"- I'm sorry, if I walked out of the end of an evening"
00:02:54,00:02:56,"at the Coliseum and I saw Gladiators fighting,"
00:02:56,00:02:57,I'm not saying that.
00:02:57,00:02:58,"I'm going, ""Did anyone see the fucking sausage dog?"""
00:02:58,00:02:59,(laughing)
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- But no, but there was so much more weird stuff than that."
00:03:01,00:03:04,Like the real acrobats did amazing things.
00:03:04,00:03:05,And one of the frustrating things is
00:03:05,00:03:07,we don't have that much information
00:03:07,00:03:09,'cause people write about it in fragments.
00:03:09,00:03:12,Sometimes we've only got little bits of writing.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"There was the Petaurus,"
00:03:14,00:03:18,which the sources we have suggest was a giant seesaw.
00:03:18,00:03:19,And we think it was used at kind of half time
00:03:19,00:03:20,in the Coliseum.
00:03:20,00:03:23,So there's huge seesaw and you'd have
00:03:23,00:03:25,two opponents competing on either side.
00:03:25,00:03:28,And one would jump onto it
00:03:28,00:03:30,and it would fling the other one up in the air.
00:03:30,00:03:32,I think about 30 feet in the air.
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- No, stop it."
00:03:34,00:03:35,Stop it.
00:03:35,00:03:38,"- Apparently they'd go through,"
00:03:38,00:03:40,"they'd go through hoops of flame,"
00:03:40,00:03:41,I think one of the sources said.
00:03:41,00:03:42,And then come back down.
00:03:42,00:03:44,Then the other one gets flung in the air.
00:03:44,00:03:46,There is an account of them falling
00:03:46,00:03:48,"to their death sometimes, as will happen."
00:03:48,00:03:51,- Wasn't there an account of them putting criminals on there?
00:03:51,00:03:52,- Yeah.
00:03:52,00:03:55,"- And the idea is the lions come in, right?"
00:03:55,00:03:56,And they're going to attack the guy
00:03:56,00:03:58,who's the bottom of the seesaw.
00:03:58,00:04:01,So you're always trying to get to the top of your seesaw
00:04:01,00:04:01,so that he's at the bottom.
00:04:01,00:04:04,- I think that sometimes is speculated
00:04:04,00:04:05,that that might be what they were used for.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"- It is, but the suggestion, the problem is,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"as soon as the other guy gets eaten,"
00:04:09,00:04:10,"you're fucked, aren't you?"
00:04:10,00:04:12,- Yeah.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"- The weird thing is, this is all the half time shows though."
00:04:14,00:04:16,Lots of what we're talking about now
00:04:16,00:04:18,"is the half time shows in between,"
00:04:18,00:04:19,"what, ""Jarriot Races?"""
00:04:19,00:04:21,And then maybe other five and the gladiators.
00:04:21,00:04:24,"- A lot of the damnatio ad bestias,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"so being killed by wild animals basically,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,organized by a group of people called the bestiary.
00:04:29,00:04:31,There are lots of sources claiming that the bestiary
00:04:31,00:04:33,were incredible trainers of animals
00:04:33,00:04:36,and they would train animals to kill people
00:04:36,00:04:37,in incredibly elaborate ways
00:04:37,00:04:40,that referenced myths for people.
00:04:40,00:04:42,So they would recreate death scenes.
00:04:42,00:04:44,You guys remember the story of Prometheus?
00:04:44,00:04:47,He stole fire from the gods and then he was punished.
00:04:47,00:04:51,He was chained to a rock and a liver would fly down every day.
00:04:51,00:04:53,And peck out his eagle.
00:04:53,00:04:55,Uh...
00:04:55,00:04:57,Ah!
00:04:57,00:04:59,"So, eagle would fly down every day."
00:04:59,00:05:01,- But they recreated it the opposite way round.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:05:03,00:05:06,Supposedly one bestiarius spent months and months
00:05:06,00:05:09,training a single eagle to remove a man's organs.
00:05:09,00:05:12,"- Wow, really? - I can't believe that's true."
00:05:12,00:05:13,"- Wow. - Like, yeah."
00:05:13,00:05:15,- The half time shows sounded amazing.
00:05:15,00:05:17,They kind of sound like a modern half time show
00:05:17,00:05:19,"of, let's say, a basketball,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,"if you watch American basketball. - A Super Bowl, maybe?"
00:05:21,00:05:24,"- A Super Bowl. Like, it's really show-stoppy kind of stuff."
00:05:24,00:05:27,So they would do things where snacks would fall from the sky
00:05:27,00:05:30,"and including from... I mean, they're not from the clouds, obviously,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,"but they were sort of launched,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,kind of like how the people that would stand in the middle
00:05:34,00:05:36,and shoot out t-shirts out of rockets.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"- They had a toga cannon? - Exactly, so they had this..."
00:05:38,00:05:40,"Yeah, well..."
00:05:40,00:05:42,"What they actually had, though, which is amazing,"
00:05:42,00:05:45,"is you got this wooden ball where, on the inside,"
00:05:45,00:05:48,you would win something like a t-shirt or...
00:05:48,00:05:51,"But I know they didn't have t-shirts, so it was very progressive."
00:05:51,00:05:53,"No, but it would be food or it would be money,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,"it would even be the deeds to a house, you know, or an apartment."
00:05:56,00:05:57,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:05:57,00:05:59,So a lot of people really fought over it.
00:05:59,00:06:02,"- But were there bad things in the balls, as well? - No, I don't know."
00:06:02,00:06:04,"- So, like, if you open the bowl, you might get a t-shirt"
00:06:04,00:06:06,or it might be you have to go on the seesaw.
00:06:06,00:06:08,"- Yeah, exactly. - Yeah."
00:06:08,00:06:10,"- That did sound pretty cool, though, didn't it? - Yeah."
00:06:10,00:06:12,"They had, possibly, we think,"
00:06:12,00:06:15,"like, the spectators would have water sprinkled on them."
00:06:15,00:06:18,"- Oh, yeah. - 'Cause they had toilets with running water."
00:06:18,00:06:20,So they would kind of get the water from the river
00:06:20,00:06:22,and kind of get it to go through the stadium
00:06:22,00:06:24,and go through where all the toilets are.
00:06:24,00:06:26,But they also had huge...
00:06:26,00:06:28,We think because they had this in pool and we haven't seen it
00:06:28,00:06:30,"in the Coliseum, but it's very, very similar."
00:06:30,00:06:33,"They had huge, huge towers with loads of water in,"
00:06:33,00:06:35,and that water would kind of sprinkle over everyone
00:06:35,00:06:36,to keep them cool.
00:06:36,00:06:38,And they also had a retractable roof.
00:06:38,00:06:39,"- No, this is amazing. - I know they were"
00:06:39,00:06:41,"more than 2,000 years ahead of Wimbledon."
00:06:41,00:06:44,"- I know. - It's so amazing, isn't it?"
00:06:44,00:06:45,- There we go again. - Yeah.
00:06:45,00:06:47,- They just had a cabbage roof that they could bring over
00:06:47,00:06:49,whenever it got too hot or cold.
00:06:49,00:06:51,"- Yeah, the Valerium, I think,"
00:06:51,00:06:54,"and it was operated by about 1,000 sailors"
00:06:54,00:06:55,"who would pull on the ropes,"
00:06:55,00:06:57,'cause they used to pulling on rope sailors.
00:06:57,00:07:00,"But, yeah, and you'd have advertising up,"
00:07:00,00:07:02,and we've got the...
00:07:02,00:07:04,"I want to say etchings in the stones,"
00:07:04,00:07:06,but we've got the evidence that you'd advertise
00:07:06,00:07:08,"""There will be shade, vela errant."""
00:07:08,00:07:10,"You know, ""There will be shade for you."""
00:07:10,00:07:11,It's incredible.
00:07:11,00:07:13,Although Caligula liked to wind it back
00:07:13,00:07:15,so he could watch people just boil up.
00:07:15,00:07:17,"- Oh, yeah. - There's the watch."
00:07:17,00:07:19,- Absolutely classic Caligula. - Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"- It sounded hectic working there, though,"
00:07:21,00:07:24,because basically you could be a part of the show
00:07:24,00:07:26,"if anything went wrong, if the emperor decided."
00:07:26,00:07:28,So Claudius in particular.
00:07:28,00:07:30,There was a biographer called Suetonius
00:07:30,00:07:32,"who wrote about the fact that Claudius,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,"if he was watching a show,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,"and something went slightly wrong,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,and everything was operated underneath
00:07:37,00:07:40,in terms of if the gladiators were fighting.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"All the animals that came up into the stadium,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,"they were all in the hypergeum, which was underneath,"
00:07:44,00:07:47,"which is this extraordinary, kind of like the backstage"
00:07:47,00:07:51,of a theater where they have just a crazy amount of stuff
00:07:51,00:07:53,that you wouldn't realize to make shows happen.
00:07:53,00:07:54,That was happening underneath.
00:07:54,00:07:56,And so if something went wrong
00:07:56,00:07:58,where something came up at the wrong time
00:07:58,00:08:00,"and it pissed off the emperor, he would just say,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"""Whoever the staff is down there, they're now in the show."
00:08:02,00:08:04,"Get them up there to fight the lions."""
00:08:04,00:08:06,- Shit. - Anything that went wrong.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"If the catering went wrong, get the caterers in there."
00:08:08,00:08:11,So he just kept adding people to be killed in the...
00:08:11,00:08:13,- Right. Sounds great. - I heard that sometimes
00:08:13,00:08:15,hecklers would be thrown to wild animals.
00:08:15,00:08:17,- Really? - That's fair enough.
00:08:17,00:08:20,We should start that.
00:08:20,00:08:24,"I like the hypergeum because it's like whack-a-mole, isn't it?"
00:08:24,00:08:27,"Because a lion would pop up somewhere,"
00:08:27,00:08:29,"and then you had to go and fight it,"
00:08:29,00:08:31,"and then some monkeys, and then a..."
00:08:31,00:08:33,- Sausage dog. - Sausage dog.
00:08:33,00:08:36,But the whole point was that there wasn't spots
00:08:36,00:08:38,you knew that they would pop up.
00:08:38,00:08:40,"There were so many spots that, like the whack-a-mole,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,"you could be facing this way, expecting a lion,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,and then it comes behind you.
00:08:44,00:08:46,"Apparently, the system to bring them up sometimes"
00:08:46,00:08:49,was so supercharged that the lion would be lobbed into the...
00:08:49,00:08:51,- Stop it. Come on. - That's an account I read.
00:08:51,00:08:53,"Oh, my God."
00:08:53,00:08:55,There's so much speculation about this stuff.
00:08:55,00:08:57,It's amazing.
00:08:57,00:09:00,The best seats were reserved for the emperor
00:09:00,00:09:02,and the Vestal Virgins.
00:09:02,00:09:04,"They got the best seats, and then if you went a little bit higher up,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,"you would get the senators,"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"and then you would get the knights and the nobles,"
00:09:08,00:09:11,"and then the very, very furthest strata was for commoners."
00:09:11,00:09:13,"And then they built one more,"
00:09:13,00:09:16,"even right at the very, very back strata."
00:09:16,00:09:18,Do you know who that was for?
00:09:18,00:09:21,- A commonist. - What did you say?
00:09:21,00:09:23,Women is exactly right.
00:09:23,00:09:24,"- Oh, really? - Yeah."
00:09:24,00:09:26,- I'm afraid so. - 'Cause they gave us the best seat.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"Well, yes, exactly."
00:09:28,00:09:30,"You wouldn't be able to see the sausage, Doug,"
00:09:30,00:09:32,unless it was flung really high.
00:09:34,00:09:38,"It seated 50,000 people, the Coliseum, roughly,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,"and I went to Wembley to see a show,"
00:09:41,00:09:43,and that gives you...
00:09:43,00:09:46,"If you were watching a sausage dog down, as you said,"
00:09:46,00:09:49,"'cause I went to see Billy Joel at Wembley,"
00:09:49,00:09:53,"and my wife booked me this ticket as part of a Christmas present,"
00:09:53,00:09:55,"and I said, ""What are the seats like?"""
00:09:55,00:09:57,"She said, ""I didn't really check. I'm sure they're good."""
00:09:57,00:10:00,You couldn't be further away from Billy Joel as possible.
00:10:00,00:10:03,"It was so far away that when the gig was playing,"
00:10:03,00:10:06,"we could hear the song and the screens that allowed us to see him,"
00:10:06,00:10:09,"which genuinely, he's sausage dog-sized at that distance."
00:10:09,00:10:11,"It was out of sync with the visuals,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"and I was like, ""Oh, my God, Billy's gonna be so angry"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"because, you know, there's so much money spent."""
00:10:15,00:10:17,That's how far away we were.
00:10:17,00:10:20,Sound and vision were traveling at a different rate
00:10:20,00:10:22,that they were not in sync.
00:10:22,00:10:25,So if you counted the number of seconds between the time he opened his mouth
00:10:25,00:10:27,"and the time you saw it, you could tell how far away he was."
00:10:27,00:10:28,"Exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:10:28,00:10:30,You could tell when you're gonna get struck by lightning.
00:10:30,00:10:31,That's right.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"Well, you say 50,000 sounds big,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,but I just don't think we ever make a big enough deal of the fact
00:10:36,00:10:38,"that this Coliseum basically replaced Circus Maximus,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,"which was its predecessor,"
00:10:40,00:10:45,"sat 250,000 people, still the biggest ever stadium."
00:10:45,00:10:47,"It's just, I find that just amazing."
00:10:47,00:10:48,What was that?
00:10:48,00:10:51,"That was Rome as well, but it was, you know, they got bored of it."
00:10:51,00:10:53,That was where they had lots of chariot races
00:10:53,00:10:55,"and then chucked the Coliseum in,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,which they never called the Coliseum.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"They called it the Flavian Amphitheater,"
00:10:59,00:11:03,and we think the reason they changed the name is quite funny.
00:11:03,00:11:07,"So it started being called the Coliseum in sort of early medieval times,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,and we believe it's because the Colossus at the time
00:11:10,00:11:11,"was the Colossus of Nero,"
00:11:11,00:11:14,"this gigantic 100-foot tall classic Nero statue of him,"
00:11:14,00:11:19,"which had, as Nero went out of fashion, its head kept changing,"
00:11:19,00:11:20,"so whatever emperor was in power at the time,"
00:11:20,00:11:23,they'd shove his head on the statue.
00:11:23,00:11:27,"And eventually someone wrote a poem about the Colossus saying,"
00:11:27,00:11:30,"""So long as the Colossus stands, Rome shall stand."
00:11:30,00:11:33,"""When the Colossus falls, Rome too shall fall,"
00:11:33,00:11:36,"""and when Rome falls, so falls the world."""
00:11:36,00:11:38,"And then almost immediately after that was written and published,"
00:11:38,00:11:42,"the Colossus fell, and we think they went,"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"""Well, shit, everyone's going to think the world's going to end."
00:11:44,00:11:46,"""We better change what the Colossus is."""
00:11:46,00:11:49,"And so then we think they named the Coliseum, the Coliseum,"
00:11:49,00:11:52,"because it was right nearby, and they said,"
00:11:52,00:11:53,"""Let's just pretend."""
00:11:53,00:11:54,Wow.
00:11:54,00:11:55,That's really cool.
00:11:55,00:11:58,I've got some stuff on sausage dogs.
00:11:58,00:11:59,Of course you do.
00:11:59,00:12:00,Sorry.
00:12:00,00:12:01,Very nice.
00:12:01,00:12:02,We've actually got to move on.
00:12:02,00:12:03,"No, no, absolutely not."
00:12:03,00:12:04,Absolutely not.
00:12:04,00:12:06,Don't go near it.
00:12:06,00:12:09,I thought this fact would go in a very different direction.
00:12:09,00:12:12,I've basically only got sausage dog stuff now.
00:12:12,00:12:15,Do you guys know where the sausage dog capital of the world is?
00:12:15,00:12:16,Oh.
00:12:16,00:12:17,It's not in Germany.
00:12:17,00:12:18,"No, it's as of this year."
00:12:18,00:12:19,It's in the UK.
00:12:19,00:12:20,Oh.
00:12:20,00:12:23,It's almost totally ungettable.
00:12:23,00:12:24,Is it Maidstone?
00:12:24,00:12:26,It's on the coast.
00:12:26,00:12:28,Unlike Maidstone.
00:12:28,00:12:29,Is it?
00:12:29,00:12:31,"No, it's not."
00:12:31,00:12:33,I don't even know why I say it.
00:12:33,00:12:35,It was in Southwold this year in Suffolk.
00:12:35,00:12:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:36,00:12:38,"They had, well, a lot of, you know..."
00:12:38,00:12:40,Push people in the audience.
00:12:40,00:12:44,This year at Southwold hosted
00:12:44,00:12:47,the world's largest ever single breed dog walk
00:12:47,00:12:52,"when 2,238 sausage dogs turned up for a walk."
00:12:52,00:12:53,Whoa.
00:12:53,00:12:54,At the same time.
00:12:54,00:12:55,That's a lot.
00:12:55,00:12:57,The size of one gladiator Christian.
00:12:57,00:13:00,You said turned up.
00:13:00,00:13:02,"Like, A, there were posters up around town"
00:13:02,00:13:04,and the dogs just trotted up on their own.
00:13:04,00:13:05,I know.
00:13:05,00:13:07,And they had one person to walk all of them.
00:13:07,00:13:08,It was a nightmare.
00:13:08,00:13:10,Do you want to hear a fact that's not about Dachshunds?
00:13:10,00:13:11,"Yeah, and then we need to move on."
00:13:11,00:13:12,"Okay, okay."
00:13:12,00:13:15,"So, I was reading an article in researching this about a Dachshund"
00:13:15,00:13:17,which was caught on CCTV in Germany
00:13:17,00:13:20,"and it was the only police lead for a case, a crime case,"
00:13:20,00:13:21,because it had an unusual lead.
00:13:21,00:13:23,And they couldn't see the face of the criminal
00:13:23,00:13:25,and they could only see the lead on the Dachshund.
00:13:25,00:13:26,And that was the...
00:13:26,00:13:27,"So, it was such a confusing case."
00:13:27,00:13:28,Do we have any leads?
00:13:28,00:13:30,"Yes, we've got this one lead, of course you."
00:13:30,00:13:36,"But I only mentioned this because of the final paragraph,"
00:13:36,00:13:38,"which I loved, but is not Dachshund related,"
00:13:38,00:13:39,but it was in this story.
00:13:39,00:13:41,"So, here I'm just going to read it verbatim."
00:13:41,00:13:45,It may not be the first time a pet has provided key evidence.
00:13:45,00:13:49,"In 2017, a woman in Michigan was convicted of killing her husband"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"partly on the testimony from their parrot,"
00:13:51,00:13:55,"which kept repeating, ""Don't shoot in the dead man's voice."""
00:13:55,00:13:58,"Oh, spooky."
00:13:58,00:13:59,In his voice.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Supposedly in his voice.
00:14:00,00:14:03,"I've never heard a parrot that can do voices, but this one can."
00:14:03,00:14:04,"Wow, amazing."
00:14:04,00:14:08,"But he didn't say, ""Don't shoot Mabel,"" did he?"
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:09,00:14:10,"So, we don't know who he was talking to."
00:14:10,00:14:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:11,00:14:12,How did that help convict her?
00:14:12,00:14:15,"Okay, well, tune in to Anna's new true crime podcast"
00:14:15,00:14:18,where she frees this woman.
00:14:18,00:14:19,LAUGHTER
00:14:19,00:14:27,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:14:27,00:14:30,"My fact this week is that in the 1920s,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,spiritualists started complaining
00:14:32,00:14:35,that Tutankhamun was appearing at their seances too often.
00:14:35,00:14:40,It's just sort of spamming them.
00:14:40,00:14:43,"Was he disruptive, or was it just, there's too much of this?"
00:14:43,00:14:44,Sometimes.
00:14:44,00:14:46,"Yeah, he seemed to have quite bad mood swings,"
00:14:46,00:14:47,which I guess he was a teenager.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"So, this was..."
00:14:50,00:14:52,Go to your pyramid.
00:14:52,00:14:53,No!
00:14:53,00:14:57,"Fuck, go to your tomb!"
00:14:57,00:14:58,"Sorry, there we go."
00:14:58,00:15:06,"This was in Tutankhamun's second heyday,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,"which was the 1920s, I guess."
00:15:08,00:15:11,"So, his tomb was discovered in 1922."
00:15:11,00:15:14,"It was this huge deal, and he became this massive celebrity."
00:15:14,00:15:17,"Obviously, no one had ever heard of him before this."
00:15:17,00:15:20,"And at the same time, seances were very popular."
00:15:20,00:15:23,"Spiritualism was very popular, and so he kept on popping up,"
00:15:23,00:15:26,"and there was an edition of a journal called ""Light"","
00:15:26,00:15:29,a journal of spiritual progress and physical research.
00:15:29,00:15:31,"And a letter in it said,"
00:15:31,00:15:35,"""We are getting a little tired of Tutankhamun."
00:15:35,00:15:37,"""Messages purporting to be from him,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,"""which consists of vague generalities,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"""are quite worth as anyone could compose them."""
00:15:42,00:15:44,"And saying, basically, you know,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,"either give us good evidence of your identity,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,"I don't know how, write some hieroglyphics or something."
00:15:48,00:15:50,They're hard to do on a Ouija board.
00:15:50,00:15:53,You need the expansion pack for that.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"You do, yeah."
00:15:55,00:15:59,"You need the right font, don't you?"
00:15:59,00:16:01,Some wing-dings on that.
00:16:01,00:16:06,"Yeah, they said we don't want just random celebrities claiming to turn up."
00:16:06,00:16:08,"Either we want the good evidence,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,or we want their message to be of such high quality
00:16:10,00:16:12,that their identity becomes unimportant.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"Some very fine teaching comes from these visitors,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,and it's being spoiled by Tutankhamun.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"And the thought was, wasn't it,"
00:16:19,00:16:22,that the reason he started coming up because of this heyday thing
00:16:22,00:16:24,is because the attention was so great on him
00:16:24,00:16:26,"that he was, like, invoked back into existence."
00:16:26,00:16:28,"That was the excuse, wasn't it?"
00:16:28,00:16:30,"Yeah, rather than why has Tutankhamun not been, like,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"breaking into everyone's seance prior to that,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,"it's because, well, he didn't know he was needed prior to that."
00:16:35,00:16:38,"They were claiming he was a bit of an eugotistical attention seeker,"
00:16:38,00:16:40,"and so he was up there, like, ""Well, no one cares about me,"""
00:16:40,00:16:42,"and then they started caring, so he decided,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"""Fine, I'll come and visit him."""
00:16:44,00:16:46,So what was he saying? What were the messages he was bringing?
00:16:46,00:16:49,"So sometimes he was angry, his tomb had been violated,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,and he would smash everything up.
00:16:51,00:16:53,He injured a medium.
00:16:53,00:16:56,He broke lots of Egyptian sculptures that were in the room.
00:16:56,00:16:59,And then sometimes he was a nice guy.
00:16:59,00:17:02,He really depended.
00:17:02,00:17:04,"I wonder who a modern equivalent of that would be,"
00:17:04,00:17:06,"as in someone who's very, very famous."
00:17:06,00:17:10,"Well, in 2003, there was a pay-per-view Princess Diana seance."
00:17:10,00:17:12,I don't know if you remember that.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"2003, God."
00:17:14,00:17:15,"Yeah, but pay-per-view."
00:17:15,00:17:17,Why do you sound appalled at pay-per-view?
00:17:17,00:17:20,"Because it's event television, it was sort of..."
00:17:20,00:17:23,"Not only would it be a huge event that you would have pay-per-view,"
00:17:23,00:17:24,"because, you know..."
00:17:24,00:17:25,Got it.
00:17:25,00:17:26,Right.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"But you're saying it should have been BBC, then?"
00:17:28,00:17:30,License fee only.
00:17:30,00:17:31,Prime time.
00:17:31,00:17:32,Absolutely.
00:17:32,00:17:35,"Budget cuts for the BBC, they just can't afford it."
00:17:35,00:17:36,But check this out.
00:17:36,00:17:38,This is a seance that I'd never heard of before.
00:17:38,00:17:42,"This was a medium who was quite famous, called Lillian Bailey."
00:17:42,00:17:44,And she claimed that she had a spirit guide
00:17:44,00:17:46,who was called William Headley Wooten.
00:17:46,00:17:48,And he was a captain during World War I.
00:17:48,00:17:50,He died in World War I.
00:17:50,00:17:54,And she would use him in order to bring other people to talk.
00:17:54,00:17:58,And she received a request one day to go and do a seance.
00:17:58,00:18:00,"But they said, ""It's a bit high-profile, the person."
00:18:00,00:18:03,So what we're going to do is we're going to pick you up from your place.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"We're going to blindfold you, and we're going to take you to the place."""
00:18:06,00:18:08,"So she was sat around the table,"
00:18:08,00:18:10,and then she wasn't allowed to take the blindfold off.
00:18:10,00:18:11,So she did it.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"And at the end of it, having contacted someone,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,she took the blindfold off and sitting in front of her
00:18:16,00:18:20,"was Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, the Queen Mother,"
00:18:20,00:18:22,and a few other of the royals.
00:18:22,00:18:25,"And what it was is it was not long after the King had died,"
00:18:25,00:18:28,and the Queen Mother was obsessed with the idea of contact.
00:18:28,00:18:30,So the Queen was at a seance.
00:18:30,00:18:33,Can you imagine taking that blindfold off?
00:18:33,00:18:37,Bloody hell.
00:18:37,00:18:40,And she just slowly put it back on.
00:18:40,00:18:44,Take me home.
00:18:44,00:18:47,"But she kind of used that in the future as a kind of,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,she's the Queen's official medium.
00:18:49,00:18:50,"Well, you were, didn't you?"
00:18:50,00:18:52,"Yeah, yeah, by royal appointment."
00:18:52,00:18:53,That's who she said she was.
00:18:53,00:18:57,And the Queen Mother often would book sessions with her afterwards
00:18:57,00:18:58,to try and do it.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"And the person who set it up, which was not in the movie,"
00:19:01,00:19:03,"was a man called Lionel Logue,"
00:19:03,00:19:06,who was the therapist who treated the King for his stammer
00:19:06,00:19:07,in the King's speech.
00:19:07,00:19:08,Right.
00:19:08,00:19:09,He's the one who set up the seance.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"Wow, they should have put that in."
00:19:10,00:19:12,"Yeah, what a scene."
00:19:12,00:19:13,Oh my God.
00:19:13,00:19:15,"Do you speak in a seance when you're one of the guests,"
00:19:15,00:19:16,or do you only speak when you're the medium?
00:19:16,00:19:17,"You're not really supposed to, yeah."
00:19:17,00:19:18,Okay.
00:19:18,00:19:20,"I just thought, because that would have given it away,"
00:19:20,00:19:22,not enough people speak like the Queen and Prince Philip
00:19:22,00:19:26,and the Queen Mum to conceal your identity.
00:19:26,00:19:28,Maybe they'd put an accent on.
00:19:28,00:19:31,"Not like an Aussie accent, no?"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"Yeah, a cockney Irish or something."
00:19:33,00:19:34,Yeah.
00:19:34,00:19:35,German.
00:19:35,00:19:36,Sure.
00:19:36,00:19:42,Whatever their best at.
00:19:42,00:19:43,"Actually, speaking of Germans,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,"there was a big thing in the war, wasn't there,"
00:19:45,00:19:49,where there was a medium called Helen Duncan.
00:19:49,00:19:53,And she was a Scottish 25-stone working-class mother of six
00:19:53,00:19:56,"who swore, smoked and drank whiskey."
00:19:56,00:19:58,"She sounds great, right?"
00:19:58,00:20:00,"But at the time, she was late in the upper classes in London."
00:20:00,00:20:02,They thought she was an absolute genius.
00:20:02,00:20:04,They thought that she could speak to the dead.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"She was really, really important in the high society."
00:20:07,00:20:11,"And then in 1941, she was in a seance in Portsmouth,"
00:20:11,00:20:14,and she claimed the spirit of a sailor told her
00:20:14,00:20:16,that a certain ship had been sunk.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"And it turned out that that ship had been sunk,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,but it hadn't been reported yet.
00:20:20,00:20:22,"And so, obviously, she became..."
00:20:22,00:20:24,They were really worried about her.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"First of all, maybe, you know, she is somehow getting messages"
00:20:27,00:20:30,"from the dead, or maybe she's getting messages from the Germans,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,or...
00:20:32,00:20:35,"Yeah, they thought she might be a spy who was ceding the information."
00:20:35,00:20:37,"And of course, she got done for witchcraft."
00:20:37,00:20:40,"Yeah, she was the last person, or the second last person,"
00:20:40,00:20:42,the last person to be imprisoned under the Witchcraft Act.
00:20:42,00:20:47,But she got imprisoned under the Witchcraft Act of 1735.
00:20:47,00:20:49,So what was she being imprisoned for?
00:20:49,00:20:50,Being a witch.
00:20:50,00:20:52,It's absolutely incorrect.
00:20:52,00:20:53,Not being a witch.
00:20:53,00:20:54,That's absolutely right.
00:20:54,00:20:55,Oh!
00:20:55,00:20:57,So the Witchcraft Act of 1735
00:20:57,00:20:59,was not about persecuting witches.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"It was the first act that acknowledged witches are not real,"
00:21:02,00:21:05,and so people pretending to be witches
00:21:05,00:21:07,are the ones who need to be punished now for faking it.
00:21:07,00:21:10,And so she was punished for pretending to be a witch.
00:21:10,00:21:11,That's brilliant.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"God, that's a real catch-22 situation as well."
00:21:13,00:21:14,"Yeah, yeah."
00:21:14,00:21:15,"Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
00:21:15,00:21:17,Have you guys heard of Colin Evans?
00:21:17,00:21:18,No.
00:21:18,00:21:21,"He was a Welsh spiritualist in, I think, the 1920s,"
00:21:21,00:21:24,and his big thing was claiming that he could levitate.
00:21:24,00:21:27,"So he would get an audience, probably an audience around this size,"
00:21:27,00:21:28,a few hundred people.
00:21:28,00:21:31,He would request the room went completely dark.
00:21:31,00:21:35,"The audience would sit around him and pitch blackness,"
00:21:35,00:21:38,"and they would chant, they would all chant the same thing,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"an incredible atmosphere, something amazing to be proud of."
00:21:40,00:21:44,"Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate."
00:21:44,00:21:45,Now the lights down?
00:21:45,00:21:46,No.
00:21:46,00:21:49,"It was completely dark, and then he provided proof of it."
00:21:49,00:21:51,He would take photos of himself at the very moment
00:21:51,00:21:53,where he was levitating.
00:21:53,00:21:56,"But the thing is, he was just jumping."
00:21:56,00:22:04,"He would just jump, take the photo, and then land."
00:22:04,00:22:05,That's quite impressive.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"Well, that was the whole act."
00:22:07,00:22:08,"When was it, sir?"
00:22:08,00:22:09,'20s?
00:22:09,00:22:11,Photos took a long time to expose back then to capture something.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"No, no, no, you had a flash photo in the '20s."
00:22:13,00:22:14,It might have been the '30s.
00:22:14,00:22:15,Exposure times were right down.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"Was he smiling in the photo, or was he serious?"
00:22:17,00:22:18,He was very serious.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"But his feet were slightly blurred, and that also gave away..."
00:22:21,00:22:23,"But also, I suppose Dan is right that the technology"
00:22:23,00:22:27,"must have been new enough that people didn't, like, catch on, right?"
00:22:27,00:22:28,"Didn't assume, yeah."
00:22:28,00:22:29,I guess.
00:22:29,00:22:30,"And it was also, even if you were in the room,"
00:22:30,00:22:33,"you'd see a tiny flash of light, and him..."
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Oh, so that would provide the light as well."
00:22:35,00:22:36,"Mid-jump, would they?"
00:22:36,00:22:37,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:37,00:22:40,"I always think that back in these olden days,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"the Seance days in the 1920s,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,it must have been so much darker than it is today.
00:22:45,00:22:47,I just think there was less natural light around.
00:22:47,00:22:49,"Maybe we didn't have a moon back then,"
00:22:49,00:22:52,because basically all the tricks they did
00:22:52,00:22:54,"were based on it being pitch black, so..."
00:22:54,00:22:56,"Maybe you have one candle, you know?"
00:22:56,00:22:57,"Just a bit of atmosphere, one candle."
00:22:57,00:22:59,"No, no, you can't have any candles."
00:22:59,00:23:01,"Well, because you had things like Seance trumpets,"
00:23:01,00:23:04,which were these trumpets through which the spirit spoke.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"They magnified their voices,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,"and they used to float around in the middle of the room,"
00:23:08,00:23:11,and they'd have glowing rings on their back end and front end.
00:23:11,00:23:14,And the way they floated was that a medium's assistant
00:23:14,00:23:17,"would just be holding it up, but he'd be wearing black,"
00:23:17,00:23:18,so no one would see.
00:23:18,00:23:22,"And it's like, ""How dark does it have to be that you can't see?"""
00:23:22,00:23:27,"And the ectoplasm, probably the best thing about all Seances,"
00:23:27,00:23:31,"the weird, like, physical manifestation of spirits,"
00:23:31,00:23:34,which was kind of white stuff.
00:23:34,00:23:35,Gooey stuff.
00:23:35,00:23:38,Gooey stuff that would come out of orifices of the medium.
00:23:38,00:23:42,"I mean, it's got to be pretty dark for you to think that's anything spooky,"
00:23:42,00:23:44,because usually it was handkerchiefs
00:23:44,00:23:48,that they would stick up their nose as far as they could
00:23:48,00:23:50,and then kind of pull out.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"There was one amazing medium, Mary M,"
00:23:52,00:23:57,who produced ectoplasm with photos of Arthur Conan Doyle on it.
00:23:57,00:24:00,"So she said, ""Arthur Conan Doyle's coming out of my nose."""
00:24:00,00:24:02,"It was after he died, ""Look at this,"""
00:24:02,00:24:06,"and then pulled this tissue out of her nose with a photo of him on it,"
00:24:06,00:24:09,which someone pointed out later was the same photo that had appeared
00:24:09,00:24:11,in a newspaper about a week earlier.
00:24:11,00:24:14,It'd obviously been stuck on people.
00:24:14,00:24:17,Arthur Conan Doyle solved an incredible case
00:24:17,00:24:22,"where someone was claiming that they'd contacted a celebrity from the other side,"
00:24:22,00:24:26,which was there was a book that was released called The Mystery of Edwin Druid.
00:24:26,00:24:28,We've spoken about it before on the podcast.
00:24:28,00:24:30,I actually wrote about this in my book as well.
00:24:30,00:24:31,I got obsessed with Seances.
00:24:31,00:24:32,What's that called then?
00:24:32,00:24:34,The theory of everything else out now.
00:24:34,00:24:37,It's actually available in Selected Stars.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"It's actually in most shots, so yeah,"
00:24:39,00:24:42,"and they have lots of copies, so if someone could find one."
00:24:42,00:24:44,"But no, I got obsessed with..."
00:24:44,00:24:47,"There was a period where there were people claiming,"
00:24:47,00:24:50,"because Seances were so massive that celebrities who were dead,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,"Mark Twain, Charles Dickens,"
00:24:52,00:24:56,"they were dictating from the other side new novels, new works,"
00:24:56,00:24:59,and they would go on sale by real publishers and people would buy them.
00:24:59,00:25:01,They'd be reviewed in The New York Times.
00:25:01,00:25:04,"Even if skeptically, they got sort of space."
00:25:04,00:25:07,And there was one book which was The Mystery of Edwin Druid.
00:25:07,00:25:10,"It was the final Charles Dickens book that he never finished,"
00:25:10,00:25:13,and he didn't leave any notes of what had happened to the character
00:25:13,00:25:15,and who had killed Edwin Druid.
00:25:15,00:25:22,So a guy called TP James actually finished the book by contacting Dickens from the other side.
00:25:22,00:25:24,"And he said, ""This is the final book."""
00:25:24,00:25:25,They published it.
00:25:25,00:25:29,There was a new forward written by Dickens as well to explain the process.
00:25:29,00:25:31,They had a new book that they were working on together
00:25:31,00:25:34,called The Life and Adventures of Buckley Whippleheap.
00:25:34,00:25:36,It was a very exciting thing.
00:25:36,00:25:41,And it was Arthur Conan Doyle who said he didn't contact Charles Dickens.
00:25:41,00:25:43,The reason Arthur Conan Doyle knew that
00:25:43,00:25:46,is because he himself did a seance in which he contacted Charles Dickens
00:25:46,00:25:48,"and asked him, ""Did you finish this book?"""
00:25:48,00:25:50,"And he said, ""No, it wasn't me."""
00:25:50,00:25:54,Just on the Ouija board.
00:25:54,00:25:55,"We're saying it right, Ouija?"
00:25:55,00:25:58,Ouija.
00:25:58,00:26:00,"Well, whenever I use them, I say Ouija."
00:26:00,00:26:03,"There's also the squeegee board, which is a whole thing."
00:26:03,00:26:06,"Anyway, so it was invented by someone called Helen Peters."
00:26:06,00:26:07,She was a medium.
00:26:07,00:26:09,And then there was an entrepreneur called William Fould
00:26:09,00:26:11,who took over the business.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"It was so popular, again, around the time of the 20s and 30s."
00:26:14,00:26:19,"At one point, he had several factories all just churning out Ouija boards."
00:26:19,00:26:22,They sold thousands and thousands of thousands of them.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"And he only sat up in such a big way because the board had told him,"
00:26:25,00:26:27,"""Prepare for big business."""
00:26:27,00:26:29,"So, yeah."
00:26:29,00:26:31,But this is the really spooky thing.
00:26:31,00:26:33,He went up on the roof of one of the factories
00:26:33,00:26:35,"to see a flagpole being replaced, right?"
00:26:35,00:26:38,And then he fell off and died.
00:26:38,00:26:39,"Oh, my God."
00:26:39,00:26:40,He just fell off.
00:26:40,00:26:41,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:41,00:26:42,OK.
00:26:42,00:26:44,And then he came back and said something.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"No, no, no, no."
00:26:46,00:26:48,"But he still makes you think, doesn't he?"
00:26:48,00:26:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:49,00:26:52,The reason I think that it's pronounced Ouija is there's a YouTuber
00:26:52,00:26:56,called Sexkick who went on to Yahoo Answers
00:26:56,00:27:00,and searched for various different spellings of Ouija board
00:27:00,00:27:03,"and found, ""How do you make a Ouija board?"
00:27:03,00:27:06,"""Have you played the Ouija board and can you burn the Ouija board?"""
00:27:06,00:27:08,"And it seems, and quite a lot more,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,and it seems like there's a lot of people in America
00:27:10,00:27:13,"who think that it's not a Ouija board, but a Ouija board."
00:27:13,00:27:14,It's really good.
00:27:14,00:27:15,It's coming through.
00:27:15,00:27:16,"""Who are you?"""
00:27:16,00:27:18,"""It's me!"""
00:27:18,00:27:20,[laughter]
00:27:20,00:27:29,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:27:29,00:27:33,"My fact this week is that according to his various biographers,"
00:27:33,00:27:38,"Pythagoras could talk with animals, be in two places at once,"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"had a shiny golden leg,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,and was able to tell fishermen the exact number of fish
00:27:44,00:27:47,they'd caught in their net just by looking at it.
00:27:47,00:27:48,So this was a side...
00:27:48,00:27:50,"I could do the last one, I reckon."
00:27:50,00:27:51,Well...
00:27:51,00:27:52,It depends how many there are.
00:27:52,00:27:53,Yeah.
00:27:53,00:27:55,"It depends on the... Maybe not a trawler, then."
00:27:55,00:27:57,[laughter]
00:27:57,00:27:58,Two.
00:27:58,00:27:59,[laughter]
00:27:59,00:28:01,"Screw you, Pythagoras."
00:28:01,00:28:06,I'm genuinely really shocked that we've done 400-plus episodes
00:28:06,00:28:08,"and we've never ever mentioned Pythagoras,"
00:28:08,00:28:12,"and I'm doubly shocked that after all the years of us doing this stuff,"
00:28:12,00:28:16,I didn't realise what a mad life he supposedly had
00:28:16,00:28:18,according to the stories of his life.
00:28:18,00:28:21,"We all know him for his theorem, very famously."
00:28:21,00:28:23,"He was a mathematician, he was a philosopher."
00:28:23,00:28:25,I didn't realise there was a cult around him
00:28:25,00:28:28,that sort of put him into a sort of paranormal territory
00:28:28,00:28:32,where he was able to reincarnate and be...
00:28:32,00:28:34,"He wasn't really a mathematician either, that's the word."
00:28:34,00:28:37,"I thought he was a mathematician, he was kind of a mystic"
00:28:37,00:28:40,and then cult leader and political figure.
00:28:40,00:28:43,"But the cult were very into numbers, weren't they?"
00:28:43,00:28:45,So that was part of it.
00:28:45,00:28:47,And numbers are very maths-related.
00:28:47,00:28:49,So they're maths-adjacent.
00:28:49,00:28:51,Not when you're doing algebra.
00:28:51,00:28:53,Great point.
00:28:53,00:28:55,"Oh, didn't you get a long way?"
00:28:55,00:28:57,[laughter]
00:28:57,00:28:59,Look who did GCSE!
00:28:59,00:29:02,"But no, he wasn't really a mathematician."
00:29:02,00:29:05,Pythagoras' theorem had been come up with about a thousand years before him.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"Oh, actually, related to the first-ever episode, we did a fish."
00:29:08,00:29:10,There's a Pythagoras fact.
00:29:10,00:29:13,"Yeah, one of the people who proved Pythagoras' theorem"
00:29:13,00:29:17,in a new way that had never been demonstrated before was...
00:29:17,00:29:19,- President Garfield. - President Garfield.
00:29:19,00:29:21,"- That's it, really. - That's it, yeah."
00:29:21,00:29:24,"Lying in that hospital bed, being fed through his arse,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,you've got to do something to distract yourself.
00:29:26,00:29:29,That's a confusing sentence if you haven't heard the first episode.
00:29:29,00:29:31,The first episode is a fish.
00:29:31,00:29:33,You'll just have to go back and listen.
00:29:33,00:29:35,"It's a great teaser, yeah."
00:29:35,00:29:37,"They were obsessed with numbers, as you say."
00:29:37,00:29:39,"And numbers, every number had a different personality."
00:29:39,00:29:43,"Now, I don't know, because I couldn't find out anywhere how high up this went,"
00:29:43,00:29:45,because it can't go forever.
00:29:45,00:29:50,"But masculine numbers are odd numbers, and feminine numbers are even."
00:29:50,00:29:52,Even are considered the only perfect numbers.
00:29:52,00:29:55,"Although odd ones are equated with divinity,"
00:29:55,00:29:58,so all the genders are doing well out of this.
00:29:58,00:30:01,"Oh, yeah, quite sweetly, the feminine number is two,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,"and the masculine number is three,"
00:30:03,00:30:05,and then five is the marriage number.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"But, yeah, all these numbers meant specific things to them."
00:30:08,00:30:11,"Yeah, it went about as... I think it went as far as ten."
00:30:11,00:30:14,Because they had to... How far is it?
00:30:14,00:30:16,They had this special thing where it's like...
00:30:16,00:30:18,"Can you imagine, like, a snooker ball triangle,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,"where you have one, then two, then three, then four,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,and that added up to ten.
00:30:22,00:30:24,This was very special to them.
00:30:24,00:30:26,"And they had a poem, or a hymn, really,"
00:30:26,00:30:29,"""Bless us, divine number, thou who generated gods and men,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,"""the mother of all, the all-comprising,"
00:30:31,00:30:34,"""the all-bounding, the firstborn, the never-swerving,"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"""the never-tiring, holy ten."""
00:30:37,00:30:39,"Right. Yeah, they love ten."
00:30:39,00:30:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:30:40,00:30:41,And they love triangles.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"Plague snooker must have been hell, actually."
00:30:43,00:30:44,Quite staggering.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"I get it, the right angle thing."
00:30:46,00:30:48,What do you guys think he was like?
00:30:48,00:30:51,"Like, let's imagine we're living in the time."
00:30:51,00:30:53,"OK, well, I can say so."
00:30:53,00:30:55,"Like, a lot of the things that you've said there"
00:30:55,00:30:58,"about the golden thigh and talking to animals,"
00:30:58,00:31:00,"they were written much, much later."
00:31:00,00:31:01,Exactly.
00:31:01,00:31:03,But some of the things that were written at the time
00:31:03,00:31:05,"when he was alive, they said that he did believe"
00:31:05,00:31:08,that the souls of humans could return as animals.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Yes.
00:31:09,00:31:11,So he did believe in reincarnation.
00:31:11,00:31:13,We know that because people said it at the time.
00:31:13,00:31:16,"And also that he, you know, he had his own kind of wisdom."
00:31:16,00:31:18,He had his own kind of learning.
00:31:18,00:31:20,So we know all that kind of stuff happened.
00:31:20,00:31:22,"Golden leg, maybe not."
00:31:22,00:31:25,"OK, so what about, is there a story about a dog?"
00:31:25,00:31:28,And he was passing someone in the street.
00:31:28,00:31:30,"He believed that, you know, people could come back"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"in the form of animals and all this, as you just said."
00:31:32,00:31:35,So he once stopped someone who was beating a small dog in the street
00:31:35,00:31:38,because he recognised in the barking...
00:31:38,00:31:40,You should be in the Colosseum.
00:31:40,00:31:43,"No, he recognised in the barking the voice of a friend of his"
00:31:43,00:31:45,"who died, who had then been reborn as a puppy."
00:31:45,00:31:46,Yeah.
00:31:46,00:31:48,The whole story does kind of imply that if he hadn't recognised
00:31:48,00:31:51,"the barking as a friend of his, he wouldn't have..."
00:31:51,00:31:53,...leave it. ...thought anything was a miss.
00:31:53,00:31:55,Must have been a bad dog. Just leave it.
00:31:55,00:31:58,But what does he then do with the dog?
00:31:58,00:32:01,You're turning this into a very different kind of talk show type
00:32:01,00:32:03,"of podcast, Jerry Springer style."
00:32:03,00:32:05,"We don't know what he was like. No, no, no."
00:32:05,00:32:07,"What's the dilemma? Sorry, this."
00:32:07,00:32:09,My friend is a dog.
00:32:09,00:32:11,My friend's a dog. Stop beating the dog.
00:32:11,00:32:13,"OK, I'll stop beating it. Wouldn't you be like,"
00:32:13,00:32:17,"""Greg, what's up? Come hang out. Have dinner at ours."""
00:32:17,00:32:19,"He's just going to be like, ""All right, see you, buddy."
00:32:19,00:32:21,"""Enjoy your new life."" Great to hang out."
00:32:21,00:32:25,"""Sucks you're a dog. Catch you later."""
00:32:25,00:32:28,Stop homing my leg. You never did that before.
00:32:30,00:32:34,"He did love numbers, but he hated irrational numbers,"
00:32:34,00:32:37,"or at least he didn't believe they existed, so..."
00:32:37,00:32:39,"Is that why they're called irrational,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,because he was so irrational about them?
00:32:41,00:32:43,He had an irrational loathing of them.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"Sorry, they're the ones that go on forever."
00:32:45,00:32:48,"So they're numbers that can't be expressed as a fraction or a ratio,"
00:32:48,00:32:51,"which I only realised when I was doing this research,"
00:32:51,00:32:55,"having to know this irrational I ratio,"
00:32:55,00:32:57,they're numbers that you can't express as a ratio.
00:32:57,00:33:00,"So five, six over two..."
00:33:00,00:33:02,"Yeah, you idiot. Can't believe we..."
00:33:02,00:33:04,Can't believe we were all thinking of that.
00:33:04,00:33:07,"So if you take 22 divided by seven,"
00:33:07,00:33:10,"it gets to quite close to 3.14 something,"
00:33:10,00:33:13,"but it doesn't get to pi, which is 3.141, blah, blah, blah, blah,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,which goes on forever.
00:33:15,00:33:17,And that would be an irrational number.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"And he didn't believe in them, because he loved finite numbers."
00:33:20,00:33:23,"And they were on a boat one day, on a cruise or something."
00:33:23,00:33:27,"And one of his followers, called Hepaceus,"
00:33:27,00:33:29,proved the existence of irrational numbers
00:33:29,00:33:31,"by saying the square root of two is one,"
00:33:31,00:33:35,"which not is one, is one, is one."
00:33:35,00:33:38,This is why I got no further than GCSE.
00:33:38,00:33:44,"And he, according to reports, was tossed overboard."
00:33:44,00:33:46,Yeah. Really?
00:33:46,00:33:48,So you've got to be careful with strict teachers.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"Wasn't they killed him? Yeah, they killed him, yeah."
00:33:50,00:33:52,They killed him for proving that the square root of two
00:33:52,00:33:54,"is an irrational number. Yeah. Supposedly, yeah."
00:33:54,00:33:56,But he had made him walk the plank.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"But he believed in reincarnation,"
00:33:58,00:34:00,so he probably thought he'd bump into him on the street.
00:34:00,00:34:02,"Greg! Greg, dude."
00:34:02,00:34:04,"I don't know what happened with my temper that day,"
00:34:04,00:34:07,"but, wow, it was a fun cruise, though, wasn't it?"
00:34:07,00:34:11,"When you joined his cult, you had to say nothing for five years,"
00:34:11,00:34:14,and that was how you got to the next level of the cult.
00:34:14,00:34:16,"OK. And also, he had..."
00:34:16,00:34:19,"If he'd had gone four years and 11 months,"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"that's a tough one, isn't it?"
00:34:21,00:34:23,And you bag your fart. Yeah.
00:34:23,00:34:26,"But he had a system for his followers, right?"
00:34:26,00:34:29,"So there were the Mathematikoi,"
00:34:29,00:34:31,"who were the senior followers, right?"
00:34:31,00:34:33,"And he would meet them in person,"
00:34:33,00:34:35,"and he would discuss proper maths with them, hard maths,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,"and, you know, they would think a lot,"
00:34:37,00:34:39,"and they'd do a lot of, you know, they'd do the big stuff."
00:34:39,00:34:41,And they had to make sacrifices.
00:34:41,00:34:43,They had to give up meat.
00:34:43,00:34:45,"Women, they're all men, and private possessions, OK?"
00:34:45,00:34:47,So that's the senior tier.
00:34:47,00:34:49,And they were touched white roosters.
00:34:49,00:34:51,Is that true? Yeah.
00:34:51,00:34:53,Wow. OK.
00:34:53,00:34:55,I'm out.
00:34:55,00:34:57,"You'll have to give up meat, women, and private possessions."
00:34:57,00:34:59,"Fine, fine. Anything else?"
00:34:59,00:35:01,There's one thing. I'm out.
00:35:01,00:35:03,"A couple more rules. OK, yeah."
00:35:03,00:35:05,Don't eat your brain.
00:35:05,00:35:07,Don't eat your brain.
00:35:07,00:35:09,"Couldn't find out really anything else,"
00:35:09,00:35:11,but I suppose that's all you need to know.
00:35:11,00:35:13,Don't break bread.
00:35:13,00:35:15,Don't poke fire with a sword.
00:35:15,00:35:17,Never urinate into the sun.
00:35:17,00:35:21,I've heard don't urinate into the wind.
00:35:21,00:35:25,Never into the sun. You might put it out.
00:35:25,00:35:29,"And we say that they couldn't eat any meat,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,"which was mostly true,"
00:35:31,00:35:33,but they did still sacrifice an oxen
00:35:33,00:35:35,whenever they proved a mathematical formula.
00:35:35,00:35:39,"Sorry, what am I being sacrificed for again?"
00:35:39,00:35:43,Normally it's to a piece of gold or something.
00:35:43,00:35:45,This doesn't sound important.
00:35:45,00:35:47,You're being put into a pie.
00:35:47,00:35:49,"Oh, my God."
00:35:49,00:35:53,That's sympathy.
00:35:53,00:35:55,No.
00:35:55,00:35:57,That's the best joke you'll hear for months.
00:35:57,00:35:59,"But then he also had these junior tier followers,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,"people who basically hadn't subscribed,"
00:36:01,00:36:03,and they were called the Akusmatikoi.
00:36:03,00:36:05,Is this like a Patreon?
00:36:05,00:36:07,It was a Patreon.
00:36:07,00:36:09,"It was genuinely he had a subscription service,"
00:36:09,00:36:11,"so the Mathematikoi were in,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,"and Akusmatikoi,"
00:36:13,00:36:15,he would only speak to them from behind a curtain.
00:36:15,00:36:17,Wow.
00:36:17,00:36:19,"And they weren't allowed to see his face,"
00:36:19,00:36:21,"and they couldn't learn any proper maths,"
00:36:21,00:36:23,like any detailed maths.
00:36:23,00:36:25,"That was really because he wasn't the real Wizard of Oz, was he?"
00:36:25,00:36:27,He was just an old man.
00:36:27,00:36:29,This thing of him hiding behind a curtain
00:36:29,00:36:31,"so that you couldn't see him as he was talking,"
00:36:31,00:36:33,there is one of the stories of his death
00:36:33,00:36:35,is directly associated with that.
00:36:35,00:36:37,So someone on the lower Patreon level
00:36:37,00:36:39,"was part of that,"
00:36:39,00:36:41,"couldn't see his face,"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"got so angry that he couldn't see him,"
00:36:43,00:36:45,was furious that he burnt down his house.
00:36:45,00:36:47,"Wait, Pythagoras' house?"
00:36:47,00:36:49,"He burnt Pythagoras' house down,"
00:36:49,00:36:51,and then he chased him into a field.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"So Pythagoras was in the lead,"
00:36:53,00:36:55,"he's going good, he gets to the field,"
00:36:55,00:36:57,"he's escaping this man, this is how the story goes,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,and then he notices that the field
00:36:59,00:37:01,"is full of beans,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,"and Pythagoras refuses to step on beans,"
00:37:03,00:37:05,"because he believes that beans,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,"much like dogs, are the reincarnation."
00:37:07,00:37:09,Reg?
00:37:09,00:37:11,I thought what you were going to say
00:37:11,00:37:13,is that the guys chasing him
00:37:13,00:37:15,went round two sides of the field
00:37:15,00:37:17,and he went diagonally across it.
00:37:17,00:37:21,So he gets to the field of beans
00:37:21,00:37:23,"and he stops and he thinks,"
00:37:23,00:37:25,"""I can't step on these beans,"
00:37:25,00:37:27,"I'll kill the beans with my feet."""
00:37:27,00:37:29,"So the man catches up, and rather than going,"
00:37:29,00:37:31,"""Fuck it, I'll just stamp on some beans,"""
00:37:31,00:37:33,he just stands there while the man cuts his throat
00:37:33,00:37:35,"and kills him, and that's the death of Pythagoras,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,according to one of many accounts.
00:37:37,00:37:39,I think there's another version of the story
00:37:39,00:37:41,where loads of his followers gave their own lives
00:37:41,00:37:43,"so that Pythagoras, ""Go, Pythagoras, go, go,"
00:37:43,00:37:45,"you must go, we'll give up our lives, well, we're killed."""
00:37:45,00:37:47,"And then he still gets to the head of the bean field,"
00:37:47,00:37:49,"""Listen, I can't do it."
00:37:49,00:37:51,I can sacrifice them.
00:37:51,00:37:53,"I can't sacrifice you, my beanie friends."""
00:37:53,00:37:59,He supposedly had the power
00:37:59,00:38:01,to write words on the face of the moon.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:03,00:38:05,And I forgot to write
00:38:05,00:38:07,anything more about that.
00:38:07,00:38:09,"I said,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"""Did he ever do that,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,"or was it just he had the power to..."""
00:38:13,00:38:15,"I have to tell you, Andy, power to the brain."
00:38:15,00:38:17,That's a single sentence there.
00:38:17,00:38:19,"And for just $2.99 a month,"
00:38:19,00:38:21,you'll be able to see the words I do write
00:38:21,00:38:23,on the face of the moon.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"All right, I need to move us on"
00:38:33,00:38:35,to our final fact of the show.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"It is time for our final fact,"
00:38:37,00:38:39,and that is James.
00:38:39,00:38:41,"OK, my fact this week is"
00:38:41,00:38:43,whenthewebsiteshealth.com
00:38:43,00:38:45,listed the fattiest foods
00:38:45,00:38:47,"in every state in the US,"
00:38:47,00:38:49,entrance included North Carolina's
00:38:49,00:38:51,"liver mush,"
00:38:51,00:38:53,"New York's garbage plate,"
00:38:53,00:38:57,and Indiana's fried brain sandwich.
00:38:57,00:38:59,"See, they never read Pythagoras"
00:38:59,00:39:01,anyway.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"So, yeah, this is a fact just about"
00:39:03,00:39:05,the disgusting things you can eat in America.
00:39:05,00:39:07,"Yeah, the fried brain sandwich sounds"
00:39:07,00:39:09,really weird.
00:39:09,00:39:11,The others are slightly euphemistic.
00:39:11,00:39:13,"Well, not even that you've missed it,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,but fried brain sandwiches are
00:39:15,00:39:17,literally exactly what they sound like.
00:39:17,00:39:19,Whose brain?
00:39:19,00:39:21,"Well, it used to be cow brains,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,"but after my cow disease came in,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,they're now pig brains.
00:39:25,00:39:27,"One little tip,"
00:39:27,00:39:29,"as in you put the breadcrumbs on there,"
00:39:29,00:39:31,"make sure you have cold hands,"
00:39:31,00:39:33,otherwise they can fall apart.
00:39:33,00:39:35,So that's a little bit of a tip.
00:39:35,00:39:37,The best place to get them is Hilltop Inn
00:39:37,00:39:39,"in Evansville,"
00:39:39,00:39:41,"and that has been dubbed recently,"
00:39:41,00:39:43,"in 2009, actually, the manliest restaurant"
00:39:43,00:39:45,in America.
00:39:45,00:39:47,Oh!
00:39:47,00:39:49,"I know I'm a man, but I don't actually want"
00:39:49,00:39:51,my restaurant to be manly.
00:39:51,00:39:53,It's not even in my top five criteria for a restaurant.
00:39:53,00:39:55,"Shall we go Indian, Chinese or Manly?"
00:39:55,00:39:57,Exactly!
00:39:57,00:39:59,"This list is incredible, though."
00:39:59,00:40:01,So you wrote out some of the
00:40:01,00:40:03,"most amazing sounding ones,"
00:40:03,00:40:05,"but even the other things on it,"
00:40:05,00:40:07,"the Colorado, the Jack and Grills 7-pound"
00:40:07,00:40:09,breakfast burrito is the least healthy food
00:40:09,00:40:11,"in Colorado. Connecticut, the two-foot-long"
00:40:11,00:40:13,"hot dog, and these aren't just in one place."
00:40:13,00:40:15,Lots of them are available in lots of different places.
00:40:15,00:40:17,Yeah.
00:40:17,00:40:19,There's the quadruple bypass burger.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"8,000 calories."
00:40:21,00:40:23,I've had some of one of them.
00:40:23,00:40:25,"How did you? Yeah, in Vegas, right?"
00:40:25,00:40:27,It's not impressive to have had some of one of them.
00:40:27,00:40:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:29,00:40:31,"They don't put your photo on the wall for that, mate."
00:40:31,00:40:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:33,00:40:35,They'll put some of your photo on the wall.
00:40:35,00:40:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:37,00:40:39,Did you hear about the Luther Burger?
00:40:39,00:40:41,"This is in Georgia, in the south."
00:40:41,00:40:43,"Right, it's a normal burger, the Luther Burger."
00:40:43,00:40:45,"It's a normal burger. It's got egg, it's got"
00:40:45,00:40:47,"bacon, and it's got cheese, as well as the burger."
00:40:47,00:40:49,"So far, so meh."
00:40:49,00:40:51,"But it's not served between a bun,"
00:40:51,00:40:53,do you guess?
00:40:53,00:40:55,"Luther, between two church doors."
00:40:55,00:40:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:57,00:40:59,Yeah.
00:40:59,00:41:01,"Between the north, it fills the gap"
00:41:01,00:41:03,between the north and south doors on the transept.
00:41:03,00:41:05,It's amazing.
00:41:05,00:41:07,"No, it's someone in the audience,"
00:41:07,00:41:09,"a mermaid, actually, it's between"
00:41:09,00:41:11,two Krispy Kreme glazed donuts.
00:41:11,00:41:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:13,00:41:15,And was that part of his Protestant theology?
00:41:15,00:41:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:17,00:41:19,The donut thing? It was the '96 theorem.
00:41:19,00:41:21,Right.
00:41:21,00:41:23,Shall I just quickly
00:41:23,00:41:25,"say the other two, very quickly?"
00:41:25,00:41:27,"Yeah, yeah. Sorry, liver mush"
00:41:27,00:41:29,is a savory slice
00:41:29,00:41:31,"loaf made from pork liver, scrap meat,"
00:41:31,00:41:33,"often from a pig's head,"
00:41:33,00:41:35,spices and cornmeal.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"Nice. Okay, and they have a liver mush"
00:41:37,00:41:39,eating contest
00:41:39,00:41:41,"in wherever it was, in North"
00:41:41,00:41:43,"Carolina, every year."
00:41:43,00:41:45,"They also have a liver mush pageant,"
00:41:45,00:41:47,but in last year's...
00:41:47,00:41:49,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:49,00:41:51,"Consisting of what? I mean, are there floats?"
00:41:51,00:41:53,It's... It really feels like
00:41:53,00:41:55,"putting lipstick on a pig, really,"
00:41:55,00:41:57,trying to make that attractive.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"It's basically a festival, and they have lots of things,"
00:41:59,00:42:01,but they have basically the local
00:42:01,00:42:03,children or young women
00:42:03,00:42:05,that kind of... Dresses liver mush.
00:42:05,00:42:07,They just dress as gobbles.
00:42:07,00:42:09,Is it like a liver mush queen? They often do that kind of thing.
00:42:09,00:42:11,"I think so, that's the kind of thing, yeah."
00:42:11,00:42:13,"And the liver mush eating contest,"
00:42:13,00:42:15,"where last year, the winner managed to eat some."
00:42:15,00:42:17,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:17,00:42:19,And garbage plate is from
00:42:19,00:42:21,"Rochester, New York, and it's basically..."
00:42:21,00:42:23,This actually sounds really good.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"It's a choice of any meats, so"
00:42:25,00:42:27,"even though I am vegetarian, but let's pretend"
00:42:27,00:42:29,"I'm not. It's like hamburgers, hot dogs,"
00:42:29,00:42:31,"sausages, any kind of stuff."
00:42:31,00:42:33,"You shove a load of french fries on it,"
00:42:33,00:42:35,"shove a load of beans on it, macaroni cheese,"
00:42:35,00:42:37,and then cover it in a special sauce.
00:42:37,00:42:39,That actually sounds quite good to me.
00:42:39,00:42:41,Really depends on the special sauce.
00:42:41,00:42:43,"Yeah, it does well. I think it's hot sauce."
00:42:43,00:42:45,Okay. Yeah.
00:42:45,00:42:47,"We've mentioned it before, James,"
00:42:47,00:42:49,"you've been there, but I just"
00:42:49,00:42:51,"love reading about it every single time,"
00:42:51,00:42:53,"which is the Disgusting Food Museum in Malmo, Sweden."
00:42:53,00:42:55,And it just collects
00:42:55,00:42:57,"food that is utterly horrible,"
00:42:57,00:42:59,"and James, you tried a few things there,"
00:42:59,00:43:01,which tasted horrible.
00:43:01,00:43:03,I was reading an article by a guy who went there
00:43:03,00:43:05,"in 2019 called Arthur de Mayer,"
00:43:05,00:43:07,and he described...
00:43:07,00:43:09,He gave a bit more of a sort of explanation
00:43:09,00:43:11,"about these particular foods, so you can have"
00:43:11,00:43:13,an Icelandic shark dish there
00:43:13,00:43:15,"called hackarl, and he said"
00:43:15,00:43:17,it was eating it was like
00:43:17,00:43:19,gnawing on three-week-old cheese
00:43:19,00:43:21,from the garbage that had also been
00:43:21,00:43:23,pissed on by every dog in the neighbourhood.
00:43:23,00:43:25,That was one thing he had here.
00:43:25,00:43:27,"I had that there, by the way. Did you?"
00:43:27,00:43:29,"Yeah, I did. Did you vomit?"
00:43:29,00:43:31,"No, I didn't vomit at all from any of them,"
00:43:31,00:43:33,although I retched quite a lot.
00:43:33,00:43:35,Does that count? No.
00:43:35,00:43:37,But the hackarl one was funny because
00:43:37,00:43:39,the guy told me that it was
00:43:39,00:43:41,"that seeped in urine,"
00:43:41,00:43:43,"and I ate it, and you could really believe it."
00:43:43,00:43:45,It tasted... It did taste like piss.
00:43:45,00:43:47,"And then I actually put it in a QI script,"
00:43:47,00:43:49,and it turned out to be completely untrue.
00:43:49,00:43:51,"Oh, no."
00:43:51,00:43:53,"It was a natural, uriny taste that it had."
00:43:53,00:43:55,It didn't add any urine
00:43:55,00:43:57,"into it, and so we cut it, yeah."
00:43:57,00:43:59,There's another one.
00:43:59,00:44:01,The South Korean wine. Did you drink that?
00:44:01,00:44:03,"Actually, I think that's behind a sort of glass,"
00:44:03,00:44:05,because in order...
00:44:05,00:44:07,"Feces? You have fresh turds of children,"
00:44:07,00:44:09,specifically.
00:44:09,00:44:11,"And the owner of the museum,"
00:44:11,00:44:13,"one of the founders of the museum,"
00:44:13,00:44:15,he actually went about scooping up
00:44:15,00:44:17,his eight-year-old daughter's poo
00:44:17,00:44:19,in order to make this concoction.
00:44:19,00:44:21,That doesn't count. It's like if you're buying it
00:44:21,00:44:23,"from South Korea as a special thing,"
00:44:23,00:44:25,that's one thing. If you're actually making it
00:44:25,00:44:27,"from your own, that's different."
00:44:27,00:44:29,"But it says it has to be fresh,"
00:44:29,00:44:31,and no turd is going to be fresh
00:44:31,00:44:33,by the time it's gone from South Korea to Sweden.
00:44:33,00:44:35,I don't think turds are ever fresh.
00:44:35,00:44:37,They absolutely are.
00:44:37,00:44:39,They can be new.
00:44:39,00:44:41,No!
00:44:41,00:44:43,I see what you're saying.
00:44:43,00:44:45,"Like, if you're at a fresh deli,"
00:44:45,00:44:47,"you wouldn't expect to see it, would you?"
00:44:47,00:44:49,They're safe at least five days
00:44:49,00:44:51,after their best-before date. I'm telling you.
00:44:51,00:44:53,"OK, OK."
00:44:53,00:44:55,"Gosh. So, it's got slightly distracted"
00:44:55,00:44:57,"from this, because someone wrote in,"
00:44:57,00:44:59,"actually, to the podcast email account,"
00:44:59,00:45:01,"podcast@qi.com,"
00:45:01,00:45:03,and this is from Evelyn Keely.
00:45:03,00:45:05,And it's the...
00:45:05,00:45:07,Oklahoma has a state steak.
00:45:07,00:45:09,"You know, these official state things"
00:45:09,00:45:11,they have? Absolutely mad stuff.
00:45:11,00:45:13,"So, Oklahoma's state steak"
00:45:13,00:45:15,is the ribeye steak.
00:45:15,00:45:17,The state drink is milk.
00:45:17,00:45:19,"This is a complete brackets,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,"but they've got a state astronomical object,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,which is the rosette nebula
00:45:23,00:45:25,"5,000 light years away."
00:45:25,00:45:27,I've no idea why.
00:45:27,00:45:29,I feel like...
00:45:29,00:45:31,Such an unreciprocated relationship.
00:45:31,00:45:33,I know.
00:45:33,00:45:35,Twinned with.
00:45:35,00:45:37,"But they've also got, right, this is what"
00:45:37,00:45:39,"sort of brought me back to the actual fact,"
00:45:39,00:45:41,"which is the state meal, OK?"
00:45:41,00:45:43,And the state meal is this.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"It's some chicken fried steak,"
00:45:45,00:45:47,"followed by barbecued pork,"
00:45:47,00:45:49,"followed by fried okra, squash,"
00:45:49,00:45:51,"cornbread, grits,"
00:45:51,00:45:53,"corn, sausage with biscuits and gravy,"
00:45:53,00:45:55,"black-eyed peas, strawberries"
00:45:55,00:45:57,and pecan pie.
00:45:57,00:45:59,That's the state meal.
00:45:59,00:46:01,"Wow. A lot of that sounds good,"
00:46:01,00:46:03,just not in the course of one meal.
00:46:03,00:46:05,"Actually, just speaking of, like, many courses"
00:46:05,00:46:07,"with meals,"
00:46:07,00:46:09,there is a footballer called Robert Lewandowski
00:46:09,00:46:11,who plays for Poland.
00:46:11,00:46:13,"And whenever he eats a three-course meal,"
00:46:13,00:46:15,he always eats his dessert first.
00:46:15,00:46:17,Isn't that cool?
00:46:17,00:46:19,Does he have a reason for it? Yes.
00:46:19,00:46:21,"He's Benjamin Button, isn't he?"
00:46:21,00:46:25,"This is a new-ish kind of diet,"
00:46:25,00:46:27,and the idea is you eat
00:46:27,00:46:29,"a very fatty dessert,"
00:46:29,00:46:31,"and then you eat your main course,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,and then you eat your starter.
00:46:33,00:46:35,"And the idea is, what happens is,"
00:46:35,00:46:37,"if you eat a normal meal, you have your starter"
00:46:37,00:46:39,"and your main course, and then the dessert will come"
00:46:39,00:46:41,"and it looks really good, and you're like,"
00:46:41,00:46:43,"""Oh, go on, then I'll have it,"" and you find some extra space for it."
00:46:43,00:46:45,But people are less inclined to do that for their starter.
00:46:45,00:46:47,And they tend to choose
00:46:47,00:46:49,better main courses as well.
00:46:49,00:46:51,And so there was a study done
00:46:51,00:46:53,with people who were either told
00:46:53,00:46:55,"to eat in the normal order,"
00:46:55,00:46:57,or they could have a cheesecake
00:46:57,00:46:59,and then choose their main and choose their
00:46:59,00:47:01,"starter, or they could"
00:47:01,00:47:03,have some fruit and then choose their main
00:47:03,00:47:05,"and then their starter, and they found that the people"
00:47:05,00:47:07,who ate the cheesecake first
00:47:07,00:47:09,have 30% fewer calories
00:47:09,00:47:11,"than anyone else in their meal, and that includes"
00:47:11,00:47:13,the really fatty dessert that they had.
00:47:13,00:47:15,That's brilliant. That's amazing.
00:47:15,00:47:17,It's like a trick. It's like you're tricking your mind.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"We've just cracked it, haven't we?"
00:47:19,00:47:21,You've just cracked the whole food thing.
00:47:21,00:47:23,That's amazing.
00:47:23,00:47:25,The whole food thing.
00:47:25,00:47:27,Wow. If that works.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"You think I've had a sticky toffee pudding,"
00:47:29,00:47:31,so I think I'll just have a salad for the main. Thank you very much.
00:47:31,00:47:33,But do you want to finish your meal
00:47:33,00:47:35,"with a nice bowl of soup, or would you rather finish"
00:47:35,00:47:37,with a chocolate cake? I'd rather finish with a starter.
00:47:37,00:47:39,"A starter is everyone's favourite course, isn't it?"
00:47:39,00:47:41,"Oh, OK. No. See?"
00:47:41,00:47:43,"OK, way fewer than a third of the people"
00:47:43,00:47:45,in the room said yes.
00:47:45,00:47:47,"Sorry, that's not proof."
00:47:47,00:47:49,You've always got at least one answer.
00:47:49,00:47:51,You are one of those people who goes to a restaurant
00:47:51,00:47:53,and they have 12 starters.
00:47:53,00:47:57,Quiz question.
00:47:57,00:48:00,Can you guys name a processed food product
00:48:00,00:48:03,that the Earl of Sandwich was responsible for inventing?
00:48:03,00:48:05,OK.
00:48:05,00:48:07,We're not going to do that.
00:48:07,00:48:09,"I'm sorry, a processed product."
00:48:09,00:48:11,A food or drink product.
00:48:11,00:48:13,"Oh, fuck, I've given it away."
00:48:13,00:48:15,"Or drinks, did you say?"
00:48:15,00:48:17,"Yeah, follow that."
00:48:17,00:48:19,Is it a liquidized sandwich?
00:48:19,00:48:21,It's the M&S New Liquid Sandwich.
00:48:21,00:48:25,It's fizzy drinks.
00:48:25,00:48:27,What? Yeah.
00:48:27,00:48:29,"So, he commissioned Joseph Priestley, the chemist,"
00:48:29,00:48:31,to work on ways of making
00:48:31,00:48:33,stale water more palatable
00:48:33,00:48:35,and to keep water lasting longer because of ships.
00:48:35,00:48:37,"Ships would have stale water, it would go horrible."
00:48:37,00:48:39,"It's a problem, people don't want to drink their water on board,"
00:48:39,00:48:41,so they might be dehydrated.
00:48:41,00:48:43,"So he hired Joseph Priestley,"
00:48:43,00:48:45,and Joseph Priestley created carbonated water.
00:48:45,00:48:47,"And as a result,"
00:48:47,00:48:49,"it's slightly acidic, carbonated water,"
00:48:49,00:48:51,"so that means it's slightly antimicrobial,"
00:48:51,00:48:53,and it means it lasts longer.
00:48:53,00:48:55,So that is actually
00:48:55,00:48:57,the product that he is kind of responsible for.
00:48:57,00:48:59,"And the sandwich was way, way earlier,"
00:48:59,00:49:01,and he just popularized it.
00:49:01,00:49:03,You might remember this.
00:49:03,00:49:05,I got married in the room where he invented the sandwich.
00:49:05,00:49:07,Did you?
00:49:07,00:49:09,And that was such a cheap meal as well.
00:49:09,00:49:13,"Interesting fact, everyone,"
00:49:13,00:49:15,while you're eating your ham sandwich.
00:49:15,00:49:17,It's a homage.
00:49:17,00:49:19,And enjoy your glass of Coke.
00:49:19,00:49:23,"Can I just say, Andy..."
00:49:23,00:49:25,Crisps are available for purchase at the bar.
00:49:25,00:49:29,Which will be a meal deal which you can pay for when you leave.
00:49:29,00:49:31,"It's not a free wedding, I should have mentioned."
00:49:31,00:49:33,"Andy said to us before the show started,"
00:49:33,00:49:35,"""Guys, I'm going to tell a personal anecdote tonight."""
00:49:35,00:49:39,Was that your personal anecdote?
00:49:39,00:49:41,It was my personal anecdote.
00:49:41,00:49:43,"Pretty good, yeah, you see that?"
00:49:43,00:49:45,Nice!
00:49:45,00:49:47,He never tells anything.
00:49:47,00:49:49,That was huge insight.
00:49:49,00:49:51,It was very brave.
00:49:51,00:49:53,Well done.
00:49:53,00:49:55,The guy from the council made such heavy weather of it in the room on the day.
00:49:55,00:49:57,It was practically more of a sandwich talk than a wedding.
00:49:57,00:49:59,"It was most of the ceremony, yeah."
00:49:59,00:50:03,And do you wish to be sandwiched
00:50:03,00:50:05,between the holy laws of matrimony?
00:50:05,00:50:09,Can I just mention one other food?
00:50:09,00:50:11,American state food that I didn't know about.
00:50:11,00:50:13,"Again, we'll be very familiar to people from these places,"
00:50:13,00:50:15,"but in places like Oregon and Washington state,"
00:50:15,00:50:19,now it's spelled G-E-O-D-U-C-K.
00:50:19,00:50:25,G-E-O-D-U-C-K?
00:50:25,00:50:27,"Yeah, weird to start with."
00:50:27,00:50:29,"It's gooey duck, spelled completely the wrong way."
00:50:29,00:50:31,And I've never seen one.
00:50:31,00:50:33,They're the biggest burrowing clams in the world.
00:50:33,00:50:35,And they look...
00:50:35,00:50:37,"They've got kind of a normal, ish-sized clamshell"
00:50:37,00:50:39,about the size of your palm.
00:50:39,00:50:41,And then it looks like...
00:50:41,00:50:43,"Looks like a slug's coming out of it, right?"
00:50:43,00:50:46,"Yeah, but it looks like a slug who's tried on a dress."
00:50:46,00:50:48,12 sizes too small for it.
00:50:48,00:50:50,It's coming out of it.
00:50:50,00:50:52,You've got a slug the length of most of your arm
00:50:52,00:50:55,coming out of this bulging out of this tiny shell.
00:50:55,00:50:57,"I mean, it looks so phallic."
00:50:57,00:51:00,It's very hard to get around the fact that it is.
00:51:00,00:51:02,And this is a delicacy.
00:51:02,00:51:04,They live up to 150 years.
00:51:04,00:51:07,"And their entire lives are, they're born."
00:51:07,00:51:10,They burrow really deep with their shell into the sand.
00:51:10,00:51:12,And the reason they've got this huge phallus on them
00:51:12,00:51:14,is so that it can stick up and just pop out of the sand
00:51:14,00:51:16,on the bottom of the seabed
00:51:16,00:51:18,so it can collect up what it needs.
00:51:18,00:51:20,"Wait, the phallus is collected?"
00:51:20,00:51:22,"No, no, no. It's not a phallus. It looks like a phallus."
00:51:22,00:51:24,"Oh, sorry. I've got to go. Sorry."
00:51:24,00:51:26,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's that sweetest mouth."
00:51:26,00:51:28,And it's a...
00:51:28,00:51:30,It's a siphon.
00:51:30,00:51:33,And he's going to be doing some googling tonight.
00:51:36,00:51:38,It's a really creepy slogan. It's not a phallus.
00:51:38,00:51:40,It's a mouth.
00:51:40,00:51:42,I don't know why.
00:51:42,00:51:44,Whose slogan is that?
00:51:44,00:51:47,It's the slogan of the gooey duck.
00:51:47,00:51:49,"And, yeah, it's..."
00:51:49,00:51:51,So it's actually a siphon.
00:51:51,00:51:53,"So it sheds salty liquids, actually,"
00:51:53,00:51:56,"that it doesn't need any more, in fact, in water."
00:51:56,00:51:59,"I know it looks like a phallus, and it's shedding salty liquids."
00:51:59,00:52:02,"But I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, it is a mouth."
00:52:03,00:52:07,If a gooey duck looks like a phallus and quacks like a phallus...
00:52:07,00:52:12,"Look, we've run over. I need to wrap us up."
00:52:12,00:52:14,"OK, that is it. That is all of our facts."
