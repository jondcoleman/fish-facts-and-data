00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.860
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.540
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.460
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 from Up The Creek in Greenwich, London!

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.620
 (audience cheering)

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.460
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700
 I am sitting here with Anna Toshensky,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.900
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.460
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.740
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.420
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.840
 - My fact is that some shows at the Roman Coliseum

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.060
 featured sausage dogs.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.500
 (audience laughing)

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.240
 - People fighting sausage dogs?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.740
 - It's so unclear.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.700
 It's so unclear what the actual thing is.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.580
 Maybe.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.680
 I mean, the thing is they would be quite far away.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.980
 - You wouldn't get great visibility

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.820
 on a sausage dog from that distance.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.420
 If you were in the back, you'd have no idea

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.260
 what was going on.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.100
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 - But maybe it was a swarm of sausage dogs

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.380
 against one Christian.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.540
 You know, that is possible.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.180
 - Would you rather fight a thousand

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.620
 Christian-sized sausage dogs?

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.860
 (audience laughing)

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.580
 - A thousand Christian-sized sausage dogs?

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.180
 (audience laughing)

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 Or what?

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.460
 - Or not.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.660
 (audience laughing)

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.840
 - They often didn't get a choice.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.220
 Fun fact, in the Coliseum,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.880
 so we should say there's a study.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.000
 There's been an archeological study done recently

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 and these are Daxons, Vena dogs,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.880
 whatever you want to call them.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.160
 And they were the kind of precursor,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.760
 the prototypes of these dogs

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.440
 'cause the modern breed only emerged

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.960
 in about the 18th and 19th century.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.040
 But they were basically this kind of dog.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.760
 - If you went back in time when you saw one,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.920
 you would think it was a sausage dog.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.760
 - Exactly.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.280
 The thing is we genuinely don't know what they thought.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.600
 The archeologists have been crawling

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440
 in the sewers under the Coliseum for a year.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.120
 They spent a year crawling in the mud on their stomachs

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.420
 and they found lots of stuff.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.640
 They found seven coins,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.880
 which does not feel like a good return on investment.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.700
 - It's not a good wage, is it, for the year?

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 - And they found some bones.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.640
 They found some leopard bones.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.020
 They found some lions and ostrich bones.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.180
 But they also found these dogs.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.180
 And we don't know were they part of staged battles,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.100
 which is great fun, or were they acrobats,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.940
 which is also fun.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.780
 - Which is amazing.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.540
 - There isn't a slightly more boring explanation,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.340
 which is that they might have been used

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.940
 to kind of hunt rats.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.240
 - Okay, 'cause when you're at the Coliseum,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.840
 loads of people there, you're eating lots of snacks.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.320
 It could be that they tried to stop the rodents,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.800
 but I mean, I'd rather think of them as acrobats.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.040
 That's all speculation.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.680
 Did we not write stuff down back then?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.880
 Because I'm pretty sure we did.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.320
 How is it that sausage dogs have escaped history?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.160
 Yet we are--

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.000
 - That's a great question.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.720
 - There was a lot going on at the Coliseum.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.120
 It was some mad shit for about 500 years.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.960
 You couldn't write every single thing down every day.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.200
 - I'm sorry, if I walked out of the end of an evening

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.220
 at the Coliseum and I saw Gladiators fighting,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.060
 I'm not saying that.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.940
 I'm going, "Did anyone see the fucking sausage dog?"

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.940
 (laughing)

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.980
 - But no, but there was so much more weird stuff than that.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.340
 Like the real acrobats did amazing things.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.940
 And one of the frustrating things is

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.380
 we don't have that much information

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.820
 'cause people write about it in fragments.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.240
 Sometimes we've only got little bits of writing.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.020
 There was the Petaurus,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.100
 which the sources we have suggest was a giant seesaw.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.900
 And we think it was used at kind of half time

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.900
 in the Coliseum.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.060
 So there's huge seesaw and you'd have

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.920
 two opponents competing on either side.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.720
 And one would jump onto it

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.840
 and it would fling the other one up in the air.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.420
 I think about 30 feet in the air.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.540
 - No, stop it.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.700
 Stop it.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.520
 - Apparently they'd go through,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.080
 they'd go through hoops of flame,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.200
 I think one of the sources said.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.280
 And then come back down.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.560
 Then the other one gets flung in the air.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.160
 There is an account of them falling

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.520
 to their death sometimes, as will happen.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.600
 - Wasn't there an account of them putting criminals on there?

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.440
 - Yeah.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.480
 - And the idea is the lions come in, right?

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.640
 And they're going to attack the guy

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.280
 who's the bottom of the seesaw.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.120
 So you're always trying to get to the top of your seesaw

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.960
 so that he's at the bottom.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.160
 - I think that sometimes is speculated

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.720
 that that might be what they were used for.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.560
 - It is, but the suggestion, the problem is,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.560
 as soon as the other guy gets eaten,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.600
 you're fucked, aren't you?

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.400
 - Yeah.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.800
 - The weird thing is, this is all the half time shows though.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.280
 Lots of what we're talking about now

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.240
 is the half time shows in between,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.800
 what, "Jarriot Races?"

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.680
 And then maybe other five and the gladiators.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.600
 - A lot of the damnatio ad bestias,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.680
 so being killed by wild animals basically,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.840
 organized by a group of people called the bestiary.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.720
 There are lots of sources claiming that the bestiary

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.920
 were incredible trainers of animals

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.360
 and they would train animals to kill people

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.800
 in incredibly elaborate ways

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.400
 that referenced myths for people.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.520
 So they would recreate death scenes.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.960
 You guys remember the story of Prometheus?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.320
 He stole fire from the gods and then he was punished.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.640
 He was chained to a rock and a liver would fly down every day.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.640
 And peck out his eagle.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.640
 Uh...

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.640
 Ah!

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.640
 So, eagle would fly down every day.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.640
 - But they recreated it the opposite way round.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.640
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.640
 Supposedly one bestiarius spent months and months

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.640
 training a single eagle to remove a man's organs.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.640
 - Wow, really? - I can't believe that's true.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640
 - Wow. - Like, yeah.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.640
 - The half time shows sounded amazing.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.640
 They kind of sound like a modern half time show

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.640
 of, let's say, a basketball,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.640
 if you watch American basketball. - A Super Bowl, maybe?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.640
 - A Super Bowl. Like, it's really show-stoppy kind of stuff.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.640
 So they would do things where snacks would fall from the sky

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.640
 and including from... I mean, they're not from the clouds, obviously,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.640
 but they were sort of launched,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.640
 kind of like how the people that would stand in the middle

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.640
 and shoot out t-shirts out of rockets.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.640
 - They had a toga cannon? - Exactly, so they had this...

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.640
 Yeah, well...

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.640
 What they actually had, though, which is amazing,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.640
 is you got this wooden ball where, on the inside,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.640
 you would win something like a t-shirt or...

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.640
 But I know they didn't have t-shirts, so it was very progressive.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.640
 No, but it would be food or it would be money,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.640
 it would even be the deeds to a house, you know, or an apartment.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.640
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.640
 So a lot of people really fought over it.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.640
 - But were there bad things in the balls, as well? - No, I don't know.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.640
 - So, like, if you open the bowl, you might get a t-shirt

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.640
 or it might be you have to go on the seesaw.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.640
 - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.640
 - That did sound pretty cool, though, didn't it? - Yeah.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.640
 They had, possibly, we think,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.640
 like, the spectators would have water sprinkled on them.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.640
 - Oh, yeah. - 'Cause they had toilets with running water.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.640
 So they would kind of get the water from the river

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.640
 and kind of get it to go through the stadium

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.640
 and go through where all the toilets are.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.640
 But they also had huge...

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.640
 We think because they had this in pool and we haven't seen it

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.640
 in the Coliseum, but it's very, very similar.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.640
 They had huge, huge towers with loads of water in,

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.640
 and that water would kind of sprinkle over everyone

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640
 to keep them cool.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.640
 And they also had a retractable roof.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.640
 - No, this is amazing. - I know they were

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.640
 more than 2,000 years ahead of Wimbledon.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.640
 - I know. - It's so amazing, isn't it?

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.640
 - There we go again. - Yeah.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.640
 - They just had a cabbage roof that they could bring over

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.640
 whenever it got too hot or cold.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.640
 - Yeah, the Valerium, I think,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.640
 and it was operated by about 1,000 sailors

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.640
 who would pull on the ropes,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.640
 'cause they used to pulling on rope sailors.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.640
 But, yeah, and you'd have advertising up,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.640
 and we've got the...

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.640
 I want to say etchings in the stones,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.640
 but we've got the evidence that you'd advertise

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.640
 "There will be shade, vela errant."

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.640
 You know, "There will be shade for you."

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.640
 It's incredible.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.640
 Although Caligula liked to wind it back

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.640
 so he could watch people just boil up.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.640
 - Oh, yeah. - There's the watch.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.640
 - Absolutely classic Caligula. - Yeah.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.640
 - It sounded hectic working there, though,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.640
 because basically you could be a part of the show

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.640
 if anything went wrong, if the emperor decided.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.640
 So Claudius in particular.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.640
 There was a biographer called Suetonius

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.640
 who wrote about the fact that Claudius,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.640
 if he was watching a show,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.640
 and something went slightly wrong,

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.640
 and everything was operated underneath

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.640
 in terms of if the gladiators were fighting.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.640
 All the animals that came up into the stadium,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.640
 they were all in the hypergeum, which was underneath,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.640
 which is this extraordinary, kind of like the backstage

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.640
 of a theater where they have just a crazy amount of stuff

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.640
 that you wouldn't realize to make shows happen.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640
 That was happening underneath.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.640
 And so if something went wrong

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.640
 where something came up at the wrong time

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.640
 and it pissed off the emperor, he would just say,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.640
 "Whoever the staff is down there, they're now in the show.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.640
 Get them up there to fight the lions."

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.640
 - Shit. - Anything that went wrong.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.640
 If the catering went wrong, get the caterers in there.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.640
 So he just kept adding people to be killed in the...

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.640
 - Right. Sounds great. - I heard that sometimes

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.640
 hecklers would be thrown to wild animals.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.640
 - Really? - That's fair enough.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.640
 We should start that.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.640
 I like the hypergeum because it's like whack-a-mole, isn't it?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.640
 Because a lion would pop up somewhere,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.640
 and then you had to go and fight it,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.640
 and then some monkeys, and then a...

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.640
 - Sausage dog. - Sausage dog.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.640
 But the whole point was that there wasn't spots

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.640
 you knew that they would pop up.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.640
 There were so many spots that, like the whack-a-mole,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.640
 you could be facing this way, expecting a lion,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.640
 and then it comes behind you.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.640
 Apparently, the system to bring them up sometimes

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.640
 was so supercharged that the lion would be lobbed into the...

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.640
 - Stop it. Come on. - That's an account I read.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.640
 Oh, my God.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.640
 There's so much speculation about this stuff.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.640
 It's amazing.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.640
 The best seats were reserved for the emperor

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.640
 and the Vestal Virgins.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.640
 They got the best seats, and then if you went a little bit higher up,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.640
 you would get the senators,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.640
 and then you would get the knights and the nobles,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.640
 and then the very, very furthest strata was for commoners.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.640
 And then they built one more,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.640
 even right at the very, very back strata.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.640
 Do you know who that was for?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.640
 - A commonist. - What did you say?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.640
 Women is exactly right.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640
 - Oh, really? - Yeah.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.640
 - I'm afraid so. - 'Cause they gave us the best seat.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.640
 Well, yes, exactly.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.640
 You wouldn't be able to see the sausage, Doug,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.640
 unless it was flung really high.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.640
 It seated 50,000 people, the Coliseum, roughly,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.640
 and I went to Wembley to see a show,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.640
 and that gives you...

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.640
 If you were watching a sausage dog down, as you said,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.640
 'cause I went to see Billy Joel at Wembley,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.640
 and my wife booked me this ticket as part of a Christmas present,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.640
 and I said, "What are the seats like?"

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.640
 She said, "I didn't really check. I'm sure they're good."

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.640
 You couldn't be further away from Billy Joel as possible.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.640
 It was so far away that when the gig was playing,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.640
 we could hear the song and the screens that allowed us to see him,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.640
 which genuinely, he's sausage dog-sized at that distance.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.640
 It was out of sync with the visuals,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.640
 and I was like, "Oh, my God, Billy's gonna be so angry

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.640
 because, you know, there's so much money spent."

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.640
 That's how far away we were.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.640
 Sound and vision were traveling at a different rate

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.640
 that they were not in sync.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.640
 So if you counted the number of seconds between the time he opened his mouth

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.640
 and the time you saw it, you could tell how far away he was.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.640
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.640
 You could tell when you're gonna get struck by lightning.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.640
 That's right.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.640
 Well, you say 50,000 sounds big,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.640
 but I just don't think we ever make a big enough deal of the fact

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.640
 that this Coliseum basically replaced Circus Maximus,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.640
 which was its predecessor,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.640
 sat 250,000 people, still the biggest ever stadium.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.640
 It's just, I find that just amazing.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.640
 What was that?

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.640
 That was Rome as well, but it was, you know, they got bored of it.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.640
 That was where they had lots of chariot races

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.640
 and then chucked the Coliseum in,

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.640
 which they never called the Coliseum.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.640
 They called it the Flavian Amphitheater,

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.640
 and we think the reason they changed the name is quite funny.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.640
 So it started being called the Coliseum in sort of early medieval times,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.640
 and we believe it's because the Colossus at the time

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.640
 was the Colossus of Nero,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.640
 this gigantic 100-foot tall classic Nero statue of him,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.640
 which had, as Nero went out of fashion, its head kept changing,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640
 so whatever emperor was in power at the time,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.640
 they'd shove his head on the statue.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.640
 And eventually someone wrote a poem about the Colossus saying,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.640
 "So long as the Colossus stands, Rome shall stand.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.640
 "When the Colossus falls, Rome too shall fall,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.640
 "and when Rome falls, so falls the world."

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.640
 And then almost immediately after that was written and published,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.640
 the Colossus fell, and we think they went,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.640
 "Well, shit, everyone's going to think the world's going to end.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.640
 "We better change what the Colossus is."

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.640
 And so then we think they named the Coliseum, the Coliseum,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.640
 because it was right nearby, and they said,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640
 "Let's just pretend."

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.640
 Wow.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.640
 That's really cool.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.640
 I've got some stuff on sausage dogs.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640
 Of course you do.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640
 Sorry.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640
 Very nice.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640
 We've actually got to move on.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.640
 No, no, absolutely not.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.640
 Absolutely not.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.640
 Don't go near it.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.640
 I thought this fact would go in a very different direction.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.640
 I've basically only got sausage dog stuff now.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.640
 Do you guys know where the sausage dog capital of the world is?

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640
 Oh.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.640
 It's not in Germany.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640
 No, it's as of this year.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.640
 It's in the UK.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640
 Oh.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.640
 It's almost totally ungettable.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640
 Is it Maidstone?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.640
 It's on the coast.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.640
 Unlike Maidstone.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.640
 Is it?

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.640
 No, it's not.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.640
 I don't even know why I say it.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.640
 It was in Southwold this year in Suffolk.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.640
 They had, well, a lot of, you know...

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.640
 Push people in the audience.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.640
 This year at Southwold hosted

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.640
 the world's largest ever single breed dog walk

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.640
 when 2,238 sausage dogs turned up for a walk.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.640
 Whoa.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640
 At the same time.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.640
 That's a lot.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.640
 The size of one gladiator Christian.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.640
 You said turned up.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.640
 Like, A, there were posters up around town

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.640
 and the dogs just trotted up on their own.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.640
 I know.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.640
 And they had one person to walk all of them.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.640
 It was a nightmare.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.640
 Do you want to hear a fact that's not about Dachshunds?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.640
 Yeah, and then we need to move on.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640
 Okay, okay.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.640
 So, I was reading an article in researching this about a Dachshund

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.640
 which was caught on CCTV in Germany

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.640
 and it was the only police lead for a case, a crime case,

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.640
 because it had an unusual lead.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.640
 And they couldn't see the face of the criminal

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.640
 and they could only see the lead on the Dachshund.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640
 And that was the...

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640
 So, it was such a confusing case.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640
 Do we have any leads?

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.640
 Yes, we've got this one lead, of course you.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.640
 But I only mentioned this because of the final paragraph,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.640
 which I loved, but is not Dachshund related,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640
 but it was in this story.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.640
 So, here I'm just going to read it verbatim.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.640
 It may not be the first time a pet has provided key evidence.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.640
 In 2017, a woman in Michigan was convicted of killing her husband

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.640
 partly on the testimony from their parrot,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.640
 which kept repeating, "Don't shoot in the dead man's voice."

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.640
 Oh, spooky.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.640
 In his voice.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.640
 Supposedly in his voice.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.640
 I've never heard a parrot that can do voices, but this one can.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.640
 Wow, amazing.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.640
 But he didn't say, "Don't shoot Mabel," did he?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.640
 So, we don't know who he was talking to.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.640
 How did that help convict her?

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.640
 Okay, well, tune in to Anna's new true crime podcast

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.640
 where she frees this woman.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640
 LAUGHTER

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:27.640
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.640
 My fact this week is that in the 1920s,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.640
 spiritualists started complaining

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.640
 that Tutankhamun was appearing at their seances too often.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.640
 It's just sort of spamming them.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.640
 Was he disruptive, or was it just, there's too much of this?

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640
 Sometimes.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.640
 Yeah, he seemed to have quite bad mood swings,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640
 which I guess he was a teenager.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.640
 So, this was...

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.640
 Go to your pyramid.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.640
 No!

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.640
 Fuck, go to your tomb!

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640
 Sorry, there we go.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:06.640
 This was in Tutankhamun's second heyday,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.640
 which was the 1920s, I guess.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.640
 So, his tomb was discovered in 1922.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.640
 It was this huge deal, and he became this massive celebrity.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.640
 Obviously, no one had ever heard of him before this.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.640
 And at the same time, seances were very popular.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.640
 Spiritualism was very popular, and so he kept on popping up,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.640
 and there was an edition of a journal called "Light",

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.640
 a journal of spiritual progress and physical research.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.640
 And a letter in it said,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.640
 "We are getting a little tired of Tutankhamun.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.640
 "Messages purporting to be from him,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.640
 "which consists of vague generalities,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.640
 "are quite worth as anyone could compose them."

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.640
 And saying, basically, you know,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.640
 either give us good evidence of your identity,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.640
 I don't know how, write some hieroglyphics or something.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.640
 They're hard to do on a Ouija board.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.640
 You need the expansion pack for that.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.640
 You do, yeah.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.640
 You need the right font, don't you?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.640
 Some wing-dings on that.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.640
 Yeah, they said we don't want just random celebrities claiming to turn up.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.640
 Either we want the good evidence,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.640
 or we want their message to be of such high quality

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.640
 that their identity becomes unimportant.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.640
 Some very fine teaching comes from these visitors,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.640
 and it's being spoiled by Tutankhamun.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.640
 And the thought was, wasn't it,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.640
 that the reason he started coming up because of this heyday thing

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.640
 is because the attention was so great on him

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.640
 that he was, like, invoked back into existence.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.640
 That was the excuse, wasn't it?

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.640
 Yeah, rather than why has Tutankhamun not been, like,

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.640
 breaking into everyone's seance prior to that,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.640
 it's because, well, he didn't know he was needed prior to that.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.640
 They were claiming he was a bit of an eugotistical attention seeker,

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.640
 and so he was up there, like, "Well, no one cares about me,"

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.640
 and then they started caring, so he decided,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.640
 "Fine, I'll come and visit him."

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.640
 So what was he saying? What were the messages he was bringing?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.640
 So sometimes he was angry, his tomb had been violated,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.640
 and he would smash everything up.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.640
 He injured a medium.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.640
 He broke lots of Egyptian sculptures that were in the room.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.640
 And then sometimes he was a nice guy.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.640
 He really depended.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.640
 I wonder who a modern equivalent of that would be,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.640
 as in someone who's very, very famous.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.640
 Well, in 2003, there was a pay-per-view Princess Diana seance.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.640
 I don't know if you remember that.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.640
 2003, God.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.640
 Yeah, but pay-per-view.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.640
 Why do you sound appalled at pay-per-view?

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.640
 Because it's event television, it was sort of...

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.640
 Not only would it be a huge event that you would have pay-per-view,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.640
 because, you know...

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640
 Got it.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.640
 Right.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.640
 But you're saying it should have been BBC, then?

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.640
 License fee only.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.640
 Prime time.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.640
 Absolutely.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.640
 Budget cuts for the BBC, they just can't afford it.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.640
 But check this out.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.640
 This is a seance that I'd never heard of before.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.640
 This was a medium who was quite famous, called Lillian Bailey.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.640
 And she claimed that she had a spirit guide

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.640
 who was called William Headley Wooten.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.640
 And he was a captain during World War I.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.640
 He died in World War I.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.640
 And she would use him in order to bring other people to talk.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.640
 And she received a request one day to go and do a seance.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.640
 But they said, "It's a bit high-profile, the person.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.640
 So what we're going to do is we're going to pick you up from your place.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.640
 We're going to blindfold you, and we're going to take you to the place."

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.640
 So she was sat around the table,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.640
 and then she wasn't allowed to take the blindfold off.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.640
 So she did it.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.640
 And at the end of it, having contacted someone,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.640
 she took the blindfold off and sitting in front of her

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.640
 was Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, the Queen Mother,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.640
 and a few other of the royals.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.640
 And what it was is it was not long after the King had died,

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.640
 and the Queen Mother was obsessed with the idea of contact.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.640
 So the Queen was at a seance.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.640
 Can you imagine taking that blindfold off?

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.640
 Bloody hell.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.640
 And she just slowly put it back on.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.640
 Take me home.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.640
 But she kind of used that in the future as a kind of,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.640
 she's the Queen's official medium.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.640
 Well, you were, didn't you?

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.640
 Yeah, yeah, by royal appointment.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.640
 That's who she said she was.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.640
 And the Queen Mother often would book sessions with her afterwards

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640
 to try and do it.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.640
 And the person who set it up, which was not in the movie,

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.640
 was a man called Lionel Logue,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.640
 who was the therapist who treated the King for his stammer

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.640
 in the King's speech.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.640
 Right.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640
 He's the one who set up the seance.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640
 Wow, they should have put that in.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.640
 Yeah, what a scene.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.640
 Oh my God.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.640
 Do you speak in a seance when you're one of the guests,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640
 or do you only speak when you're the medium?

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.640
 You're not really supposed to, yeah.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.640
 Okay.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.640
 I just thought, because that would have given it away,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.640
 not enough people speak like the Queen and Prince Philip

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.640
 and the Queen Mum to conceal your identity.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.640
 Maybe they'd put an accent on.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.640
 Not like an Aussie accent, no?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.640
 Yeah, a cockney Irish or something.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.640
 Yeah.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.640
 German.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640
 Sure.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:42.640
 Whatever their best at.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640
 Actually, speaking of Germans,

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.640
 there was a big thing in the war, wasn't there,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.640
 where there was a medium called Helen Duncan.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.640
 And she was a Scottish 25-stone working-class mother of six

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.640
 who swore, smoked and drank whiskey.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.640
 She sounds great, right?

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.640
 But at the time, she was late in the upper classes in London.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.640
 They thought she was an absolute genius.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.640
 They thought that she could speak to the dead.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.640
 She was really, really important in the high society.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.640
 And then in 1941, she was in a seance in Portsmouth,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.640
 and she claimed the spirit of a sailor told her

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.640
 that a certain ship had been sunk.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.640
 And it turned out that that ship had been sunk,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.640
 but it hadn't been reported yet.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.640
 And so, obviously, she became...

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.640
 They were really worried about her.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.640
 First of all, maybe, you know, she is somehow getting messages

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.640
 from the dead, or maybe she's getting messages from the Germans,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.640
 or...

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.640
 Yeah, they thought she might be a spy who was ceding the information.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.640
 And of course, she got done for witchcraft.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.640
 Yeah, she was the last person, or the second last person,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.640
 the last person to be imprisoned under the Witchcraft Act.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.640
 But she got imprisoned under the Witchcraft Act of 1735.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.640
 So what was she being imprisoned for?

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.640
 Being a witch.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.640
 It's absolutely incorrect.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.640
 Not being a witch.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.640
 That's absolutely right.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640
 Oh!

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.640
 So the Witchcraft Act of 1735

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.640
 was not about persecuting witches.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.640
 It was the first act that acknowledged witches are not real,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.640
 and so people pretending to be witches

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.640
 are the ones who need to be punished now for faking it.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.640
 And so she was punished for pretending to be a witch.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640
 That's brilliant.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.640
 God, that's a real catch-22 situation as well.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.640
 Yeah, it is, isn't it?

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.640
 Have you guys heard of Colin Evans?

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.640
 No.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.640
 He was a Welsh spiritualist in, I think, the 1920s,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.640
 and his big thing was claiming that he could levitate.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.640
 So he would get an audience, probably an audience around this size,

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640
 a few hundred people.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.640
 He would request the room went completely dark.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.640
 The audience would sit around him and pitch blackness,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.640
 and they would chant, they would all chant the same thing,

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.640
 an incredible atmosphere, something amazing to be proud of.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.640
 Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.640
 Now the lights down?

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.640
 No.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.640
 It was completely dark, and then he provided proof of it.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.640
 He would take photos of himself at the very moment

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.640
 where he was levitating.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.640
 But the thing is, he was just jumping.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:04.640
 He would just jump, take the photo, and then land.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640
 That's quite impressive.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.640
 Well, that was the whole act.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640
 When was it, sir?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.640
 '20s?

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.640
 Photos took a long time to expose back then to capture something.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.640
 No, no, no, you had a flash photo in the '20s.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.640
 It might have been the '30s.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.640
 Exposure times were right down.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.640
 Was he smiling in the photo, or was he serious?

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.640
 He was very serious.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.640
 But his feet were slightly blurred, and that also gave away...

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.640
 But also, I suppose Dan is right that the technology

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.640
 must have been new enough that people didn't, like, catch on, right?

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.640
 Didn't assume, yeah.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640
 I guess.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.640
 And it was also, even if you were in the room,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.640
 you'd see a tiny flash of light, and him...

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.640
 Oh, so that would provide the light as well.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640
 Mid-jump, would they?

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.640
 I always think that back in these olden days,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.640
 the Seance days in the 1920s,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.640
 it must have been so much darker than it is today.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.640
 I just think there was less natural light around.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.640
 Maybe we didn't have a moon back then,

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.640
 because basically all the tricks they did

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.640
 were based on it being pitch black, so...

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.640
 Maybe you have one candle, you know?

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.640
 Just a bit of atmosphere, one candle.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.640
 No, no, you can't have any candles.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.640
 Well, because you had things like Seance trumpets,

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.640
 which were these trumpets through which the spirit spoke.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.640
 They magnified their voices,

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.640
 and they used to float around in the middle of the room,

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.640
 and they'd have glowing rings on their back end and front end.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.640
 And the way they floated was that a medium's assistant

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.640
 would just be holding it up, but he'd be wearing black,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.640
 so no one would see.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.640
 And it's like, "How dark does it have to be that you can't see?"

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.640
 And the ectoplasm, probably the best thing about all Seances,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.640
 the weird, like, physical manifestation of spirits,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.640
 which was kind of white stuff.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.640
 Gooey stuff.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.640
 Gooey stuff that would come out of orifices of the medium.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.640
 I mean, it's got to be pretty dark for you to think that's anything spooky,

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.640
 because usually it was handkerchiefs

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.640
 that they would stick up their nose as far as they could

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.640
 and then kind of pull out.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.640
 There was one amazing medium, Mary M,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.640
 who produced ectoplasm with photos of Arthur Conan Doyle on it.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.640
 So she said, "Arthur Conan Doyle's coming out of my nose."

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.640
 It was after he died, "Look at this,"

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.640
 and then pulled this tissue out of her nose with a photo of him on it,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.640
 which someone pointed out later was the same photo that had appeared

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.640
 in a newspaper about a week earlier.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.640
 It'd obviously been stuck on people.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.640
 Arthur Conan Doyle solved an incredible case

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.640
 where someone was claiming that they'd contacted a celebrity from the other side,

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.640
 which was there was a book that was released called The Mystery of Edwin Druid.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.640
 We've spoken about it before on the podcast.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.640
 I actually wrote about this in my book as well.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640
 I got obsessed with Seances.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.640
 What's that called then?

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.640
 The theory of everything else out now.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.640
 It's actually available in Selected Stars.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.640
 It's actually in most shots, so yeah,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.640
 and they have lots of copies, so if someone could find one.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.640
 But no, I got obsessed with...

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.640
 There was a period where there were people claiming,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.640
 because Seances were so massive that celebrities who were dead,

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.640
 Mark Twain, Charles Dickens,

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.640
 they were dictating from the other side new novels, new works,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.640
 and they would go on sale by real publishers and people would buy them.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.640
 They'd be reviewed in The New York Times.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.640
 Even if skeptically, they got sort of space.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.640
 And there was one book which was The Mystery of Edwin Druid.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.640
 It was the final Charles Dickens book that he never finished,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.640
 and he didn't leave any notes of what had happened to the character

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.640
 and who had killed Edwin Druid.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:22.640
 So a guy called TP James actually finished the book by contacting Dickens from the other side.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.640
 And he said, "This is the final book."

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.640
 They published it.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.640
 There was a new forward written by Dickens as well to explain the process.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.640
 They had a new book that they were working on together

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.640
 called The Life and Adventures of Buckley Whippleheap.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.640
 It was a very exciting thing.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.640
 And it was Arthur Conan Doyle who said he didn't contact Charles Dickens.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.640
 The reason Arthur Conan Doyle knew that

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.640
 is because he himself did a seance in which he contacted Charles Dickens

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.640
 and asked him, "Did you finish this book?"

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.640
 And he said, "No, it wasn't me."

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.640
 Just on the Ouija board.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640
 We're saying it right, Ouija?

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.640
 Ouija.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.640
 Well, whenever I use them, I say Ouija.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.640
 There's also the squeegee board, which is a whole thing.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.640
 Anyway, so it was invented by someone called Helen Peters.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.640
 She was a medium.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.640
 And then there was an entrepreneur called William Fould

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.640
 who took over the business.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.640
 It was so popular, again, around the time of the 20s and 30s.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.640
 At one point, he had several factories all just churning out Ouija boards.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.640
 They sold thousands and thousands of thousands of them.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.640
 And he only sat up in such a big way because the board had told him,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.640
 "Prepare for big business."

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.640
 So, yeah.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.640
 But this is the really spooky thing.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.640
 He went up on the roof of one of the factories

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.640
 to see a flagpole being replaced, right?

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.640
 And then he fell off and died.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.640
 Oh, my God.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.640
 He just fell off.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.640
 OK.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.640
 And then he came back and said something.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.640
 No, no, no, no.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.640
 But he still makes you think, doesn't he?

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.640
 The reason I think that it's pronounced Ouija is there's a YouTuber

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.640
 called Sexkick who went on to Yahoo Answers

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.640
 and searched for various different spellings of Ouija board

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.640
 and found, "How do you make a Ouija board?

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.640
 "Have you played the Ouija board and can you burn the Ouija board?"

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.640
 And it seems, and quite a lot more,

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.640
 and it seems like there's a lot of people in America

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.640
 who think that it's not a Ouija board, but a Ouija board.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.640
 It's really good.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640
 It's coming through.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.640
 "Who are you?"

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.640
 "It's me!"

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.640
 [laughter]

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:29.640
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.640
 My fact this week is that according to his various biographers,

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.640
 Pythagoras could talk with animals, be in two places at once,

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.640
 had a shiny golden leg,

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.640
 and was able to tell fishermen the exact number of fish

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.640
 they'd caught in their net just by looking at it.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.640
 So this was a side...

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.640
 I could do the last one, I reckon.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.640
 Well...

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.640
 It depends how many there are.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640
 Yeah.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.640
 It depends on the... Maybe not a trawler, then.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.640
 [laughter]

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640
 Two.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640
 [laughter]

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.640
 Screw you, Pythagoras.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.640
 I'm genuinely really shocked that we've done 400-plus episodes

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.640
 and we've never ever mentioned Pythagoras,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.640
 and I'm doubly shocked that after all the years of us doing this stuff,

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.640
 I didn't realise what a mad life he supposedly had

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.640
 according to the stories of his life.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.640
 We all know him for his theorem, very famously.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.640
 He was a mathematician, he was a philosopher.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.640
 I didn't realise there was a cult around him

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.640
 that sort of put him into a sort of paranormal territory

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.640
 where he was able to reincarnate and be...

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.640
 He wasn't really a mathematician either, that's the word.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.640
 I thought he was a mathematician, he was kind of a mystic

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.640
 and then cult leader and political figure.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.640
 But the cult were very into numbers, weren't they?

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.640
 So that was part of it.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.640
 And numbers are very maths-related.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.640
 So they're maths-adjacent.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.640
 Not when you're doing algebra.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.640
 Great point.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.640
 Oh, didn't you get a long way?

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.640
 [laughter]

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.640
 Look who did GCSE!

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.640
 But no, he wasn't really a mathematician.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.640
 Pythagoras' theorem had been come up with about a thousand years before him.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.640
 Oh, actually, related to the first-ever episode, we did a fish.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.640
 There's a Pythagoras fact.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.640
 Yeah, one of the people who proved Pythagoras' theorem

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.640
 in a new way that had never been demonstrated before was...

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.640
 - President Garfield. - President Garfield.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.640
 - That's it, really. - That's it, yeah.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.640
 Lying in that hospital bed, being fed through his arse,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.640
 you've got to do something to distract yourself.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.640
 That's a confusing sentence if you haven't heard the first episode.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.640
 The first episode is a fish.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.640
 You'll just have to go back and listen.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.640
 It's a great teaser, yeah.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.640
 They were obsessed with numbers, as you say.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.640
 And numbers, every number had a different personality.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.640
 Now, I don't know, because I couldn't find out anywhere how high up this went,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.640
 because it can't go forever.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.640
 But masculine numbers are odd numbers, and feminine numbers are even.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.640
 Even are considered the only perfect numbers.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.640
 Although odd ones are equated with divinity,

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.640
 so all the genders are doing well out of this.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.640
 Oh, yeah, quite sweetly, the feminine number is two,

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.640
 and the masculine number is three,

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.640
 and then five is the marriage number.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.640
 But, yeah, all these numbers meant specific things to them.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.640
 Yeah, it went about as... I think it went as far as ten.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.640
 Because they had to... How far is it?

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.640
 They had this special thing where it's like...

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.640
 Can you imagine, like, a snooker ball triangle,

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.640
 where you have one, then two, then three, then four,

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.640
 and that added up to ten.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.640
 This was very special to them.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.640
 And they had a poem, or a hymn, really,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.640
 "Bless us, divine number, thou who generated gods and men,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.640
 "the mother of all, the all-comprising,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.640
 "the all-bounding, the firstborn, the never-swerving,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.640
 "the never-tiring, holy ten."

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.640
 Right. Yeah, they love ten.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.640
 And they love triangles.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.640
 Plague snooker must have been hell, actually.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.640
 Quite staggering.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.640
 I get it, the right angle thing.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.640
 What do you guys think he was like?

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.640
 Like, let's imagine we're living in the time.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.640
 OK, well, I can say so.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.640
 Like, a lot of the things that you've said there

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.640
 about the golden thigh and talking to animals,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.640
 they were written much, much later.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640
 Exactly.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.640
 But some of the things that were written at the time

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.640
 when he was alive, they said that he did believe

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.640
 that the souls of humans could return as animals.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640
 Yes.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.640
 So he did believe in reincarnation.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.640
 We know that because people said it at the time.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.640
 And also that he, you know, he had his own kind of wisdom.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.640
 He had his own kind of learning.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.640
 So we know all that kind of stuff happened.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.640
 Golden leg, maybe not.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.640
 OK, so what about, is there a story about a dog?

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.640
 And he was passing someone in the street.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.640
 He believed that, you know, people could come back

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.640
 in the form of animals and all this, as you just said.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.640
 So he once stopped someone who was beating a small dog in the street

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.640
 because he recognised in the barking...

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.640
 You should be in the Colosseum.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.640
 No, he recognised in the barking the voice of a friend of his

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.640
 who died, who had then been reborn as a puppy.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.640
 Yeah.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.640
 The whole story does kind of imply that if he hadn't recognised

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.640
 the barking as a friend of his, he wouldn't have...

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.640
 ...leave it. ...thought anything was a miss.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.640
 Must have been a bad dog. Just leave it.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.640
 But what does he then do with the dog?

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.640
 You're turning this into a very different kind of talk show type

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.640
 of podcast, Jerry Springer style.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.640
 We don't know what he was like. No, no, no.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.640
 What's the dilemma? Sorry, this.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.640
 My friend is a dog.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.640
 My friend's a dog. Stop beating the dog.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.640
 OK, I'll stop beating it. Wouldn't you be like,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.640
 "Greg, what's up? Come hang out. Have dinner at ours."

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.640
 He's just going to be like, "All right, see you, buddy.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.640
 "Enjoy your new life." Great to hang out.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.640
 "Sucks you're a dog. Catch you later."

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.640
 Stop homing my leg. You never did that before.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.640
 He did love numbers, but he hated irrational numbers,

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.640
 or at least he didn't believe they existed, so...

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.640
 Is that why they're called irrational,

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.640
 because he was so irrational about them?

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.640
 He had an irrational loathing of them.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.640
 Sorry, they're the ones that go on forever.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.640
 So they're numbers that can't be expressed as a fraction or a ratio,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.640
 which I only realised when I was doing this research,

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.640
 having to know this irrational I ratio,

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.640
 they're numbers that you can't express as a ratio.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.640
 So five, six over two...

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.640
 Yeah, you idiot. Can't believe we...

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.640
 Can't believe we were all thinking of that.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.640
 So if you take 22 divided by seven,

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.640
 it gets to quite close to 3.14 something,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.640
 but it doesn't get to pi, which is 3.141, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.640
 which goes on forever.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.640
 And that would be an irrational number.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.640
 And he didn't believe in them, because he loved finite numbers.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.640
 And they were on a boat one day, on a cruise or something.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.640
 And one of his followers, called Hepaceus,

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.640
 proved the existence of irrational numbers

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.640
 by saying the square root of two is one,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.640
 which not is one, is one, is one.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.640
 This is why I got no further than GCSE.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.640
 And he, according to reports, was tossed overboard.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.640
 Yeah. Really?

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.640
 So you've got to be careful with strict teachers.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.640
 Wasn't they killed him? Yeah, they killed him, yeah.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.640
 They killed him for proving that the square root of two

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.640
 is an irrational number. Yeah. Supposedly, yeah.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.640
 But he had made him walk the plank.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.640
 But he believed in reincarnation,

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.640
 so he probably thought he'd bump into him on the street.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.640
 Greg! Greg, dude.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.640
 I don't know what happened with my temper that day,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.640
 but, wow, it was a fun cruise, though, wasn't it?

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.640
 When you joined his cult, you had to say nothing for five years,

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.640
 and that was how you got to the next level of the cult.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.640
 OK. And also, he had...

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.640
 If he'd had gone four years and 11 months,

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.640
 that's a tough one, isn't it?

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.640
 And you bag your fart. Yeah.

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.640
 But he had a system for his followers, right?

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.640
 So there were the Mathematikoi,

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.640
 who were the senior followers, right?

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.640
 And he would meet them in person,

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.640
 and he would discuss proper maths with them, hard maths,

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.640
 and, you know, they would think a lot,

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.640
 and they'd do a lot of, you know, they'd do the big stuff.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.640
 And they had to make sacrifices.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.640
 They had to give up meat.

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.640
 Women, they're all men, and private possessions, OK?

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.640
 So that's the senior tier.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.640
 And they were touched white roosters.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.640
 Is that true? Yeah.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.640
 Wow. OK.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.640
 I'm out.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.640
 You'll have to give up meat, women, and private possessions.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.640
 Fine, fine. Anything else?

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.640
 There's one thing. I'm out.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.640
 A couple more rules. OK, yeah.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.640
 Don't eat your brain.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.640
 Don't eat your brain.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.640
 Couldn't find out really anything else,

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.640
 but I suppose that's all you need to know.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.640
 Don't break bread.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.640
 Don't poke fire with a sword.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.640
 Never urinate into the sun.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.640
 I've heard don't urinate into the wind.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.640
 Never into the sun. You might put it out.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.640
 And we say that they couldn't eat any meat,

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.640
 which was mostly true,

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.640
 but they did still sacrifice an oxen

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.640
 whenever they proved a mathematical formula.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.640
 Sorry, what am I being sacrificed for again?

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.640
 Normally it's to a piece of gold or something.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.640
 This doesn't sound important.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.640
 You're being put into a pie.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.640
 Oh, my God.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.640
 That's sympathy.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.640
 No.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.640
 That's the best joke you'll hear for months.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.640
 But then he also had these junior tier followers,

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.640
 people who basically hadn't subscribed,

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.640
 and they were called the Akusmatikoi.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.640
 Is this like a Patreon?

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.640
 It was a Patreon.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.640
 It was genuinely he had a subscription service,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.640
 so the Mathematikoi were in,

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.640
 and Akusmatikoi,

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.640
 he would only speak to them from behind a curtain.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.640
 Wow.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.640
 And they weren't allowed to see his face,

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.640
 and they couldn't learn any proper maths,

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.640
 like any detailed maths.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.640
 That was really because he wasn't the real Wizard of Oz, was he?

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.640
 He was just an old man.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.640
 This thing of him hiding behind a curtain

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.640
 so that you couldn't see him as he was talking,

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.640
 there is one of the stories of his death

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.640
 is directly associated with that.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.640
 So someone on the lower Patreon level

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.640
 was part of that,

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.640
 couldn't see his face,

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.640
 got so angry that he couldn't see him,

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.640
 was furious that he burnt down his house.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.640
 Wait, Pythagoras' house?

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.640
 He burnt Pythagoras' house down,

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.640
 and then he chased him into a field.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.640
 So Pythagoras was in the lead,

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.640
 he's going good, he gets to the field,

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.640
 he's escaping this man, this is how the story goes,

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.640
 and then he notices that the field

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.640
 is full of beans,

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.640
 and Pythagoras refuses to step on beans,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.640
 because he believes that beans,

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.640
 much like dogs, are the reincarnation.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.640
 Reg?

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.640
 I thought what you were going to say

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.640
 is that the guys chasing him

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.640
 went round two sides of the field

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.640
 and he went diagonally across it.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.640
 So he gets to the field of beans

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.640
 and he stops and he thinks,

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.640
 "I can't step on these beans,

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.640
 I'll kill the beans with my feet."

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.640
 So the man catches up, and rather than going,

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.640
 "Fuck it, I'll just stamp on some beans,"

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.640
 he just stands there while the man cuts his throat

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.640
 and kills him, and that's the death of Pythagoras,

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.640
 according to one of many accounts.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.640
 I think there's another version of the story

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.640
 where loads of his followers gave their own lives

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.640
 so that Pythagoras, "Go, Pythagoras, go, go,

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.640
 you must go, we'll give up our lives, well, we're killed."

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.640
 And then he still gets to the head of the bean field,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.640
 "Listen, I can't do it.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.640
 I can sacrifice them.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.640
 I can't sacrifice you, my beanie friends."

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:59.640
 He supposedly had the power

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.640
 to write words on the face of the moon.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.640
 And I forgot to write

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.640
 anything more about that.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.640
 I said,

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.640
 "Did he ever do that,

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.640
 or was it just he had the power to..."

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.640
 I have to tell you, Andy, power to the brain.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.640
 That's a single sentence there.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.640
 And for just $2.99 a month,

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.640
 you'll be able to see the words I do write

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.640
 on the face of the moon.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.640
 All right, I need to move us on

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.640
 to our final fact of the show.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640
 It is time for our final fact,

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.640
 and that is James.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.640
 OK, my fact this week is

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.640
 whenthewebsiteshealth.com

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.640
 listed the fattiest foods

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.640
 in every state in the US,

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.640
 entrance included North Carolina's

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.640
 liver mush,

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.640
 New York's garbage plate,

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.640
 and Indiana's fried brain sandwich.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.640
 See, they never read Pythagoras

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.640
 anyway.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.640
 So, yeah, this is a fact just about

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.640
 the disgusting things you can eat in America.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.640
 Yeah, the fried brain sandwich sounds

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.640
 really weird.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.640
 The others are slightly euphemistic.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.640
 Well, not even that you've missed it,

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.640
 but fried brain sandwiches are

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.640
 literally exactly what they sound like.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.640
 Whose brain?

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.640
 Well, it used to be cow brains,

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.640
 but after my cow disease came in,

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.640
 they're now pig brains.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.640
 One little tip,

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.640
 as in you put the breadcrumbs on there,

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.640
 make sure you have cold hands,

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.640
 otherwise they can fall apart.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.640
 So that's a little bit of a tip.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.640
 The best place to get them is Hilltop Inn

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.640
 in Evansville,

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.640
 and that has been dubbed recently,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.640
 in 2009, actually, the manliest restaurant

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.640
 in America.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.640
 Oh!

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.640
 I know I'm a man, but I don't actually want

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.640
 my restaurant to be manly.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.640
 It's not even in my top five criteria for a restaurant.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.640
 Shall we go Indian, Chinese or Manly?

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.640
 Exactly!

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.640
 This list is incredible, though.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.640
 So you wrote out some of the

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.640
 most amazing sounding ones,

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.640
 but even the other things on it,

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.640
 the Colorado, the Jack and Grills 7-pound

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.640
 breakfast burrito is the least healthy food

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.640
 in Colorado. Connecticut, the two-foot-long

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.640
 hot dog, and these aren't just in one place.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.640
 Lots of them are available in lots of different places.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.640
 Yeah.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.640
 There's the quadruple bypass burger.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.640
 8,000 calories.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.640
 I've had some of one of them.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.640
 How did you? Yeah, in Vegas, right?

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.640
 It's not impressive to have had some of one of them.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.640
 They don't put your photo on the wall for that, mate.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.640
 They'll put some of your photo on the wall.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.640
 Did you hear about the Luther Burger?

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.640
 This is in Georgia, in the south.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.640
 Right, it's a normal burger, the Luther Burger.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.640
 It's a normal burger. It's got egg, it's got

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.640
 bacon, and it's got cheese, as well as the burger.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.640
 So far, so meh.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.640
 But it's not served between a bun,

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.640
 do you guess?

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.640
 Luther, between two church doors.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.640
 Yeah.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.640
 Between the north, it fills the gap

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.640
 between the north and south doors on the transept.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.640
 It's amazing.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.640
 No, it's someone in the audience,

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.640
 a mermaid, actually, it's between

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.640
 two Krispy Kreme glazed donuts.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.640
 And was that part of his Protestant theology?

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.640
 The donut thing? It was the '96 theorem.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.640
 Right.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.640
 Shall I just quickly

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.640
 say the other two, very quickly?

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.640
 Yeah, yeah. Sorry, liver mush

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.640
 is a savory slice

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.640
 loaf made from pork liver, scrap meat,

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.640
 often from a pig's head,

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.640
 spices and cornmeal.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.640
 Nice. Okay, and they have a liver mush

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.640
 eating contest

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.640
 in wherever it was, in North

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.640
 Carolina, every year.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.640
 They also have a liver mush pageant,

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.640
 but in last year's...

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.640
 Consisting of what? I mean, are there floats?

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.640
 It's... It really feels like

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.640
 putting lipstick on a pig, really,

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.640
 trying to make that attractive.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.640
 It's basically a festival, and they have lots of things,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.640
 but they have basically the local

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.640
 children or young women

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.640
 that kind of... Dresses liver mush.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.640
 They just dress as gobbles.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.640
 Is it like a liver mush queen? They often do that kind of thing.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.640
 I think so, that's the kind of thing, yeah.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.640
 And the liver mush eating contest,

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.640
 where last year, the winner managed to eat some.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.640
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.640
 And garbage plate is from

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.640
 Rochester, New York, and it's basically...

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.640
 This actually sounds really good.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.640
 It's a choice of any meats, so

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.640
 even though I am vegetarian, but let's pretend

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.640
 I'm not. It's like hamburgers, hot dogs,

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.640
 sausages, any kind of stuff.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.640
 You shove a load of french fries on it,

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.640
 shove a load of beans on it, macaroni cheese,

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.640
 and then cover it in a special sauce.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.640
 That actually sounds quite good to me.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.640
 Really depends on the special sauce.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.640
 Yeah, it does well. I think it's hot sauce.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.640
 Okay. Yeah.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.640
 We've mentioned it before, James,

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.640
 you've been there, but I just

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.640
 love reading about it every single time,

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.640
 which is the Disgusting Food Museum in Malmo, Sweden.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.640
 And it just collects

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.640
 food that is utterly horrible,

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.640
 and James, you tried a few things there,

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.640
 which tasted horrible.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.640
 I was reading an article by a guy who went there

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.640
 in 2019 called Arthur de Mayer,

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.640
 and he described...

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.640
 He gave a bit more of a sort of explanation

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.640
 about these particular foods, so you can have

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.640
 an Icelandic shark dish there

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.640
 called hackarl, and he said

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.640
 it was eating it was like

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.640
 gnawing on three-week-old cheese

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.640
 from the garbage that had also been

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.640
 pissed on by every dog in the neighbourhood.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.640
 That was one thing he had here.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.640
 I had that there, by the way. Did you?

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.640
 Yeah, I did. Did you vomit?

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.640
 No, I didn't vomit at all from any of them,

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.640
 although I retched quite a lot.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.640
 Does that count? No.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.640
 But the hackarl one was funny because

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.640
 the guy told me that it was

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.640
 that seeped in urine,

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.640
 and I ate it, and you could really believe it.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.640
 It tasted... It did taste like piss.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.640
 And then I actually put it in a QI script,

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.640
 and it turned out to be completely untrue.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.640
 Oh, no.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.640
 It was a natural, uriny taste that it had.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.640
 It didn't add any urine

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.640
 into it, and so we cut it, yeah.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.640
 There's another one.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.640
 The South Korean wine. Did you drink that?

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.640
 Actually, I think that's behind a sort of glass,

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.640
 because in order...

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.640
 Feces? You have fresh turds of children,

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.640
 specifically.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.640
 And the owner of the museum,

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.640
 one of the founders of the museum,

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.640
 he actually went about scooping up

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.640
 his eight-year-old daughter's poo

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.640
 in order to make this concoction.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.640
 That doesn't count. It's like if you're buying it

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.640
 from South Korea as a special thing,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.640
 that's one thing. If you're actually making it

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.640
 from your own, that's different.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.640
 But it says it has to be fresh,

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.640
 and no turd is going to be fresh

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.640
 by the time it's gone from South Korea to Sweden.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.640
 I don't think turds are ever fresh.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.640
 They absolutely are.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.640
 They can be new.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.640
 No!

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.640
 I see what you're saying.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.640
 Like, if you're at a fresh deli,

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.640
 you wouldn't expect to see it, would you?

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.640
 They're safe at least five days

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.640
 after their best-before date. I'm telling you.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.640
 OK, OK.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.640
 Gosh. So, it's got slightly distracted

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.640
 from this, because someone wrote in,

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.640
 actually, to the podcast email account,

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.640
 podcast@qi.com,

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640
 and this is from Evelyn Keely.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.640
 And it's the...

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.640
 Oklahoma has a state steak.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.640
 You know, these official state things

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.640
 they have? Absolutely mad stuff.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.640
 So, Oklahoma's state steak

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.640
 is the ribeye steak.

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.640
 The state drink is milk.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.640
 This is a complete brackets,

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.640
 but they've got a state astronomical object,

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.640
 which is the rosette nebula

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.640
 5,000 light years away.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.640
 I've no idea why.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.640
 I feel like...

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.640
 Such an unreciprocated relationship.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.640
 I know.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.640
 Twinned with.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.640
 But they've also got, right, this is what

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.640
 sort of brought me back to the actual fact,

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.640
 which is the state meal, OK?

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.640
 And the state meal is this.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.640
 It's some chicken fried steak,

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.640
 followed by barbecued pork,

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.640
 followed by fried okra, squash,

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.640
 cornbread, grits,

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.640
 corn, sausage with biscuits and gravy,

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.640
 black-eyed peas, strawberries

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.640
 and pecan pie.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.640
 That's the state meal.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.640
 Wow. A lot of that sounds good,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.640
 just not in the course of one meal.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.640
 Actually, just speaking of, like, many courses

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.640
 with meals,

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.640
 there is a footballer called Robert Lewandowski

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.640
 who plays for Poland.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.640
 And whenever he eats a three-course meal,

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.640
 he always eats his dessert first.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.640
 Isn't that cool?

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.640
 Does he have a reason for it? Yes.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.640
 He's Benjamin Button, isn't he?

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.640
 This is a new-ish kind of diet,

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.640
 and the idea is you eat

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.640
 a very fatty dessert,

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.640
 and then you eat your main course,

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.640
 and then you eat your starter.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.640
 And the idea is, what happens is,

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.640
 if you eat a normal meal, you have your starter

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.640
 and your main course, and then the dessert will come

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.640
 and it looks really good, and you're like,

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.640
 "Oh, go on, then I'll have it," and you find some extra space for it.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.640
 But people are less inclined to do that for their starter.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.640
 And they tend to choose

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.640
 better main courses as well.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.640
 And so there was a study done

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.640
 with people who were either told

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.640
 to eat in the normal order,

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.640
 or they could have a cheesecake

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.640
 and then choose their main and choose their

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.640
 starter, or they could

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.640
 have some fruit and then choose their main

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.640
 and then their starter, and they found that the people

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.640
 who ate the cheesecake first

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.640
 have 30% fewer calories

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.640
 than anyone else in their meal, and that includes

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.640
 the really fatty dessert that they had.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.640
 That's brilliant. That's amazing.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.640
 It's like a trick. It's like you're tricking your mind.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.640
 We've just cracked it, haven't we?

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.640
 You've just cracked the whole food thing.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.640
 That's amazing.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.640
 The whole food thing.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.640
 Wow. If that works.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.640
 You think I've had a sticky toffee pudding,

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.640
 so I think I'll just have a salad for the main. Thank you very much.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.640
 But do you want to finish your meal

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.640
 with a nice bowl of soup, or would you rather finish

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.640
 with a chocolate cake? I'd rather finish with a starter.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.640
 A starter is everyone's favourite course, isn't it?

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.640
 Oh, OK. No. See?

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.640
 OK, way fewer than a third of the people

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.640
 in the room said yes.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.640
 Sorry, that's not proof.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.640
 You've always got at least one answer.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.640
 You are one of those people who goes to a restaurant

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.640
 and they have 12 starters.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.640
 Quiz question.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.640
 Can you guys name a processed food product

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.640
 that the Earl of Sandwich was responsible for inventing?

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.640
 OK.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.640
 We're not going to do that.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.640
 I'm sorry, a processed product.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.640
 A food or drink product.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.640
 Oh, fuck, I've given it away.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.640
 Or drinks, did you say?

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.640
 Yeah, follow that.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.640
 Is it a liquidized sandwich?

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.640
 It's the M&S New Liquid Sandwich.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.640
 It's fizzy drinks.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.640
 What? Yeah.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.640
 So, he commissioned Joseph Priestley, the chemist,

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.640
 to work on ways of making

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.640
 stale water more palatable

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.640
 and to keep water lasting longer because of ships.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.640
 Ships would have stale water, it would go horrible.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.640
 It's a problem, people don't want to drink their water on board,

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.640
 so they might be dehydrated.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.640
 So he hired Joseph Priestley,

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.640
 and Joseph Priestley created carbonated water.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.640
 And as a result,

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.640
 it's slightly acidic, carbonated water,

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.640
 so that means it's slightly antimicrobial,

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.640
 and it means it lasts longer.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.640
 So that is actually

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.640
 the product that he is kind of responsible for.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.640
 And the sandwich was way, way earlier,

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.640
 and he just popularized it.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.640
 You might remember this.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.640
 I got married in the room where he invented the sandwich.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.640
 Did you?

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.640
 And that was such a cheap meal as well.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.640
 Interesting fact, everyone,

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.640
 while you're eating your ham sandwich.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.640
 It's a homage.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.640
 And enjoy your glass of Coke.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:23.640
 Can I just say, Andy...

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.640
 Crisps are available for purchase at the bar.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:29.640
 Which will be a meal deal which you can pay for when you leave.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.640
 It's not a free wedding, I should have mentioned.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.640
 Andy said to us before the show started,

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.640
 "Guys, I'm going to tell a personal anecdote tonight."

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.640
 Was that your personal anecdote?

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.640
 It was my personal anecdote.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.640
 Pretty good, yeah, you see that?

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.640
 Nice!

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.640
 He never tells anything.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.640
 That was huge insight.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.640
 It was very brave.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.640
 Well done.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.640
 The guy from the council made such heavy weather of it in the room on the day.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.640
 It was practically more of a sandwich talk than a wedding.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.640
 It was most of the ceremony, yeah.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.640
 And do you wish to be sandwiched

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.640
 between the holy laws of matrimony?

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:09.640
 Can I just mention one other food?

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.640
 American state food that I didn't know about.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.640
 Again, we'll be very familiar to people from these places,

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.640
 but in places like Oregon and Washington state,

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.640
 now it's spelled G-E-O-D-U-C-K.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:25.640
 G-E-O-D-U-C-K?

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.640
 Yeah, weird to start with.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.640
 It's gooey duck, spelled completely the wrong way.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.640
 And I've never seen one.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.640
 They're the biggest burrowing clams in the world.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.640
 And they look...

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.640
 They've got kind of a normal, ish-sized clamshell

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.640
 about the size of your palm.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.640
 And then it looks like...

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.640
 Looks like a slug's coming out of it, right?

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.640
 Yeah, but it looks like a slug who's tried on a dress.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.640
 12 sizes too small for it.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.640
 It's coming out of it.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.640
 You've got a slug the length of most of your arm

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.640
 coming out of this bulging out of this tiny shell.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.640
 I mean, it looks so phallic.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.640
 It's very hard to get around the fact that it is.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.640
 And this is a delicacy.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.640
 They live up to 150 years.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.640
 And their entire lives are, they're born.

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.640
 They burrow really deep with their shell into the sand.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.640
 And the reason they've got this huge phallus on them

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.640
 is so that it can stick up and just pop out of the sand

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.640
 on the bottom of the seabed

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.640
 so it can collect up what it needs.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.640
 Wait, the phallus is collected?

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.640
 No, no, no. It's not a phallus. It looks like a phallus.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.640
 Oh, sorry. I've got to go. Sorry.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's that sweetest mouth.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.640
 And it's a...

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.640
 It's a siphon.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.640
 And he's going to be doing some googling tonight.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.640
 It's a really creepy slogan. It's not a phallus.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.640
 It's a mouth.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.640
 I don't know why.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.640
 Whose slogan is that?

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.640
 It's the slogan of the gooey duck.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.640
 And, yeah, it's...

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.640
 So it's actually a siphon.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.640
 So it sheds salty liquids, actually,

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.640
 that it doesn't need any more, in fact, in water.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.640
 I know it looks like a phallus, and it's shedding salty liquids.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.640
 But I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, it is a mouth.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.640
 If a gooey duck looks like a phallus and quacks like a phallus...

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:12.640
 Look, we've run over. I need to wrap us up.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.640
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.640
