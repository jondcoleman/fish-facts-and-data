00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,860
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,540
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,460
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,660
 from Up The Creek in Greenwich, London!

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,620
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,460
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,700
 I am sitting here with Anna Toshensky,

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,900
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,460
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,460
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,740
 And in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,420
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,840
 - My fact is that some shows at the Roman Coliseum

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,060
 featured sausage dogs.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,500
 (audience laughing)

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,240
 - People fighting sausage dogs?

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,740
 - It's so unclear.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,700
 It's so unclear what the actual thing is.

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,580
 Maybe.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,680
 I mean, the thing is they would be quite far away.

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,980
 - You wouldn't get great visibility

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,820
 on a sausage dog from that distance.

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,420
 If you were in the back, you'd have no idea

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,260
 what was going on.

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,100
 - Yeah, that's true.

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,100
 - But maybe it was a swarm of sausage dogs

28
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,380
 against one Christian.

29
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,540
 You know, that is possible.

30
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,180
 - Would you rather fight a thousand

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,620
 Christian-sized sausage dogs?

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,860
 (audience laughing)

33
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,580
 - A thousand Christian-sized sausage dogs?

34
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,180
 (audience laughing)

35
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,180
 Or what?

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,460
 - Or not.

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,660
 (audience laughing)

38
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,840
 - They often didn't get a choice.

39
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,220
 Fun fact, in the Coliseum,

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
 so we should say there's a study.

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,000
 There's been an archeological study done recently

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,040
 and these are Daxons, Vena dogs,

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
 whatever you want to call them.

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,160
 And they were the kind of precursor,

45
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,760
 the prototypes of these dogs

46
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,440
 'cause the modern breed only emerged

47
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,960
 in about the 18th and 19th century.

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
 But they were basically this kind of dog.

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,760
 - If you went back in time when you saw one,

50
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,920
 you would think it was a sausage dog.

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
 - Exactly.

52
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,280
 The thing is we genuinely don't know what they thought.

53
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,600
 The archeologists have been crawling

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,440
 in the sewers under the Coliseum for a year.

55
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,120
 They spent a year crawling in the mud on their stomachs

56
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,420
 and they found lots of stuff.

57
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,640
 They found seven coins,

58
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,880
 which does not feel like a good return on investment.

59
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,700
 - It's not a good wage, is it, for the year?

60
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
 - And they found some bones.

61
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,640
 They found some leopard bones.

62
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,020
 They found some lions and ostrich bones.

63
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,180
 But they also found these dogs.

64
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,180
 And we don't know were they part of staged battles,

65
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,100
 which is great fun, or were they acrobats,

66
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,940
 which is also fun.

67
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,780
 - Which is amazing.

68
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,540
 - There isn't a slightly more boring explanation,

69
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,340
 which is that they might have been used

70
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,940
 to kind of hunt rats.

71
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,240
 - Okay, 'cause when you're at the Coliseum,

72
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,840
 loads of people there, you're eating lots of snacks.

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,320
 It could be that they tried to stop the rodents,

74
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,800
 but I mean, I'd rather think of them as acrobats.

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,040
 That's all speculation.

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
 Did we not write stuff down back then?

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,880
 Because I'm pretty sure we did.

79
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,320
 How is it that sausage dogs have escaped history?

80
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,160
 Yet we are--

81
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,000
 - That's a great question.

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,720
 - There was a lot going on at the Coliseum.

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,120
 It was some mad shit for about 500 years.

84
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,960
 You couldn't write every single thing down every day.

85
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,200
 - I'm sorry, if I walked out of the end of an evening

86
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,220
 at the Coliseum and I saw Gladiators fighting,

87
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,060
 I'm not saying that.

88
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,940
 I'm going, "Did anyone see the fucking sausage dog?"

89
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
 (laughing)

90
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,980
 - But no, but there was so much more weird stuff than that.

91
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,340
 Like the real acrobats did amazing things.

92
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,940
 And one of the frustrating things is

93
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,380
 we don't have that much information

94
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,820
 'cause people write about it in fragments.

95
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,240
 Sometimes we've only got little bits of writing.

96
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,020
 There was the Petaurus,

97
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,100
 which the sources we have suggest was a giant seesaw.

98
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,900
 And we think it was used at kind of half time

99
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,900
 in the Coliseum.

100
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,060
 So there's huge seesaw and you'd have

101
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,920
 two opponents competing on either side.

102
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
 And one would jump onto it

103
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,840
 and it would fling the other one up in the air.

104
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,420
 I think about 30 feet in the air.

105
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,540
 - No, stop it.

106
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,700
 Stop it.

107
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,520
 - Apparently they'd go through,

108
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,080
 they'd go through hoops of flame,

109
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,200
 I think one of the sources said.

110
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,280
 And then come back down.

111
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,560
 Then the other one gets flung in the air.

112
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
 There is an account of them falling

113
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,520
 to their death sometimes, as will happen.

114
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,600
 - Wasn't there an account of them putting criminals on there?

115
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,440
 - Yeah.

116
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,480
 - And the idea is the lions come in, right?

117
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,640
 And they're going to attack the guy

118
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,280
 who's the bottom of the seesaw.

119
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,120
 So you're always trying to get to the top of your seesaw

120
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
 so that he's at the bottom.

121
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,160
 - I think that sometimes is speculated

122
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,720
 that that might be what they were used for.

123
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,560
 - It is, but the suggestion, the problem is,

124
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
 as soon as the other guy gets eaten,

125
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,600
 you're fucked, aren't you?

126
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,400
 - Yeah.

127
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,800
 - The weird thing is, this is all the half time shows though.

128
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,280
 Lots of what we're talking about now

129
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,240
 is the half time shows in between,

130
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,800
 what, "Jarriot Races?"

131
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,680
 And then maybe other five and the gladiators.

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,600
 - A lot of the damnatio ad bestias,

133
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,680
 so being killed by wild animals basically,

134
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,840
 organized by a group of people called the bestiary.

135
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,720
 There are lots of sources claiming that the bestiary

136
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,920
 were incredible trainers of animals

137
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,360
 and they would train animals to kill people

138
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
 in incredibly elaborate ways

139
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,400
 that referenced myths for people.

140
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,520
 So they would recreate death scenes.

141
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,960
 You guys remember the story of Prometheus?

142
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,320
 He stole fire from the gods and then he was punished.

143
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,640
 He was chained to a rock and a liver would fly down every day.

144
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
 And peck out his eagle.

145
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
 Uh...

146
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
 Ah!

147
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
 So, eagle would fly down every day.

148
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
 - But they recreated it the opposite way round.

149
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
 - Exactly, yeah.

150
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,640
 Supposedly one bestiarius spent months and months

151
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,640
 training a single eagle to remove a man's organs.

152
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,640
 - Wow, really? - I can't believe that's true.

153
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
 - Wow. - Like, yeah.

154
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
 - The half time shows sounded amazing.

155
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
 They kind of sound like a modern half time show

156
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
 of, let's say, a basketball,

157
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
 if you watch American basketball. - A Super Bowl, maybe?

158
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
 - A Super Bowl. Like, it's really show-stoppy kind of stuff.

159
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,640
 So they would do things where snacks would fall from the sky

160
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,640
 and including from... I mean, they're not from the clouds, obviously,

161
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
 but they were sort of launched,

162
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
 kind of like how the people that would stand in the middle

163
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
 and shoot out t-shirts out of rockets.

164
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
 - They had a toga cannon? - Exactly, so they had this...

165
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
 Yeah, well...

166
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
 What they actually had, though, which is amazing,

167
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,640
 is you got this wooden ball where, on the inside,

168
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,640
 you would win something like a t-shirt or...

169
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 But I know they didn't have t-shirts, so it was very progressive.

170
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
 No, but it would be food or it would be money,

171
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,640
 it would even be the deeds to a house, you know, or an apartment.

172
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
 - Wow. - Yeah.

173
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
 So a lot of people really fought over it.

174
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
 - But were there bad things in the balls, as well? - No, I don't know.

175
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
 - So, like, if you open the bowl, you might get a t-shirt

176
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
 or it might be you have to go on the seesaw.

177
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
 - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah.

178
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
 - That did sound pretty cool, though, didn't it? - Yeah.

179
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
 They had, possibly, we think,

180
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,640
 like, the spectators would have water sprinkled on them.

181
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,640
 - Oh, yeah. - 'Cause they had toilets with running water.

182
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
 So they would kind of get the water from the river

183
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
 and kind of get it to go through the stadium

184
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
 and go through where all the toilets are.

185
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
 But they also had huge...

186
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
 We think because they had this in pool and we haven't seen it

187
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
 in the Coliseum, but it's very, very similar.

188
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,640
 They had huge, huge towers with loads of water in,

189
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
 and that water would kind of sprinkle over everyone

190
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
 to keep them cool.

191
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
 And they also had a retractable roof.

192
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
 - No, this is amazing. - I know they were

193
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,640
 more than 2,000 years ahead of Wimbledon.

194
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,640
 - I know. - It's so amazing, isn't it?

195
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
 - There we go again. - Yeah.

196
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,640
 - They just had a cabbage roof that they could bring over

197
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
 whenever it got too hot or cold.

198
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
 - Yeah, the Valerium, I think,

199
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,640
 and it was operated by about 1,000 sailors

200
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
 who would pull on the ropes,

201
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
 'cause they used to pulling on rope sailors.

202
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,640
 But, yeah, and you'd have advertising up,

203
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
 and we've got the...

204
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
 I want to say etchings in the stones,

205
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
 but we've got the evidence that you'd advertise

206
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
 "There will be shade, vela errant."

207
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
 You know, "There will be shade for you."

208
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
 It's incredible.

209
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
 Although Caligula liked to wind it back

210
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,640
 so he could watch people just boil up.

211
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,640
 - Oh, yeah. - There's the watch.

212
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
 - Absolutely classic Caligula. - Yeah.

213
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,640
 - It sounded hectic working there, though,

214
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,640
 because basically you could be a part of the show

215
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
 if anything went wrong, if the emperor decided.

216
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
 So Claudius in particular.

217
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
 There was a biographer called Suetonius

218
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
 who wrote about the fact that Claudius,

219
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
 if he was watching a show,

220
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
 and something went slightly wrong,

221
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
 and everything was operated underneath

222
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,640
 in terms of if the gladiators were fighting.

223
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
 All the animals that came up into the stadium,

224
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
 they were all in the hypergeum, which was underneath,

225
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,640
 which is this extraordinary, kind of like the backstage

226
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,640
 of a theater where they have just a crazy amount of stuff

227
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
 that you wouldn't realize to make shows happen.

228
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
 That was happening underneath.

229
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
 And so if something went wrong

230
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
 where something came up at the wrong time

231
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
 and it pissed off the emperor, he would just say,

232
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
 "Whoever the staff is down there, they're now in the show.

233
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
 Get them up there to fight the lions."

234
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
 - Shit. - Anything that went wrong.

235
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
 If the catering went wrong, get the caterers in there.

236
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
 So he just kept adding people to be killed in the...

237
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
 - Right. Sounds great. - I heard that sometimes

238
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
 hecklers would be thrown to wild animals.

239
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
 - Really? - That's fair enough.

240
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,640
 We should start that.

241
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,640
 I like the hypergeum because it's like whack-a-mole, isn't it?

242
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,640
 Because a lion would pop up somewhere,

243
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
 and then you had to go and fight it,

244
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
 and then some monkeys, and then a...

245
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
 - Sausage dog. - Sausage dog.

246
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 But the whole point was that there wasn't spots

247
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
 you knew that they would pop up.

248
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
 There were so many spots that, like the whack-a-mole,

249
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
 you could be facing this way, expecting a lion,

250
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
 and then it comes behind you.

251
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
 Apparently, the system to bring them up sometimes

252
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,640
 was so supercharged that the lion would be lobbed into the...

253
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
 - Stop it. Come on. - That's an account I read.

254
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
 Oh, my God.

255
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
 There's so much speculation about this stuff.

256
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
 It's amazing.

257
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,640
 The best seats were reserved for the emperor

258
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
 and the Vestal Virgins.

259
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
 They got the best seats, and then if you went a little bit higher up,

260
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
 you would get the senators,

261
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
 and then you would get the knights and the nobles,

262
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,640
 and then the very, very furthest strata was for commoners.

263
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
 And then they built one more,

264
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,640
 even right at the very, very back strata.

265
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
 Do you know who that was for?

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,640
 - A commonist. - What did you say?

267
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
 Women is exactly right.

268
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
 - Oh, really? - Yeah.

269
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
 - I'm afraid so. - 'Cause they gave us the best seat.

270
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
 Well, yes, exactly.

271
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
 You wouldn't be able to see the sausage, Doug,

272
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
 unless it was flung really high.

273
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,640
 It seated 50,000 people, the Coliseum, roughly,

274
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,640
 and I went to Wembley to see a show,

275
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
 and that gives you...

276
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,640
 If you were watching a sausage dog down, as you said,

277
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,640
 'cause I went to see Billy Joel at Wembley,

278
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,640
 and my wife booked me this ticket as part of a Christmas present,

279
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
 and I said, "What are the seats like?"

280
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
 She said, "I didn't really check. I'm sure they're good."

281
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,640
 You couldn't be further away from Billy Joel as possible.

282
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,640
 It was so far away that when the gig was playing,

283
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,640
 we could hear the song and the screens that allowed us to see him,

284
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,640
 which genuinely, he's sausage dog-sized at that distance.

285
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
 It was out of sync with the visuals,

286
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
 and I was like, "Oh, my God, Billy's gonna be so angry

287
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
 because, you know, there's so much money spent."

288
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
 That's how far away we were.

289
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,640
 Sound and vision were traveling at a different rate

290
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
 that they were not in sync.

291
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,640
 So if you counted the number of seconds between the time he opened his mouth

292
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
 and the time you saw it, you could tell how far away he was.

293
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

294
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
 You could tell when you're gonna get struck by lightning.

295
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
 That's right.

296
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
 Well, you say 50,000 sounds big,

297
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,640
 but I just don't think we ever make a big enough deal of the fact

298
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
 that this Coliseum basically replaced Circus Maximus,

299
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
 which was its predecessor,

300
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,640
 sat 250,000 people, still the biggest ever stadium.

301
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
 It's just, I find that just amazing.

302
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
 What was that?

303
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
 That was Rome as well, but it was, you know, they got bored of it.

304
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
 That was where they had lots of chariot races

305
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
 and then chucked the Coliseum in,

306
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
 which they never called the Coliseum.

307
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
 They called it the Flavian Amphitheater,

308
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,640
 and we think the reason they changed the name is quite funny.

309
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,640
 So it started being called the Coliseum in sort of early medieval times,

310
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,640
 and we believe it's because the Colossus at the time

311
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
 was the Colossus of Nero,

312
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
 this gigantic 100-foot tall classic Nero statue of him,

313
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,640
 which had, as Nero went out of fashion, its head kept changing,

314
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
 so whatever emperor was in power at the time,

315
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
 they'd shove his head on the statue.

316
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,640
 And eventually someone wrote a poem about the Colossus saying,

317
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,640
 "So long as the Colossus stands, Rome shall stand.

318
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,640
 "When the Colossus falls, Rome too shall fall,

319
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,640
 "and when Rome falls, so falls the world."

320
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
 And then almost immediately after that was written and published,

321
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,640
 the Colossus fell, and we think they went,

322
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
 "Well, shit, everyone's going to think the world's going to end.

323
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
 "We better change what the Colossus is."

324
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
 And so then we think they named the Coliseum, the Coliseum,

325
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,640
 because it was right nearby, and they said,

326
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
 "Let's just pretend."

327
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
 Wow.

328
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
 That's really cool.

329
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,640
 I've got some stuff on sausage dogs.

330
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
 Of course you do.

331
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
 Sorry.

332
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
 Very nice.

333
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
 We've actually got to move on.

334
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
 No, no, absolutely not.

335
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
 Absolutely not.

336
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
 Don't go near it.

337
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,640
 I thought this fact would go in a very different direction.

338
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,640
 I've basically only got sausage dog stuff now.

339
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
 Do you guys know where the sausage dog capital of the world is?

340
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
 Oh.

341
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
 It's not in Germany.

342
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
 No, it's as of this year.

343
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
 It's in the UK.

344
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
 Oh.

345
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,640
 It's almost totally ungettable.

346
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
 Is it Maidstone?

347
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
 It's on the coast.

348
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
 Unlike Maidstone.

349
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
 Is it?

350
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,640
 No, it's not.

351
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
 I don't even know why I say it.

352
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
 It was in Southwold this year in Suffolk.

353
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
 Oh, yeah.

354
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
 They had, well, a lot of, you know...

355
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
 Push people in the audience.

356
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,640
 This year at Southwold hosted

357
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,640
 the world's largest ever single breed dog walk

358
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,640
 when 2,238 sausage dogs turned up for a walk.

359
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
 Whoa.

360
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
 At the same time.

361
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
 That's a lot.

362
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
 The size of one gladiator Christian.

363
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,640
 You said turned up.

364
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
 Like, A, there were posters up around town

365
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
 and the dogs just trotted up on their own.

366
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
 I know.

367
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
 And they had one person to walk all of them.

368
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
 It was a nightmare.

369
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
 Do you want to hear a fact that's not about Dachshunds?

370
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
 Yeah, and then we need to move on.

371
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
 Okay, okay.

372
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,640
 So, I was reading an article in researching this about a Dachshund

373
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
 which was caught on CCTV in Germany

374
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,640
 and it was the only police lead for a case, a crime case,

375
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
 because it had an unusual lead.

376
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
 And they couldn't see the face of the criminal

377
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
 and they could only see the lead on the Dachshund.

378
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
 And that was the...

379
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
 So, it was such a confusing case.

380
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 Do we have any leads?

381
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
 Yes, we've got this one lead, of course you.

382
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,640
 But I only mentioned this because of the final paragraph,

383
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
 which I loved, but is not Dachshund related,

384
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
 but it was in this story.

385
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
 So, here I'm just going to read it verbatim.

386
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,640
 It may not be the first time a pet has provided key evidence.

387
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,640
 In 2017, a woman in Michigan was convicted of killing her husband

388
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
 partly on the testimony from their parrot,

389
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,640
 which kept repeating, "Don't shoot in the dead man's voice."

390
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
 Oh, spooky.

391
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
 In his voice.

392
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
 Supposedly in his voice.

393
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,640
 I've never heard a parrot that can do voices, but this one can.

394
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
 Wow, amazing.

395
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,640
 But he didn't say, "Don't shoot Mabel," did he?

396
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
 Oh, yeah.

397
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
 So, we don't know who he was talking to.

398
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
 Yeah, yeah.

399
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
 How did that help convict her?

400
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,640
 Okay, well, tune in to Anna's new true crime podcast

401
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,640
 where she frees this woman.

402
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
 LAUGHTER

403
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:27,640
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

404
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,640
 My fact this week is that in the 1920s,

405
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
 spiritualists started complaining

406
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,640
 that Tutankhamun was appearing at their seances too often.

407
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,640
 It's just sort of spamming them.

408
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,640
 Was he disruptive, or was it just, there's too much of this?

409
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
 Sometimes.

410
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
 Yeah, he seemed to have quite bad mood swings,

411
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
 which I guess he was a teenager.

412
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
 So, this was...

413
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
 Go to your pyramid.

414
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
 No!

415
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,640
 Fuck, go to your tomb!

416
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
 Sorry, there we go.

417
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:06,640
 This was in Tutankhamun's second heyday,

418
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
 which was the 1920s, I guess.

419
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,640
 So, his tomb was discovered in 1922.

420
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,640
 It was this huge deal, and he became this massive celebrity.

421
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,640
 Obviously, no one had ever heard of him before this.

422
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,640
 And at the same time, seances were very popular.

423
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,640
 Spiritualism was very popular, and so he kept on popping up,

424
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,640
 and there was an edition of a journal called "Light",

425
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,640
 a journal of spiritual progress and physical research.

426
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
 And a letter in it said,

427
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,640
 "We are getting a little tired of Tutankhamun.

428
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
 "Messages purporting to be from him,

429
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,640
 "which consists of vague generalities,

430
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,640
 "are quite worth as anyone could compose them."

431
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
 And saying, basically, you know,

432
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
 either give us good evidence of your identity,

433
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
 I don't know how, write some hieroglyphics or something.

434
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 They're hard to do on a Ouija board.

435
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,640
 You need the expansion pack for that.

436
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
 You do, yeah.

437
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,640
 You need the right font, don't you?

438
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
 Some wing-dings on that.

439
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,640
 Yeah, they said we don't want just random celebrities claiming to turn up.

440
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
 Either we want the good evidence,

441
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
 or we want their message to be of such high quality

442
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
 that their identity becomes unimportant.

443
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,640
 Some very fine teaching comes from these visitors,

444
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 and it's being spoiled by Tutankhamun.

445
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
 And the thought was, wasn't it,

446
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,640
 that the reason he started coming up because of this heyday thing

447
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
 is because the attention was so great on him

448
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
 that he was, like, invoked back into existence.

449
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
 That was the excuse, wasn't it?

450
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
 Yeah, rather than why has Tutankhamun not been, like,

451
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
 breaking into everyone's seance prior to that,

452
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,640
 it's because, well, he didn't know he was needed prior to that.

453
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,640
 They were claiming he was a bit of an eugotistical attention seeker,

454
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
 and so he was up there, like, "Well, no one cares about me,"

455
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
 and then they started caring, so he decided,

456
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 "Fine, I'll come and visit him."

457
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
 So what was he saying? What were the messages he was bringing?

458
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,640
 So sometimes he was angry, his tomb had been violated,

459
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
 and he would smash everything up.

460
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,640
 He injured a medium.

461
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,640
 He broke lots of Egyptian sculptures that were in the room.

462
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,640
 And then sometimes he was a nice guy.

463
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
 He really depended.

464
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
 I wonder who a modern equivalent of that would be,

465
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
 as in someone who's very, very famous.

466
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,640
 Well, in 2003, there was a pay-per-view Princess Diana seance.

467
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
 I don't know if you remember that.

468
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
 2003, God.

469
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
 Yeah, but pay-per-view.

470
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
 Why do you sound appalled at pay-per-view?

471
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,640
 Because it's event television, it was sort of...

472
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,640
 Not only would it be a huge event that you would have pay-per-view,

473
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
 because, you know...

474
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
 Got it.

475
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
 Right.

476
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
 But you're saying it should have been BBC, then?

477
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
 License fee only.

478
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
 Prime time.

479
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
 Absolutely.

480
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,640
 Budget cuts for the BBC, they just can't afford it.

481
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
 But check this out.

482
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
 This is a seance that I'd never heard of before.

483
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
 This was a medium who was quite famous, called Lillian Bailey.

484
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
 And she claimed that she had a spirit guide

485
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
 who was called William Headley Wooten.

486
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
 And he was a captain during World War I.

487
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
 He died in World War I.

488
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
 And she would use him in order to bring other people to talk.

489
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,640
 And she received a request one day to go and do a seance.

490
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
 But they said, "It's a bit high-profile, the person.

491
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,640
 So what we're going to do is we're going to pick you up from your place.

492
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,640
 We're going to blindfold you, and we're going to take you to the place."

493
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
 So she was sat around the table,

494
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
 and then she wasn't allowed to take the blindfold off.

495
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
 So she did it.

496
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 And at the end of it, having contacted someone,

497
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
 she took the blindfold off and sitting in front of her

498
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
 was Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, the Queen Mother,

499
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
 and a few other of the royals.

500
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
 And what it was is it was not long after the King had died,

501
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,640
 and the Queen Mother was obsessed with the idea of contact.

502
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
 So the Queen was at a seance.

503
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,640
 Can you imagine taking that blindfold off?

504
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 Bloody hell.

505
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,640
 And she just slowly put it back on.

506
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,640
 Take me home.

507
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,640
 But she kind of used that in the future as a kind of,

508
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
 she's the Queen's official medium.

509
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
 Well, you were, didn't you?

510
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
 Yeah, yeah, by royal appointment.

511
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
 That's who she said she was.

512
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,640
 And the Queen Mother often would book sessions with her afterwards

513
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
 to try and do it.

514
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,640
 And the person who set it up, which was not in the movie,

515
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
 was a man called Lionel Logue,

516
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,640
 who was the therapist who treated the King for his stammer

517
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
 in the King's speech.

518
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
 Right.

519
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
 He's the one who set up the seance.

520
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
 Wow, they should have put that in.

521
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
 Yeah, what a scene.

522
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
 Oh my God.

523
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
 Do you speak in a seance when you're one of the guests,

524
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
 or do you only speak when you're the medium?

525
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
 You're not really supposed to, yeah.

526
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
 Okay.

527
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
 I just thought, because that would have given it away,

528
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
 not enough people speak like the Queen and Prince Philip

529
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,640
 and the Queen Mum to conceal your identity.

530
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
 Maybe they'd put an accent on.

531
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,640
 Not like an Aussie accent, no?

532
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
 Yeah, a cockney Irish or something.

533
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
 Yeah.

534
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
 German.

535
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
 Sure.

536
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,640
 Whatever their best at.

537
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
 Actually, speaking of Germans,

538
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
 there was a big thing in the war, wasn't there,

539
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,640
 where there was a medium called Helen Duncan.

540
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,640
 And she was a Scottish 25-stone working-class mother of six

541
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,640
 who swore, smoked and drank whiskey.

542
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
 She sounds great, right?

543
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
 But at the time, she was late in the upper classes in London.

544
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
 They thought she was an absolute genius.

545
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
 They thought that she could speak to the dead.

546
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,640
 She was really, really important in the high society.

547
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,640
 And then in 1941, she was in a seance in Portsmouth,

548
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,640
 and she claimed the spirit of a sailor told her

549
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
 that a certain ship had been sunk.

550
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
 And it turned out that that ship had been sunk,

551
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
 but it hadn't been reported yet.

552
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
 And so, obviously, she became...

553
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
 They were really worried about her.

554
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,640
 First of all, maybe, you know, she is somehow getting messages

555
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
 from the dead, or maybe she's getting messages from the Germans,

556
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
 or...

557
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,640
 Yeah, they thought she might be a spy who was ceding the information.

558
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,640
 And of course, she got done for witchcraft.

559
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,640
 Yeah, she was the last person, or the second last person,

560
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
 the last person to be imprisoned under the Witchcraft Act.

561
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,640
 But she got imprisoned under the Witchcraft Act of 1735.

562
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
 So what was she being imprisoned for?

563
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 Being a witch.

564
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
 It's absolutely incorrect.

565
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
 Not being a witch.

566
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 That's absolutely right.

567
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 Oh!

568
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
 So the Witchcraft Act of 1735

569
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,640
 was not about persecuting witches.

570
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,640
 It was the first act that acknowledged witches are not real,

571
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,640
 and so people pretending to be witches

572
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
 are the ones who need to be punished now for faking it.

573
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,640
 And so she was punished for pretending to be a witch.

574
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 That's brilliant.

575
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
 God, that's a real catch-22 situation as well.

576
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
 Yeah, yeah.

577
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
 Yeah, it is, isn't it?

578
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
 Have you guys heard of Colin Evans?

579
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
 No.

580
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,640
 He was a Welsh spiritualist in, I think, the 1920s,

581
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 and his big thing was claiming that he could levitate.

582
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,640
 So he would get an audience, probably an audience around this size,

583
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 a few hundred people.

584
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,640
 He would request the room went completely dark.

585
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,640
 The audience would sit around him and pitch blackness,

586
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,640
 and they would chant, they would all chant the same thing,

587
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
 an incredible atmosphere, something amazing to be proud of.

588
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
 Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate.

589
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
 Now the lights down?

590
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
 No.

591
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,640
 It was completely dark, and then he provided proof of it.

592
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
 He would take photos of himself at the very moment

593
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
 where he was levitating.

594
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,640
 But the thing is, he was just jumping.

595
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,640
 He would just jump, take the photo, and then land.

596
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
 That's quite impressive.

597
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,640
 Well, that was the whole act.

598
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
 When was it, sir?

599
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
 '20s?

600
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
 Photos took a long time to expose back then to capture something.

601
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
 No, no, no, you had a flash photo in the '20s.

602
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
 It might have been the '30s.

603
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
 Exposure times were right down.

604
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
 Was he smiling in the photo, or was he serious?

605
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
 He was very serious.

606
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,640
 But his feet were slightly blurred, and that also gave away...

607
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
 But also, I suppose Dan is right that the technology

608
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,640
 must have been new enough that people didn't, like, catch on, right?

609
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
 Didn't assume, yeah.

610
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
 I guess.

611
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
 And it was also, even if you were in the room,

612
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,640
 you'd see a tiny flash of light, and him...

613
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
 Oh, so that would provide the light as well.

614
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
 Mid-jump, would they?

615
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

616
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,640
 I always think that back in these olden days,

617
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
 the Seance days in the 1920s,

618
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,640
 it must have been so much darker than it is today.

619
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 I just think there was less natural light around.

620
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
 Maybe we didn't have a moon back then,

621
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,640
 because basically all the tricks they did

622
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
 were based on it being pitch black, so...

623
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
 Maybe you have one candle, you know?

624
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
 Just a bit of atmosphere, one candle.

625
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
 No, no, you can't have any candles.

626
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
 Well, because you had things like Seance trumpets,

627
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,640
 which were these trumpets through which the spirit spoke.

628
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
 They magnified their voices,

629
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
 and they used to float around in the middle of the room,

630
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,640
 and they'd have glowing rings on their back end and front end.

631
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,640
 And the way they floated was that a medium's assistant

632
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,640
 would just be holding it up, but he'd be wearing black,

633
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
 so no one would see.

634
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,640
 And it's like, "How dark does it have to be that you can't see?"

635
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,640
 And the ectoplasm, probably the best thing about all Seances,

636
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,640
 the weird, like, physical manifestation of spirits,

637
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,640
 which was kind of white stuff.

638
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
 Gooey stuff.

639
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
 Gooey stuff that would come out of orifices of the medium.

640
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,640
 I mean, it's got to be pretty dark for you to think that's anything spooky,

641
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
 because usually it was handkerchiefs

642
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,640
 that they would stick up their nose as far as they could

643
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
 and then kind of pull out.

644
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
 There was one amazing medium, Mary M,

645
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,640
 who produced ectoplasm with photos of Arthur Conan Doyle on it.

646
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,640
 So she said, "Arthur Conan Doyle's coming out of my nose."

647
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
 It was after he died, "Look at this,"

648
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,640
 and then pulled this tissue out of her nose with a photo of him on it,

649
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,640
 which someone pointed out later was the same photo that had appeared

650
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
 in a newspaper about a week earlier.

651
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,640
 It'd obviously been stuck on people.

652
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,640
 Arthur Conan Doyle solved an incredible case

653
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,640
 where someone was claiming that they'd contacted a celebrity from the other side,

654
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
 which was there was a book that was released called The Mystery of Edwin Druid.

655
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
 We've spoken about it before on the podcast.

656
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
 I actually wrote about this in my book as well.

657
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
 I got obsessed with Seances.

658
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
 What's that called then?

659
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
 The theory of everything else out now.

660
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,640
 It's actually available in Selected Stars.

661
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
 It's actually in most shots, so yeah,

662
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,640
 and they have lots of copies, so if someone could find one.

663
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
 But no, I got obsessed with...

664
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,640
 There was a period where there were people claiming,

665
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,640
 because Seances were so massive that celebrities who were dead,

666
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
 Mark Twain, Charles Dickens,

667
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,640
 they were dictating from the other side new novels, new works,

668
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,640
 and they would go on sale by real publishers and people would buy them.

669
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
 They'd be reviewed in The New York Times.

670
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,640
 Even if skeptically, they got sort of space.

671
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,640
 And there was one book which was The Mystery of Edwin Druid.

672
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,640
 It was the final Charles Dickens book that he never finished,

673
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 and he didn't leave any notes of what had happened to the character

674
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
 and who had killed Edwin Druid.

675
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 So a guy called TP James actually finished the book by contacting Dickens from the other side.

676
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
 And he said, "This is the final book."

677
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
 They published it.

678
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,640
 There was a new forward written by Dickens as well to explain the process.

679
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
 They had a new book that they were working on together

680
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,640
 called The Life and Adventures of Buckley Whippleheap.

681
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
 It was a very exciting thing.

682
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,640
 And it was Arthur Conan Doyle who said he didn't contact Charles Dickens.

683
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
 The reason Arthur Conan Doyle knew that

684
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,640
 is because he himself did a seance in which he contacted Charles Dickens

685
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
 and asked him, "Did you finish this book?"

686
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
 And he said, "No, it wasn't me."

687
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
 Just on the Ouija board.

688
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
 We're saying it right, Ouija?

689
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,640
 Ouija.

690
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
 Well, whenever I use them, I say Ouija.

691
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,640
 There's also the squeegee board, which is a whole thing.

692
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,640
 Anyway, so it was invented by someone called Helen Peters.

693
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
 She was a medium.

694
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,640
 And then there was an entrepreneur called William Fould

695
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
 who took over the business.

696
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,640
 It was so popular, again, around the time of the 20s and 30s.

697
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,640
 At one point, he had several factories all just churning out Ouija boards.

698
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,640
 They sold thousands and thousands of thousands of them.

699
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,640
 And he only sat up in such a big way because the board had told him,

700
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
 "Prepare for big business."

701
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
 So, yeah.

702
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
 But this is the really spooky thing.

703
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
 He went up on the roof of one of the factories

704
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,640
 to see a flagpole being replaced, right?

705
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,640
 And then he fell off and died.

706
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
 Oh, my God.

707
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
 He just fell off.

708
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
 Yeah, yeah.

709
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
 OK.

710
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
 And then he came back and said something.

711
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
 No, no, no, no.

712
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
 But he still makes you think, doesn't he?

713
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
 Oh, yeah.

714
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,640
 The reason I think that it's pronounced Ouija is there's a YouTuber

715
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
 called Sexkick who went on to Yahoo Answers

716
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,640
 and searched for various different spellings of Ouija board

717
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,640
 and found, "How do you make a Ouija board?

718
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,640
 "Have you played the Ouija board and can you burn the Ouija board?"

719
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
 And it seems, and quite a lot more,

720
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
 and it seems like there's a lot of people in America

721
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,640
 who think that it's not a Ouija board, but a Ouija board.

722
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
 It's really good.

723
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
 It's coming through.

724
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
 "Who are you?"

725
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
 "It's me!"

726
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
 [laughter]

727
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:29,640
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

728
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,640
 My fact this week is that according to his various biographers,

729
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,640
 Pythagoras could talk with animals, be in two places at once,

730
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
 had a shiny golden leg,

731
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,640
 and was able to tell fishermen the exact number of fish

732
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,640
 they'd caught in their net just by looking at it.

733
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
 So this was a side...

734
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
 I could do the last one, I reckon.

735
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
 Well...

736
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
 It depends how many there are.

737
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
 Yeah.

738
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
 It depends on the... Maybe not a trawler, then.

739
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,640
 [laughter]

740
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
 Two.

741
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
 [laughter]

742
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
 Screw you, Pythagoras.

743
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,640
 I'm genuinely really shocked that we've done 400-plus episodes

744
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
 and we've never ever mentioned Pythagoras,

745
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,640
 and I'm doubly shocked that after all the years of us doing this stuff,

746
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,640
 I didn't realise what a mad life he supposedly had

747
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
 according to the stories of his life.

748
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,640
 We all know him for his theorem, very famously.

749
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
 He was a mathematician, he was a philosopher.

750
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
 I didn't realise there was a cult around him

751
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 that sort of put him into a sort of paranormal territory

752
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
 where he was able to reincarnate and be...

753
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
 He wasn't really a mathematician either, that's the word.

754
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,640
 I thought he was a mathematician, he was kind of a mystic

755
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,640
 and then cult leader and political figure.

756
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,640
 But the cult were very into numbers, weren't they?

757
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
 So that was part of it.

758
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
 And numbers are very maths-related.

759
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
 So they're maths-adjacent.

760
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
 Not when you're doing algebra.

761
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
 Great point.

762
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
 Oh, didn't you get a long way?

763
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
 [laughter]

764
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
 Look who did GCSE!

765
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,640
 But no, he wasn't really a mathematician.

766
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
 Pythagoras' theorem had been come up with about a thousand years before him.

767
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,640
 Oh, actually, related to the first-ever episode, we did a fish.

768
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 There's a Pythagoras fact.

769
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,640
 Yeah, one of the people who proved Pythagoras' theorem

770
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,640
 in a new way that had never been demonstrated before was...

771
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
 - President Garfield. - President Garfield.

772
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
 - That's it, really. - That's it, yeah.

773
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,640
 Lying in that hospital bed, being fed through his arse,

774
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
 you've got to do something to distract yourself.

775
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,640
 That's a confusing sentence if you haven't heard the first episode.

776
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
 The first episode is a fish.

777
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
 You'll just have to go back and listen.

778
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
 It's a great teaser, yeah.

779
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,640
 They were obsessed with numbers, as you say.

780
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
 And numbers, every number had a different personality.

781
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,640
 Now, I don't know, because I couldn't find out anywhere how high up this went,

782
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
 because it can't go forever.

783
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,640
 But masculine numbers are odd numbers, and feminine numbers are even.

784
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
 Even are considered the only perfect numbers.

785
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,640
 Although odd ones are equated with divinity,

786
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,640
 so all the genders are doing well out of this.

787
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,640
 Oh, yeah, quite sweetly, the feminine number is two,

788
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
 and the masculine number is three,

789
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
 and then five is the marriage number.

790
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,640
 But, yeah, all these numbers meant specific things to them.

791
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,640
 Yeah, it went about as... I think it went as far as ten.

792
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,640
 Because they had to... How far is it?

793
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
 They had this special thing where it's like...

794
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
 Can you imagine, like, a snooker ball triangle,

795
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
 where you have one, then two, then three, then four,

796
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
 and that added up to ten.

797
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
 This was very special to them.

798
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 And they had a poem, or a hymn, really,

799
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,640
 "Bless us, divine number, thou who generated gods and men,

800
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
 "the mother of all, the all-comprising,

801
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,640
 "the all-bounding, the firstborn, the never-swerving,

802
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,640
 "the never-tiring, holy ten."

803
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
 Right. Yeah, they love ten.

804
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
 Yeah, yeah.

805
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
 And they love triangles.

806
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
 Plague snooker must have been hell, actually.

807
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
 Quite staggering.

808
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
 I get it, the right angle thing.

809
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
 What do you guys think he was like?

810
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,640
 Like, let's imagine we're living in the time.

811
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
 OK, well, I can say so.

812
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
 Like, a lot of the things that you've said there

813
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,640
 about the golden thigh and talking to animals,

814
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
 they were written much, much later.

815
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
 Exactly.

816
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
 But some of the things that were written at the time

817
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
 when he was alive, they said that he did believe

818
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,640
 that the souls of humans could return as animals.

819
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
 Yes.

820
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
 So he did believe in reincarnation.

821
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
 We know that because people said it at the time.

822
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,640
 And also that he, you know, he had his own kind of wisdom.

823
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
 He had his own kind of learning.

824
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
 So we know all that kind of stuff happened.

825
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
 Golden leg, maybe not.

826
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,640
 OK, so what about, is there a story about a dog?

827
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 And he was passing someone in the street.

828
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
 He believed that, you know, people could come back

829
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
 in the form of animals and all this, as you just said.

830
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,640
 So he once stopped someone who was beating a small dog in the street

831
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,640
 because he recognised in the barking...

832
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
 You should be in the Colosseum.

833
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,640
 No, he recognised in the barking the voice of a friend of his

834
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
 who died, who had then been reborn as a puppy.

835
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
 Yeah.

836
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
 The whole story does kind of imply that if he hadn't recognised

837
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,640
 the barking as a friend of his, he wouldn't have...

838
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
 ...leave it. ...thought anything was a miss.

839
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
 Must have been a bad dog. Just leave it.

840
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,640
 But what does he then do with the dog?

841
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,640
 You're turning this into a very different kind of talk show type

842
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
 of podcast, Jerry Springer style.

843
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,640
 We don't know what he was like. No, no, no.

844
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
 What's the dilemma? Sorry, this.

845
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
 My friend is a dog.

846
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
 My friend's a dog. Stop beating the dog.

847
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
 OK, I'll stop beating it. Wouldn't you be like,

848
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,640
 "Greg, what's up? Come hang out. Have dinner at ours."

849
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
 He's just going to be like, "All right, see you, buddy.

850
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
 "Enjoy your new life." Great to hang out.

851
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,640
 "Sucks you're a dog. Catch you later."

852
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,640
 Stop homing my leg. You never did that before.

853
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,640
 He did love numbers, but he hated irrational numbers,

854
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,640
 or at least he didn't believe they existed, so...

855
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
 Is that why they're called irrational,

856
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
 because he was so irrational about them?

857
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
 He had an irrational loathing of them.

858
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
 Sorry, they're the ones that go on forever.

859
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,640
 So they're numbers that can't be expressed as a fraction or a ratio,

860
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,640
 which I only realised when I was doing this research,

861
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,640
 having to know this irrational I ratio,

862
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
 they're numbers that you can't express as a ratio.

863
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,640
 So five, six over two...

864
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
 Yeah, you idiot. Can't believe we...

865
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
 Can't believe we were all thinking of that.

866
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,640
 So if you take 22 divided by seven,

867
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,640
 it gets to quite close to 3.14 something,

868
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,640
 but it doesn't get to pi, which is 3.141, blah, blah, blah, blah,

869
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
 which goes on forever.

870
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
 And that would be an irrational number.

871
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,640
 And he didn't believe in them, because he loved finite numbers.

872
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,640
 And they were on a boat one day, on a cruise or something.

873
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,640
 And one of his followers, called Hepaceus,

874
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
 proved the existence of irrational numbers

875
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
 by saying the square root of two is one,

876
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,640
 which not is one, is one, is one.

877
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,640
 This is why I got no further than GCSE.

878
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,640
 And he, according to reports, was tossed overboard.

879
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
 Yeah. Really?

880
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
 So you've got to be careful with strict teachers.

881
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
 Wasn't they killed him? Yeah, they killed him, yeah.

882
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
 They killed him for proving that the square root of two

883
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
 is an irrational number. Yeah. Supposedly, yeah.

884
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
 But he had made him walk the plank.

885
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
 But he believed in reincarnation,

886
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
 so he probably thought he'd bump into him on the street.

887
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
 Greg! Greg, dude.

888
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
 I don't know what happened with my temper that day,

889
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,640
 but, wow, it was a fun cruise, though, wasn't it?

890
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,640
 When you joined his cult, you had to say nothing for five years,

891
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,640
 and that was how you got to the next level of the cult.

892
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
 OK. And also, he had...

893
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,640
 If he'd had gone four years and 11 months,

894
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
 that's a tough one, isn't it?

895
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,640
 And you bag your fart. Yeah.

896
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,640
 But he had a system for his followers, right?

897
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,640
 So there were the Mathematikoi,

898
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
 who were the senior followers, right?

899
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
 And he would meet them in person,

900
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
 and he would discuss proper maths with them, hard maths,

901
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
 and, you know, they would think a lot,

902
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
 and they'd do a lot of, you know, they'd do the big stuff.

903
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
 And they had to make sacrifices.

904
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
 They had to give up meat.

905
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
 Women, they're all men, and private possessions, OK?

906
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
 So that's the senior tier.

907
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
 And they were touched white roosters.

908
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
 Is that true? Yeah.

909
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
 Wow. OK.

910
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
 I'm out.

911
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
 You'll have to give up meat, women, and private possessions.

912
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
 Fine, fine. Anything else?

913
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
 There's one thing. I'm out.

914
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,640
 A couple more rules. OK, yeah.

915
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
 Don't eat your brain.

916
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
 Don't eat your brain.

917
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
 Couldn't find out really anything else,

918
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
 but I suppose that's all you need to know.

919
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
 Don't break bread.

920
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,640
 Don't poke fire with a sword.

921
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
 Never urinate into the sun.

922
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,640
 I've heard don't urinate into the wind.

923
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,640
 Never into the sun. You might put it out.

924
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,640
 And we say that they couldn't eat any meat,

925
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
 which was mostly true,

926
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
 but they did still sacrifice an oxen

927
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
 whenever they proved a mathematical formula.

928
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,640
 Sorry, what am I being sacrificed for again?

929
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,640
 Normally it's to a piece of gold or something.

930
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
 This doesn't sound important.

931
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
 You're being put into a pie.

932
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
 Oh, my God.

933
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,640
 That's sympathy.

934
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
 No.

935
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
 That's the best joke you'll hear for months.

936
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
 But then he also had these junior tier followers,

937
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
 people who basically hadn't subscribed,

938
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
 and they were called the Akusmatikoi.

939
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
 Is this like a Patreon?

940
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
 It was a Patreon.

941
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
 It was genuinely he had a subscription service,

942
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
 so the Mathematikoi were in,

943
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
 and Akusmatikoi,

944
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
 he would only speak to them from behind a curtain.

945
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
 Wow.

946
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
 And they weren't allowed to see his face,

947
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
 and they couldn't learn any proper maths,

948
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
 like any detailed maths.

949
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
 That was really because he wasn't the real Wizard of Oz, was he?

950
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
 He was just an old man.

951
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
 This thing of him hiding behind a curtain

952
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
 so that you couldn't see him as he was talking,

953
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
 there is one of the stories of his death

954
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
 is directly associated with that.

955
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
 So someone on the lower Patreon level

956
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
 was part of that,

957
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
 couldn't see his face,

958
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
 got so angry that he couldn't see him,

959
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
 was furious that he burnt down his house.

960
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
 Wait, Pythagoras' house?

961
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
 He burnt Pythagoras' house down,

962
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
 and then he chased him into a field.

963
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
 So Pythagoras was in the lead,

964
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
 he's going good, he gets to the field,

965
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
 he's escaping this man, this is how the story goes,

966
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
 and then he notices that the field

967
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
 is full of beans,

968
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
 and Pythagoras refuses to step on beans,

969
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
 because he believes that beans,

970
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
 much like dogs, are the reincarnation.

971
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
 Reg?

972
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
 I thought what you were going to say

973
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
 is that the guys chasing him

974
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,640
 went round two sides of the field

975
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
 and he went diagonally across it.

976
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,640
 So he gets to the field of beans

977
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
 and he stops and he thinks,

978
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
 "I can't step on these beans,

979
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
 I'll kill the beans with my feet."

980
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,640
 So the man catches up, and rather than going,

981
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
 "Fuck it, I'll just stamp on some beans,"

982
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
 he just stands there while the man cuts his throat

983
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,640
 and kills him, and that's the death of Pythagoras,

984
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
 according to one of many accounts.

985
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
 I think there's another version of the story

986
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
 where loads of his followers gave their own lives

987
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,640
 so that Pythagoras, "Go, Pythagoras, go, go,

988
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
 you must go, we'll give up our lives, well, we're killed."

989
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
 And then he still gets to the head of the bean field,

990
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
 "Listen, I can't do it.

991
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
 I can sacrifice them.

992
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
 I can't sacrifice you, my beanie friends."

993
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,640
 He supposedly had the power

994
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
 to write words on the face of the moon.

995
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
 Oh, yeah.

996
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
 And I forgot to write

997
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,640
 anything more about that.

998
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
 I said,

999
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
 "Did he ever do that,

1000
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
 or was it just he had the power to..."

1001
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
 I have to tell you, Andy, power to the brain.

1002
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
 That's a single sentence there.

1003
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
 And for just $2.99 a month,

1004
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
 you'll be able to see the words I do write

1005
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
 on the face of the moon.

1006
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
 All right, I need to move us on

1007
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
 to our final fact of the show.

1008
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
 It is time for our final fact,

1009
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
 and that is James.

1010
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
 OK, my fact this week is

1011
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
 whenthewebsiteshealth.com

1012
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
 listed the fattiest foods

1013
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
 in every state in the US,

1014
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
 entrance included North Carolina's

1015
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
 liver mush,

1016
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
 New York's garbage plate,

1017
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,640
 and Indiana's fried brain sandwich.

1018
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
 See, they never read Pythagoras

1019
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
 anyway.

1020
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
 So, yeah, this is a fact just about

1021
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
 the disgusting things you can eat in America.

1022
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
 Yeah, the fried brain sandwich sounds

1023
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,640
 really weird.

1024
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
 The others are slightly euphemistic.

1025
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
 Well, not even that you've missed it,

1026
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
 but fried brain sandwiches are

1027
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
 literally exactly what they sound like.

1028
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
 Whose brain?

1029
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,640
 Well, it used to be cow brains,

1030
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
 but after my cow disease came in,

1031
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
 they're now pig brains.

1032
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
 One little tip,

1033
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
 as in you put the breadcrumbs on there,

1034
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,640
 make sure you have cold hands,

1035
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,640
 otherwise they can fall apart.

1036
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
 So that's a little bit of a tip.

1037
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
 The best place to get them is Hilltop Inn

1038
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
 in Evansville,

1039
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
 and that has been dubbed recently,

1040
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
 in 2009, actually, the manliest restaurant

1041
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
 in America.

1042
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
 Oh!

1043
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
 I know I'm a man, but I don't actually want

1044
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
 my restaurant to be manly.

1045
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
 It's not even in my top five criteria for a restaurant.

1046
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,640
 Shall we go Indian, Chinese or Manly?

1047
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,640
 Exactly!

1048
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
 This list is incredible, though.

1049
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
 So you wrote out some of the

1050
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
 most amazing sounding ones,

1051
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
 but even the other things on it,

1052
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
 the Colorado, the Jack and Grills 7-pound

1053
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
 breakfast burrito is the least healthy food

1054
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
 in Colorado. Connecticut, the two-foot-long

1055
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,640
 hot dog, and these aren't just in one place.

1056
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,640
 Lots of them are available in lots of different places.

1057
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,640
 Yeah.

1058
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
 There's the quadruple bypass burger.

1059
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,640
 8,000 calories.

1060
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
 I've had some of one of them.

1061
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
 How did you? Yeah, in Vegas, right?

1062
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,640
 It's not impressive to have had some of one of them.

1063
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,640
 [LAUGHTER]

1064
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,640
 They don't put your photo on the wall for that, mate.

1065
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,640
 [LAUGHTER]

1066
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
 They'll put some of your photo on the wall.

1067
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
 [LAUGHTER]

1068
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
 Did you hear about the Luther Burger?

1069
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,640
 This is in Georgia, in the south.

1070
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,640
 Right, it's a normal burger, the Luther Burger.

1071
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
 It's a normal burger. It's got egg, it's got

1072
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
 bacon, and it's got cheese, as well as the burger.

1073
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
 So far, so meh.

1074
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
 But it's not served between a bun,

1075
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640
 do you guess?

1076
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,640
 Luther, between two church doors.

1077
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
 [LAUGHTER]

1078
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
 Yeah.

1079
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
 Between the north, it fills the gap

1080
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,640
 between the north and south doors on the transept.

1081
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
 It's amazing.

1082
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
 No, it's someone in the audience,

1083
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
 a mermaid, actually, it's between

1084
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,640
 two Krispy Kreme glazed donuts.

1085
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,640
 Oh, yeah.

1086
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,640
 And was that part of his Protestant theology?

1087
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
 [LAUGHTER]

1088
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
 The donut thing? It was the '96 theorem.

1089
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
 Right.

1090
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,640
 Shall I just quickly

1091
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,640
 say the other two, very quickly?

1092
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,640
 Yeah, yeah. Sorry, liver mush

1093
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,640
 is a savory slice

1094
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
 loaf made from pork liver, scrap meat,

1095
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
 often from a pig's head,

1096
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
 spices and cornmeal.

1097
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
 Nice. Okay, and they have a liver mush

1098
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
 eating contest

1099
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
 in wherever it was, in North

1100
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
 Carolina, every year.

1101
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
 They also have a liver mush pageant,

1102
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
 but in last year's...

1103
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1104
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
 Consisting of what? I mean, are there floats?

1105
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
 It's... It really feels like

1106
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
 putting lipstick on a pig, really,

1107
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
 trying to make that attractive.

1108
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,640
 It's basically a festival, and they have lots of things,

1109
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,640
 but they have basically the local

1110
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,640
 children or young women

1111
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
 that kind of... Dresses liver mush.

1112
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
 They just dress as gobbles.

1113
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
 Is it like a liver mush queen? They often do that kind of thing.

1114
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
 I think so, that's the kind of thing, yeah.

1115
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
 And the liver mush eating contest,

1116
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
 where last year, the winner managed to eat some.

1117
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,640
 (LAUGHTER)

1118
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
 And garbage plate is from

1119
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
 Rochester, New York, and it's basically...

1120
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
 This actually sounds really good.

1121
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
 It's a choice of any meats, so

1122
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
 even though I am vegetarian, but let's pretend

1123
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,640
 I'm not. It's like hamburgers, hot dogs,

1124
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,640
 sausages, any kind of stuff.

1125
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
 You shove a load of french fries on it,

1126
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
 shove a load of beans on it, macaroni cheese,

1127
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
 and then cover it in a special sauce.

1128
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,640
 That actually sounds quite good to me.

1129
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,640
 Really depends on the special sauce.

1130
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
 Yeah, it does well. I think it's hot sauce.

1131
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
 Okay. Yeah.

1132
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
 We've mentioned it before, James,

1133
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
 you've been there, but I just

1134
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
 love reading about it every single time,

1135
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
 which is the Disgusting Food Museum in Malmo, Sweden.

1136
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
 And it just collects

1137
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
 food that is utterly horrible,

1138
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
 and James, you tried a few things there,

1139
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,640
 which tasted horrible.

1140
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
 I was reading an article by a guy who went there

1141
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
 in 2019 called Arthur de Mayer,

1142
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
 and he described...

1143
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,640
 He gave a bit more of a sort of explanation

1144
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
 about these particular foods, so you can have

1145
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
 an Icelandic shark dish there

1146
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,640
 called hackarl, and he said

1147
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
 it was eating it was like

1148
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,640
 gnawing on three-week-old cheese

1149
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
 from the garbage that had also been

1150
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
 pissed on by every dog in the neighbourhood.

1151
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
 That was one thing he had here.

1152
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,640
 I had that there, by the way. Did you?

1153
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,640
 Yeah, I did. Did you vomit?

1154
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,640
 No, I didn't vomit at all from any of them,

1155
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
 although I retched quite a lot.

1156
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,640
 Does that count? No.

1157
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,640
 But the hackarl one was funny because

1158
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,640
 the guy told me that it was

1159
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,640
 that seeped in urine,

1160
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
 and I ate it, and you could really believe it.

1161
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
 It tasted... It did taste like piss.

1162
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
 And then I actually put it in a QI script,

1163
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
 and it turned out to be completely untrue.

1164
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,640
 Oh, no.

1165
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
 It was a natural, uriny taste that it had.

1166
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
 It didn't add any urine

1167
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
 into it, and so we cut it, yeah.

1168
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,640
 There's another one.

1169
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
 The South Korean wine. Did you drink that?

1170
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,640
 Actually, I think that's behind a sort of glass,

1171
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
 because in order...

1172
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
 Feces? You have fresh turds of children,

1173
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,640
 specifically.

1174
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
 And the owner of the museum,

1175
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
 one of the founders of the museum,

1176
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
 he actually went about scooping up

1177
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
 his eight-year-old daughter's poo

1178
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,640
 in order to make this concoction.

1179
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,640
 That doesn't count. It's like if you're buying it

1180
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
 from South Korea as a special thing,

1181
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
 that's one thing. If you're actually making it

1182
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
 from your own, that's different.

1183
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,640
 But it says it has to be fresh,

1184
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
 and no turd is going to be fresh

1185
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
 by the time it's gone from South Korea to Sweden.

1186
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
 I don't think turds are ever fresh.

1187
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,640
 They absolutely are.

1188
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
 They can be new.

1189
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,640
 No!

1190
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,640
 I see what you're saying.

1191
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
 Like, if you're at a fresh deli,

1192
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,640
 you wouldn't expect to see it, would you?

1193
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,640
 They're safe at least five days

1194
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,640
 after their best-before date. I'm telling you.

1195
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,640
 OK, OK.

1196
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,640
 Gosh. So, it's got slightly distracted

1197
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,640
 from this, because someone wrote in,

1198
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,640
 actually, to the podcast email account,

1199
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,640
 podcast@qi.com,

1200
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
 and this is from Evelyn Keely.

1201
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,640
 And it's the...

1202
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,640
 Oklahoma has a state steak.

1203
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,640
 You know, these official state things

1204
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,640
 they have? Absolutely mad stuff.

1205
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,640
 So, Oklahoma's state steak

1206
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,640
 is the ribeye steak.

1207
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,640
 The state drink is milk.

1208
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
 This is a complete brackets,

1209
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
 but they've got a state astronomical object,

1210
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
 which is the rosette nebula

1211
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,640
 5,000 light years away.

1212
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,640
 I've no idea why.

1213
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
 I feel like...

1214
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,640
 Such an unreciprocated relationship.

1215
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,640
 I know.

1216
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,640
 Twinned with.

1217
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,640
 But they've also got, right, this is what

1218
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,640
 sort of brought me back to the actual fact,

1219
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,640
 which is the state meal, OK?

1220
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,640
 And the state meal is this.

1221
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,640
 It's some chicken fried steak,

1222
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,640
 followed by barbecued pork,

1223
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,640
 followed by fried okra, squash,

1224
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
 cornbread, grits,

1225
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,640
 corn, sausage with biscuits and gravy,

1226
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,640
 black-eyed peas, strawberries

1227
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,640
 and pecan pie.

1228
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
 That's the state meal.

1229
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,640
 Wow. A lot of that sounds good,

1230
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,640
 just not in the course of one meal.

1231
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,640
 Actually, just speaking of, like, many courses

1232
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,640
 with meals,

1233
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,640
 there is a footballer called Robert Lewandowski

1234
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,640
 who plays for Poland.

1235
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,640
 And whenever he eats a three-course meal,

1236
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
 he always eats his dessert first.

1237
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,640
 Isn't that cool?

1238
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,640
 Does he have a reason for it? Yes.

1239
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,640
 He's Benjamin Button, isn't he?

1240
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,640
 This is a new-ish kind of diet,

1241
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,640
 and the idea is you eat

1242
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,640
 a very fatty dessert,

1243
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,640
 and then you eat your main course,

1244
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,640
 and then you eat your starter.

1245
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,640
 And the idea is, what happens is,

1246
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,640
 if you eat a normal meal, you have your starter

1247
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,640
 and your main course, and then the dessert will come

1248
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
 and it looks really good, and you're like,

1249
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
 "Oh, go on, then I'll have it," and you find some extra space for it.

1250
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,640
 But people are less inclined to do that for their starter.

1251
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,640
 And they tend to choose

1252
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,640
 better main courses as well.

1253
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,640
 And so there was a study done

1254
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,640
 with people who were either told

1255
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,640
 to eat in the normal order,

1256
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,640
 or they could have a cheesecake

1257
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,640
 and then choose their main and choose their

1258
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,640
 starter, or they could

1259
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,640
 have some fruit and then choose their main

1260
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,640
 and then their starter, and they found that the people

1261
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,640
 who ate the cheesecake first

1262
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,640
 have 30% fewer calories

1263
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,640
 than anyone else in their meal, and that includes

1264
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,640
 the really fatty dessert that they had.

1265
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,640
 That's brilliant. That's amazing.

1266
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,640
 It's like a trick. It's like you're tricking your mind.

1267
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,640
 We've just cracked it, haven't we?

1268
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,640
 You've just cracked the whole food thing.

1269
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,640
 That's amazing.

1270
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,640
 The whole food thing.

1271
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
 Wow. If that works.

1272
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,640
 You think I've had a sticky toffee pudding,

1273
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,640
 so I think I'll just have a salad for the main. Thank you very much.

1274
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,640
 But do you want to finish your meal

1275
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,640
 with a nice bowl of soup, or would you rather finish

1276
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,640
 with a chocolate cake? I'd rather finish with a starter.

1277
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
 A starter is everyone's favourite course, isn't it?

1278
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,640
 Oh, OK. No. See?

1279
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,640
 OK, way fewer than a third of the people

1280
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,640
 in the room said yes.

1281
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,640
 Sorry, that's not proof.

1282
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,640
 You've always got at least one answer.

1283
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640
 You are one of those people who goes to a restaurant

1284
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,640
 and they have 12 starters.

1285
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,640
 Quiz question.

1286
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,640
 Can you guys name a processed food product

1287
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,640
 that the Earl of Sandwich was responsible for inventing?

1288
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,640
 OK.

1289
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,640
 We're not going to do that.

1290
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
 I'm sorry, a processed product.

1291
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,640
 A food or drink product.

1292
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,640
 Oh, fuck, I've given it away.

1293
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,640
 Or drinks, did you say?

1294
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,640
 Yeah, follow that.

1295
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,640
 Is it a liquidized sandwich?

1296
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,640
 It's the M&S New Liquid Sandwich.

1297
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,640
 It's fizzy drinks.

1298
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,640
 What? Yeah.

1299
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,640
 So, he commissioned Joseph Priestley, the chemist,

1300
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,640
 to work on ways of making

1301
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,640
 stale water more palatable

1302
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,640
 and to keep water lasting longer because of ships.

1303
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,640
 Ships would have stale water, it would go horrible.

1304
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,640
 It's a problem, people don't want to drink their water on board,

1305
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,640
 so they might be dehydrated.

1306
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,640
 So he hired Joseph Priestley,

1307
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,640
 and Joseph Priestley created carbonated water.

1308
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,640
 And as a result,

1309
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,640
 it's slightly acidic, carbonated water,

1310
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,640
 so that means it's slightly antimicrobial,

1311
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,640
 and it means it lasts longer.

1312
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,640
 So that is actually

1313
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,640
 the product that he is kind of responsible for.

1314
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,640
 And the sandwich was way, way earlier,

1315
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,640
 and he just popularized it.

1316
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,640
 You might remember this.

1317
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,640
 I got married in the room where he invented the sandwich.

1318
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,640
 Did you?

1319
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,640
 And that was such a cheap meal as well.

1320
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,640
 Interesting fact, everyone,

1321
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,640
 while you're eating your ham sandwich.

1322
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,640
 It's a homage.

1323
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,640
 And enjoy your glass of Coke.

1324
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,640
 Can I just say, Andy...

1325
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,640
 Crisps are available for purchase at the bar.

1326
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,640
 Which will be a meal deal which you can pay for when you leave.

1327
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,640
 It's not a free wedding, I should have mentioned.

1328
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,640
 Andy said to us before the show started,

1329
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
 "Guys, I'm going to tell a personal anecdote tonight."

1330
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,640
 Was that your personal anecdote?

1331
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,640
 It was my personal anecdote.

1332
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
 Pretty good, yeah, you see that?

1333
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,640
 Nice!

1334
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,640
 He never tells anything.

1335
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,640
 That was huge insight.

1336
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,640
 It was very brave.

1337
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,640
 Well done.

1338
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,640
 The guy from the council made such heavy weather of it in the room on the day.

1339
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
 It was practically more of a sandwich talk than a wedding.

1340
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,640
 It was most of the ceremony, yeah.

1341
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,640
 And do you wish to be sandwiched

1342
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,640
 between the holy laws of matrimony?

1343
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,640
 Can I just mention one other food?

1344
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,640
 American state food that I didn't know about.

1345
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,640
 Again, we'll be very familiar to people from these places,

1346
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,640
 but in places like Oregon and Washington state,

1347
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,640
 now it's spelled G-E-O-D-U-C-K.

1348
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:25,640
 G-E-O-D-U-C-K?

1349
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,640
 Yeah, weird to start with.

1350
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,640
 It's gooey duck, spelled completely the wrong way.

1351
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,640
 And I've never seen one.

1352
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,640
 They're the biggest burrowing clams in the world.

1353
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,640
 And they look...

1354
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,640
 They've got kind of a normal, ish-sized clamshell

1355
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,640
 about the size of your palm.

1356
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,640
 And then it looks like...

1357
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,640
 Looks like a slug's coming out of it, right?

1358
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,640
 Yeah, but it looks like a slug who's tried on a dress.

1359
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
 12 sizes too small for it.

1360
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,640
 It's coming out of it.

1361
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,640
 You've got a slug the length of most of your arm

1362
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,640
 coming out of this bulging out of this tiny shell.

1363
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,640
 I mean, it looks so phallic.

1364
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,640
 It's very hard to get around the fact that it is.

1365
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,640
 And this is a delicacy.

1366
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,640
 They live up to 150 years.

1367
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,640
 And their entire lives are, they're born.

1368
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,640
 They burrow really deep with their shell into the sand.

1369
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,640
 And the reason they've got this huge phallus on them

1370
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,640
 is so that it can stick up and just pop out of the sand

1371
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,640
 on the bottom of the seabed

1372
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,640
 so it can collect up what it needs.

1373
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,640
 Wait, the phallus is collected?

1374
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,640
 No, no, no. It's not a phallus. It looks like a phallus.

1375
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,640
 Oh, sorry. I've got to go. Sorry.

1376
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's that sweetest mouth.

1377
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,640
 And it's a...

1378
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,640
 It's a siphon.

1379
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,640
 And he's going to be doing some googling tonight.

1380
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,640
 It's a really creepy slogan. It's not a phallus.

1381
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,640
 It's a mouth.

1382
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,640
 I don't know why.

1383
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,640
 Whose slogan is that?

1384
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,640
 It's the slogan of the gooey duck.

1385
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,640
 And, yeah, it's...

1386
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,640
 So it's actually a siphon.

1387
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,640
 So it sheds salty liquids, actually,

1388
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,640
 that it doesn't need any more, in fact, in water.

1389
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,640
 I know it looks like a phallus, and it's shedding salty liquids.

1390
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,640
 But I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, it is a mouth.

1391
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,640
 If a gooey duck looks like a phallus and quacks like a phallus...

1392
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,640
 Look, we've run over. I need to wrap us up.

1393
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,640
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1394
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,640
 Thank you so much for listening.

1395
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

1396
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,640
 about the things that we have said over the course of this podcast,

1397
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
 we can be found on our Twitter account.

1398
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,640
 So I'm on @SriberlandAndy.

1399
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,640
 @AndrewHunterM.

1400
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
 James.

1401
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
