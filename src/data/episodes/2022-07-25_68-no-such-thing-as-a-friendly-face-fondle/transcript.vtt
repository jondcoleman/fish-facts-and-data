00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.360
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.520
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray, and Anagy Zinski.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.120
 facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.640
 Starting with you, Juzinski.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.320
 >> My fact is that only 28% of people know when they're being flirted with.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.240
 >> I never know, ever.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.280
 >> Do you think you think people are flirting or they aren't with you?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.080
 >> Aren't.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.720
 >> They aren't.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.880
 Yeah, so this is the interesting thing.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.680
 People never seem so, they've done this study recently, which looked at 52

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.880
 heterosexual women, 52 heterosexual men.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.840
 And they put them in pairs together and made them have a conversation.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.120
 And then afterwards they asked them if they'd flirted with the other person.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.160
 And then they asked them if they thought the other person had been flirting with them.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.520
 And lots of people flirted and only 28% of people realized they were doing it.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.080
 And in women, it was 18%.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.760
 >> Wow.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.080
 >> Was that who knew that they were flirting with someone else or that someone else was flirting with them?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.920
 >> When people flirted with other people, they were aware of it.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.560
 >> Well, sometimes they're not, I think.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.720
 >> Sometimes you accidentally flirt.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 >> Yes, sometimes people are just so flirtatious.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.080
 >> I go accused of that of flirting when I'm not.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.000
 >> Yeah, James always says.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.960
 >> I do say that to you a lot.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.040
 And by the way, get your hand off my leg.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.120
 >> This is an interesting thing about flirting.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.160
 So men are perceived as being better at flirting when these are some of the behaviors

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.600
 that they engage in when women think, oh, he's flirting and he's good at it.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.000
 So for a start, actually looking at the person that you want to flirt with,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.680
 that is a solid gold winner, that's really good.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.440
 Also positioning your body that it takes up more space.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.040
 And doing what's called non-reciprocated touching to surrounding men.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.440
 So this includes playfully shoving, touching, or elbowing the ribs of other men around you.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.920
 Supposedly helps you flirt with a woman that you're interested in on the other side of a bar or something.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.440
 >> Really?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.480
 >> Yeah, you probably should know the person when you're shoving them, right?

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.560
 >> Yeah, so what happens is there's a massive bar fight going on at the other side of the bar.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.320
 And they go, wow, stop flirting with me, guys.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.200
 >> Here's the last thing that this study identified as supposedly a really good sign is the men who are good at it.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 Changed their location in the bar more frequently.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.840
 Where's he gone?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.800
 >> So is that just literally playing hard to get?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.680
 >> I suppose so.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.800
 >> You try to walk over to him, he's suddenly in a different place.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.760
 >> Playing hard to find.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.520
 >> Let's take the thing out of there, let's do that.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.840
 >> You know how you think you're not flirting and you are, Dan?

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.560
 >> Yeah.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.120
 >> Some people think that they're flirting when they're not.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.400
 >> What is it? >> This is called signal amplification bias.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.000
 And it's where you think that your gestures are making it really clear that you're doing some pretty heavy duty flirting.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.320
 But obviously, the other person has no idea.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.000
 So it's like when I'm in a bar and I'm running around into lots of different positions.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.400
 >> The other person just hasn't noticed it.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.680
 >> But she'd run the men in the face.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.760
 >> Yeah, well, I mean, that's why the study has ended up showing that people don't know if they've been flirted with because people don't flirt properly.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.400
 Because the whole, it's kind of self-defeating flirting because the whole point of it really is to be subtle, isn't it?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.520
 The whole point of flirting is to kind of conceal and protect, conceal what you're trying to do and protect yourself.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.760
 Because you don't just walk up to someone and go, I fancy you, do you want to have sex?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.800
 >> So evolutionarily, the idea, I think, is that it could be socially costly to kind of just go up to someone and say,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.680
 you want to have sex with them.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.080
 Because if they say no, then you could get excluded from the group or whatever.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.000
 And it seems to be like a uniquely human thing.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.920
 Other animals don't seem to do it.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.840
 But I read one article about the idea that other animals don't really flirt.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.000
 And it said, if other animals were to flirt, would we even be able to detect it?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.560
 >> Well, we can't detect when we're doing it.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.880
 >> Let's look at the head of ourselves, is this mouse flirting?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.160
 I mean, folks on that woman over there.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.560
 >> But I think around all over the floor, it looks like it's flirting.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.960
 >> But there was a natural history museum exhibition that went on where their whole premise was that animals do flirt.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.640
 And obviously, they must have just been putting a nice little spin on it.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.640
 But there are examples of sort of romantic gestures, it seems.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.560
 >> The idea with flirting is it's something which you wouldn't really be able to tell

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.960
 unless you can just about kind of pick up on it.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.040
 >> Oh, I disagree, I think flirting can be absolutely outright.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.520
 >> No, it is, it's a defense mechanism, rather than saying.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.240
 Because animals just go up to each other and say, let's sleep together.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.560
 That's what all of their flirting is.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.720
 >> Look, the Amazonian River Dolphin, it brings a bouquet of waterweeds.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.920
 >> Yeah, that's not subtle, it's not what you're bouquet of waterweeds.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.960
 >> That's what they want it.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.840
 >> Okay, okay, how about there's a haddock that hums.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.120
 >> Again, that's not really flirting.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.720
 >> Well, if you're going over them.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.440
 >> Yeah, I think that could be.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.120
 >> If she says, well, you just, no, I was just humming, I was just talking about it.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.920
 It's just subtle, that's a subtle signal.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.400
 >> Yeah. >> And with you, Dan.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.000
 >> Flirting is quite a good way of trying to suss out whether someone's going to be worthwhile

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.800
 without actually inviting them to jump into bed with you.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.120
 >> Right. >> Because you might decide halfway through

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.400
 the flirting encounter that actually, no, this guy's not right.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.680
 >> Not sure how this fits with your stats.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.440
 But men over perceived flirting and women under perceived flirting.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.520
 And the reason is because men, if they over perceived and they don't get it right,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.880
 then they just move on to the next one.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.120
 And it doesn't really matter.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.240
 Whereas if women over perceived, then they might have sex with an undesirable man and

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.920
 end up with weedy children and burdened.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.000
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.120
 Yeah, I think that's very plausible.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.360
 And that's definitely what the study showed.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.360
 16% of women recognize some people with flirting, but way more men did.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.320
 >> Right. >> So the, because it is quite costly for

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.200
 humans if you sleep with the wrong person who turns out to be a bit of a weed.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.560
 And doesn't give you good offspring because that's like a nine month gestation period.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.960
 And then you've got to raise this kid who's weedy and shit like the dad.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.840
 So they still under, underestimated it.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.720
 >> Right.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.440
 The word flirting, the word flirting used to actually mean hitting somebody.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.840
 >> Did it?

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.680
 >> Yeah.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.280
 >> It also meant to turn up one's nose or sneer at.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.080
 >> Really?

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.040
 >> That's the verb anyway.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.600
 >> It's really, it's really changed, yeah.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.360
 >> Yeah.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.200
 >> But since the fifth, I think in the 1560s, Samuel Johnson described the noun

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.440
 flirt as it's always a female and it's a pert young Hussie.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.840
 I also liked their alternatives to flirting, which were when it came to mean being,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.400
 it meant being nimble often and I think that came to be nimble conversationally.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.640
 And you could also say someone was a flirty gig or a flirt, Gillian.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.960
 Which I quite like to mean an unconstant woman.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.000
 >> Wow.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.040
 >> They have a flirty gig.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.920
 >> This is weird.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.720
 Scientists found that men find happiness very attractive in a woman.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.800
 But women find it one of the less attractive things in a man.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.600
 >> What happiness?

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.680
 >> Yeah, apparently.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.320
 And shame, sort of doing what's called shameful displays or displays of shame,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.360
 was more attractive to women than happiness.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.080
 >> What's a shameful display?

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.720
 >> Oh, I'm so embarrassed, oh, I can't do this.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.240
 >> Okay.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.480
 >> But you know, which explains you grand in a way?

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.240
 >> It's not dropping your trousers and going.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.800
 >> No, that's a penis.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.920
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.440
 >> I like this, there was, I think this is in scientific American saying research.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.600
 A split types of touching into three categories.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.360
 So there's merely friendly, there's plausible deniability, which is what we were talking about.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.680
 Like if someone's like, are you flirting with me, you can go, no, obviously not.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.200
 And then there's going nuclear and plausible deniability includes an arm touch or

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.600
 a shoulder or a waist touch.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.600
 >> What's going nuclear kind of flirt?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.520
 >> Face touch, which would be a bit weird, wouldn't it?

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.760
 If you just in a pub with someone, they leaned over and touched you on the face.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.880
 >> Yeah, mid-chat though, it's not weird.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.120
 >> Don't if you ever do that to me.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.840
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.040
 >> You're going to be in serious trouble.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.800
 >> If you had like a thing on your head, I'd be like, you got a thing on your head.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.120
 >> You can't just touch people's faces mid conversation, I'm constantly touching faces.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.080
 >> You can't do that.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.200
 >> I don't even ask, I go right in, I don't.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.280
 >> Why?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.840
 Because it's a very personal bit of the body.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.480
 >> I've got a thing on their face.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.200
 >> What's this thing you keep going on about?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.200
 >> Yeah, if you've got a thing on their face, I think that's okay.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.440
 >> I'm not leaving this until we just attain what the thing is.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:09.600
 It might be like sometimes people get glitter on their face or a bit of plough.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.760
 Why do I get the feeling that you go around with a bit of glitter at your pockets, about people's faces?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.480
 >> I don't think it's weird to touch a face, I'm just putting that out there.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.400
 >> I'd touch a bus driver's face, I would touch that's why they've had to put the screens in these days.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.200
 [MUSIC]

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.600
 >> Okay, time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:39.160
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that ancient Sumerian beer was as thick as porridge and was drunk through a straw.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
 >> That's so good.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.320
 >> It's good, although it was as thick as porridge, what kind of heavy-duty straw, is it like McDonald's milkshake?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.800
 >> Yeah, that's the view, right?

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.960
 >> The oldest straw that they've ever found was Sumerian.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.720
 It was found in a tomb dated 3,000 BCE, and it was a gold tube inlaid with Lapis Lazuli.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.360
 >> Gold?

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.760
 >> Wow, wow.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.800
 >> And the thing is, this beer was kind of fermented bread, so it's a bit like vast that they have in Russia.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:17.320
 And it was really, really thick, but you wanted to drink mostly the liquid bit, and so you had the straw to stop the bread from going into your mouth.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.240
 So you just got the liquid bit.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.840
 And they reckon that that's why the straw was invented in general, probably for drinking beer.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.160
 >> That's cool, and I think- >> That's very cool.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.200
 >> Wasn't that first one, it was two men sharing a drink, wasn't it, in the Sumerian tomb, which is nice.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.880
 >> Was it?

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.400
 >> You can't share a straw, though.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.880
 >> I think they had a straw each.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.480
 >> Okay, cool.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.240
 >> And well, wasn't because they found the oldest depiction of a straw, and they also found the oldest straw, didn't they?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.440
 And the depiction had a picture of two men sharing a beer.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.280
 >> Yeah, so this is probably not the first beer in the world that we know of, because that was probably ancient Chinese.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:58.440
 That was called kui, but this is in the, in the, let's say, near West, and it was Sumerian, and they had a few different words for beer.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.840
 It was Sikaru, Dida, or a beer.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.880
 >> The way- >> No!

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.640
 >> E-B-I-R was one of the names for the- >> No, fancy beer.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.240
 >> Cool. >> That's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:17.480
 That also meant beer mug, and they thought that beer was a gift from the gods to promote human happiness and well-being.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.240
 And the first brewers were, they were pre-stasses.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:29.840
 >> So the ancient Egyptians used to say to each other, to greet each other day-to-day, they'd say bread and beer, and that basically meant everything is good in life.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.320
 >> Oh, cool as that.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.720
 >> Yeah, we should start doing that again.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720
 >> Bread and beer.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.920
 >> Isn't there quite a long-running debate?

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:46.320
 I mean, I think there is quite a long-running debate about whether bread came first or beer came first, and a lot of archaeologists think that we have evidence to suggest that beer was brewed before bread was made.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.480
 >> And one followed on from the other.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:55.360
 >> Actually, the oldest bread maker was actually found in a tomb, which contained the oldest depiction of a bread maker.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.040
 >> [LAUGH]

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:14.160
 >> There are loads of guys who try and recreate very ancient beers, and they find the right sort of chemicals in tombs and things like that, and they speculate that this might have been beer or that this contained the sort of flavorings that were to be that they know around the area, so they try and remake all these things.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.640
 They even do things like killing goats to make fresh wine skins at the time.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.440
 >> Wow, that's so cool.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.480
 >> Well, not for the goats, not for the goat.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:29.280
 No, but they have things like genuinely beer used to have things like olive oil, cheese, or carrot, or hemp, all kinds of stuff will be added to it.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.600
 >> I don't want to go to a party that these guys are throwing, I'm going to get a cheesy olive oil beer.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:40.680
 >> There is one guy in Oregon who's a brewer, and he made beer with yeast harvest him from his own beard.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.240
 >> Cool.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.760
 >> Yeah.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.600
 >> How did that taste?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.160
 >> It's just yeast, you know.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:51.440
 Most yeast in the rest of the world is found on animals and insects and rotting fruit, so it's not necessarily any grosser.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.240
 Even though it seems like it is.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.080
 >> Yeah, it does.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.160
 >> There was some 170 year old beer found in a shipwreck just off the coast of Finland, either this year or last year, wasn't there.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.000
 And the divers who went down and they uncovered it.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.080
 I think there were six bottles of beer and they decided to taste it, and it was pretty disgusting, I think.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.520
 >> It's always disgusting whenever they do this.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.840
 >> I never learned.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.840
 We found some 5,000 year old honey too, giving it like, "Oh, it's disgusting."

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.240
 >> You say that, but it could have been disgusting in the first place.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.240
 >> Indeed, and it probably was.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:32.360
 >> They did when they analysed it, they said that it would have had hints of sourd milk and burnt rubber with some rose-like notes and a goatee taste.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.880
 >> A goatee, as in a beard goatee.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:41.480
 >> I'm one of those people that I love a novelty beer, I love the variety of new beers that we have.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.520
 >> I don't know if I go to an off license and I see that Iron Maiden has a beer or ACDC, I'm going to buy that one.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.200
 Did you know that Hansen the band released a beer?

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.040
 >> No.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.680
 >> Was it called "mhops"?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.240
 >> Yes.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.040
 >> Oh, yes it was.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.840
 >> How good was that?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.360
 >> Yeah.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.440
 >> I was going to say they should have done a soft drink called "mhops".

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.360
 >> Oh, yeah.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.080
 >> They could see, like, mist there's a whole range of drinks that they could have done.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.360
 >> Or a range of cleaning items called "mhops".

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.800
 >> It's been gone for a while.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.520
 >> Yep, yep.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:16.680
 >> Also, one that I'd love to get my hands on, because it's a bit of a historical, or historically, it'll be a bit of a famous beer.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.240
 Do you know that David Cameron gave the Coalition Cabinet a beer?

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:21.760
 >> Wait, really?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.560
 >> Around?

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.360
 >> No, no.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.160
 They just want beer between them, that's austerity.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:33.440
 >> No, after the final session of the Coalition Cabinet, they got goody bags as they left.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:42.000
 And inside one of the goody bags was a Coalition beer, which was called co-ale-ishen beer.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.720
 And it had on it, on the back, it said, "An unconventional pairing.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.960
 This experimental beer has astonished outers and exceeded expectations.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.920
 Time for some creative thinking with this carefully crafted beer.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.920
 Hints of oak and zesty lemon deliver a truly distinctive refreshing flavor that lasts the distance."

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.840
 >> Makes you feel sick after a very short time.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.120
 >> Yeah.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.160
 >> I was trying to look for which country drinks most beer was just having a few little looks.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.480
 >> People say it's Czech Republic.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.440
 >> Yep, that's true.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:16.440
 So, as I was looking into this, I also found out what country drinks most wine, the Vatican.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.600
 >> Oh, yeah, of course.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.880
 >> The Vatican, yeah.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.520
 >> But they are really the biggest consumers of Jesus' blood.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.280
 >> Oh, that's they are also that, yeah, that's true, I forgot about that.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.720
 But they also, the Vatican have their own Vatican beer.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.880
 They have a brewery that's not too far away from them.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.160
 And they have, they bring in cases and they love beer.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.400
 Apparently, and it's only slightly a rumor, but when they, when they were deciding on the last pope,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.640
 there was enough bottles for each of the people who were deciding, what would you call them?

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.760
 >> Are they cardinals who do it, but there's a lot of specials.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.960
 >> Yeah, the electors basically.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.520
 There was enough beer for one of them each.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.360
 >> The A electors.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.960
 >> Oh, my goodness.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.640
 >> I just wanted to kill that because I've got really bad but down there.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.720
 And this is why puns ruin all conversations.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720
 >> Yeah.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.480
 >> Because just for anyone listening, James and Andy, we're looking into the sky, not listening

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.840
 to a word that Dan was saying, desperately grappling for some pathetic pun relating to

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.840
 popes and beer.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.840
 And I think it's really inconsiderate to the speaker.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:20.120
 >> And he's still doing it.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:29.520
 >> Okay, time for fact number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.520
 >> My fact is that baby turtles coordinate when they're going to hatch from within their

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.520
 eggshells.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.520
 >> Wow.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.520
 >> It's incredible.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.520
 >> It's so amazing.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.040
 >> They talk to each other.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.040
 >> Yeah.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.000
 Scientists listen to the eggs to see if they made any noise from within the shells.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 And they do.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.720
 And they actually found more than 300 different noises coming from them.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.880
 And I don't know if all of those mean anything or have particular meanings.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.680
 But there was one sound which came only from nests which had only eggs in.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.520
 So there was some which had only eggs and there was some which had a mixture of eggs

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.760
 and already hatched babies.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.040
 And they believe that the babies were communicating so that they could coordinate when they all

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:09.600
 hatch together because when they hatch there's a great advantage to having strength in numbers

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.520
 because the journey from the point where they hatched to the sea is so dangerous and there

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.280
 are so many predators who just hang around waiting as the article I read put it.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.280
 While some babies will be picked off by predators, a bird can only eat so many sea turtles at

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.280
 a time.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.400
 How do they coordinate the hatching?

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400
 Is there a leader?

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400
 Is there one leading turtle?

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400
 Just a leader.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400
 All right guys, come on.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400
 We can do this.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400
 Leonardo.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400
 Leonardo.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:41.320
 I saw a really good, I'd come up with where this was but four really good pie charts which

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:47.680
 was the teenage mutant ninja turtles proportion that they're famous for being artists compared

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.480
 to proportion that they're famous for being turtles.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.480
 It's quite cool.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:56.600
 We're done a tell-o, obviously a tiny sliver of famous artists.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:02.200
 So on communicating with things before they hatch, this is so called birds do the same thing.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:09.280
 And some birds called superb fairy wrens, which we must have mentioned before, the mothers

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.740
 sing to the eggs to teach them a password which they have to use when they hatch if they want

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.740
 food.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.740
 Wow.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:22.280
 And it's because loads of cuckoos lay their eggs in superb fairy wrennests and it's-

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.280
 What's the password?

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280
 Cucko.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:31.340
 And it's normally a single unique note that the cheques know.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.500
 And what it means is that cuckoos are laid later on and they hatch earlier as well.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.620
 So they only get about two days to learn the password which is normally not enough for

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.060
 them to actually process it and learn it.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.100
 And Ren embryos have about five days.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.180
 So if the cucko hatches and pushes out the other eggs, the parents can test it with the

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.180
 password.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.580
 Cuckoos doesn't know the password and the parents can just abandon it and fly off and make

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.040
 a new nest and a new life.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.300
 Just one more quite cool thing about eggs that I like.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.300
 So sand gobyfish, which you'd recognise that you see them in Europe.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.180
 It's the responsibility of the male gobyfish to guard the eggs when they've been laid by

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.180
 the female.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.420
 But he gets really impatient because he wants to have sex with as many females as he can

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.220
 and spread his seed as often as he can so the female gobyfish is like, "I've laid the

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.220
 eggs now.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.940
 Can you guard these until they hatch?"

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.340
 And he knows that the bigger the egg is, the longer it takes to hatch, so he just eats all

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.340
 the bigger ones.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.340
 Oh.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.660
 Because he probably will have to wait for them.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.060
 It's bad, isn't it?

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.980
 And usually the bigger ones are going to be the stronger healthier offspring.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.380
 But he mongers them right up.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.380
 There's an octopus who's recently been discovered just stating its egg or protecting its

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.380
 egg for four and a half years.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.380
 Yeah.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.060
 And supposedly they get so hungry that they nearly starve and they have to eat their

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.260
 own arms to survive while they're protecting their offspring from predators.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.260
 Wow.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.260
 Yeah.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.540
 And for often they're so knackered at the end of this that when their offspring have

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.220
 eventually gone swam away independently, they're just pretty easy prey.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.260
 Yeah, I think they waste away, so they didn't they and die.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.260
 Isn't that amazing?

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.260
 Yeah.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.260
 This is really off topic.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:08.060
 But I read the other day that there is some jellyfish and if they lose an arm, then it's

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.100
 like some animals can grow arms back.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.100
 But they can't do that.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.060
 But what they can do is shuffle around all the other arms so that they're now symmetrical

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.420
 again so they can go up like swim properly.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.780
 What, it not looks stupid?

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.780
 That is amazing.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.780
 I know.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:27.620
 Can I just say quickly my favorite discovery about turtles this week?

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:33.420
 Scientists haven't yet properly decided on whether or not turtles have a penis or a

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.420
 fallace.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.420
 What?

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.420
 It's the same thing.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:42.340
 Apparently it's not because penis should be restricted to mammals yet.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.420
 They want to call it a penis.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:50.380
 I read this in an article called terrifying sex organs of male turtles and I think I've

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:55.220
 seen the film of that.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.700
 I do it to be honest.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.540
 I asked Anna to read this article because I couldn't understand all the big words and

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.820
 so I don't know the answer to that.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.780
 No one could, it's not a, it's a, it's a very, it's full of like really zoological words.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.780
 Yeah.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.700
 That's a trick though because the title sounds really kind of accessible.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.020
 It's an incredibly deceptive title.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.180
 Yeah, it's in scientific American.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.540
 This is an article from, so if anyone wants to read it and explain it to me.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.540
 No.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.540
 It's fine.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.060
 It's just very dense about how like their organs work.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.580
 There were a couple of good things in that article though.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.660
 So I like the fact that they referred to as the intramidant organ.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.700
 When they're having this debate as to whether it's the fallace or the penis, it's

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:37.180
 called the intramidant organ, as in the organ that sends something in, in Latin, which is

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.180
 quite cool.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.220
 The other thing that I think there was a spin-off article from this that it uncovered is

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.860
 if you google a cross section of a turtle penis, it looks exactly like a teenage mutant

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.860
 in the turtle head.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.860
 You're doing it now.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.860
 Doing it now.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.860
 Doing it now.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.860
 With the bandana and everything.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.860
 It's got the bandana.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.860
 Oh my god.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.860
 Donatello.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.860
 Oh, it's Thomas.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.860
 Oh my god.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.860
 With the bandana.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.940
 We'll have to put this up on the Twitter page.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.940
 Definitely.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.940
 I'll put it up on mine.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.940
 Yeah.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.940
 It'll be on QI podcast.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.940
 Yes.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.940
 QI podcast.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.300
 So we were saying before about how turtles kind of hatch and all go down to the sea at the

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.300
 same time.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.900
 Well, one problem that they have in Florida is people are accidentally drowning baby

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:27.340
 tortoises because go for tortoises nest in sand dunes near to the sea and people keep

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.420
 finding these little totuses and think they're turtles and so put them back in the sea.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.420
 Oh my god.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.420
 And they just drown because they can't swim.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.420
 Oh my god.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.420
 Oh my god.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420
 That's so frustrating.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.420
 That's horrible.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.420
 In the town of Hilton Head Island, I'm not quite sure where this is, I think it's

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.260
 in America somewhere.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:48.580
 There was a man who was proposing to his future wife and little load of candles on the

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:55.180
 edge of the beach and she said yes and they retired to the room and they killed 60 baby

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.180
 sea turtles.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.180
 Oh my god.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.180
 Oh.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.180
 Why?

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.180
 Because they were attracted to the light.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:06.300
 They were disorientated by the light and some tracks repeatedly encircled the lanterns where

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.180
 the hatchlings eventually succumbed to ghost craps.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.180
 Oh my god.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.180
 What are they?

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.180
 Moths.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.180
 What's this light thing?

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.180
 I've never heard this before.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.180
 Yeah.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.180
 Any other animal getting attracted to light.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.220
 Well, the thing is, there was one species of sea turtle who hatched during the day and that's

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.220
 really problematic, obviously, because you know, they just just straight out.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.220
 Yeah.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.420
 Is that a bad omen?

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:35.020
 Do you think you cancel the wedding the next day when you emerge from your tent and see just

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.620
 dozens of tortoise carcasses?

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:42.260
 I don't normally believe in omen, but that is a bad sign.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:47.260
 Sorry darling, I know we have been dating for 10 years and finally you've said yes, but

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.220
 there's a couple of dead animals.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:58.220
 So I wouldn't be willing to take the risk of saying another quite funny turtle story is...

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.540
 Got how many died in this one?

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:05.220
 They're already really endangered, all seven species of sea turtle.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.260
 And here we are, casually making light of the death of more.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.260
 Well, include me out.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.260
 Go on.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.700
 Okay, we've included Andy out, but for everyone else.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:20.340
 So in somewhere in China, I remember where there was a drunk guy known only as Wang, the

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.340
 article says.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.300
 So I don't think he wanted to identify himself in full.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.380
 He got really drunk, ran into the seafood section of a restaurant, dunked his head in the

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:36.100
 fish tank and tried to kiss a turtle, at which point the turtle clamped onto his mouth.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.900
 Would you like to go?

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.300
 He had to go to hospital, I think, I know he had to be freed by having the turtle decapitated.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.300
 What?

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.300
 What the fuck?

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:53.860
 Say, that was going so well.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.020
 Okay, time to move on to our final fact of the show and that's my fact.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.260
 My fact this week is that the playwright Henrik Ibsen's last words were to his nurse.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.980
 She said to him that she thought he seemed to be looking better and he replied on the contrary

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.220
 and died.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.220
 It turns out that that's not as exciting as I want it to be and that he actually died

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.220
 the next day.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.220
 But those were the last words he said.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.220
 So I think he must have lapsed into a coma or a-

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.180
 Oh, he thought they were pretty good words.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.860
 Just going to sit on those.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:30.100
 I think I should collect a series of last words just so that I've got 20 or 30 things to

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.900
 say on my deathbed and if I say one, I can just cross it off the list and then I'll go

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.900
 on with the next one.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.900
 Oh yeah, yes.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.820
 If everything you ever say is extremely piffy and witty, then it doesn't matter when

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.820
 you die.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.340
 Okay, but we're dealing with the real world here and I have to make allowances.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.420
 His last words were a terrible story about dead turtles.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.600
 His last words were a long pause where he was trying to come up with a pun relating the

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.700
 Pope to death in some way.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.660
 I think if you constantly peve your conversations with desperate attempts at last words, your

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.820
 death might come sooner than you expect.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.380
 So the thing about last words, when you suddenly put a sort of researcher's eye onto it,

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:14.020
 you realize that no one ever said any of the things that everyone thinks they said on their

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.020
 deathbed.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.020
 Oscar Wilde.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.300
 Either this wallpaper goes or I do.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.420
 And the actual thing he said was this wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death, either

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.820
 it goes or I do.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.420
 Not the last thing he said.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.420
 Not even close.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.700
 I mean, that was I think in the days preceding his death.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.620
 Dylan Thomas was said to have said, I've had 18 straight whiskeys, I believe that's the

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.620
 record.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.300
 And that's where those were his last words.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.300
 It's such a good last line.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.500
 It's an amazing last line.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.540
 I think there's some controversy now because Dylan Thomas was often assumed to have died

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:48.260
 of alcohol poisoning and his family and other people say quite strongly that he didn't.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:54.060
 He just died of pneumonia and his agent spread about this kind of falsehood because his agent

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:58.260
 was actually a bit lax in looking after Dylan Thomas in the days preceding his death.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.660
 So wanted to make it seem like he was a hope to have drunk it.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.660
 His agent should have made it.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.260
 What a magnificent agent I've got.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.060
 I've always thought that.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:13.060
 And now that he's freed up to work with other people, you should all apply.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.500
 I think probably by favorite last words.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:21.660
 And again, who knows if these were genuinely said, but it was by French poet slash diplomat

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.020
 died in 1955 called Paul Claudel.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:31.780
 And his last words were, doctor, do you think it was the sausage?

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.820
 I looked up Paul Claudel just to see who he was.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.700
 He's the opening line from his obituary.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.900
 Paul Claudel was a misogynist at anti-Soviet and it is lather foam.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.740
 That's the opening sentence.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.740
 Opening sentence of what?

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.740
 His obituary.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.740
 It wasn't written by his agent.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.740
 Was it?

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.740
 No, exactly.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:55.700
 This is a saying that's going, could he put and a poet in there?

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.220
 One time when we do know people's last words and when it's going to be something quite

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.740
 pithy is when people know they're going to die.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.740
 So people on death row.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.740
 Yes.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.700
 And so there's a few famous ones of that.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.780
 There was a murderer called James French when he was on the electric chair.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.940
 He shouted, hey, fellas, how about this for a headline for tomorrow's paper French fries?

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.660
 It's a cracking one.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.020
 And another one who did pretty much the same joke was called George Apple.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.340
 And when he was being executed, he said, well, gentlemen, you are about to see a baked apple.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.340
 That is sort of copying things.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.300
 Well, I don't know who came first, actually.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.300
 Yeah.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.300
 He was in the line behind them.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.300
 Oh, that's pretty good.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:38.020
 That's what happened if Andy heard some last lines that he was up next.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.620
 Well, the name isn't at all food related.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.660
 So I'd be third in line going, oh, my God, what am I going to do?

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:45.660
 Murray Mints.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.660
 Murray Mints.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.660
 What?

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.660
 What?

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.140
 Have you been sliced to pieces?

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.020
 I just sound odd, but can I request the guilty?

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.220
 It's just very pun thing.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:02.380
 I just have one more last words thing, which actually is just, I just wanted to mention

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.220
 Nero's last words only because I read something else about Nero this week, which I loved and

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.220
 didn't know.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:12.100
 So Nero, quite famously, was supposed to have said, I can't remember who claimed it, someone

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.820
 who was with him when he died said that Nero's last words were, what an artist the world

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.980
 is losing in me.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.700
 But something else, oh, it's Cassius Dio, who was with him when he died.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.700
 But another thing I learned about Nero this week was he was kind of a, like, some people

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.220
 say he was the words for the world's first known SNM propagator.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.780
 And he liked to have himself dressed up in animal skins, like exotic animal furs.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.420
 And he'd have people lock him in an enclosure in a cage.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.020
 And then he'd, like, get himself all worked up, and then he'd like to be released from this

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.020
 enclosure.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.300
 And he'd gallop around like a wild beast.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.620
 And there'd be a bunch of men hung up in stocks around him, and he'd attack their genitals

00:28:50.620 --> 00:29:01.900
 and bite them off for fun, yeah, still not as weird as someone touching your face, though.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.900
 Okay, that's it.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.900
 That's all of our facts.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.900
