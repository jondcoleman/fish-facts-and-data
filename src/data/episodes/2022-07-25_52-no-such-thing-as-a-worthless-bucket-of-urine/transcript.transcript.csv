00:00:00,00:00:02,"Hi everyone, James here."
00:00:02,00:00:04,I just wanted to start with an apology.
00:00:04,00:00:07,"Unfortunately, the audio is very bad in this episode."
00:00:07,00:00:09,Some of our microphones failed.
00:00:09,00:00:12,"So we only had one mic, and you'll be hearing it from that."
00:00:12,00:00:15,"So it's going to be a bit tinny, a little bit like we recorded"
00:00:15,00:00:15,in a toilet.
00:00:15,00:00:17,"But that's kind of back to our roots,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,because that's what most of our early ones were like.
00:00:19,00:00:21,But enjoy the show anyway.
00:00:21,00:00:23,We think is a good one.
00:00:23,00:00:24,Get through the audio next week.
00:00:24,00:00:25,We'll be much better.
00:00:25,00:00:36,[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
00:00:36,00:00:45,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:45,00:00:46,"Hi, everyone."
00:00:46,00:00:48,Welcome to another episode.
00:00:48,00:00:51,"And no such thing is a fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:51,00:00:54,We're coming to you from the Soho Theater in Central London.
00:00:54,00:00:56,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:56,00:00:58,"I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin,"
00:00:58,00:00:59,and Andy Murray.
00:00:59,00:01:01,This is our one-year special.
00:01:01,00:01:02,It's our birthday.
00:01:02,00:01:04,We've once again sat around the microphones
00:01:04,00:01:06,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:06,00:01:09,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:09,00:01:11,"Starting with you, Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:01:11,00:01:12,Hello.
00:01:12,00:01:16,My fact is that the root for the home call Ultramarathon
00:01:16,00:01:19,is to run up and down the same stretch of road 25 times.
00:01:19,00:01:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:25,00:01:27,This has been on the news a bit recently.
00:01:27,00:01:29,"Because it's just happened, the first ever Ultramarathon"
00:01:29,00:01:33,they've had on this route for one of the better words.
00:01:33,00:01:34,And it's 31 miles long.
00:01:34,00:01:37,Because apparently anything longer than the standard 26.2
00:01:37,00:01:40,"is an Ultramarathon, which I think is cheating,"
00:01:40,00:01:43,because I think it should be at least double.
00:01:43,00:01:44,And I'd say that as someone who's never
00:01:44,00:01:49,"run more than 200 meters, and that was this fourth day."
00:01:49,00:01:51,And fourth.
00:01:51,00:01:52,Out of fourth.
00:01:52,00:01:54,Out of fourth.
00:01:54,00:01:55,"So yeah, that's it."
00:01:55,00:01:57,"Well, my father used to say it was."
00:01:57,00:01:58,31 miles.
00:01:58,00:01:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:01:59,00:02:02,"Because normally Ultramarathon is more like 100 miles,"
00:02:02,00:02:03,"200 miles, 200 miles, whatever."
00:02:03,00:02:04,"But if they had done that here,"
00:02:04,00:02:07,they probably would have been suicides and pulled them out.
00:02:07,00:02:10,"I would have actually-- so I read that if you run 200 miles,"
00:02:10,00:02:13,it's less tiring than if you run 100 miles.
00:02:13,00:02:14,Right.
00:02:14,00:02:17,That can't be true.
00:02:17,00:02:17,That can't be true.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"Yeah, apparently what happens is when you know it's going"
00:02:21,00:02:23,"to be much longer, your intensity is much lower."
00:02:23,00:02:25,So you take your time a lot more.
00:02:25,00:02:26,And they've felt that people who do the longer ones
00:02:26,00:02:27,feel better at the end.
00:02:27,00:02:30,So you'll just say you do it much more so.
00:02:30,00:02:30,You're saying it takes--
00:02:30,00:02:33,You can serve your energy better.
00:02:33,00:02:34,You walk it.
00:02:34,00:02:36,You walk it.
00:02:36,00:02:40,You take the job when you get your two.
00:02:40,00:02:41,So the thing about this marathon
00:02:41,00:02:42,"is that everyone's been describing it,"
00:02:42,00:02:46,particularly people doing it as the most boring marathon
00:02:46,00:02:48,possible because of the repetitions.
00:02:48,00:02:50,And I was looking into boring marathons.
00:02:50,00:02:52,And there is an annual boring marathon.
00:02:52,00:02:53,What?
00:02:53,00:02:54,"Yeah, there's an annual boring marathon."
00:02:54,00:02:57,There's an ultra boring marathon.
00:02:57,00:02:59,And it's actually apparently quite exciting.
00:02:59,00:03:02,It's just it happens to take place in a town
00:03:02,00:03:05,and we're seeing people boring Oregon City.
00:03:05,00:03:07,"Yeah, which is an actual place."
00:03:07,00:03:10,"And their motto is, ""The most exciting place to live."""
00:03:10,00:03:13,They're twins with a town called Dole in Scotland.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"Yeah, yeah, they have an annual Dole and boring day,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,which you both think it was August 9th.
00:03:19,00:03:21,"So a lot more than recently, the most boring day"
00:03:21,00:03:23,in modern history.
00:03:23,00:03:28,"And it was equal to the 11th, 1954, so a bad time."
00:03:28,00:03:30,It was a scientist of a huge program
00:03:30,00:03:32,to work out the day where the least interesting stuff
00:03:32,00:03:35,"happened, because there's a general election in Belgium."
00:03:35,00:03:38,"So sorry, sorry, Belgium."
00:03:38,00:03:40,The confront page of the New York Post
00:03:40,00:03:42,was two cops attending a conference
00:03:42,00:03:46,on juvenile delinquency from their views.
00:03:46,00:03:48,"So they put that into a machine, right?"
00:03:48,00:03:49,And it's generous.
00:03:49,00:03:51,So it was like three million bits of information.
00:03:51,00:03:52,300 million?
00:03:52,00:03:53,Was it 300 million?
00:03:53,00:03:54,It was.
00:03:54,00:03:55,Wow.
00:03:55,00:03:56,"So they said, ""Find us the most boring day."""
00:03:56,00:04:00,"They came up with this date, April 11th, 1954."
00:04:00,00:04:01,I read this as well.
00:04:01,00:04:04,"Sight note to it, which actually caught my eye"
00:04:04,00:04:07,"more than the fact itself, is that the guy who was a Cambridge"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"scientist, he was a computer programmer,"
00:04:09,00:04:14,"his name, his name is William Tundstel-Pedo."
00:04:14,00:04:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:16,00:04:19,"He changed his surname, wouldn't he?"
00:04:19,00:04:20,I was trying to research the facts.
00:04:20,00:04:21,I got so sidelined.
00:04:21,00:04:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:22,00:04:25,Take your key point out.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"You got plasticins came up with boredom,"
00:04:27,00:04:28,as in he invented the word.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"Yeah, I read his books, yeah."
00:04:30,00:04:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:31,00:04:32,Oh!
00:04:32,00:04:35,[INAUDIBLE]
00:04:35,00:04:36,"Yeah, it's in the Bleak House."
00:04:36,00:04:39,"He says, ""Someone is bought to death by marriage."""
00:04:39,00:04:40,"Oh, sorry."
00:04:40,00:04:42,So maybe people just deceived that sort of man.
00:04:42,00:04:44,Maybe it meant thrills.
00:04:44,00:04:45,"What do you mean, thrills?"
00:04:45,00:04:47,There's a lot of people say to me when I'm talking to them
00:04:47,00:04:49,"in the pub and they say, ""I'm so bad."""
00:04:49,00:04:50,Yeah.
00:04:50,00:04:51,They're actually saying they're thrills.
00:04:51,00:04:52,Is that why you keep going on and on?
00:04:52,00:04:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:54,00:04:58,"There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea called the Baining,"
00:04:58,00:05:01,"and they value work as the highest ideal, the best"
00:05:01,00:05:02,thing you do is work.
00:05:02,00:05:06,And they have been called unstudiable because of their failure
00:05:06,00:05:07,to do anything interesting.
00:05:07,00:05:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:11,00:05:13,"So much, isn't it?"
00:05:13,00:05:16,"And there was an anthropologist called Gregory Bateson,"
00:05:16,00:05:20,who spent 14 months attempting to study them
00:05:20,00:05:22,in the 1920s before giving up.
00:05:22,00:05:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:25,00:05:26,They don't even like sex.
00:05:26,00:05:27,Is that right?
00:05:27,00:05:28,Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:29,They don't like it very much.
00:05:29,00:05:30,"No, they don't like it."
00:05:30,00:05:32,"But they do have kids, but often a lot of adoption,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,because they don't really want to have kids.
00:05:34,00:05:37,"Wait, when have they got moved forward?"
00:05:37,00:05:38,There's been maybe tribes or something.
00:05:38,00:05:39,I don't know.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"But they also got like play, because it's"
00:05:41,00:05:44,"a natural state of children, and they got like children."
00:05:44,00:05:47,At least sometimes they will punish the children who
00:05:47,00:05:50,are playing by putting their hands in the fire.
00:05:50,00:05:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:51,00:05:53,That's not boring.
00:05:53,00:05:57,That's an exciting thing to do.
00:05:57,00:05:59,"I think the most boring sport ever,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,"the most boring sporting event ever,"
00:06:01,00:06:06,"was the cycling event of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic, where"
00:06:06,00:06:10,"it involved people watching two people who are cycling head-to-head,"
00:06:10,00:06:13,sitting still on bicycles for more than an hour.
00:06:13,00:06:14,What were they exercise bikes?
00:06:14,00:06:17,"No, it was that-- you notice that it's the sprint cycle"
00:06:17,00:06:18,"when it goes head-to-head, and they often"
00:06:18,00:06:20,"like hover at the start of it, so you don't know."
00:06:20,00:06:22,"Because I think it's a slipstream thing,"
00:06:22,00:06:25,"so because they want the other person to start cycling first,"
00:06:25,00:06:27,and they can get in their slipstream.
00:06:27,00:06:28,And these two guys just have this stand-up.
00:06:28,00:06:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:30,00:06:33,"They're still on the bike, standing on the bikes,"
00:06:33,00:06:35,but over an hour an hour and three on the bike.
00:06:35,00:06:37,So that's pretty hard.
00:06:37,00:06:38,"Yeah, I know impressive."
00:06:38,00:06:40,"Oh, it sounds exciting to me."
00:06:40,00:06:41,"As you constantly get wet, you always go out, no."
00:06:41,00:06:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:44,00:06:46,The commentator had to leave.
00:06:46,00:06:47,I think I was so bad.
00:06:47,00:06:51,It's something else to get on with.
00:06:51,00:06:53,Exciting with too much.
00:06:53,00:06:53,Hand of this.
00:06:53,00:06:57,Do you know the way they induce boredom scientists want
00:06:57,00:06:58,to test boredom?
00:06:58,00:06:59,"Obviously, there are a lot of ways of doing it."
00:06:59,00:07:02,"So to do pain, they put your hand in the bucket of icy water."
00:07:02,00:07:05,"And to do boredom, they make you copy out the phone book."
00:07:05,00:07:09,That's the official way of doing it.
00:07:09,00:07:11,"But if they want to really test you,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,they just make you read the phone book.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"Let me see, I have to focus on it and really concentrate."
00:07:16,00:07:20,But it proves your creativity.
00:07:20,00:07:21,What are you in the phone doctors?
00:07:21,00:07:25,"What being bored, as induced by this and the experiment they did."
00:07:25,00:07:29,"So they tested, they had people who could just copy"
00:07:29,00:07:32,numbers out of the phone book or not do that.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"And at the end of that, everyone who'd been in it"
00:07:35,00:07:37,was asked to-- this is the test.
00:07:37,00:07:43,"Think of it as many uses as they could for a pair of plastic cups,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,which is apparently a test of divergent thinking
00:07:45,00:07:48,and how crazy and creative you are.
00:07:48,00:07:50,And people who've been reading the phone book
00:07:50,00:07:53,or copying it out were much more creative.
00:07:53,00:07:58,"They're like, throw them at the person who told me to read the phone book."
00:07:58,00:08:00,And there's a scientific test at the boredom program
00:08:00,00:08:03,this scale that's come up with by two psychologists.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"And it's 28 statements, which you have to agree on this agree with."
00:08:07,00:08:09,"And it consists of statements, including,"
00:08:09,00:08:11,"I have projects in mind all the time, things to do."
00:08:11,00:08:14,"Or much of the time, I just sit around doing nothing."
00:08:14,00:08:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:17,00:08:19,"If you could do that successfully, I don't think you're easily bored."
00:08:19,00:08:22,I sometimes read my own phone book and test myself
00:08:22,00:08:25,on people I have to not know who they are.
00:08:25,00:08:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:27,00:08:28,Here's Rose.
00:08:28,00:08:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:30,00:08:32,Does anyone else do that?
00:08:32,00:08:35,"One yes, one yes, one yes, one yes."
00:08:35,00:08:37,I did a terrible thing the other day.
00:08:37,00:08:40,"I got a message on my phone from someone saying,"
00:08:40,00:08:41,"hey, how's it going?"
00:08:41,00:08:44,And you know that terrible moment when you haven't got their number.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"And you're like, oh my god, the message is so familiar."
00:08:47,00:08:48,I definitely know who this is.
00:08:48,00:08:49,They're going to hate.
00:08:49,00:08:51,So I have to do the old classic.
00:08:51,00:08:53,"Sorry, it's a new phone."
00:08:53,00:08:54,I haven't got your number.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Who is it?
00:08:55,00:08:59,"And the person wrote back going, it's Sheila."
00:08:59,00:09:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:00,00:09:04,So I did the lamest thing that I've done it used.
00:09:04,00:09:08,"I wrote back, hey, sorry, I'm Australian."
00:09:08,00:09:09,There's a lot of Sheila.
00:09:09,00:09:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:11,00:09:12,Which one do?
00:09:12,00:09:14,[APPLAUSE]
00:09:14,00:09:16,She didn't write back.
00:09:16,00:09:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:19,00:09:23,I found the most boring-- it's very unfortunate.
00:09:23,00:09:26,"There's a resort in Switzerland, and I was a bit confused"
00:09:26,00:09:28,because it's described as a village and resort.
00:09:28,00:09:30,So I can't feel how the village is going to scale itself.
00:09:30,00:09:31,Yeah.
00:09:31,00:09:34,And it's been described as the most boring resort in Switzerland.
00:09:34,00:09:36,"And you know when it's like, oh, how the nice time."
00:09:36,00:09:37,They're all of their things.
00:09:37,00:09:39,It's just this is so dull.
00:09:39,00:09:40,This is my dull place.
00:09:40,00:09:42,And the tourist board there released the statements.
00:09:42,00:09:44,They said that they think they've got this kind to look
00:09:44,00:09:50,"because their point village has nothing, does nothing,"
00:09:50,00:09:53,and offers nothing.
00:09:53,00:09:57,"And then they added, we think that's a positive."
00:09:57,00:09:59,"But so they've combatted it now by going,"
00:09:59,00:10:00,"they had a meeting, and they're like, how do we"
00:10:00,00:10:02,sort out the boredom levels of our town?
00:10:02,00:10:04,How do we make it exciting and vibrant?
00:10:04,00:10:09,"And they started a stone skipping competition,"
00:10:09,00:10:12,which they're now trying to make a worldwide thing.
00:10:12,00:10:14,But then they found out that another similarly dull town
00:10:14,00:10:16,also decided the way to combat boredom
00:10:16,00:10:19,was to set up a skimming stones competition.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"So they have to call them and say, could we do the qualifying"
00:10:21,00:10:24,round before they get to it?
00:10:24,00:10:25,You can't even go and see the finals.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"Yeah, I can see."
00:10:26,00:10:28,Yeah.
00:10:28,00:10:29,"OK, some stuff on Ultramarathens."
00:10:29,00:10:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:10:30,00:10:33,"OK, so Ultramarathen athletes sometimes"
00:10:33,00:10:35,have all their toenails removed.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Before or after?
00:10:36,00:10:37,Before.
00:10:37,00:10:40,"I'm not sure, but like, you know what I'm saying."
00:10:40,00:10:42,So put that off in there.
00:10:42,00:10:45,"So you'll end up, you'll run, and you'll have real problems"
00:10:45,00:10:46,"with your toenails, and they'll get worse and worse."
00:10:46,00:10:48,And then they get better.
00:10:48,00:10:50,"And then once they've been a problem once,"
00:10:50,00:10:52,they get worse and worse all the time.
00:10:52,00:10:54,"And so quite often they'll have them taken off,"
00:10:54,00:10:55,just lately.
00:10:55,00:10:57,What?
00:10:57,00:10:59,It reminds me of how?
00:10:59,00:11:00,"Yeah, how?"
00:11:00,00:11:01,How do they take them off?
00:11:01,00:11:04,Do you want me to show you?
00:11:04,00:11:06,"They would search, if they have searching, we'd do it."
00:11:06,00:11:07,Yeah.
00:11:07,00:11:08,That's not what I mean.
00:11:08,00:11:10,I wanted a method.
00:11:10,00:11:13,I think it's a yank.
00:11:13,00:11:16,And the other thing that happens in Ultramarathen
00:11:16,00:11:19,people is their body gets in such trouble
00:11:19,00:11:20,"because they're really, really pushing it"
00:11:20,00:11:22,that they are insatiable and want
00:11:22,00:11:25,"to have lots and lots of sex, apparently."
00:11:25,00:11:28,It's the comments of one of the athletes.
00:11:28,00:11:31,Who I back to the pub?
00:11:31,00:11:35,"Yes, he was boring, but I couldn't have myself."
00:11:35,00:11:36,"No, he said--"
00:11:36,00:11:44,"He says, ""When a person is in various strengths like that,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"sex becomes a priority because naturally,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"we want to perpetuate the species we want to procreate."""
00:11:50,00:11:52,"So it's like, we're in such trouble we're about to buy."
00:11:52,00:11:55,We need to have kids quickly.
00:11:55,00:11:58,That's what he said.
00:11:58,00:11:59,Wow.
00:11:59,00:12:01,OK.
00:12:01,00:12:03,Madison's work considered so dangerous
00:12:03,00:12:05,"that they weren't supposed to happen again, weren't they?"
00:12:05,00:12:07,"In 1902, the 1902 Olympics--"
00:12:07,00:12:08,I was in 1902.
00:12:08,00:12:11,--in 1902 or Olympics.
00:12:11,00:12:15,It was decided because it was so badly done that one guy--
00:12:15,00:12:18,so the doctor's drove in front of them along this dust track.
00:12:18,00:12:19,"And like, you know what I mean?"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"Oh, that's aphyxia space."
00:12:21,00:12:23,"One of them did run along collapse, had like a pulmonary failure"
00:12:23,00:12:24,or something.
00:12:24,00:12:27,Collapse very nearly died because he'd inhaled so much dust.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"Another one, the guy who won in the end collapse"
00:12:29,00:12:31,"and had to be picked up and was given a strictly, which"
00:12:31,00:12:34,is that pesticide that we now use on crops
00:12:34,00:12:37,to try and simulate him and then some brown needs.
00:12:37,00:12:39,"Well, at that time, it was a useful stimulant"
00:12:39,00:12:42,"that didn't do any of that, so he can--"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"And then there was a guy who won initially, who"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"was called someone's laws, who decided"
00:12:47,00:12:49,he couldn't hack it after about nine kilometers.
00:12:49,00:12:52,"And Jonathan a car passed by, waved all the other athletes,"
00:12:52,00:12:54,"jumped out of the other end, sprinted to the finish line,"
00:12:54,00:12:56,the 50 hours.
00:12:56,00:12:57,And one--
00:12:57,00:12:57,--50 yards.
00:12:57,00:12:58,And then--
00:12:58,00:13:00,"There was no one nearby, presumably,"
00:13:00,00:13:03,"because I would stop a mile back, you know."
00:13:03,00:13:04,I would just think--
00:13:04,00:13:06,"Well, when he claimed was, when he was taking his trophy"
00:13:06,00:13:09,"and someone did say, by the way, I did see you"
00:13:09,00:13:13,drive most of the way.
00:13:13,00:13:15,He did say he'd always been meaning to give it back.
00:13:15,00:13:16,It was just a joke.
00:13:16,00:13:17,But that is the kind of thing you'd--
00:13:17,00:13:21,"I'll claim this, and if no one said anything, that's 5'1."""
00:13:21,00:13:24,"And if they do, I'll just say, I was kidding."
00:13:24,00:13:25,"Anyway, it was--"
00:13:25,00:13:28,"Sounds strong, it was going to do that, wasn't it?"
00:13:28,00:13:31,"It was just a joke, I mean."
00:13:31,00:13:33,Have you heard of Rosa Ruiz?
00:13:33,00:13:34,No.
00:13:34,00:13:38,She won the 1980 Boston Marathon.
00:13:38,00:13:42,"She's 23-year-old New Yorker, and she was very, very fast."
00:13:42,00:13:44,She was the third fastest time ever recorded
00:13:44,00:13:46,for a female runner.
00:13:46,00:13:49,And she was completely sweat free and composed
00:13:49,00:13:51,when she crossed the finishing line.
00:13:51,00:13:52,"Car, obviously."
00:13:52,00:13:55,No one saw her during the race.
00:13:55,00:13:56,No other checkpoints.
00:13:56,00:13:58,None of the other runners.
00:13:58,00:14:00,"Photographs of the race, she was nowhere."
00:14:00,00:14:05,"She was so fast, they couldn't get a little photos."
00:14:05,00:14:07,"She-- not Car, Subway."
00:14:07,00:14:11,She just got Subway straight across.
00:14:11,00:14:14,"And doesn't count, though, if you're still running."
00:14:14,00:14:17,"While you take all of your cash, you ran to the Subway."
00:14:17,00:14:18,Just kept it.
00:14:18,00:14:19,That should count.
00:14:19,00:14:20,Just on the spot.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:22,I was running.
00:14:22,00:14:24,I just got corrected with it.
00:14:24,00:14:27,"But again, she just stood back in half a mile before the end,"
00:14:27,00:14:28,which seems very cocky.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Yeah.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Why don't you open in Subway?
00:14:30,00:14:31,You have to run up a lot of stairs.
00:14:31,00:14:33,I reckon that's more tiring.
00:14:33,00:14:35,That would be tough.
00:14:35,00:14:37,We've got to move on very soon to the next bag.
00:14:37,00:14:40,Can I just quickly give a few Hong Kong things?
00:14:40,00:14:40,Yeah.
00:14:40,00:14:42,So because I'm born in race in Hong Kong.
00:14:42,00:14:43,And--
00:14:43,00:14:46,Can I bet money on a Hong Kong fact that you
00:14:46,00:14:48,will say in the next 20 seconds?
00:14:48,00:14:49,"Oh, OK, yeah."
00:14:49,00:14:51,I'm just wondering if there's a Hong Kong fact about Bruce Lee
00:14:51,00:14:52,to follow?
00:14:52,00:14:52,"No, there's not."
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Oh, my God."
00:14:53,00:14:55,"Although there is a good Bruce Lee fact, but I'll tell you"
00:14:55,00:14:58,just to see how you've made it through.
00:14:58,00:14:59,Why did I do it?
00:14:59,00:15:03,He was the 1958 Cha Cha champion in Hong Kong.
00:15:03,00:15:04,There he goes.
00:15:04,00:15:07,How many people have it?
00:15:07,00:15:08,How's he well?
00:15:08,00:15:10,It's the perfect--
00:15:10,00:15:11,"Yeah, so one thing I discovered"
00:15:11,00:15:14,"was that after the handover happened,"
00:15:14,00:15:15,there were a lot of things that the Chinese admitted
00:15:15,00:15:19,to doing that they were sort of tripping the British colonialists
00:15:19,00:15:21,about when they first arrived.
00:15:21,00:15:23,And one thing was the names of places in Hong Kong.
00:15:23,00:15:25,"And I've been to a lot of these places,"
00:15:25,00:15:28,and I had no idea that their translations meant what they are.
00:15:28,00:15:32,"So for example, there's a place called Hisi one."
00:15:32,00:15:33,"So when the British were like, oh, what's this called?"
00:15:33,00:15:35,"They went up, Hisi one."
00:15:35,00:15:38,That translates as vagina discharge day--
00:15:38,00:15:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:40,00:15:43,The vagina discharge day.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"There's Nushi Wu, which is cow shit lake,"
00:15:46,00:15:50,"and Dao Tao, which is penis head rock."
00:15:50,00:15:52,It needs a bin on signs in Hong Kong for ages.
00:15:52,00:15:54,And they started changing some.
00:15:54,00:15:58,So foreign-devil sex organ is now dead.
00:15:58,00:15:59,I've become pyramid rock.
00:15:59,00:16:02,And all sex corner is now swimming dragon cape.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"Oh, that's really cool."
00:16:04,00:16:06,I had no idea when I was there.
00:16:06,00:16:08,Did you guys have any more that we--
00:16:08,00:16:09,"Oh, that's really welcome."
00:16:09,00:16:11,"OK, time for fact number two."
00:16:11,00:16:14,And that is Chun Zinsky.
00:16:14,00:16:16,"Yep, my fact is that the meter is wrong."
00:16:16,00:16:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:19,00:16:20,"Typical, I don't know."
00:16:20,00:16:22,"Every while everything's wrong, we come together."
00:16:22,00:16:23,Yeah.
00:16:23,00:16:24,I hate it.
00:16:24,00:16:25,Why does that mean?
00:16:25,00:16:30,So the meter-- it was determined that the meter--
00:16:30,00:16:33,so in a guy called Pierre Mecha was a French astronomer.
00:16:33,00:16:37,"In the 1790s, he determined that they decided"
00:16:37,00:16:38,to go to a decimal system.
00:16:38,00:16:40,And the meter would be the unit of the system.
00:16:40,00:16:43,And it would be exactly 1/10 million of the distance
00:16:43,00:16:45,between the equator and the North Pole.
00:16:45,00:16:48,So he went on this big tour to measure
00:16:48,00:16:50,our arcs of the Earth and stuff.
00:16:50,00:16:52,And do calculations to what every meter was.
00:16:52,00:16:54,And there was a slight error in his calculations.
00:16:54,00:16:55,A slight problem was one of his bits of equipment.
00:16:55,00:17:00,And he was 0.16 of a millimeter out for every meter.
00:17:00,00:17:03,"The meter we use now, he realized that he'd gone wrong."
00:17:03,00:17:05,And so we tried to draw people's attention to it.
00:17:05,00:17:07,"But at that point, they were like, we've made all these"
00:17:07,00:17:10,like meter long sticks.
00:17:10,00:17:12,We can't just go and make them.
00:17:12,00:17:16,And so we just stayed that way.
00:17:16,00:17:19,"I mean, but that's so unscientific for how science usually works."
00:17:19,00:17:22,"Well, we've made them do that."
00:17:22,00:17:23,It's just going to have to be it.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"Sorry, I have-- he went back to where he had made"
00:17:26,00:17:28,the original mistake later in his life.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"And he wanted to correct it, because on this campaign"
00:17:30,00:17:31,to get it corrected.
00:17:31,00:17:34,"And he got to where he made the mistake, where he caught"
00:17:34,00:17:37,malaria and died.
00:17:37,00:17:40,So never check.
00:17:40,00:17:41,You're working.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"He kept getting arrested, isn't he, when"
00:17:43,00:17:47,"he was doing all this stuff, because it was during the revolution."
00:17:47,00:17:49,People thought that his--
00:17:49,00:17:50,what do you call these things?
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Instruments for weapons, don't they?"
00:17:52,00:17:53,Yeah.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"So it just kept them at prison, all of a sudden."
00:17:55,00:17:56,Yeah.
00:17:56,00:17:57,And it was-- but that was actually a good thing.
00:17:57,00:17:58,"Well, was it good or was it bad?"
00:17:58,00:18:00,"It was when he was in prison, then he realized he'd got it wrong."
00:18:00,00:18:01,He thought I've got nothing else.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"He just said, recheck my calculations."
00:18:03,00:18:06,"And when he did that, he realized it was wrong."
00:18:06,00:18:08,But then it didn't do much good.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"So in fact, there was-- in 1875, there"
00:18:10,00:18:14,"was the Treaty de la Metro, or the Treaty of the Metre,"
00:18:14,00:18:14,in France.
00:18:14,00:18:15,Thank you.
00:18:15,00:18:16,Thank you.
00:18:16,00:18:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:20,00:18:23,"So he'd meet 10 valuable minutes, though."
00:18:23,00:18:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:26,00:18:31,"I was going to leave it, and I remember you were here."
00:18:31,00:18:34,And that decided to consecrate his wrong meter
00:18:34,00:18:36,into being the actual meter.
00:18:36,00:18:39,"So to say, actually, my chance meter is the proper meter."
00:18:39,00:18:41,The meter is now going to be 1 meter and 0.6--
00:18:41,00:18:42,1.6 millimeter long.
00:18:42,00:18:46,And so they created a standard meter at this conference.
00:18:46,00:18:49,So they had to create an exact replica of the wrong meter.
00:18:49,00:18:53,"But this time, say, this is now the right meter."
00:18:53,00:18:55,But they can just take his wrong one
00:18:55,00:18:56,"and say, this is the standard meter,"
00:18:56,00:19:00,"because that had been wrong, does that make sense?"
00:19:00,00:19:02,"It didn't, but yeah."
00:19:02,00:19:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:06,00:19:10,I'm still on Treaty de la Metro.
00:19:10,00:19:12,"And so before this happened, in 18th century France,"
00:19:12,00:19:15,"there were more than 250,000 different types"
00:19:15,00:19:17,of measurement in France.
00:19:17,00:19:17,What?
00:19:17,00:19:18,I know.
00:19:18,00:19:20,How many people were there?
00:19:20,00:19:23,Was it just different weights and measurements and--
00:19:23,00:19:24,"250,000."
00:19:24,00:19:25,Yeah.
00:19:25,00:19:26,It's a lot better than it.
00:19:26,00:19:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:29,00:19:31,"They were totally, really arrogant when they wanted"
00:19:31,00:19:32,to go to the decimal system.
00:19:32,00:19:33,"And there were a lot of people saying,"
00:19:33,00:19:35,I can't believe you think you can just
00:19:35,00:19:37,make the whole world abide by your ridiculous system.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"But obviously, they did."
00:19:39,00:19:41,Japan went metric in 1924.
00:19:41,00:19:44,And no one noticed or did anything about it.
00:19:44,00:19:46,And they had to do it again.
00:19:46,00:19:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:50,00:19:52,"Oh, my god."
00:19:52,00:19:55,I think you have to strive to a few times.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"In 1960s, they were saying, let's do it."
00:19:57,00:19:58,And they've just never got around to it.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"And now, because there are three countries"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"that are metric, aren't there?"
00:20:02,00:20:03,"So Burma, Liberia, and the US."
00:20:03,00:20:05,But Burma is about to go imperial now.
00:20:05,00:20:07,So it's about to just be US and Liberia.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"That's going to be metric, yeah."
00:20:09,00:20:11,"That's going to metric, sorry."
00:20:11,00:20:12,Wasn't it just the Liberia?
00:20:12,00:20:13,"It had a very good luck, yeah."
00:20:13,00:20:14,Wasn't there that great--
00:20:14,00:20:15,I don't have a full fact.
00:20:15,00:20:18,"I hope you guys do, which is that."
00:20:18,00:20:20,I'm not sure if that was complete the fact.
00:20:20,00:20:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:21,00:20:25,"Mount Everest, when that was originally measured,"
00:20:25,00:20:28,"what was it, 29,000 feet?"
00:20:28,00:20:29,Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:31,So it was the first to say it?
00:20:31,00:20:32,"Yeah, yeah, definitely."
00:20:32,00:20:34,So they worked out exactly how tall it was.
00:20:34,00:20:36,"It was 29,000 feet."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"But they thought that if they put that as the actual number,"
00:20:38,00:20:39,people won't believe them.
00:20:39,00:20:42,They think they would think they just rounded them up.
00:20:42,00:20:44,And so they put an extra two feet on top.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"So they called it 29,000 and two feet."
00:20:46,00:20:47,Yeah.
00:20:47,00:20:48,Can you imagine?
00:20:48,00:20:49,You've just done this incredible thing.
00:20:49,00:20:52,You've measured the greatest mountain in the highest
00:20:52,00:20:54,tallest mountain in the world.
00:20:54,00:20:56,And it's a perfect number.
00:20:56,00:20:59,And you can't tell them that it's high.
00:20:59,00:21:01,Because you know when you will believe you.
00:21:01,00:21:01,Poor guy.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"You must be like, can't fucking believe my love."
00:21:04,00:21:06,That's nuts.
00:21:06,00:21:08,I really like mistakes.
00:21:08,00:21:11,"I think history, definitely, some of the things"
00:21:11,00:21:12,"that we find as an everyday thing, like the meter,"
00:21:12,00:21:15,is as a result of a mistake.
00:21:15,00:21:17,One of the things that almost seems to have come out
00:21:17,00:21:20,of being a mistake is phosphorus matches.
00:21:20,00:21:23,"The head of matches, the only reason--"
00:21:23,00:21:24,"I mean, we may have got to it eventually,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,but the actual reason that we did end up getting to it
00:21:26,00:21:30,is because a guy in 1675 called Henning Brand
00:21:30,00:21:33,got obsessed with the idea that he could make gold
00:21:33,00:21:36,by converting buckets of urine into gold.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"So he in his basement, he had 50 buckets of urine."
00:21:39,00:21:41,"Yeah, he went to a winner here."
00:21:41,00:21:44,"And it went up super, and it went up all taxi."
00:21:44,00:21:47,And it just didn't at all go goldy.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"If he had a Cleveland, he must have had to have a look"
00:21:49,00:21:51,on every single bucket.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"Please, leave."
00:21:52,00:21:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:55,00:21:59,"But so, but the weird byproduct of him doing this"
00:21:59,00:22:00,is that it actually lets--
00:22:00,00:22:02,"As I said, it's the tubs of urine."
00:22:02,00:22:03,"Yeah, all right."
00:22:03,00:22:05,"No, the tubs of urine did this waxy substance"
00:22:05,00:22:09,that he ended up having lit up when light was
00:22:09,00:22:11,"making contact with it, and they were going, what is it?"
00:22:11,00:22:13,And they realized this was a way of making fire.
00:22:13,00:22:17,"And so actually, each bucket became way more"
00:22:17,00:22:18,worth than gold.
00:22:18,00:22:20,So he actually exceeded the amount of money
00:22:20,00:22:22,that he would have made from turning that into gold.
00:22:22,00:22:23,Exactly.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"If I shine a light, no, it's like setting light to it."
00:22:27,00:22:28,"All right, OK."
00:22:28,00:22:29,OK.
00:22:29,00:22:32,Do you know the first matches were a yard long?
00:22:32,00:22:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Seriously, the first sold batches."
00:22:35,00:22:37,And the guy who invented them sold 168 in something
00:22:37,00:22:42,"like three years, and they were a toy for rich people."
00:22:42,00:22:44,And they were also incredibly dangerous.
00:22:44,00:22:47,"Because once you'd lit it, it was more like a home"
00:22:47,00:22:48,science kit almost.
00:22:48,00:22:49,It wasn't a practical thing.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"But once you lit it, the globular flaming stuff"
00:22:51,00:22:55,had this amazing tendency to just fall to the ground
00:22:55,00:22:57,and set fire to whatever you were standing on at the time.
00:22:57,00:23:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:00,00:23:02,"I guess because they were very practice-aviding,"
00:23:02,00:23:03,"actually, so one time--"
00:23:03,00:23:04,"No, not under a yard long as well."
00:23:04,00:23:06,That's taken two people.
00:23:06,00:23:07,Yes.
00:23:07,00:23:07,Yeah.
00:23:07,00:23:09,"Good for bonding, maybe that's how they did it."
00:23:09,00:23:10,"Yeah, people."
00:23:10,00:23:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:11,00:23:14,"OK, you know, I don't know."
00:23:14,00:23:16,"Before the 19th century, there was a unit of measurement"
00:23:16,00:23:23,which was called a lot.
00:23:23,00:23:24,How many was that?
00:23:24,00:23:25,It was about--
00:23:25,00:23:26,Not very much.
00:23:26,00:23:27,I thought it wasn't.
00:23:27,00:23:32,"It was the 30th of a pound, so it was not a lot."
00:23:32,00:23:32,That's great.
00:23:32,00:23:35,The word acre used to mean an open field
00:23:35,00:23:36,of no particular measurement.
00:23:36,00:23:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:40,00:23:41,And yard comes from--
00:23:41,00:23:43,Saxons used to wear like a girl.
00:23:43,00:23:45,"It comes from the same origin as girls, doesn't it?"
00:23:45,00:23:46,"Because they're a belt that people used to wear,"
00:23:46,00:23:48,and then they take it off to measure something
00:23:48,00:23:51,when they needed to know it's speculating as to what--
00:23:51,00:23:52,and--
00:23:52,00:23:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:57,00:23:58,"Oh, nice."
00:23:58,00:23:59,Some people understood.
00:23:59,00:24:00,How big is this?
00:24:00,00:24:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:02,00:24:04,So there are some other videos of measurement.
00:24:04,00:24:06,The gun-- you'll know the gun.
00:24:06,00:24:07,No.
00:24:07,00:24:11,The gun is a unit of measurement that measures space sickness.
00:24:11,00:24:14,And it's named after-- he was the first US politician
00:24:14,00:24:16,"to go into space, actually."
00:24:16,00:24:18,"It was named after Senator Jake Gone, who"
00:24:18,00:24:19,"was so sick during his space mission,"
00:24:19,00:24:23,but now it's meant one gun is considered very space sick.
00:24:23,00:24:24,That's great.
00:24:24,00:24:27,That's like the mini-Hellin.
00:24:27,00:24:28,That's not--
00:24:28,00:24:30,The mini-Hellin is the amount of beauty
00:24:30,00:24:31,you need to launch one ship.
00:24:31,00:24:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:34,00:24:35,It's weird.
00:24:35,00:24:37,Lots of units of measurement that we have are quite similar.
00:24:37,00:24:39,So there's a Japanese measure we've called--
00:24:39,00:24:40,I'll mispronounce this--
00:24:40,00:24:44,"but Kaniyaku, it's an obscure one, as in it's not used any more."
00:24:44,00:24:47,But it's about the same as an English foot.
00:24:47,00:24:49,And both of those things are about the same length
00:24:49,00:24:51,as the average man's foot.
00:24:51,00:24:55,So it's a sort of common origin for lots of these things.
00:24:55,00:24:56,It's quite cool.
00:24:56,00:24:58,Like the qubit is the distance from it.
00:24:58,00:24:59,What is it?
00:24:59,00:25:02,Your elbow to the beginning of your hand.
00:25:02,00:25:05,So you would send out someone with a big to buy cloth
00:25:05,00:25:07,in the future engine.
00:25:07,00:25:10,"Because they will be able to get more cloth for their money,"
00:25:10,00:25:11,because they have bigger arms.
00:25:11,00:25:13,It's just one guy with a really massive arm.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"Yeah, it's one more that would have you done."
00:25:16,00:25:17,Yeah.
00:25:17,00:25:19,It's amazing that we took so long to get
00:25:19,00:25:22,to the fact that all humans are different sizes.
00:25:22,00:25:26,We can't base a measurement system with one big human body.
00:25:26,00:25:31,"There's one called a Pietroa, which is Shalamine introduced."
00:25:31,00:25:33,And it was supposedly the size of his foot.
00:25:33,00:25:34,It wasn't.
00:25:34,00:25:37,"It was a human, just trying to understand those things."
00:25:37,00:25:39,"But-- so it was bigger than his foot, so small than his foot."
00:25:39,00:25:40,I don't know.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"I don't know what size of his foot was,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,but I also don't know what size of the thing was.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"So it could be, actually."
00:25:46,00:25:47,Yeah.
00:25:47,00:25:50,I think it was.
00:25:50,00:25:53,"You know what I said, then, with indeterminate size feet."
00:25:53,00:25:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:54,00:26:01,"Can I just say very quickly, just as a side note,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"every time that we've said, oh, what's that called?"
00:26:03,00:26:07,Someone from the crowd has called that.
00:26:07,00:26:08,You're going to get this at any other comedy
00:26:08,00:26:11,days for the audience of treating it like a pub quiz.
00:26:11,00:26:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:13,00:26:14,Are you hearing that?
00:26:14,00:26:15,"Yeah, can you not hear it all the time?"
00:26:15,00:26:16,Every time.
00:26:16,00:26:17,What is it now?
00:26:17,00:26:18,"Listen out, or be there."
00:26:18,00:26:20,Just going to be the carrot.
00:26:20,00:26:21,I just was kind of interesting.
00:26:21,00:26:23,The carrot measurement for diamonds
00:26:23,00:26:26,"is from carrot seeds, because they thought people"
00:26:26,00:26:27,"used to think they're all carrot seeds,"
00:26:27,00:26:31,"where, in fact, as they were announced, so they don't say them out."
00:26:31,00:26:33,"Like, who was it?"
00:26:33,00:26:36,Was it Bob who weighed out of 60 coffee beans for each double coffee
00:26:36,00:26:38,"drink, or you get started in way like half of the milk?"
00:26:38,00:26:39,"Yeah, it was one of them."
00:26:39,00:26:40,It was Bob.
00:26:40,00:26:43,"It was whoever wrote the coffee cantata, which I think was Bob."
00:26:43,00:26:46,He wrote the whole thing in praise of coffee.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Who was it?
00:26:47,00:26:48,No.
00:26:48,00:26:52,"I'm throwing out of the coffee beans, Bob wrote the coffee cantata."
00:26:52,00:26:52,Fucking told you.
00:26:52,00:26:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:54,00:27:02,"Guys, we're going to have to move on to our next stage."
00:27:02,00:27:03,This is Bob.
00:27:03,00:27:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:05,00:27:08,And the next fact comes from that lady in the audience.
00:27:08,00:27:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:10,00:27:13,"OK, so I'm from fact number three, and that is James."
00:27:13,00:27:17,"OK, my fact this week is that St. Andrews Aquarium"
00:27:17,00:27:23,"has three mircats called Churchill, Admiral, and Sheila's Wheels."
00:27:23,00:27:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:25,00:27:28,I love that Sheila's Wheels Mircan.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"They also had a Viva and Direct Line, but they both died."
00:27:30,00:27:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:33,00:27:35,Because I was doing the credit cards.
00:27:35,00:27:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:38,00:27:39,"Oh, yeah, mircats."
00:27:39,00:27:40,And funny names.
00:27:40,00:27:41,Why?
00:27:41,00:27:44,"The very question, first of all, does an Aquarium have"
00:27:44,00:27:44,mircats?
00:27:44,00:27:46,Because they realize there's no such thing as a bitch.
00:27:46,00:27:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:48,00:27:53,[APPLAUSE]
00:27:53,00:27:55,"They had this little bit-- it's a brilliant aquarium, by the way,"
00:27:55,00:27:58,but they had this little bit of rock where they didn't
00:27:58,00:27:59,have anything to put there.
00:27:59,00:28:02,And so they got offered some mircats when they got to do it.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"And I said, yeah, great."
00:28:03,00:28:06,"Mircats, why not?"
00:28:06,00:28:07,"Everyone was big, huh?"
00:28:07,00:28:09,So you actually--
00:28:09,00:28:12,"I was there this week, and that's how you found this out."
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Yeah, did you know the mircats?"
00:28:14,00:28:15,I did.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Meet the mircats.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"And Beth, what do you call these things?"
00:28:18,00:28:19,Penguins.
00:28:19,00:28:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:20,00:28:22,And saw all the different fish?
00:28:22,00:28:23,"Yeah, it's great."
00:28:23,00:28:23,"Really, really go."
00:28:23,00:28:24,Definitely recommend it.
00:28:24,00:28:26,So why are they-- why are they named there?
00:28:26,00:28:29,"Oh, so they were named by someone on Facebook,"
00:28:29,00:28:31,and they thought they were such great names that would name them that.
00:28:31,00:28:34,"And wait, they know there are existing names, don't they?"
00:28:34,00:28:35,That's a mircats.
00:28:35,00:28:36,"Yeah, no."
00:28:36,00:28:37,They were allowed to name them.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"They were born there, and they were allowed to name them."
00:28:40,00:28:43,And my head admiral has a tiny jacket with her full length.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"And they're made to occult Kate and Will's,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,and the others are named after members
00:28:47,00:28:49,of the Royal Family as well.
00:28:49,00:28:54,And they have a penguin who is called Andy Murray.
00:28:54,00:28:58,"Yeah, they do, and it's a female."
00:28:58,00:29:00,And all the other penguins are named after the Murray Family.
00:29:00,00:29:02,They're not your family.
00:29:02,00:29:05,That's the tennis player.
00:29:05,00:29:07,"Interesting, we've heard that the mircats are named after Kate and Will's,"
00:29:07,00:29:10,"because mircats, too, are threatened by inbreeding."
00:29:10,00:29:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:11,00:29:17,[APPLAUSE]
00:29:17,00:29:20,"So mircats, as when they're fighting,"
00:29:20,00:29:23,"they line up in a line, and then just charge at each other."
00:29:23,00:29:24,Really?
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Yeah, like a horizontal line, like a key."
00:29:26,00:29:28,Like a horizontal line.
00:29:28,00:29:29,And so it's like one against the other one.
00:29:29,00:29:31,And they just charge into each other.
00:29:31,00:29:33,And that is how naval warships fall.
00:29:33,00:29:34,"Yeah, it's at the other side."
00:29:34,00:29:36,"So presumably, admiral fights each other."
00:29:36,00:29:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:43,00:29:46,And one way they start from fighting each other
00:29:46,00:29:48,is because they get a lot of their thing from scent.
00:29:48,00:29:51,"They rub a big spaper rub on the mircats,"
00:29:51,00:29:52,"because then they can't smell each other,"
00:29:52,00:29:55,and they don't get angry with each other.
00:29:55,00:29:59,But they also come smell who's related to them.
00:29:59,00:30:00,"No, but that's a good thing."
00:30:00,00:30:04,Because they recently had one mircat who was completely
00:30:04,00:30:06,"segregated, they just were like, we don't want you."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"And they named the mircat Oliver Twist,"
00:30:08,00:30:09,because he was orphaned.
00:30:09,00:30:11,And one of the guys there had to look after Oliver Twist.
00:30:11,00:30:12,And that was the sentence.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"He said, we're going to completely cover them and fix--"
00:30:15,00:30:16,What's up with them?
00:30:16,00:30:16,Becker rub.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Becker rub.
00:30:17,00:30:19,And we're going to cover him as well.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"And that will allow them back into the group,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,because they won't know that he wasn't smelling the same
00:30:23,00:30:24,as us.
00:30:24,00:30:25,But I just reminded me of a brilliant thing
00:30:25,00:30:26,that I read this week.
00:30:26,00:30:28,"You'll have all read out a show, a new scientist,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,"which is that when you shake someone's hand,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,"you smell your hand afterwards, because you're"
00:30:32,00:30:35,trying to get the sense of the person that you shook hands with.
00:30:35,00:30:37,"And all humans have been doing this forever,"
00:30:37,00:30:39,and no one's ever noticed.
00:30:39,00:30:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:40,00:30:40,Not me.
00:30:40,00:30:42,I can assure you I don't do that.
00:30:42,00:30:46,And they videoed a lot of the people in their room
00:30:46,00:30:48,"shaking hands, and counted how often they were touching their faces"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"around them, nose and mouth."
00:30:50,00:30:51,And it was a certain number.
00:30:51,00:30:54,"And when they shook hands, it always went up."
00:30:54,00:30:55,It's amazing.
00:30:55,00:30:56,I think it's on your face.
00:30:56,00:31:00,I've been watching my boyfriend do it over the weekend.
00:31:00,00:31:01,We've found various instances.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"We've like played a board game, shake hands after them."
00:31:03,00:31:04,And then I've watched him.
00:31:04,00:31:07,"And he holds his nose up to shake hands with me,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,which I've not taken this good side.
00:31:09,00:31:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:13,00:31:17,"On Mircats, there's the only animal we've observed"
00:31:17,00:31:19,"is hyperfast, who we've seen employing proper teaching"
00:31:19,00:31:22,methods to teach their young how to hunt.
00:31:22,00:31:23,"So because they hunt individually,"
00:31:23,00:31:26,you can't-- the young can't just follow their parents around
00:31:26,00:31:26,and see how they hunt.
00:31:26,00:31:28,So the parents bring back dead animals
00:31:28,00:31:32,and then explain to their kids how to dismember them.
00:31:32,00:31:34,And the other thing Mircats mothers do
00:31:34,00:31:37,"is they kill the children of other Mircats mothers,"
00:31:37,00:31:40,so that those mothers will breastfeed their own children
00:31:40,00:31:43,so that they can go out and have fun.
00:31:43,00:31:45,Nice guys.
00:31:45,00:31:47,So they turn that mother into a baby
00:31:47,00:31:48,because she's lactating anyway.
00:31:48,00:31:50,"So she'll be like, OK, you can look out for my kids"
00:31:50,00:31:51,and I'll kill the girls.
00:31:51,00:31:52,I'm going to go out on the couch.
00:31:52,00:31:54,They are horrible.
00:31:54,00:31:57,"They're not good pets, apparently,"
00:31:57,00:31:58,according to some websites.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"Because they can be very cruel to each other,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,aggressive to the people they don't know.
00:32:03,00:32:05,They smell quite ferretty.
00:32:05,00:32:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:06,00:32:08,Like you do me a hammer?
00:32:08,00:32:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:10,00:32:13,I was reading about aquariums.
00:32:13,00:32:15,"And I read about London's very first aquarium,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,which was the Royal Aquarium.
00:32:17,00:32:19,I was heard about the Royal Aquarium.
00:32:19,00:32:21,It was basically 1903--
00:32:21,00:32:24,"I'm sorry, just before 1903, because it"
00:32:24,00:32:25,was pulled down in 1903.
00:32:25,00:32:26,It had huge tanks.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"It was ginormous, simple."
00:32:28,00:32:31,And the reason it was pulled down and didn't do so well
00:32:31,00:32:35,is that all of these dine tanks contained no fish.
00:32:35,00:32:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:35,00:32:37,They were completely empty.
00:32:37,00:32:40,Because they marketed it as having sea life.
00:32:40,00:32:41,So they needed salt water.
00:32:41,00:32:43,And they realized how extensive that was.
00:32:43,00:32:47,And they couldn't afford to actually put the right amount
00:32:47,00:32:49,of water in there with the relevant fish.
00:32:49,00:32:52,So people used to come and just look at tanks of water.
00:32:52,00:32:56,I read the promise at one day that they would be fishing them.
00:32:56,00:32:57,I don't think that was the first one.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"Because the first one I think was at London Zoo,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,which would have been-- where did you say your source?
00:33:01,00:33:03,"1903, I was saying that."
00:33:03,00:33:05,London Zoo's open to the mid 19th century.
00:33:05,00:33:07,And it was called the Aquarium.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"But it used to be called Aquavirarium, which is a cool name."
00:33:10,00:33:13,And an aquarium was originally a watering place for cattle.
00:33:13,00:33:16,So you see sometimes troughs where people used to let
00:33:16,00:33:17,their horses and cows drink.
00:33:17,00:33:19,And it has aquarium written on it.
00:33:19,00:33:20,"And it looks like the West Aquarium in the world,"
00:33:20,00:33:22,but it's not.
00:33:22,00:33:23,So did they call it Aquavirarium?
00:33:23,00:33:27,So it's not to be confused and have cattle turn up.
00:33:27,00:33:30,I'm hoping for a drink.
00:33:30,00:33:34,And then they had this thing called Aquarium media.
00:33:34,00:33:35,Have you heard of this?
00:33:35,00:33:36,This is so cool.
00:33:36,00:33:39,That's right.
00:33:39,00:33:41,So there was a guy called Philip Henry Goss or Gosser.
00:33:41,00:33:44,We can edit that as a progrif.
00:33:44,00:33:47,And he was one of the pioneers of basically allowing fish
00:33:47,00:33:49,"to survive, whether--"
00:33:49,00:33:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:52,00:33:55,"Basically, everyone went, they were killing all fish."
00:33:55,00:33:58,"And he was like, no, this is wrong."
00:33:58,00:33:59,We should likely survive.
00:33:59,00:34:06,He came up with a system whereby you could keep fish in a tank
00:34:06,00:34:08,and they would get enough oxygen and he'd eat plants in there.
00:34:08,00:34:09,"And he'd eat it, yeah."
00:34:09,00:34:10,"Got it, and then."
00:34:10,00:34:13,"But suddenly, everyone started getting aquariums."
00:34:13,00:34:16,"So people got them set into their windows, some people,"
00:34:16,00:34:19,"or put into shender liars, just hanging from the ceiling."
00:34:19,00:34:24,Some people built a bird cage into an aquarium.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"So there would be a bird living in there surrounded by fish,"
00:34:26,00:34:27,which it could never eat.
00:34:27,00:34:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:29,00:34:31,That's what you're talking about.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"Yeah, they've made a like trainer into an aquarium"
00:34:34,00:34:35,like design as well.
00:34:35,00:34:36,Oh.
00:34:36,00:34:37,It's they transformed into--
00:34:37,00:34:39,"I don't know how functional it is as a trainer anymore,"
00:34:39,00:34:41,but it looks really cool if you look it up.
00:34:41,00:34:42,It's the paper and into the--
00:34:42,00:34:44,"Well, in the face of the shoe, do you mean?"
00:34:44,00:34:45,The whole shoe is an aquarium.
00:34:45,00:34:47,So it's round the edge of the shoe to fill the water
00:34:47,00:34:48,and put some fish in.
00:34:48,00:34:49,That's incredible.
00:34:49,00:34:50,That's high.
00:34:50,00:34:51,Yeah.
00:34:51,00:34:52,"Oh, that's weird."
00:34:52,00:34:55,"Also, there's the world's smallest aquariums in there that's--"
00:34:55,00:34:56,Small of them.
00:34:56,00:34:57,Is that not it?
00:34:57,00:34:58,Yeah.
00:34:58,00:34:59,It's not even a full shoe.
00:34:59,00:35:00,That's a heel.
00:35:00,00:35:03,I think this one is 24 millimeters high.
00:35:03,00:35:04,Right.
00:35:04,00:35:06,So it's for several fish.
00:35:06,00:35:09,"It's this guy, Anatoly Kamenko, who just designed--"
00:35:09,00:35:10,he's a designer.
00:35:10,00:35:12,His job is designing tiny things.
00:35:12,00:35:15,And so he's created the world's smallest book.
00:35:15,00:35:17,And that's what it's the work for human hair.
00:35:17,00:35:20,Is it advice on how to keep your new zebrafish?
00:35:20,00:35:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:25,00:35:26,Just a few things.
00:35:26,00:35:27,I'll just go on.
00:35:27,00:35:30,"I was just going to say, did anyone see the giant male octopus"
00:35:30,00:35:32,this week that was trying to escape from its aquariums?
00:35:32,00:35:33,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:35:33,00:35:36,Does anyone read what the aquarium is an aquarium in Seattle?
00:35:36,00:35:38,"The aquarium, I don't know if you've ever said."
00:35:38,00:35:41,So the octopus was crawled up the sides of its aquarium
00:35:41,00:35:42,and it's clutched at the outside.
00:35:42,00:35:44,And it's got some of its tentacles on the outside
00:35:44,00:35:45,and it's trying to get over.
00:35:45,00:35:48,And aquarium officials say the octopus named ink
00:35:48,00:35:51,"was not attempting a jailbreak, but simply"
00:35:51,00:35:54,learning to embrace his new home with all eight arms.
00:35:54,00:35:56,It was not in the saber term.
00:35:56,00:35:59,"They said, well, it's putting the lid back on to you."
00:35:59,00:36:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:03,00:36:05,So some things about name changes and product
00:36:05,00:36:06,placements and stuff like that.
00:36:06,00:36:07,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:07,00:36:10,"So Aussie Royal Spotball, Gary Hocking,"
00:36:10,00:36:13,"changed his name by Pete Paul to Whiskers one year,"
00:36:13,00:36:15,because he was paid a lot of money by that.
00:36:15,00:36:18,"And he was a tongue-in-rubbi star, Epitoyoni,"
00:36:18,00:36:21,who changes his name to Patti Power.
00:36:21,00:36:25,And you can change your name of your stadium and stuff.
00:36:25,00:36:26,But it doesn't always work out.
00:36:26,00:36:30,The MLS side Colorado Rapids has changed their stadium
00:36:30,00:36:34,"to Dick's Spotting Goods Park, but everyone calls it the Dick."
00:36:34,00:36:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:37,00:36:39,"And like, changing your name by Pete Paul as well,"
00:36:39,00:36:40,I like all that kind of stuff.
00:36:40,00:36:44,So there was a guy called Gary Brett from Potter's Bar.
00:36:44,00:36:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:47,00:36:48,He was as broad a change that they'd do
00:36:48,00:36:50,on his bar before him.
00:36:50,00:36:54,"He changed his name to Mr. Hong Kong Fui, OK?"
00:36:54,00:36:57,"And he said, I've loved Hong Kong Fui since I was a boy."
00:36:57,00:37:00,And I always wanted to be named up then.
00:37:00,00:37:01,I'm quite serious.
00:37:01,00:37:04,I'm a bit of a sad child.
00:37:04,00:37:06,I'm quite serious about being known as Mr. Fui.
00:37:06,00:37:08,"My wife was a bit upset, but she should"
00:37:08,00:37:11,be honored to be married to a number one super guy
00:37:11,00:37:16,who's quicker than the human life.
00:37:16,00:37:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:17,00:37:19,"And then there was a guy called Nigel Dyle, who"
00:37:19,00:37:24,"changed his name to Mr. Toasted's T-Cakes, OK?"
00:37:24,00:37:27,"And he said, some people can't believe it, especially,"
00:37:27,00:37:29,because I don't even like T-Cakes that much.
00:37:29,00:37:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:31,00:37:36,That was a nice name.
00:37:36,00:37:38,It must be so hard if you love stupid names
00:37:38,00:37:40,that you've got to go to the--
00:37:40,00:37:41,"What's the name, Charlie?"
00:37:41,00:37:42,The Dean's Hole.
00:37:42,00:37:44,"And you must be in the queue going, OK, this time,"
00:37:44,00:37:48,"it's just going to be Brian Smith, the name of the Brian Smith."
00:37:48,00:37:49,"And you're saying, hi to the guy in front of you."
00:37:49,00:37:50,"Oh, what are you changing your name to?"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"Oh, rainbow sunshine moon does."
00:37:52,00:37:54,You're going down there.
00:37:54,00:37:55,And you get home to your wife.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"She's like, is it Brian Smith?"
00:37:56,00:37:59,"It's asked my cadang, dang, dang, dang."
00:37:59,00:38:01,I couldn't help myself.
00:38:01,00:38:03,It must be so hard if you love a name.
00:38:03,00:38:07,At least a good no marriage to a number one super guy.
00:38:07,00:38:09,"There's a guy called Sean Hennessy, who"
00:38:09,00:38:11,changes his name to Nigel Bottomface
00:38:11,00:38:14,to win a bet with his friends.
00:38:14,00:38:17,"And he said, my mum was furious."
00:38:17,00:38:19,But at least I got a Nite out in Chelmswood.
00:38:19,00:38:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:21,00:38:28,You're the sad life there.
00:38:28,00:38:30,"We're going to have to move on, but do you want to go?"
00:38:30,00:38:33,"Oh, I've got some funny stuff on advertising."
00:38:33,00:38:35,"OK, so the Churchill dog, as the one of the fidget school"
00:38:35,00:38:38,"Churchill, as the fact, the Churchill dog was initially"
00:38:38,00:38:41,"a real bulldog called Lucas, who had to be sacked off the one"
00:38:41,00:38:45,"handbook, because he refused to hold a phone in his mouth."
00:38:45,00:38:47,He refused.
00:38:47,00:38:48,Oh no.
00:38:48,00:38:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:50,00:38:58,"Oh, we are going to have to move on."
00:38:58,00:38:59,I'm going to have to move it on.
00:38:59,00:39:02,So we move on to our final fact to the evening.
00:39:02,00:39:03,And that is my fact.
00:39:03,00:39:07,And my fact this week is that the only ancient Egyptian
00:39:07,00:39:11,socks that we know of all belonged to Tutankhamun.
00:39:11,00:39:12,Is that awesome?
00:39:12,00:39:15,"When Howard Carter went into the tomb,"
00:39:15,00:39:19,"he found a lot of stuff, a lot of gold, a lot of walking"
00:39:19,00:39:22,"sticks, and he found three pairs of socks."
00:39:22,00:39:25,"And what's amazing is that up until finding these socks,"
00:39:25,00:39:30,"there had been no depiction of socks in ancient Egypt,"
00:39:30,00:39:31,whatsoever.
00:39:31,00:39:34,And I can't believe that that wasn't the headline.
00:39:34,00:39:36,They wore socks.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"Also, because he wore sandals."
00:39:37,00:39:41,It means that he was a socks-and-sandals fan.
00:39:41,00:39:44,Which is very exciting.
00:39:44,00:39:47,Do you normally have painted on the bottom of his sandals?
00:39:47,00:39:48,"No, this is cool."
00:39:48,00:39:51,He had the faces of his enemies painted on the bottom.
00:39:51,00:39:53,"So wherever he walked, he would be crushing them"
00:39:53,00:39:55,into the dust.
00:39:55,00:39:57,"Yes, but except there was a lot of sand."
00:39:57,00:39:58,So that would just be great branding.
00:39:58,00:40:00,Because you'd see the heart of everyone.
00:40:00,00:40:02,That's like the ultimate marketing trend.
00:40:02,00:40:06,"It's like you, Tim Collins and me."
00:40:06,00:40:07,"Yeah, they have that."
00:40:07,00:40:10,So there was some socks that I think those weren't found intact
00:40:10,00:40:12,where they were reconstructed from the evidence
00:40:12,00:40:14,"that they had, but that all the socks found intact."
00:40:14,00:40:15,"No, no, no, sorry."
00:40:15,00:40:17,"In his tomb, they found three that were completely intact."
00:40:17,00:40:20,And then they found three that weren't.
00:40:20,00:40:22,But they think that they must have been socks.
00:40:22,00:40:23,They were the other pairs.
00:40:23,00:40:24,Yeah.
00:40:24,00:40:26,"So he actually had six pairs, but three"
00:40:26,00:40:30,"didn't make the 3,000-year period of time as his past."
00:40:30,00:40:33,"In fact, they also found a bottle of perfume"
00:40:33,00:40:36,"speaking of the 3,000-year period of time,"
00:40:36,00:40:38,"which still when they took the lid off, it still smelled."
00:40:38,00:40:41,I think it smelled like something rotten.
00:40:41,00:40:42,"Oh, I know."
00:40:42,00:40:46,It smelled like a chamomile of vanilla or something.
00:40:46,00:40:48,"Oh, it's 3,000 years."
00:40:48,00:40:50,"He was also buried with his own baby clothes,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,which I think is quite sweet.
00:40:52,00:40:53,"Yeah, I wonder why."
00:40:53,00:40:55,There was actually a few toys.
00:40:55,00:40:57,"Weirdly, there was a boomerang."
00:40:57,00:40:58,Yeah.
00:40:58,00:41:01,"Well, they used the dump and they used lassoos as well."
00:41:01,00:41:01,Did they?
00:41:01,00:41:02,Yeah.
00:41:02,00:41:03,Yeah.
00:41:03,00:41:04,"Cool, isn't it?"
00:41:04,00:41:05,It's Australia.
00:41:05,00:41:06,Yes.
00:41:06,00:41:09,It's the thing with the mirror where we call this India.
00:41:09,00:41:10,And we just--
00:41:10,00:41:11,It does sound like the outback from--
00:41:11,00:41:12,Yeah.
00:41:12,00:41:13,Wow.
00:41:13,00:41:16,"And he was buried with 413, what we're called,"
00:41:16,00:41:17,shabby figures.
00:41:17,00:41:20,And these were little slaves that he would take
00:41:20,00:41:21,into the next life.
00:41:21,00:41:23,"Because often people think they, if you were the slave"
00:41:23,00:41:24,"of a pharaoh and your pharaoh died,"
00:41:24,00:41:27,then you'd have to kill yourself and be buried with him.
00:41:27,00:41:29,"Or be buried with him, which is even worse, but that never"
00:41:29,00:41:30,happened.
00:41:30,00:41:33,It was actually a little model of the use that you would use.
00:41:33,00:41:36,He was also buried with James as telling me an erection.
00:41:36,00:41:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:38,00:41:39,That was a compliment.
00:41:39,00:41:39,"That was something, you know."
00:41:39,00:41:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:42,00:41:43,Yeah.
00:41:43,00:41:45,He had a 90 degree erection of that.
00:41:45,00:41:48,90 degree erection.
00:41:48,00:41:51,"And he's the only known pharaoh, as far as I know,"
00:41:51,00:41:53,who was buried that way.
00:41:53,00:41:54,No one really knows him.
00:41:54,00:41:58,And James has studied the field extensively.
00:41:58,00:42:00,"There was a guy called George Glitten, who"
00:42:00,00:42:03,was going to unwrap a mummy in front of a lot of people.
00:42:03,00:42:05,"He was a bit of a shouts, and he didn't have a mummy."
00:42:05,00:42:07,And he was going to unwrap them.
00:42:07,00:42:10,And he said it was a princess mummy.
00:42:10,00:42:11,And he claimed that he knew that.
00:42:11,00:42:14,"He knew her identity, she was a doctrine of Egyptian priests."
00:42:14,00:42:17,He knew that because of the side of the hieroglyphics
00:42:17,00:42:18,on her sarcophagus.
00:42:18,00:42:20,And then he unwrapped to unwrap to unwrap to him
00:42:20,00:42:22,in front of a lot of people.
00:42:22,00:42:25,"And then they realized, actually, that it was a man."
00:42:25,00:42:28,The princess had a rather large penis.
00:42:28,00:42:29,That's where we get a pharaoh to from.
00:42:29,00:42:30,The princess and the penis.
00:42:30,00:42:37,It was embossed in this.
00:42:37,00:42:41,And he explained that his era was due to the poor handwriting
00:42:41,00:42:43,of the sideophagus.
00:42:43,00:42:47,A bad Egyptologist always blames the hieroglyphs.
00:42:47,00:42:48,That's funny.
00:42:48,00:42:50,Have you had a mummy petigrew?
00:42:50,00:42:52,What mummy petigrew was a guy called Thomas Petigrew.
00:42:52,00:42:56,And he was just unrolled loads of mummies all the time.
00:42:56,00:42:57,He was an Egyptologist.
00:42:57,00:43:00,And he unrolled 14 of them.
00:43:00,00:43:02,And he would do a six-part lecture series.
00:43:02,00:43:05,And he would always save the unrolling for the very last lecture
00:43:05,00:43:07,in the series to build up to it.
00:43:07,00:43:09,"Throughout it, I just found one sentence about it,"
00:43:09,00:43:13,"which I wanted to share, which is that Petigrew's dramatic,"
00:43:13,00:43:16,erotically tinge unrollings became so popular
00:43:16,00:43:18,"that at one gathering, the Archbishop of Canterbury"
00:43:18,00:43:20,himself got squeezed out of the room.
00:43:20,00:43:31,"And then later on, he was asked to turn a Victorian duke"
00:43:31,00:43:32,into a mummy.
00:43:32,00:43:34,The Duke of Helton was obsessed with mummies.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"And he said, will you mummify me after I die?"
00:43:36,00:43:39,"I did, yeah, yeah."
00:43:39,00:43:40,And he did it.
00:43:40,00:43:42,"But unfortunately, he didn't fit in the sarcophagus he'd had built."
00:43:42,00:43:44,So they had to take off his feet.
00:43:44,00:43:45,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:45,00:43:46,Yeah.
00:43:46,00:43:50,"Well, they were excavating the Tudon Cummings clothes."
00:43:50,00:43:52,"No, actually this was later on when they decided"
00:43:52,00:43:53,to recreate all his clothes.
00:43:53,00:43:55,Then the person who was recreating them
00:43:55,00:43:57,"decided to tell her students, so the anyway,"
00:43:57,00:43:59,they could work out exactly how it worn them
00:43:59,00:44:01,was by trying them all on himself themselves.
00:44:01,00:44:04,So the students of this archeologist
00:44:04,00:44:05,got to just try and all Tudon Cummings clothes.
00:44:05,00:44:07,And they worked out that something they thought
00:44:07,00:44:11,was a head dress was actually a pair of these things
00:44:11,00:44:14,"to be worn, the arms to form the wings of a falcon."
00:44:14,00:44:15,"Oh, absolutely."
00:44:15,00:44:17,I don't know how you work that out.
00:44:17,00:44:19,And it sounds a bit like they were just pissing it out.
00:44:19,00:44:22,The head dress on their arm was made from ribbons.
00:44:22,00:44:24,He was a very strange shape.
00:44:24,00:44:27,I think he had a Tudon Cummings.
00:44:27,00:44:28,All right.
00:44:28,00:44:30,"I think he had a congenital disease or something,"
00:44:30,00:44:32,because his hip measurements were extremely
00:44:32,00:44:33,loved.
00:44:33,00:44:35,It was sort of out of proportion with the rest of his body.
00:44:35,00:44:35,And we don't know why.
00:44:35,00:44:37,"Well, much like Kate's and Will's."
00:44:37,00:44:38,It was inbreeding.
00:44:38,00:44:40,I'm talking about the fear of that.
00:44:40,00:44:41,The fear of perhaps Kate and Will's.
00:44:41,00:44:44,"No, his parents were brother and sister."
00:44:44,00:44:45,Yeah.
00:44:45,00:44:47,I really like the-- so when you were saying
00:44:47,00:44:49,"the thing of unwrapping the mummies,"
00:44:49,00:44:52,"that was a massive craze that the Victorians went through,"
00:44:52,00:44:55,where they suddenly were just digging up lots of mummies
00:44:55,00:44:57,"and using them, virtually everything."
00:44:57,00:44:59,Railroads used to use them as fuel.
00:44:59,00:45:00,"No, that's much."
00:45:00,00:45:01,"I promise, that's not so."
00:45:01,00:45:02,I was in America.
00:45:02,00:45:04,"Oh, but Mark Twain said that they did."
00:45:04,00:45:06,And we think he was taken to Mickey.
00:45:06,00:45:07,"Oh, OK."
00:45:07,00:45:08,Yeah.
00:45:08,00:45:09,So how about the time traveler guy
00:45:09,00:45:10,who went to King Arthur's Court?
00:45:10,00:45:11,That's not a--
00:45:11,00:45:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:13,00:45:14,I've got some terrible news going
00:45:14,00:45:16,about Phil and Ted Spokas journey.
00:45:16,00:45:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:20,00:45:21,How about mummy brown?
00:45:21,00:45:22,Is that true?
00:45:22,00:45:23,I think that's true.
00:45:23,00:45:24,Mummy brown is amazing.
00:45:24,00:45:26,"Mummy brown was, if you haven't heard of it,"
00:45:26,00:45:29,is a-- it was a paint that artists would use.
00:45:29,00:45:32,It was ground up mummy that would lead to a brown.
00:45:32,00:45:35,And they would use them on their paintings.
00:45:35,00:45:35,And a lot of people didn't.
00:45:35,00:45:37,They just thought it was a cute name.
00:45:37,00:45:39,"And then someone explained, no, it's an actual mummy."
00:45:39,00:45:43,And a lot of famous artists actually got quite disturbed by that.
00:45:43,00:45:47,"And buried the rest of the paint, giving it an honorable burial."
00:45:47,00:45:49,"But they just thought, well, there's a lot of stuff"
00:45:49,00:45:51,"about persons going on in fact, then."
00:45:51,00:45:52,And they didn't want that.
00:45:52,00:45:53,"But yeah, you get paints."
00:45:53,00:45:54,I can't believe that.
00:45:54,00:45:54,It's extraordinary.
00:45:54,00:45:56,And they used it as a panacea as well
00:45:56,00:45:58,that they would use this mummy.
00:45:58,00:46:02,And then they would take it as a medicine for any illness.
00:46:02,00:46:03,I think they used it.
00:46:03,00:46:06,People in fees used it until the 20th century
00:46:06,00:46:10,"to heal bruises, which is amazingly cafeteria considering."
00:46:10,00:46:11,It's just a bruise.
00:46:11,00:46:12,Yeah.
00:46:12,00:46:16,"Yeah, why don't you don't need to heal bruises?"
00:46:16,00:46:18,"You could get an imitation mummy as well,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,if you didn't have the real thing.
00:46:20,00:46:23,"And so you would, here's the ingredients."
00:46:23,00:46:27,"Take the carcass of a young man, some say red-haired,"
00:46:27,00:46:29,not dying of a disease.
00:46:29,00:46:32,"Let it live for 24 hours in clean water, cut the flesh into pieces,"
00:46:32,00:46:36,and add a little allow and invite for 24 hours
00:46:36,00:46:38,in the spirit of wine and turpentine.
00:46:38,00:46:42,It doesn't sound artificial to me.
00:46:42,00:46:43,Sounds real.
00:46:43,00:46:45,"It's real, but not old."
00:46:45,00:46:46,OK.
00:46:46,00:46:47,Yeah.
00:46:47,00:46:51,"I was looking at very interesting, very old sites and very old rituals."
00:46:51,00:46:54,"But so the Vikings, they were buried on ships."
00:46:54,00:46:55,I was even not at sea.
00:46:55,00:46:57,And I read a really interesting theory
00:46:57,00:46:59,that because they were often buried with decapitated animals.
00:46:59,00:47:03,"So the Osberg, Osberg Viking ship is one of the most famous Viking ships"
00:47:03,00:47:04,that's been on Earth.
00:47:04,00:47:05,It was this woman.
00:47:05,00:47:07,She was buried with ten decapitated horses.
00:47:07,00:47:09,And I think a couple of decapitated dogs.
00:47:09,00:47:13,And they think this is because they have the ships on land.
00:47:13,00:47:15,"But to get to the underworld, you have to sail."
00:47:15,00:47:19,It was in order to create a convenient river of blood
00:47:19,00:47:23,from your decapitated horses on which you could sail to the underworld.
00:47:23,00:47:24,Wow.
00:47:24,00:47:26,Grotesque.
00:47:26,00:47:29,"And also, so the first evidence of a ritual burial"
00:47:29,00:47:32,"is from 28,000 years ago, of a burial where"
00:47:32,00:47:34,people were sort of buried with items.
00:47:34,00:47:37,And it seemed like they believed in an afterlife.
00:47:37,00:47:40,And it was two young boys.
00:47:40,00:47:43,And they were buried with mammoth tusks over two years long.
00:47:43,00:47:44,But they'd been straightened.
00:47:44,00:47:46,And we don't know how they straightened them.
00:47:46,00:47:48,So we think they'd boiled them and then straighten the mammoth tusks
00:47:48,00:47:52,into a four feet long and just straight tusks.
00:47:52,00:47:55,I trade my will as soon as I get it.
00:47:55,00:47:57,That's what I want.
00:47:57,00:48:01,And I'm ten decapitated horses and straightened the mammoth tusks.
00:48:01,00:48:05,"I read a thing that I want as well, for deaf, which is that."
00:48:05,00:48:06,I was reading that.
00:48:06,00:48:08,It's weird when you read like someone's deaf.
00:48:08,00:48:09,"You're like, whoa, I want that."
00:48:09,00:48:10,It sounded really cool.
00:48:10,00:48:15,"Utsi, who was the oldest iceman that we found."
00:48:15,00:48:18,"He was made by Utsi, I don't know what period he was from."
00:48:18,00:48:19,But he was complete.
00:48:19,00:48:21,And they found everything on him.
00:48:21,00:48:23,They found a bag which had magic mushrooms in it.
00:48:23,00:48:25,They found he had shoes.
00:48:25,00:48:25,He had socks.
00:48:25,00:48:26,He had socks.
00:48:26,00:48:28,But what's amazing is that they found them complete.
00:48:28,00:48:31,And what they don't point out is that they
00:48:31,00:48:34,have found other people who are complete.
00:48:34,00:48:36,But Utsi's a rare case because he was just a whole thing.
00:48:36,00:48:37,Sorry?
00:48:37,00:48:37,Let's see.
00:48:37,00:48:39,Let's see.
00:48:39,00:48:40,Not the Q&A.
00:48:40,00:48:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:42,00:48:43,"Thank you, though."
00:48:43,00:48:47,"Again, it was like, kind of the heckles."
00:48:47,00:48:50,"At John Wers, it's like, you're shit."
00:48:50,00:48:51,Arcroud.
00:48:51,00:48:52,"Utsi, dickhead."
00:48:52,00:48:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:55,00:48:56,Do I say it right?
00:48:56,00:48:57,Let's see.
00:48:57,00:49:00,So Utsi was found as a full body.
00:49:00,00:49:01,"But then I read about these other deaths,"
00:49:01,00:49:02,where they found other people.
00:49:02,00:49:06,"And basically, because of the way that tectonics and just"
00:49:06,00:49:08,"the way that things shift, they found full bodies."
00:49:08,00:49:12,But people have been splattered and cartoonified.
00:49:12,00:49:14,"You know, at the end of Roger Rabbit, where he splattered,"
00:49:14,00:49:15,because it's a long form?
00:49:15,00:49:17,They found people that are like just fully
00:49:17,00:49:20,like huge humans in a huge world.
00:49:20,00:49:21,Like a bit of pressed flowers.
00:49:21,00:49:23,"Yeah, like some of the pressed humans."
00:49:23,00:49:25,And that's how I want to go.
00:49:25,00:49:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:49:28,00:49:31,"Which is what's great, what's going on?"
00:49:31,00:49:34,We're going to have to wrap up in a couple more minutes.
