00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,040
 Hi everyone, James here.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,400
 I just wanted to start with an apology.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,960
 Unfortunately, the audio is very bad in this episode.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,440
 Some of our microphones failed.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,200
 So we only had one mic, and you'll be hearing it from that.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,000
 So it's going to be a bit tinny, a little bit like we recorded

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,840
 in a toilet.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,320
 But that's kind of back to our roots,

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,840
 because that's what most of our early ones were like.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,360
 But enjoy the show anyway.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,080
 We think is a good one.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,440
 Get through the audio next week.

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,840
 We'll be much better.

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:36,360
 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,120
 [APPLAUSE]

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,640
 Hi, everyone.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,720
 Welcome to another episode.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,520
 And no such thing is a fish, a weekly podcast.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,520
 We're coming to you from the Soho Theater in Central London.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,720
 I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin,

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,920
 and Andy Murray.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,720
 This is our one-year special.

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,680
 It's our birthday.

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,600
 We've once again sat around the microphones

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,960
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
 And in no particular order, here we go.

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,720
 Starting with you, Andrew Hunter Murray.

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,400
 Hello.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,240
 My fact is that the root for the home call Ultramarathon

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,400
 is to run up and down the same stretch of road 25 times.

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,440
 [LAUGHTER]

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,680
 This has been on the news a bit recently.

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,880
 Because it's just happened, the first ever Ultramarathon

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,080
 they've had on this route for one of the better words.

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,840
 And it's 31 miles long.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,880
 Because apparently anything longer than the standard 26.2

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,560
 is an Ultramarathon, which I think is cheating,

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,160
 because I think it should be at least double.

40
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,480
 And I'd say that as someone who's never

41
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,160
 run more than 200 meters, and that was this fourth day.

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,040
 And fourth.

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
 Out of fourth.

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,120
 Out of fourth.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,560
 So yeah, that's it.

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,440
 Well, my father used to say it was.

47
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,600
 31 miles.

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,080
 Oh, yeah.

49
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,280
 Because normally Ultramarathon is more like 100 miles,

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,160
 200 miles, 200 miles, whatever.

51
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,080
 But if they had done that here,

52
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,200
 they probably would have been suicides and pulled them out.

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,320
 I would have actually-- so I read that if you run 200 miles,

54
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,800
 it's less tiring than if you run 100 miles.

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 Right.

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
 That can't be true.

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,920
 That can't be true.

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,000
 Yeah, apparently what happens is when you know it's going

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,360
 to be much longer, your intensity is much lower.

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,080
 So you take your time a lot more.

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,960
 And they've felt that people who do the longer ones

62
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,920
 feel better at the end.

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,120
 So you'll just say you do it much more so.

64
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
 You're saying it takes--

65
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,240
 You can serve your energy better.

66
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,040
 You walk it.

67
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,240
 You walk it.

68
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,280
 You take the job when you get your two.

69
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,360
 So the thing about this marathon

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
 is that everyone's been describing it,

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,280
 particularly people doing it as the most boring marathon

72
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,160
 possible because of the repetitions.

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,360
 And I was looking into boring marathons.

74
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,560
 And there is an annual boring marathon.

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,080
 What?

76
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,280
 Yeah, there's an annual boring marathon.

77
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,320
 There's an ultra boring marathon.

78
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,560
 And it's actually apparently quite exciting.

79
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,280
 It's just it happens to take place in a town

80
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,000
 and we're seeing people boring Oregon City.

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,120
 Yeah, which is an actual place.

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
 And their motto is, "The most exciting place to live."

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,960
 They're twins with a town called Dole in Scotland.

84
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,600
 Yeah, yeah, they have an annual Dole and boring day,

85
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,720
 which you both think it was August 9th.

86
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,920
 So a lot more than recently, the most boring day

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,640
 in modern history.

88
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,640
 And it was equal to the 11th, 1954, so a bad time.

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,600
 It was a scientist of a huge program

90
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,720
 to work out the day where the least interesting stuff

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,320
 happened, because there's a general election in Belgium.

92
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,080
 So sorry, sorry, Belgium.

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,120
 The confront page of the New York Post

94
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,000
 was two cops attending a conference

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,080
 on juvenile delinquency from their views.

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
 So they put that into a machine, right?

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
 And it's generous.

98
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,480
 So it was like three million bits of information.

99
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,560
 300 million?

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
 Was it 300 million?

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,480
 It was.

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,000
 Wow.

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,640
 So they said, "Find us the most boring day."

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,880
 They came up with this date, April 11th, 1954.

105
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,960
 I read this as well.

106
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,080
 Sight note to it, which actually caught my eye

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,600
 more than the fact itself, is that the guy who was a Cambridge

108
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,800
 scientist, he was a computer programmer,

109
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,120
 his name, his name is William Tundstel-Pedo.

110
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,400
 [LAUGHTER]

111
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,440
 He changed his surname, wouldn't he?

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
 I was trying to research the facts.

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,880
 I got so sidelined.

114
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,960
 [LAUGHTER]

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,200
 Take your key point out.

116
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,840
 You got plasticins came up with boredom,

117
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,960
 as in he invented the word.

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,520
 Yeah, I read his books, yeah.

119
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,720
 [LAUGHTER]

120
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,480
 Oh!

121
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,240
 [INAUDIBLE]

122
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,400
 Yeah, it's in the Bleak House.

123
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
 He says, "Someone is bought to death by marriage."

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,200
 Oh, sorry.

125
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,720
 So maybe people just deceived that sort of man.

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,360
 Maybe it meant thrills.

127
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
 What do you mean, thrills?

128
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,640
 There's a lot of people say to me when I'm talking to them

129
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,480
 in the pub and they say, "I'm so bad."

130
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,000
 Yeah.

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,200
 They're actually saying they're thrills.

132
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,680
 Is that why you keep going on and on?

133
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,720
 [LAUGHTER]

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,640
 There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea called the Baining,

135
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,080
 and they value work as the highest ideal, the best

136
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,720
 thing you do is work.

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,120
 And they have been called unstudiable because of their failure

138
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
 to do anything interesting.

139
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,680
 [LAUGHTER]

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,880
 So much, isn't it?

141
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,800
 And there was an anthropologist called Gregory Bateson,

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,120
 who spent 14 months attempting to study them

143
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,320
 in the 1920s before giving up.

144
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,640
 [LAUGHTER]

145
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,760
 They don't even like sex.

146
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,400
 Is that right?

147
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,080
 Yeah.

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,200
 They don't like it very much.

149
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,120
 No, they don't like it.

150
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,840
 But they do have kids, but often a lot of adoption,

151
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,880
 because they don't really want to have kids.

152
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,160
 Wait, when have they got moved forward?

153
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,920
 There's been maybe tribes or something.

154
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,600
 I don't know.

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,560
 But they also got like play, because it's

156
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,320
 a natural state of children, and they got like children.

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,240
 At least sometimes they will punish the children who

158
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,240
 are playing by putting their hands in the fire.

159
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
 [LAUGHTER]

160
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,600
 That's not boring.

161
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
 That's an exciting thing to do.

162
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,880
 I think the most boring sport ever,

163
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,600
 the most boring sporting event ever,

164
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,280
 was the cycling event of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic, where

165
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,120
 it involved people watching two people who are cycling head-to-head,

166
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,200
 sitting still on bicycles for more than an hour.

167
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,840
 What were they exercise bikes?

168
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,160
 No, it was that-- you notice that it's the sprint cycle

169
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,640
 when it goes head-to-head, and they often

170
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,880
 like hover at the start of it, so you don't know.

171
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
 Because I think it's a slipstream thing,

172
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,680
 so because they want the other person to start cycling first,

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
 and they can get in their slipstream.

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,920
 And these two guys just have this stand-up.

175
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
 [LAUGHTER]

176
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,520
 They're still on the bike, standing on the bikes,

177
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,800
 but over an hour an hour and three on the bike.

178
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,000
 So that's pretty hard.

179
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
 Yeah, I know impressive.

180
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,120
 Oh, it sounds exciting to me.

181
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,880
 As you constantly get wet, you always go out, no.

182
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,360
 [LAUGHTER]

183
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,160
 The commentator had to leave.

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,680
 I think I was so bad.

185
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,000
 It's something else to get on with.

186
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,040
 Exciting with too much.

187
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,840
 Hand of this.

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,360
 Do you know the way they induce boredom scientists want

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,040
 to test boredom?

190
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,560
 Obviously, there are a lot of ways of doing it.

191
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,800
 So to do pain, they put your hand in the bucket of icy water.

192
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,760
 And to do boredom, they make you copy out the phone book.

193
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,000
 That's the official way of doing it.

194
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,520
 But if they want to really test you,

195
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,600
 they just make you read the phone book.

196
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
 Let me see, I have to focus on it and really concentrate.

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 But it proves your creativity.

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
 What are you in the phone doctors?

199
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,520
 What being bored, as induced by this and the experiment they did.

200
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,400
 So they tested, they had people who could just copy

201
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,360
 numbers out of the phone book or not do that.

202
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,320
 And at the end of that, everyone who'd been in it

203
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,080
 was asked to-- this is the test.

204
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,040
 Think of it as many uses as they could for a pair of plastic cups,

205
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,120
 which is apparently a test of divergent thinking

206
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,040
 and how crazy and creative you are.

207
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,400
 And people who've been reading the phone book

208
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,400
 or copying it out were much more creative.

209
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,040
 They're like, throw them at the person who told me to read the phone book.

210
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,880
 And there's a scientific test at the boredom program

211
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,600
 this scale that's come up with by two psychologists.

212
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,000
 And it's 28 statements, which you have to agree on this agree with.

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,040
 And it consists of statements, including,

214
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,720
 I have projects in mind all the time, things to do.

215
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,640
 Or much of the time, I just sit around doing nothing.

216
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,120
 [LAUGHTER]

217
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,720
 If you could do that successfully, I don't think you're easily bored.

218
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,920
 I sometimes read my own phone book and test myself

219
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,120
 on people I have to not know who they are.

220
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,360
 [LAUGHTER]

221
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,280
 Here's Rose.

222
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,040
 [LAUGHTER]

223
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
 Does anyone else do that?

224
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,600
 One yes, one yes, one yes, one yes.

225
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,120
 I did a terrible thing the other day.

226
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,480
 I got a message on my phone from someone saying,

227
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,360
 hey, how's it going?

228
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,440
 And you know that terrible moment when you haven't got their number.

229
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,360
 And you're like, oh my god, the message is so familiar.

230
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,960
 I definitely know who this is.

231
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,600
 They're going to hate.

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
 So I have to do the old classic.

233
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
 Sorry, it's a new phone.

234
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,360
 I haven't got your number.

235
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,320
 Who is it?

236
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,160
 And the person wrote back going, it's Sheila.

237
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,920
 [LAUGHTER]

238
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,120
 So I did the lamest thing that I've done it used.

239
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,160
 I wrote back, hey, sorry, I'm Australian.

240
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,040
 There's a lot of Sheila.

241
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,160
 [LAUGHTER]

242
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
 Which one do?

243
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,880
 [APPLAUSE]

244
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,400
 She didn't write back.

245
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,320
 [LAUGHTER]

246
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,760
 I found the most boring-- it's very unfortunate.

247
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,120
 There's a resort in Switzerland, and I was a bit confused

248
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,000
 because it's described as a village and resort.

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,120
 So I can't feel how the village is going to scale itself.

250
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
 Yeah.

251
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,120
 And it's been described as the most boring resort in Switzerland.

252
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,560
 And you know when it's like, oh, how the nice time.

253
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,640
 They're all of their things.

254
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,080
 It's just this is so dull.

255
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
 This is my dull place.

256
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
 And the tourist board there released the statements.

257
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,840
 They said that they think they've got this kind to look

258
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,480
 because their point village has nothing, does nothing,

259
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,400
 and offers nothing.

260
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,280
 And then they added, we think that's a positive.

261
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,040
 But so they've combatted it now by going,

262
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,280
 they had a meeting, and they're like, how do we

263
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,760
 sort out the boredom levels of our town?

264
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,800
 How do we make it exciting and vibrant?

265
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,520
 And they started a stone skipping competition,

266
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,320
 which they're now trying to make a worldwide thing.

267
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,760
 But then they found out that another similarly dull town

268
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,800
 also decided the way to combat boredom

269
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,520
 was to set up a skimming stones competition.

270
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
 So they have to call them and say, could we do the qualifying

271
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,360
 round before they get to it?

272
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,960
 You can't even go and see the finals.

273
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,880
 Yeah, I can see.

274
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,040
 Yeah.

275
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,880
 OK, some stuff on Ultramarathens.

276
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,840
 Yeah, yeah.

277
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,040
 OK, so Ultramarathen athletes sometimes

278
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,400
 have all their toenails removed.

279
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,680
 Before or after?

280
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
 Before.

281
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,240
 I'm not sure, but like, you know what I'm saying.

282
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,560
 So put that off in there.

283
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,040
 So you'll end up, you'll run, and you'll have real problems

284
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,840
 with your toenails, and they'll get worse and worse.

285
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,120
 And then they get better.

286
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
 And then once they've been a problem once,

287
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,440
 they get worse and worse all the time.

288
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,920
 And so quite often they'll have them taken off,

289
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
 just lately.

290
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,720
 What?

291
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,560
 It reminds me of how?

292
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,280
 Yeah, how?

293
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,240
 How do they take them off?

294
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,480
 Do you want me to show you?

295
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
 They would search, if they have searching, we'd do it.

296
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,080
 Yeah.

297
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,520
 That's not what I mean.

298
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,680
 I wanted a method.

299
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,760
 I think it's a yank.

300
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,200
 And the other thing that happens in Ultramarathen

301
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,080
 people is their body gets in such trouble

302
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,720
 because they're really, really pushing it

303
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,400
 that they are insatiable and want

304
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,240
 to have lots and lots of sex, apparently.

305
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,120
 It's the comments of one of the athletes.

306
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,960
 Who I back to the pub?

307
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,840
 Yes, he was boring, but I couldn't have myself.

308
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,880
 No, he said--

309
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,880
 He says, "When a person is in various strengths like that,

310
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
 sex becomes a priority because naturally,

311
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,960
 we want to perpetuate the species we want to procreate."

312
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,840
 So it's like, we're in such trouble we're about to buy.

313
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,360
 We need to have kids quickly.

314
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,640
 That's what he said.

315
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,400
 Wow.

316
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,040
 OK.

317
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,160
 Madison's work considered so dangerous

318
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,040
 that they weren't supposed to happen again, weren't they?

319
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,880
 In 1902, the 1902 Olympics--

320
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
 I was in 1902.

321
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,240
 --in 1902 or Olympics.

322
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,120
 It was decided because it was so badly done that one guy--

323
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,040
 so the doctor's drove in front of them along this dust track.

324
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,960
 And like, you know what I mean?

325
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,280
 Oh, that's aphyxia space.

326
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,960
 One of them did run along collapse, had like a pulmonary failure

327
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,480
 or something.

328
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,640
 Collapse very nearly died because he'd inhaled so much dust.

329
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
 Another one, the guy who won in the end collapse

330
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,720
 and had to be picked up and was given a strictly, which

331
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,840
 is that pesticide that we now use on crops

332
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,120
 to try and simulate him and then some brown needs.

333
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,280
 Well, at that time, it was a useful stimulant

334
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,680
 that didn't do any of that, so he can--

335
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,160
 And then there was a guy who won initially, who

336
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,480
 was called someone's laws, who decided

337
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,720
 he couldn't hack it after about nine kilometers.

338
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,760
 And Jonathan a car passed by, waved all the other athletes,

339
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,880
 jumped out of the other end, sprinted to the finish line,

340
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,440
 the 50 hours.

341
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,160
 And one--

342
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,720
 --50 yards.

343
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
 And then--

344
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,360
 There was no one nearby, presumably,

345
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,080
 because I would stop a mile back, you know.

346
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,680
 I would just think--

347
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,920
 Well, when he claimed was, when he was taking his trophy

348
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,080
 and someone did say, by the way, I did see you

349
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,120
 drive most of the way.

350
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,520
 He did say he'd always been meaning to give it back.

351
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,280
 It was just a joke.

352
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,600
 But that is the kind of thing you'd--

353
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
 I'll claim this, and if no one said anything, that's 5'1."

354
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,520
 And if they do, I'll just say, I was kidding.

355
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,280
 Anyway, it was--

356
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,240
 Sounds strong, it was going to do that, wasn't it?

357
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
 It was just a joke, I mean.

358
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,560
 Have you heard of Rosa Ruiz?

359
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,760
 No.

360
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,280
 She won the 1980 Boston Marathon.

361
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,240
 She's 23-year-old New Yorker, and she was very, very fast.

362
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,640
 She was the third fastest time ever recorded

363
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,240
 for a female runner.

364
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,520
 And she was completely sweat free and composed

365
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,760
 when she crossed the finishing line.

366
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,960
 Car, obviously.

367
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,280
 No one saw her during the race.

368
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,480
 No other checkpoints.

369
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,040
 None of the other runners.

370
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,760
 Photographs of the race, she was nowhere.

371
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,480
 She was so fast, they couldn't get a little photos.

372
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,360
 She-- not Car, Subway.

373
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,560
 She just got Subway straight across.

374
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,240
 And doesn't count, though, if you're still running.

375
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,720
 While you take all of your cash, you ran to the Subway.

376
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,880
 Just kept it.

377
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,720
 That should count.

378
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
 Just on the spot.

379
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 Yeah.

380
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
 I was running.

381
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,440
 I just got corrected with it.

382
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,560
 But again, she just stood back in half a mile before the end,

383
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,960
 which seems very cocky.

384
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
 Yeah.

385
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,800
 Why don't you open in Subway?

386
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,880
 You have to run up a lot of stairs.

387
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,720
 I reckon that's more tiring.

388
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,880
 That would be tough.

389
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,800
 We've got to move on very soon to the next bag.

390
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,160
 Can I just quickly give a few Hong Kong things?

391
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,680
 Yeah.

392
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,720
 So because I'm born in race in Hong Kong.

393
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,520
 And--

394
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,240
 Can I bet money on a Hong Kong fact that you

395
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,200
 will say in the next 20 seconds?

396
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,120
 Oh, OK, yeah.

397
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,200
 I'm just wondering if there's a Hong Kong fact about Bruce Lee

398
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,080
 to follow?

399
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,840
 No, there's not.

400
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,640
 Oh, my God.

401
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,720
 Although there is a good Bruce Lee fact, but I'll tell you

402
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,560
 just to see how you've made it through.

403
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,880
 Why did I do it?

404
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,440
 He was the 1958 Cha Cha champion in Hong Kong.

405
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
 There he goes.

406
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,240
 How many people have it?

407
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
 How's he well?

408
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
 It's the perfect--

409
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,840
 Yeah, so one thing I discovered

410
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,040
 was that after the handover happened,

411
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,840
 there were a lot of things that the Chinese admitted

412
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,600
 to doing that they were sort of tripping the British colonialists

413
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,200
 about when they first arrived.

414
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,720
 And one thing was the names of places in Hong Kong.

415
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,280
 And I've been to a lot of these places,

416
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,520
 and I had no idea that their translations meant what they are.

417
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,000
 So for example, there's a place called Hisi one.

418
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,760
 So when the British were like, oh, what's this called?

419
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,560
 They went up, Hisi one.

420
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,800
 That translates as vagina discharge day--

421
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
 [LAUGHTER]

422
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
 The vagina discharge day.

423
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,880
 There's Nushi Wu, which is cow shit lake,

424
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,320
 and Dao Tao, which is penis head rock.

425
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
 It needs a bin on signs in Hong Kong for ages.

426
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,320
 And they started changing some.

427
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,280
 So foreign-devil sex organ is now dead.

428
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,560
 I've become pyramid rock.

429
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,840
 And all sex corner is now swimming dragon cape.

430
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,200
 Oh, that's really cool.

431
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,760
 I had no idea when I was there.

432
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,520
 Did you guys have any more that we--

433
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
 Oh, that's really welcome.

434
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,800
 OK, time for fact number two.

435
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,480
 And that is Chun Zinsky.

436
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,600
 Yep, my fact is that the meter is wrong.

437
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,760
 [LAUGHTER]

438
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,720
 Typical, I don't know.

439
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,680
 Every while everything's wrong, we come together.

440
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
 Yeah.

441
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
 I hate it.

442
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,840
 Why does that mean?

443
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,080
 So the meter-- it was determined that the meter--

444
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,800
 so in a guy called Pierre Mecha was a French astronomer.

445
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,600
 In the 1790s, he determined that they decided

446
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
 to go to a decimal system.

447
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,600
 And the meter would be the unit of the system.

448
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,440
 And it would be exactly 1/10 million of the distance

449
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,880
 between the equator and the North Pole.

450
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,880
 So he went on this big tour to measure

451
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,280
 our arcs of the Earth and stuff.

452
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,000
 And do calculations to what every meter was.

453
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,040
 And there was a slight error in his calculations.

454
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,840
 A slight problem was one of his bits of equipment.

455
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,440
 And he was 0.16 of a millimeter out for every meter.

456
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
 The meter we use now, he realized that he'd gone wrong.

457
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
 And so we tried to draw people's attention to it.

458
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,400
 But at that point, they were like, we've made all these

459
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,280
 like meter long sticks.

460
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,920
 We can't just go and make them.

461
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,160
 And so we just stayed that way.

462
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
 I mean, but that's so unscientific for how science usually works.

463
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,120
 Well, we've made them do that.

464
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,840
 It's just going to have to be it.

465
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,080
 Sorry, I have-- he went back to where he had made

466
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,240
 the original mistake later in his life.

467
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,360
 And he wanted to correct it, because on this campaign

468
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,800
 to get it corrected.

469
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,080
 And he got to where he made the mistake, where he caught

470
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,560
 malaria and died.

471
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,560
 So never check.

472
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,360
 You're working.

473
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
 He kept getting arrested, isn't he, when

474
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,080
 he was doing all this stuff, because it was during the revolution.

475
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,680
 People thought that his--

476
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,920
 what do you call these things?

477
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,400
 Instruments for weapons, don't they?

478
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,200
 Yeah.

479
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,280
 So it just kept them at prison, all of a sudden.

480
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,120
 Yeah.

481
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,640
 And it was-- but that was actually a good thing.

482
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
 Well, was it good or was it bad?

483
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,840
 It was when he was in prison, then he realized he'd got it wrong.

484
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,640
 He thought I've got nothing else.

485
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,680
 He just said, recheck my calculations.

486
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,520
 And when he did that, he realized it was wrong.

487
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,240
 But then it didn't do much good.

488
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,600
 So in fact, there was-- in 1875, there

489
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,360
 was the Treaty de la Metro, or the Treaty of the Metre,

490
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:14,880
 in France.

491
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 Thank you.

492
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
 Thank you.

493
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,640
 [LAUGHTER]

494
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,160
 So he'd meet 10 valuable minutes, though.

495
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,880
 [LAUGHTER]

496
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,120
 I was going to leave it, and I remember you were here.

497
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,200
 And that decided to consecrate his wrong meter

498
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,360
 into being the actual meter.

499
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,200
 So to say, actually, my chance meter is the proper meter.

500
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,640
 The meter is now going to be 1 meter and 0.6--

501
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,920
 1.6 millimeter long.

502
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,440
 And so they created a standard meter at this conference.

503
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,680
 So they had to create an exact replica of the wrong meter.

504
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,600
 But this time, say, this is now the right meter.

505
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,000
 But they can just take his wrong one

506
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,760
 and say, this is the standard meter,

507
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,560
 because that had been wrong, does that make sense?

508
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,760
 It didn't, but yeah.

509
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,760
 [LAUGHTER]

510
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,000
 I'm still on Treaty de la Metro.

511
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,480
 And so before this happened, in 18th century France,

512
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,600
 there were more than 250,000 different types

513
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,120
 of measurement in France.

514
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,880
 What?

515
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,440
 I know.

516
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,680
 How many people were there?

517
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,600
 Was it just different weights and measurements and--

518
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,640
 250,000.

519
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
 Yeah.

520
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,320
 It's a lot better than it.

521
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,080
 [LAUGHTER]

522
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,040
 They were totally, really arrogant when they wanted

523
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,400
 to go to the decimal system.

524
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,560
 And there were a lot of people saying,

525
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,080
 I can't believe you think you can just

526
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,760
 make the whole world abide by your ridiculous system.

527
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,240
 But obviously, they did.

528
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,760
 Japan went metric in 1924.

529
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,960
 And no one noticed or did anything about it.

530
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,440
 And they had to do it again.

531
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,360
 [LAUGHTER]

532
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,920
 Oh, my god.

533
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,120
 I think you have to strive to a few times.

534
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,480
 In 1960s, they were saying, let's do it.

535
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,840
 And they've just never got around to it.

536
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,320
 And now, because there are three countries

537
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,080
 that are metric, aren't there?

538
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,720
 So Burma, Liberia, and the US.

539
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,920
 But Burma is about to go imperial now.

540
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,720
 So it's about to just be US and Liberia.

541
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,240
 That's going to be metric, yeah.

542
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,080
 That's going to metric, sorry.

543
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
 Wasn't it just the Liberia?

544
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,640
 It had a very good luck, yeah.

545
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,880
 Wasn't there that great--

546
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
 I don't have a full fact.

547
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,000
 I hope you guys do, which is that.

548
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,280
 I'm not sure if that was complete the fact.

549
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,520
 [LAUGHTER]

550
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,760
 Mount Everest, when that was originally measured,

551
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,800
 what was it, 29,000 feet?

552
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,600
 Yeah.

553
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,560
 So it was the first to say it?

554
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,360
 Yeah, yeah, definitely.

555
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
 So they worked out exactly how tall it was.

556
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,240
 It was 29,000 feet.

557
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,920
 But they thought that if they put that as the actual number,

558
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,960
 people won't believe them.

559
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,480
 They think they would think they just rounded them up.

560
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,320
 And so they put an extra two feet on top.

561
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,440
 So they called it 29,000 and two feet.

562
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
 Yeah.

563
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,160
 Can you imagine?

564
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,960
 You've just done this incredible thing.

565
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,720
 You've measured the greatest mountain in the highest

566
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
 tallest mountain in the world.

567
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,200
 And it's a perfect number.

568
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,000
 And you can't tell them that it's high.

569
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,040
 Because you know when you will believe you.

570
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,720
 Poor guy.

571
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,760
 You must be like, can't fucking believe my love.

572
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,360
 That's nuts.

573
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,000
 I really like mistakes.

574
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,080
 I think history, definitely, some of the things

575
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,960
 that we find as an everyday thing, like the meter,

576
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,680
 is as a result of a mistake.

577
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,560
 One of the things that almost seems to have come out

578
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,520
 of being a mistake is phosphorus matches.

579
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,040
 The head of matches, the only reason--

580
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,440
 I mean, we may have got to it eventually,

581
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,520
 but the actual reason that we did end up getting to it

582
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,360
 is because a guy in 1675 called Henning Brand

583
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,560
 got obsessed with the idea that he could make gold

584
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,680
 by converting buckets of urine into gold.

585
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,720
 So he in his basement, he had 50 buckets of urine.

586
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,360
 Yeah, he went to a winner here.

587
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,800
 And it went up super, and it went up all taxi.

588
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,760
 And it just didn't at all go goldy.

589
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,520
 If he had a Cleveland, he must have had to have a look

590
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,480
 on every single bucket.

591
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
 Please, leave.

592
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,240
 [LAUGHTER]

593
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,440
 But so, but the weird byproduct of him doing this

594
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,680
 is that it actually lets--

595
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,520
 As I said, it's the tubs of urine.

596
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
 Yeah, all right.

597
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,800
 No, the tubs of urine did this waxy substance

598
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,160
 that he ended up having lit up when light was

599
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,000
 making contact with it, and they were going, what is it?

600
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,520
 And they realized this was a way of making fire.

601
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,400
 And so actually, each bucket became way more

602
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,360
 worth than gold.

603
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,200
 So he actually exceeded the amount of money

604
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,440
 that he would have made from turning that into gold.

605
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,280
 Exactly.

606
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,200
 If I shine a light, no, it's like setting light to it.

607
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,840
 All right, OK.

608
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
 OK.

609
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,560
 Do you know the first matches were a yard long?

610
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,080
 [LAUGHTER]

611
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
 Seriously, the first sold batches.

612
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,640
 And the guy who invented them sold 168 in something

613
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,400
 like three years, and they were a toy for rich people.

614
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,840
 And they were also incredibly dangerous.

615
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,480
 Because once you'd lit it, it was more like a home

616
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,440
 science kit almost.

617
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,720
 It wasn't a practical thing.

618
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,800
 But once you lit it, the globular flaming stuff

619
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,080
 had this amazing tendency to just fall to the ground

620
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,320
 and set fire to whatever you were standing on at the time.

621
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,280
 [LAUGHTER]

622
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,080
 I guess because they were very practice-aviding,

623
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,040
 actually, so one time--

624
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,720
 No, not under a yard long as well.

625
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,520
 That's taken two people.

626
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,120
 Yes.

627
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,880
 Yeah.

628
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,920
 Good for bonding, maybe that's how they did it.

629
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
 Yeah, people.

630
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
 [LAUGHTER]

631
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,160
 OK, you know, I don't know.

632
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,640
 Before the 19th century, there was a unit of measurement

633
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,520
 which was called a lot.

634
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
 How many was that?

635
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
 It was about--

636
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
 Not very much.

637
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,520
 I thought it wasn't.

638
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,160
 It was the 30th of a pound, so it was not a lot.

639
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,960
 That's great.

640
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,400
 The word acre used to mean an open field

641
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,960
 of no particular measurement.

642
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,480
 [LAUGHTER]

643
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,880
 And yard comes from--

644
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,320
 Saxons used to wear like a girl.

645
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,120
 It comes from the same origin as girls, doesn't it?

646
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,840
 Because they're a belt that people used to wear,

647
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,280
 and then they take it off to measure something

648
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,200
 when they needed to know it's speculating as to what--

649
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
 and--

650
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,160
 [LAUGHTER]

651
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
 Oh, nice.

652
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,760
 Some people understood.

653
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,360
 How big is this?

654
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,960
 [LAUGHTER]

655
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
 So there are some other videos of measurement.

656
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,880
 The gun-- you'll know the gun.

657
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 No.

658
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,600
 The gun is a unit of measurement that measures space sickness.

659
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,320
 And it's named after-- he was the first US politician

660
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,200
 to go into space, actually.

661
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,440
 It was named after Senator Jake Gone, who

662
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,840
 was so sick during his space mission,

663
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,880
 but now it's meant one gun is considered very space sick.

664
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,640
 That's great.

665
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,680
 That's like the mini-Hellin.

666
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
 That's not--

667
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,240
 The mini-Hellin is the amount of beauty

668
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,720
 you need to launch one ship.

669
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,960
 [LAUGHTER]

670
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,560
 It's weird.

671
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,880
 Lots of units of measurement that we have are quite similar.

672
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,920
 So there's a Japanese measure we've called--

673
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,760
 I'll mispronounce this--

674
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,600
 but Kaniyaku, it's an obscure one, as in it's not used any more.

675
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,040
 But it's about the same as an English foot.

676
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,720
 And both of those things are about the same length

677
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,440
 as the average man's foot.

678
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,400
 So it's a sort of common origin for lots of these things.

679
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,200
 It's quite cool.

680
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
 Like the qubit is the distance from it.

681
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
 What is it?

682
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,360
 Your elbow to the beginning of your hand.

683
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,840
 So you would send out someone with a big to buy cloth

684
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,320
 in the future engine.

685
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,080
 Because they will be able to get more cloth for their money,

686
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,040
 because they have bigger arms.

687
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,120
 It's just one guy with a really massive arm.

688
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,920
 Yeah, it's one more that would have you done.

689
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 Yeah.

690
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,700
 It's amazing that we took so long to get

691
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,200
 to the fact that all humans are different sizes.

692
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,920
 We can't base a measurement system with one big human body.

693
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,360
 There's one called a Pietroa, which is Shalamine introduced.

694
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,640
 And it was supposedly the size of his foot.

695
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,160
 It wasn't.

696
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,040
 It was a human, just trying to understand those things.

697
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,480
 But-- so it was bigger than his foot, so small than his foot.

698
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,920
 I don't know.

699
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,240
 I don't know what size of his foot was,

700
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,840
 but I also don't know what size of the thing was.

701
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,480
 So it could be, actually.

702
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
 Yeah.

703
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,560
 I think it was.

704
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,120
 You know what I said, then, with indeterminate size feet.

705
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,840
 [LAUGHTER]

706
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,320
 Can I just say very quickly, just as a side note,

707
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,760
 every time that we've said, oh, what's that called?

708
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,160
 Someone from the crowd has called that.

709
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,680
 You're going to get this at any other comedy

710
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,280
 days for the audience of treating it like a pub quiz.

711
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,120
 [LAUGHTER]

712
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
 Are you hearing that?

713
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,680
 Yeah, can you not hear it all the time?

714
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,720
 Every time.

715
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,600
 What is it now?

716
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,920
 Listen out, or be there.

717
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,080
 Just going to be the carrot.

718
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
 I just was kind of interesting.

719
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,640
 The carrot measurement for diamonds

720
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,040
 is from carrot seeds, because they thought people

721
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,280
 used to think they're all carrot seeds,

722
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,880
 where, in fact, as they were announced, so they don't say them out.

723
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,320
 Like, who was it?

724
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,160
 Was it Bob who weighed out of 60 coffee beans for each double coffee

725
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,800
 drink, or you get started in way like half of the milk?

726
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,720
 Yeah, it was one of them.

727
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,520
 It was Bob.

728
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,400
 It was whoever wrote the coffee cantata, which I think was Bob.

729
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,120
 He wrote the whole thing in praise of coffee.

730
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,200
 Who was it?

731
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
 No.

732
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,120
 I'm throwing out of the coffee beans, Bob wrote the coffee cantata.

733
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,880
 Fucking told you.

734
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,400
 [LAUGHTER]

735
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:02,880
 Guys, we're going to have to move on to our next stage.

736
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,840
 This is Bob.

737
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
 [LAUGHTER]

738
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
 And the next fact comes from that lady in the audience.

739
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
 [LAUGHTER]

740
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,680
 OK, so I'm from fact number three, and that is James.

741
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,640
 OK, my fact this week is that St. Andrews Aquarium

742
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,000
 has three mircats called Churchill, Admiral, and Sheila's Wheels.

743
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,760
 [LAUGHTER]

744
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,000
 I love that Sheila's Wheels Mircan.

745
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,640
 They also had a Viva and Direct Line, but they both died.

746
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,520
 [LAUGHTER]

747
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,200
 Because I was doing the credit cards.

748
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
 [LAUGHTER]

749
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,240
 Oh, yeah, mircats.

750
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
 And funny names.

751
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
 Why?

752
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,000
 The very question, first of all, does an Aquarium have

753
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,600
 mircats?

754
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,680
 Because they realize there's no such thing as a bitch.

755
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
 [LAUGHTER]

756
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,480
 [APPLAUSE]

757
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,440
 They had this little bit-- it's a brilliant aquarium, by the way,

758
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,400
 but they had this little bit of rock where they didn't

759
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,920
 have anything to put there.

760
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,400
 And so they got offered some mircats when they got to do it.

761
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,920
 And I said, yeah, great.

762
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,240
 Mircats, why not?

763
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,360
 Everyone was big, huh?

764
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,880
 So you actually--

765
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,240
 I was there this week, and that's how you found this out.

766
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,560
 Yeah, did you know the mircats?

767
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,080
 I did.

768
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,120
 Meet the mircats.

769
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,320
 And Beth, what do you call these things?

770
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,600
 Penguins.

771
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,640
 [LAUGHTER]

772
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,400
 And saw all the different fish?

773
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,240
 Yeah, it's great.

774
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,880
 Really, really go.

775
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,760
 Definitely recommend it.

776
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
 So why are they-- why are they named there?

777
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,200
 Oh, so they were named by someone on Facebook,

778
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,320
 and they thought they were such great names that would name them that.

779
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,440
 And wait, they know there are existing names, don't they?

780
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
 That's a mircats.

781
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,040
 Yeah, no.

782
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,240
 They were allowed to name them.

783
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,040
 They were born there, and they were allowed to name them.

784
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,280
 And my head admiral has a tiny jacket with her full length.

785
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,640
 And they're made to occult Kate and Will's,

786
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,440
 and the others are named after members

787
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
 of the Royal Family as well.

788
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,320
 And they have a penguin who is called Andy Murray.

789
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,040
 Yeah, they do, and it's a female.

790
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,560
 And all the other penguins are named after the Murray Family.

791
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,360
 They're not your family.

792
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,120
 That's the tennis player.

793
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,720
 Interesting, we've heard that the mircats are named after Kate and Will's,

794
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,480
 because mircats, too, are threatened by inbreeding.

795
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,280
 [LAUGHTER]

796
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:17,520
 [APPLAUSE]

797
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,040
 So mircats, as when they're fighting,

798
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,480
 they line up in a line, and then just charge at each other.

799
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,000
 Really?

800
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,080
 Yeah, like a horizontal line, like a key.

801
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,160
 Like a horizontal line.

802
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,880
 And so it's like one against the other one.

803
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,800
 And they just charge into each other.

804
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,560
 And that is how naval warships fall.

805
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,600
 Yeah, it's at the other side.

806
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,440
 So presumably, admiral fights each other.

807
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,440
 [LAUGHTER]

808
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,080
 And one way they start from fighting each other

809
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,640
 is because they get a lot of their thing from scent.

810
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,640
 They rub a big spaper rub on the mircats,

811
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,920
 because then they can't smell each other,

812
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,000
 and they don't get angry with each other.

813
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,040
 But they also come smell who's related to them.

814
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,560
 No, but that's a good thing.

815
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,040
 Because they recently had one mircat who was completely

816
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,120
 segregated, they just were like, we don't want you.

817
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
 And they named the mircat Oliver Twist,

818
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,000
 because he was orphaned.

819
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,120
 And one of the guys there had to look after Oliver Twist.

820
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,360
 And that was the sentence.

821
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,560
 He said, we're going to completely cover them and fix--

822
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,320
 What's up with them?

823
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,840
 Becker rub.

824
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,360
 Becker rub.

825
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,560
 And we're going to cover him as well.

826
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,600
 And that will allow them back into the group,

827
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,680
 because they won't know that he wasn't smelling the same

828
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,160
 as us.

829
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,680
 But I just reminded me of a brilliant thing

830
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,480
 that I read this week.

831
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,840
 You'll have all read out a show, a new scientist,

832
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,800
 which is that when you shake someone's hand,

833
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,480
 you smell your hand afterwards, because you're

834
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,160
 trying to get the sense of the person that you shook hands with.

835
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,280
 And all humans have been doing this forever,

836
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,080
 and no one's ever noticed.

837
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,160
 [LAUGHTER]

838
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,560
 Not me.

839
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,600
 I can assure you I don't do that.

840
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,000
 And they videoed a lot of the people in their room

841
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,880
 shaking hands, and counted how often they were touching their faces

842
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,600
 around them, nose and mouth.

843
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,960
 And it was a certain number.

844
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,720
 And when they shook hands, it always went up.

845
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,360
 It's amazing.

846
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,840
 I think it's on your face.

847
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,240
 I've been watching my boyfriend do it over the weekend.

848
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,280
 We've found various instances.

849
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,520
 We've like played a board game, shake hands after them.

850
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
 And then I've watched him.

851
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,400
 And he holds his nose up to shake hands with me,

852
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
 which I've not taken this good side.

853
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,200
 [LAUGHTER]

854
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,000
 On Mircats, there's the only animal we've observed

855
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,720
 is hyperfast, who we've seen employing proper teaching

856
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,280
 methods to teach their young how to hunt.

857
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,680
 So because they hunt individually,

858
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,000
 you can't-- the young can't just follow their parents around

859
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,880
 and see how they hunt.

860
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,760
 So the parents bring back dead animals

861
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,440
 and then explain to their kids how to dismember them.

862
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,120
 And the other thing Mircats mothers do

863
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,480
 is they kill the children of other Mircats mothers,

864
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,200
 so that those mothers will breastfeed their own children

865
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,400
 so that they can go out and have fun.

866
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,680
 Nice guys.

867
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,400
 So they turn that mother into a baby

868
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,680
 because she's lactating anyway.

869
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,240
 So she'll be like, OK, you can look out for my kids

870
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
 and I'll kill the girls.

871
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,600
 I'm going to go out on the couch.

872
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,640
 They are horrible.

873
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,160
 They're not good pets, apparently,

874
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,880
 according to some websites.

875
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
 Because they can be very cruel to each other,

876
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,320
 aggressive to the people they don't know.

877
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,320
 They smell quite ferretty.

878
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,480
 [LAUGHTER]

879
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,000
 Like you do me a hammer?

880
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,800
 [LAUGHTER]

881
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,000
 I was reading about aquariums.

882
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,200
 And I read about London's very first aquarium,

883
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,240
 which was the Royal Aquarium.

884
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,200
 I was heard about the Royal Aquarium.

885
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,240
 It was basically 1903--

886
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,240
 I'm sorry, just before 1903, because it

887
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,760
 was pulled down in 1903.

888
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,880
 It had huge tanks.

889
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,840
 It was ginormous, simple.

890
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,960
 And the reason it was pulled down and didn't do so well

891
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,160
 is that all of these dine tanks contained no fish.

892
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,960
 [LAUGHTER]

893
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,200
 They were completely empty.

894
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,680
 Because they marketed it as having sea life.

895
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,920
 So they needed salt water.

896
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,880
 And they realized how extensive that was.

897
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,240
 And they couldn't afford to actually put the right amount

898
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,720
 of water in there with the relevant fish.

899
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,960
 So people used to come and just look at tanks of water.

900
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,320
 I read the promise at one day that they would be fishing them.

901
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
 I don't think that was the first one.

902
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,960
 Because the first one I think was at London Zoo,

903
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,760
 which would have been-- where did you say your source?

904
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,520
 1903, I was saying that.

905
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,480
 London Zoo's open to the mid 19th century.

906
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,440
 And it was called the Aquarium.

907
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,960
 But it used to be called Aquavirarium, which is a cool name.

908
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,720
 And an aquarium was originally a watering place for cattle.

909
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,400
 So you see sometimes troughs where people used to let

910
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,640
 their horses and cows drink.

911
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,280
 And it has aquarium written on it.

912
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,920
 And it looks like the West Aquarium in the world,

913
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,320
 but it's not.

914
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,960
 So did they call it Aquavirarium?

915
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,360
 So it's not to be confused and have cattle turn up.

916
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,920
 I'm hoping for a drink.

917
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,120
 And then they had this thing called Aquarium media.

918
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,400
 Have you heard of this?

919
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
 This is so cool.

920
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,200
 That's right.

921
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,840
 So there was a guy called Philip Henry Goss or Gosser.

922
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,480
 We can edit that as a progrif.

923
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,800
 And he was one of the pioneers of basically allowing fish

924
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,760
 to survive, whether--

925
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,400
 [LAUGHTER]

926
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,520
 Basically, everyone went, they were killing all fish.

927
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,880
 And he was like, no, this is wrong.

928
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,800
 We should likely survive.

929
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:06,600
 He came up with a system whereby you could keep fish in a tank

930
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,960
 and they would get enough oxygen and he'd eat plants in there.

931
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,760
 And he'd eat it, yeah.

932
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,680
 Got it, and then.

933
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,200
 But suddenly, everyone started getting aquariums.

934
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,640
 So people got them set into their windows, some people,

935
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,680
 or put into shender liars, just hanging from the ceiling.

936
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,040
 Some people built a bird cage into an aquarium.

937
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,360
 So there would be a bird living in there surrounded by fish,

938
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,400
 which it could never eat.

939
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,920
 [LAUGHTER]

940
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,240
 That's what you're talking about.

941
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,360
 Yeah, they've made a like trainer into an aquarium

942
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,480
 like design as well.

943
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
 Oh.

944
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,880
 It's they transformed into--

945
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,600
 I don't know how functional it is as a trainer anymore,

946
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,360
 but it looks really cool if you look it up.

947
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,680
 It's the paper and into the--

948
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,120
 Well, in the face of the shoe, do you mean?

949
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,480
 The whole shoe is an aquarium.

950
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
 So it's round the edge of the shoe to fill the water

951
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,680
 and put some fish in.

952
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,680
 That's incredible.

953
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,680
 That's high.

954
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
 Yeah.

955
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,680
 Oh, that's weird.

956
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,680
 Also, there's the world's smallest aquariums in there that's--

957
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
 Small of them.

958
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,680
 Is that not it?

959
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
 Yeah.

960
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
 It's not even a full shoe.

961
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
 That's a heel.

962
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,680
 I think this one is 24 millimeters high.

963
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
 Right.

964
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,480
 So it's for several fish.

965
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,080
 It's this guy, Anatoly Kamenko, who just designed--

966
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
 he's a designer.

967
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,440
 His job is designing tiny things.

968
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,480
 And so he's created the world's smallest book.

969
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,360
 And that's what it's the work for human hair.

970
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,360
 Is it advice on how to keep your new zebrafish?

971
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,360
 [LAUGHTER]

972
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
 Just a few things.

973
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
 I'll just go on.

974
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,360
 I was just going to say, did anyone see the giant male octopus

975
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
 this week that was trying to escape from its aquariums?

976
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

977
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,160
 Does anyone read what the aquarium is an aquarium in Seattle?

978
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,360
 The aquarium, I don't know if you've ever said.

979
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,360
 So the octopus was crawled up the sides of its aquarium

980
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,840
 and it's clutched at the outside.

981
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,360
 And it's got some of its tentacles on the outside

982
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,960
 and it's trying to get over.

983
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,960
 And aquarium officials say the octopus named ink

984
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,360
 was not attempting a jailbreak, but simply

985
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,840
 learning to embrace his new home with all eight arms.

986
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,040
 It was not in the saber term.

987
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,200
 They said, well, it's putting the lid back on to you.

988
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,400
 [LAUGHTER]

989
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,720
 So some things about name changes and product

990
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,760
 placements and stuff like that.

991
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,280
 Oh, yeah.

992
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,360
 So Aussie Royal Spotball, Gary Hocking,

993
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,480
 changed his name by Pete Paul to Whiskers one year,

994
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,720
 because he was paid a lot of money by that.

995
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,640
 And he was a tongue-in-rubbi star, Epitoyoni,

996
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,120
 who changes his name to Patti Power.

997
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,320
 And you can change your name of your stadium and stuff.

998
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,600
 But it doesn't always work out.

999
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,560
 The MLS side Colorado Rapids has changed their stadium

1000
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,680
 to Dick's Spotting Goods Park, but everyone calls it the Dick.

1001
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1002
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,720
 And like, changing your name by Pete Paul as well,

1003
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,840
 I like all that kind of stuff.

1004
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,640
 So there was a guy called Gary Brett from Potter's Bar.

1005
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,040
 [LAUGHTER]

1006
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,600
 He was as broad a change that they'd do

1007
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,640
 on his bar before him.

1008
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,440
 He changed his name to Mr. Hong Kong Fui, OK?

1009
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,240
 And he said, I've loved Hong Kong Fui since I was a boy.

1010
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,240
 And I always wanted to be named up then.

1011
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
 I'm quite serious.

1012
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,000
 I'm a bit of a sad child.

1013
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,760
 I'm quite serious about being known as Mr. Fui.

1014
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,840
 My wife was a bit upset, but she should

1015
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,520
 be honored to be married to a number one super guy

1016
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,000
 who's quicker than the human life.

1017
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 [LAUGHTER]

1018
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,960
 And then there was a guy called Nigel Dyle, who

1019
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,680
 changed his name to Mr. Toasted's T-Cakes, OK?

1020
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,680
 And he said, some people can't believe it, especially,

1021
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
 because I don't even like T-Cakes that much.

1022
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1023
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,080
 That was a nice name.

1024
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,800
 It must be so hard if you love stupid names

1025
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,480
 that you've got to go to the--

1026
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
 What's the name, Charlie?

1027
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,560
 The Dean's Hole.

1028
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,720
 And you must be in the queue going, OK, this time,

1029
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,000
 it's just going to be Brian Smith, the name of the Brian Smith.

1030
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,600
 And you're saying, hi to the guy in front of you.

1031
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,840
 Oh, what are you changing your name to?

1032
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,880
 Oh, rainbow sunshine moon does.

1033
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,120
 You're going down there.

1034
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,280
 And you get home to your wife.

1035
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,960
 She's like, is it Brian Smith?

1036
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,120
 It's asked my cadang, dang, dang, dang.

1037
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,320
 I couldn't help myself.

1038
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,520
 It must be so hard if you love a name.

1039
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,400
 At least a good no marriage to a number one super guy.

1040
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,600
 There's a guy called Sean Hennessy, who

1041
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,960
 changes his name to Nigel Bottomface

1042
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,120
 to win a bet with his friends.

1043
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,640
 And he said, my mum was furious.

1044
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,680
 But at least I got a Nite out in Chelmswood.

1045
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,440
 [LAUGHTER]

1046
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,720
 You're the sad life there.

1047
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,960
 We're going to have to move on, but do you want to go?

1048
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,360
 Oh, I've got some funny stuff on advertising.

1049
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,840
 OK, so the Churchill dog, as the one of the fidget school

1050
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,480
 Churchill, as the fact, the Churchill dog was initially

1051
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,760
 a real bulldog called Lucas, who had to be sacked off the one

1052
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,760
 handbook, because he refused to hold a phone in his mouth.

1053
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,080
 He refused.

1054
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
 Oh no.

1055
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
 [LAUGHTER]

1056
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:58,400
 Oh, we are going to have to move on.

1057
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,680
 I'm going to have to move it on.

1058
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,680
 So we move on to our final fact to the evening.

1059
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,960
 And that is my fact.

1060
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,280
 And my fact this week is that the only ancient Egyptian

1061
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,200
 socks that we know of all belonged to Tutankhamun.

1062
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,700
 Is that awesome?

1063
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,720
 When Howard Carter went into the tomb,

1064
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,400
 he found a lot of stuff, a lot of gold, a lot of walking

1065
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,920
 sticks, and he found three pairs of socks.

1066
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,800
 And what's amazing is that up until finding these socks,

1067
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,560
 there had been no depiction of socks in ancient Egypt,

1068
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,440
 whatsoever.

1069
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,520
 And I can't believe that that wasn't the headline.

1070
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,400
 They wore socks.

1071
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,760
 Also, because he wore sandals.

1072
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,960
 It means that he was a socks-and-sandals fan.

1073
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,360
 Which is very exciting.

1074
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,080
 Do you normally have painted on the bottom of his sandals?

1075
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,240
 No, this is cool.

1076
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,120
 He had the faces of his enemies painted on the bottom.

1077
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,880
 So wherever he walked, he would be crushing them

1078
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,520
 into the dust.

1079
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,000
 Yes, but except there was a lot of sand.

1080
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,320
 So that would just be great branding.

1081
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,880
 Because you'd see the heart of everyone.

1082
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,480
 That's like the ultimate marketing trend.

1083
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,440
 It's like you, Tim Collins and me.

1084
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,720
 Yeah, they have that.

1085
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,240
 So there was some socks that I think those weren't found intact

1086
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,200
 where they were reconstructed from the evidence

1087
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,040
 that they had, but that all the socks found intact.

1088
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,080
 No, no, no, sorry.

1089
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,960
 In his tomb, they found three that were completely intact.

1090
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,120
 And then they found three that weren't.

1091
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,560
 But they think that they must have been socks.

1092
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,720
 They were the other pairs.

1093
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,400
 Yeah.

1094
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,320
 So he actually had six pairs, but three

1095
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,560
 didn't make the 3,000-year period of time as his past.

1096
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,200
 In fact, they also found a bottle of perfume

1097
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,040
 speaking of the 3,000-year period of time,

1098
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,920
 which still when they took the lid off, it still smelled.

1099
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,960
 I think it smelled like something rotten.

1100
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
 Oh, I know.

1101
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,400
 It smelled like a chamomile of vanilla or something.

1102
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,200
 Oh, it's 3,000 years.

1103
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,560
 He was also buried with his own baby clothes,

1104
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,080
 which I think is quite sweet.

1105
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,800
 Yeah, I wonder why.

1106
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,320
 There was actually a few toys.

1107
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,440
 Weirdly, there was a boomerang.

1108
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
 Yeah.

1109
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,000
 Well, they used the dump and they used lassoos as well.

1110
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,520
 Did they?

1111
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,320
 Yeah.

1112
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,840
 Yeah.

1113
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
 Cool, isn't it?

1114
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,960
 It's Australia.

1115
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,920
 Yes.

1116
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,120
 It's the thing with the mirror where we call this India.

1117
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
 And we just--

1118
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,720
 It does sound like the outback from--

1119
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,480
 Yeah.

1120
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,200
 Wow.

1121
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,000
 And he was buried with 413, what we're called,

1122
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,360
 shabby figures.

1123
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,120
 And these were little slaves that he would take

1124
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,000
 into the next life.

1125
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,080
 Because often people think they, if you were the slave

1126
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,640
 of a pharaoh and your pharaoh died,

1127
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,240
 then you'd have to kill yourself and be buried with him.

1128
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,600
 Or be buried with him, which is even worse, but that never

1129
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,100
 happened.

1130
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,440
 It was actually a little model of the use that you would use.

1131
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,360
 He was also buried with James as telling me an erection.

1132
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,120
 [LAUGHTER]

1133
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
 That was a compliment.

1134
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,960
 That was something, you know.

1135
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,440
 [LAUGHTER]

1136
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,280
 Yeah.

1137
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,160
 He had a 90 degree erection of that.

1138
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,000
 90 degree erection.

1139
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,560
 And he's the only known pharaoh, as far as I know,

1140
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,680
 who was buried that way.

1141
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
 No one really knows him.

1142
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,240
 And James has studied the field extensively.

1143
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,800
 There was a guy called George Glitten, who

1144
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,560
 was going to unwrap a mummy in front of a lot of people.

1145
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,880
 He was a bit of a shouts, and he didn't have a mummy.

1146
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,400
 And he was going to unwrap them.

1147
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,280
 And he said it was a princess mummy.

1148
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,440
 And he claimed that he knew that.

1149
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,560
 He knew her identity, she was a doctrine of Egyptian priests.

1150
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,040
 He knew that because of the side of the hieroglyphics

1151
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,800
 on her sarcophagus.

1152
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,600
 And then he unwrapped to unwrap to unwrap to him

1153
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,160
 in front of a lot of people.

1154
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,280
 And then they realized, actually, that it was a man.

1155
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,160
 The princess had a rather large penis.

1156
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,560
 That's where we get a pharaoh to from.

1157
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,600
 The princess and the penis.

1158
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:37,440
 It was embossed in this.

1159
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,080
 And he explained that his era was due to the poor handwriting

1160
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,160
 of the sideophagus.

1161
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,560
 A bad Egyptologist always blames the hieroglyphs.

1162
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,640
 That's funny.

1163
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,680
 Have you had a mummy petigrew?

1164
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,880
 What mummy petigrew was a guy called Thomas Petigrew.

1165
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,680
 And he was just unrolled loads of mummies all the time.

1166
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,840
 He was an Egyptologist.

1167
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,840
 And he unrolled 14 of them.

1168
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,440
 And he would do a six-part lecture series.

1169
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,480
 And he would always save the unrolling for the very last lecture

1170
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,040
 in the series to build up to it.

1171
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,600
 Throughout it, I just found one sentence about it,

1172
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,080
 which I wanted to share, which is that Petigrew's dramatic,

1173
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,160
 erotically tinge unrollings became so popular

1174
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,280
 that at one gathering, the Archbishop of Canterbury

1175
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,560
 himself got squeezed out of the room.

1176
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:31,280
 And then later on, he was asked to turn a Victorian duke

1177
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,160
 into a mummy.

1178
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,920
 The Duke of Helton was obsessed with mummies.

1179
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,600
 And he said, will you mummify me after I die?

1180
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,120
 I did, yeah, yeah.

1181
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,160
 And he did it.

1182
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,920
 But unfortunately, he didn't fit in the sarcophagus he'd had built.

1183
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,800
 So they had to take off his feet.

1184
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,600
 Oh, yeah.

1185
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
 Yeah.

1186
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,840
 Well, they were excavating the Tudon Cummings clothes.

1187
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,240
 No, actually this was later on when they decided

1188
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,600
 to recreate all his clothes.

1189
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,760
 Then the person who was recreating them

1190
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,400
 decided to tell her students, so the anyway,

1191
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,280
 they could work out exactly how it worn them

1192
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,800
 was by trying them all on himself themselves.

1193
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,040
 So the students of this archeologist

1194
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,760
 got to just try and all Tudon Cummings clothes.

1195
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,280
 And they worked out that something they thought

1196
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,360
 was a head dress was actually a pair of these things

1197
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,280
 to be worn, the arms to form the wings of a falcon.

1198
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
 Oh, absolutely.

1199
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,320
 I don't know how you work that out.

1200
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,640
 And it sounds a bit like they were just pissing it out.

1201
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,840
 The head dress on their arm was made from ribbons.

1202
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,880
 He was a very strange shape.

1203
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,200
 I think he had a Tudon Cummings.

1204
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
 All right.

1205
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,360
 I think he had a congenital disease or something,

1206
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,520
 because his hip measurements were extremely

1207
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,040
 loved.

1208
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
 It was sort of out of proportion with the rest of his body.

1209
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,760
 And we don't know why.

1210
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,120
 Well, much like Kate's and Will's.

1211
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,160
 It was inbreeding.

1212
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,440
 I'm talking about the fear of that.

1213
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,920
 The fear of perhaps Kate and Will's.

1214
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,240
 No, his parents were brother and sister.

1215
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,280
 Yeah.

1216
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,680
 I really like the-- so when you were saying

1217
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,480
 the thing of unwrapping the mummies,

1218
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,400
 that was a massive craze that the Victorians went through,

1219
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,240
 where they suddenly were just digging up lots of mummies

1220
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,400
 and using them, virtually everything.

1221
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,360
 Railroads used to use them as fuel.

1222
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,440
 No, that's much.

1223
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,400
 I promise, that's not so.

1224
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,240
 I was in America.

1225
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,320
 Oh, but Mark Twain said that they did.

1226
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,800
 And we think he was taken to Mickey.

1227
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,320
 Oh, OK.

1228
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
 Yeah.

1229
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,760
 So how about the time traveler guy

1230
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,960
 who went to King Arthur's Court?

1231
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
 That's not a--

1232
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,800
 [LAUGHTER]

1233
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,960
 I've got some terrible news going

1234
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,440
 about Phil and Ted Spokas journey.

1235
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,240
 [LAUGHTER]

1236
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,240
 How about mummy brown?

1237
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
 Is that true?

1238
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,120
 I think that's true.

1239
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,320
 Mummy brown is amazing.

1240
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,200
 Mummy brown was, if you haven't heard of it,

1241
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,920
 is a-- it was a paint that artists would use.

1242
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,640
 It was ground up mummy that would lead to a brown.

1243
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,120
 And they would use them on their paintings.

1244
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,920
 And a lot of people didn't.

1245
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,120
 They just thought it was a cute name.

1246
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,680
 And then someone explained, no, it's an actual mummy.

1247
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,240
 And a lot of famous artists actually got quite disturbed by that.

1248
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,840
 And buried the rest of the paint, giving it an honorable burial.

1249
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,680
 But they just thought, well, there's a lot of stuff

1250
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,400
 about persons going on in fact, then.

1251
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,360
 And they didn't want that.

1252
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,440
 But yeah, you get paints.

1253
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,160
 I can't believe that.

1254
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,960
 It's extraordinary.

1255
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,760
 And they used it as a panacea as well

1256
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,640
 that they would use this mummy.

1257
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,240
 And then they would take it as a medicine for any illness.

1258
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,320
 I think they used it.

1259
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,080
 People in fees used it until the 20th century

1260
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,160
 to heal bruises, which is amazingly cafeteria considering.

1261
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,800
 It's just a bruise.

1262
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
 Yeah.

1263
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,320
 Yeah, why don't you don't need to heal bruises?

1264
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,720
 You could get an imitation mummy as well,

1265
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
 if you didn't have the real thing.

1266
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,200
 And so you would, here's the ingredients.

1267
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,480
 Take the carcass of a young man, some say red-haired,

1268
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,240
 not dying of a disease.

1269
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,840
 Let it live for 24 hours in clean water, cut the flesh into pieces,

1270
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,520
 and add a little allow and invite for 24 hours

1271
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,920
 in the spirit of wine and turpentine.

1272
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,560
 It doesn't sound artificial to me.

1273
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,560
 Sounds real.

1274
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,200
 It's real, but not old.

1275
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
 OK.

1276
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,200
 Yeah.

1277
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,320
 I was looking at very interesting, very old sites and very old rituals.

1278
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,320
 But so the Vikings, they were buried on ships.

1279
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,640
 I was even not at sea.

1280
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,480
 And I read a really interesting theory

1281
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,400
 that because they were often buried with decapitated animals.

1282
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,160
 So the Osberg, Osberg Viking ship is one of the most famous Viking ships

1283
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,760
 that's been on Earth.

1284
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,680
 It was this woman.

1285
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,840
 She was buried with ten decapitated horses.

1286
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,720
 And I think a couple of decapitated dogs.

1287
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,280
 And they think this is because they have the ships on land.

1288
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,520
 But to get to the underworld, you have to sail.

1289
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,160
 It was in order to create a convenient river of blood

1290
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,960
 from your decapitated horses on which you could sail to the underworld.

1291
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,960
 Wow.

1292
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,280
 Grotesque.

1293
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,280
 And also, so the first evidence of a ritual burial

1294
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,720
 is from 28,000 years ago, of a burial where

1295
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,520
 people were sort of buried with items.

1296
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,120
 And it seemed like they believed in an afterlife.

1297
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,080
 And it was two young boys.

1298
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,080
 And they were buried with mammoth tusks over two years long.

1299
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,520
 But they'd been straightened.

1300
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,040
 And we don't know how they straightened them.

1301
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,960
 So we think they'd boiled them and then straighten the mammoth tusks

1302
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,440
 into a four feet long and just straight tusks.

1303
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,760
 I trade my will as soon as I get it.

1304
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,480
 That's what I want.

1305
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,600
 And I'm ten decapitated horses and straightened the mammoth tusks.

1306
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,280
 I read a thing that I want as well, for deaf, which is that.

1307
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,720
 I was reading that.

1308
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,240
 It's weird when you read like someone's deaf.

1309
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,280
 You're like, whoa, I want that.

1310
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,800
 It sounded really cool.

1311
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,160
 Utsi, who was the oldest iceman that we found.

1312
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,480
 He was made by Utsi, I don't know what period he was from.

1313
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,760
 But he was complete.

1314
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,000
 And they found everything on him.

1315
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,360
 They found a bag which had magic mushrooms in it.

1316
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,000
 They found he had shoes.

1317
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,600
 He had socks.

1318
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,520
 He had socks.

1319
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,680
 But what's amazing is that they found them complete.

1320
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,080
 And what they don't point out is that they

1321
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,040
 have found other people who are complete.

1322
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,520
 But Utsi's a rare case because he was just a whole thing.

1323
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,040
 Sorry?

1324
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,600
 Let's see.

1325
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,680
 Let's see.

1326
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,720
 Not the Q&A.

1327
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,800
 [LAUGHTER]

1328
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,680
 Thank you, though.

1329
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,280
 Again, it was like, kind of the heckles.

1330
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,280
 At John Wers, it's like, you're shit.

1331
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,040
 Arcroud.

1332
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,040
 Utsi, dickhead.

1333
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,080
 [LAUGHTER]

1334
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,400
 Do I say it right?

1335
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,320
 Let's see.

1336
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,320
 So Utsi was found as a full body.

1337
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,640
 But then I read about these other deaths,

1338
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,880
 where they found other people.

1339
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,280
 And basically, because of the way that tectonics and just

1340
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,640
 the way that things shift, they found full bodies.

1341
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,160
 But people have been splattered and cartoonified.

1342
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,200
 You know, at the end of Roger Rabbit, where he splattered,

1343
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,480
 because it's a long form?

1344
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,360
 They found people that are like just fully

1345
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,640
 like huge humans in a huge world.

1346
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,960
 Like a bit of pressed flowers.

1347
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,720
 Yeah, like some of the pressed humans.

1348
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,000
 And that's how I want to go.

1349
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,720
 [LAUGHTER]

1350
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,640
 Which is what's great, what's going on?

1351
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,640
 We're going to have to wrap up in a couple more minutes.

1352
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,560
 Is there anything else you guys want to add?

1353
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,040
 1/3 of the world's socks are made in a single city in China.

1354
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,760
 The way.

1355
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,520
 Yeah, the way.

1356
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,560
 That's how it's called.

1357
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,600
 But they get-- 1 foot.

1358
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
 They come in pairs.

1359
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:51,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1360
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,720
 [APPLAUSE]

1361
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,640
 What is 1/3 of 6?

1362
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,640
 2.

1363
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,320
 [LAUGHTER]

1364
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,320
 [LAUGHTER]

1365
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,840
 All right, we all can have the wrap up.

1366
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,560
 So if you can have the wrap, thank you so much, everyone.

1367
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,640
 Those are all of our friends.

1368

 One last week, we're going to go upstairs and get

1386

 a very drunk, because if you'd like to join us, that'll be awesome.

1387
