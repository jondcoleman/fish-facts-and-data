00:00:00,00:00:05,"Afternoon all, you must know by now if you've been paying attention over the last couple of months"
00:00:05,00:00:12,that I have for some reason committed to traveling the country with these three upcoming idiots.
00:00:12,00:00:20,"We are going to all sorts of exotic places like Ipswich, Barnstable, Pool, Reading,"
00:00:20,00:00:25,"Peterborough, Chesterfield, but popping over to Dublin, we're going up to Scotland,"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"few locations there. Obviously, sitting on a tour bus for months on end with Dan, James and Andy"
00:00:30,00:00:34,is not how any sane person would choose to spend their time. The only thing that's going to make
00:00:34,00:00:40,"it bearable is if you guys come along too, please know such things at fish.com has all the details,"
00:00:40,00:00:45,"get tickets, come and watch us. There'll be an exclusive first half which will never be available"
00:00:45,00:00:49,anywhere else and then we'll be doing a different podcast every night for the second half. See you there.
00:00:49,00:01:05,[Music]
00:01:05,00:01:11,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:11,00:01:18,"from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a humongous distance"
00:01:18,00:01:23,"from Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered"
00:01:23,00:01:27,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:01:27,00:01:33,"order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that's my fact, my fact this week is that"
00:01:33,00:01:39,it would take people around 10 minutes to adjust to the way Abraham Lincoln sounded before they
00:01:39,00:01:45,could enjoy his speeches. Wow. So the first 10 minutes of his speeches always really shit because
00:01:45,00:01:49,he knows it has to be filler and at the 10 minute mark he launches into the real stuff. He does the
00:01:49,00:01:54,"whole what do you do, what's your job, you know, emceeing moments. Hang on Dan, Abraham Lincoln's"
00:01:54,00:01:58,most famous speech was the Gettysburg Address where I believe he spoke for two minutes.
00:01:58,00:02:04,"And also his most famous line is the first line of that address isn't it? Oh no, yeah you're right."
00:02:04,00:02:09,It's true. Oh I would say it was the last line so it's the last line. Wasn't it Shall Not Parish from
00:02:09,00:02:15,"the Earth line? Yes it was the first line, four score. I really would have gone the four score"
00:02:15,00:02:19,"as the big line. Would you? And I would go by the people too, the people four the people with the"
00:02:19,00:02:23,people. You didn't understand the first minute and a half though did you? That's true because I
00:02:23,00:02:27,was so distracted by his weird voice. What's his weird voice? Did he have an accent? He did have an
00:02:27,00:02:33,accent but he also had a much higher voice than you would think so I guess all of us probably had
00:02:33,00:02:37,an introduction to Abraham Lincoln's supposed voice through the movies and so on. For me it was
00:02:37,00:02:42,Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Incredibly Low. I watched that this weekend. Did you? Well
00:02:42,00:02:46,"you would have seen it then. My niece had never seen it, she's only nine and so yeah. Right."
00:02:46,00:02:51,"Introduced her to it, it's brilliant. It's a fantastic movie. Talk about that."
00:02:51,00:02:56,So he comes out at the end and he does the four score and it's a very baritone
00:02:56,00:02:59,war score and that's what we know is Lincoln but all of the contemporary accounts of his
00:02:59,00:03:05,"speeches say that he had a tenor's voice, a much higher voice and as a result there's a historian"
00:03:05,00:03:11,called Harold Holzer who's written over 40 books on both Lincoln and the Civil War and he found
00:03:11,00:03:15,that there were all these accounts of journalists saying that for the first 10 minutes people just
00:03:15,00:03:21,really had to adjust to both the accent and the sound matched with this tall human who was quite
00:03:21,00:03:26,gangly and just putting all the things together. It took 10 minutes before they could settle in
00:03:26,00:03:30,and go oh okay he's actually saying amazing stuff. It sounds like a really weird voice
00:03:30,00:03:34,"all because obviously no recording. Your good at voices, Adley, can you do us a little?"
00:03:34,00:03:41,He had a thin tenor or rather falsetto voice almost as high-pitched as a Boson's whistle.
00:03:41,00:03:49,All the reviews are so negative of him. The New York Herald said he had a frequent tendency
00:03:49,00:03:55,to dwindle into a shrill and unpleasant sound. It just sounds yeah. Some people think it was
00:03:55,00:04:00,useful though because like there were some famous debates he did with a guy called Stephen A. Douglas
00:04:00,00:04:05,and he had quite a baritone voice Stephen A. Douglas but they think that maybe in a big crowd
00:04:05,00:04:09,the baritone might sometimes get lost there and the people at the back will be able to hear the
00:04:09,00:04:15,"high pitch sounds better. Yes, how interesting. Is that like when your neighbours are having a party"
00:04:15,00:04:20,and you can hear the bass much more indistinctly but the high stuff is what really annoys you?
00:04:20,00:04:26,Yeah. For me it's the bass. Is that a joke? No. The bass is the annoying bit right? The bass is
00:04:26,00:04:32,"the bit that keeps you. Yes, you're right. Okay, so it's like the opposite of my life with my neighbours."
00:04:32,00:04:39,"It's another brilliant analogy from Andy Murray. The whole thing of it being the voice being low,"
00:04:39,00:04:44,the first time I think I've then heard the higher voices when Daniel Day-Lewis played him
00:04:44,00:04:50,in the Spielberg movie. It's a fantastic movie. It's still Bill and Ted. It's no Bill and Ted.
00:04:50,00:04:55,"Yeah, I read an article in the Library of Congress and they said that his voice is closer to that"
00:04:55,00:04:59,Daniel Day-Lewis voice than any other impression that anyone's ever done. They even said it was
00:04:59,00:05:04,more close than the one Andy is going to do on the podcast in a few weeks' time on that article.
00:05:04,00:05:12,"So when Daniel Day-Lewis was cast for the movie, which was after Liam Neeson had to drop out,"
00:05:12,00:05:17,he spent a year prepping. Was Liam Neeson going to play Lincoln? Liam Neeson was going to play Lincoln.
00:05:17,00:05:22,"I don't know if I take a role that I was second to Liam Neeson. Well, I think Daniel Day-Lewis"
00:05:22,00:05:27,was the original choice. He said no to it and then Liam Neeson got involved and then Liam Neeson
00:05:27,00:05:31,"had a horrible role. I know, yeah. Surely then Daniel Day-Lewis said, ""Oh god, fine, I will do it,"
00:05:31,00:05:37,"my lord. I'm going to find whoever stole my hat and I'm going to rip their heads from the body."""
00:05:37,00:05:46,"Yeah, so he took on the role and he spent a year, possibly more, prepping for it. Read over 100"
00:05:46,00:05:51,"books and that's when he was trying to find the voice, the voice of Lincoln. And when he"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"eventually found it - Probably reading the wrong books, wasn't he? I made an audio book."
00:05:54,00:06:02,"Well, he eventually decided on what the voice was. He recorded it with a neighbour and he posted it"
00:06:02,00:06:07,to Steven Spielberg in a package where he drew a skull and crossbones on it and put a black mark on
00:06:07,00:06:13,"it because he wanted no one but Steven Spielberg to read to hear it first. Yeah, interesting and"
00:06:13,00:06:18,"exciting to be tempered with. If it was just a blank envelope, I'd be like, ""Yeah, fine, I'm not"
00:06:18,00:06:22,"interested in that."" All of a sudden, he didn't treasure that. Exactly. I don't know what he was"
00:06:22,00:06:28,"thinking. It sounds very odd filming with him because he is your classic method actor, I guess."
00:06:28,00:06:33,"Daniel Day-Lewis and he insisted on being Lincoln on set, so he talked in that voice the entire"
00:06:33,00:06:38,time on and off set for months and months when they were filming. He never didn't talk in the voice.
00:06:38,00:06:43,He wouldn't allow any accents other than American accent around him in case that put him off his
00:06:43,00:06:49,flow. He made everyone refer to him as Mr. President throughout filming. I think Spielberg
00:06:49,00:06:54,"insisted on that as well. Did he? Why they're both presidents? It was very confusing, battle of the"
00:06:54,00:07:00,"presidents. No, no, he said, ""Let's buy into this."" Oh, so he said that everyone had to call Day-Lewis"
00:07:00,00:07:05,President? I believe so because he started coming in irreappropriate clothing as well as the director
00:07:05,00:07:10,to sort of make it. Spielberg did that and Daniel Day-Lewis was not on the call sheet. Abraham
00:07:10,00:07:16,Lincoln was on the call sheet instead. How do you dress irreappropriate as a film director if
00:07:16,00:07:23,"you're dressing for the 1860s? Surely, yeah, he just walks in and he went, ""Sorry, we can't make a"
00:07:23,00:07:28,"film because film hasn't been invented."" Everyone go home. There's one journalist who described"
00:07:28,00:07:34,"Lincoln as a slang-wanging stump speaker. That is a great phrase, isn't it? It's a really good"
00:07:34,00:07:40,"phrase. He was known for being humble, which some people cast as maybe not sophisticated enough in"
00:07:40,00:07:47,"his language, slang-wanging. He's wanging the slang around. His accent, we were saying before,"
00:07:47,00:07:52,"was kind of different as well, right? So whenever he was supposed to say chairman, he would say"
00:07:52,00:08:00,"""Cheerman."" Cheerman. Cheerman. Cheerman. What about this? If he ever said ""Winder."" Winder."
00:08:01,00:08:08,"That's window. Window, right. Learned would be ""Larrant,"" and he would always say ""Recum"" instead"
00:08:08,00:08:19,"of ""Assume."" That sounds really different. But equally strangely, he also had a lot of misspellings"
00:08:19,00:08:24,"in his written work as well, and he would often spell the word ""Inaugural"" wrong. Oh, yeah."
00:08:24,00:08:29,But we think that perhaps that gives a clue as to how he spoke as well. If he spelled it slightly
00:08:29,00:08:34,"differently, maybe he spoke it that way as well. Right. Was it radically different? Did it start"
00:08:34,00:08:40,"with a Q? No, it would be ""Inaugural"" instead of ""Inaugural."" Right. ""Inaugural."""
00:08:40,00:08:45,And he stood so still. This was another report of the way he spoke. So his law partner was a man
00:08:45,00:08:50,"called William Herndon, and Herndon recorded that, I don't know why he said this, but he said ""You"
00:08:50,00:08:54,"could leave a silver dollar between his feet at the start of his speech, and it would still be"
00:08:54,00:08:59,"there at the end."" I have a theory for why he did this. So I was reading accounts of young Lincoln."
00:08:59,00:09:03,I don't think he actually did that. I'm just - what do you mean? He didn't actually leave
00:09:03,00:09:06,"a dollar between his feet at the start. No, no, no, but he stood in credit. The point was"
00:09:06,00:09:12,to make the point. I thought you were saying that he had done that. I have a theory that the coin
00:09:12,00:09:17,"was magic. He used to be a busker, and he always put a few quotes there to just get people to know."
00:09:17,00:09:24,"No, my theory, which probably is an established reason as opposed to a theory,"
00:09:24,00:09:29,"is when he was young, he used to sit up late at night, and he used to listen to his dad tell"
00:09:29,00:09:33,stories to all of his friends. Really funny stories. Lincoln was obsessed with them.
00:09:33,00:09:36,"So in the morning, he would go and he would find his friends, and he would tell all the stories"
00:09:36,00:09:40,"that his dad had told the night before, and he would stand on a tree stump, and that is where"
00:09:40,00:09:46,he would deliver all of his speeches. So he didn't have much of a stage. He had the space
00:09:46,00:09:51,"of a tree stump, and that would have informed the lack of leg movement, which then took him"
00:09:51,00:10:02,to presidency when he was doing his inaugural speech. The Gettysburg Address was not him.
00:10:02,00:10:07,"Wow, okay, this is a crazier theory than my tree stump theory."
00:10:07,00:10:12,"This is, he stood so still because it was actually a robot. No, the Gettysburg Address"
00:10:12,00:10:17,"was someone else delivered it. So really, at the event where he delivered the Gettysburg Address,"
00:10:17,00:10:22,"he was supposed to be giving a very short closing dedication, which is why it was only"
00:10:22,00:10:26,"two minutes long. It was just very quick. Thanks for coming, guys. Thank God these bloats gave"
00:10:26,00:10:31,"their lives for the Civil War, et cetera. If there's a carriage in the park with the license plate,"
00:10:31,00:10:37,it's blocking the way you need to move your carriage. Exactly. The person who was supposed
00:10:37,00:10:41,to give what they were calling the Gettysburg Address at the time was this great orator and
00:10:41,00:10:47,"politician, pastor, who was called Edward Everett. And his was two hours long. So that could be the"
00:10:47,00:10:53,"one we all knew off by heart. Wow, really? So did he actually do that two hour speech first?"
00:10:53,00:10:56,"He did a two hour speech, which means it's incredible people had the energy to listen"
00:10:56,00:11:00,to Lincoln after that. He did the two hours and then. I wonder they loved it so much.
00:11:00,00:11:06,"I think he was sick at the time as well, Lincoln, when he then gave the speech afterwards and it"
00:11:06,00:11:11,"kind of bombed, I guess, after a two hour speech. Yeah, it got terrible reviews everywhere. So"
00:11:11,00:11:16,the Times said that the inauguration of the cemetery at Gettysburg was an imposing ceremony
00:11:16,00:11:21,only rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln.
00:11:21,00:11:27,"He got a really, yeah. And in fact, there was an apology issued in 2013 by a newspaper called"
00:11:27,00:11:33,"The Patriot News, who gave him a really bad review at the time. They said it was silly remarks and"
00:11:33,00:11:39,"that maybe he was drunk and that it deserved the veil of oblivion. And then in 2013, they recanted."
00:11:39,00:11:44,"Of all the things he should be apologizing for, it does feel quite far down the list."
00:11:44,00:11:47,When did Lincoln become President? How do you all know? 1860?
00:11:47,00:11:51,Yeah. So when do you think the first town was named after him?
00:11:51,00:11:56,I would have guessed a few years after the Civil War or maybe soon after it.
00:11:56,00:12:01,"Okay, I'm going to go the opposite direction and say he was an influential lawyer and maybe that"
00:12:01,00:12:04,led to something. So two years before he was President as well.
00:12:04,00:12:08,Wow. Who are you and what have you done with Dan Shriver? That is absolutely correct.
00:12:08,00:12:14,It was 1853 because he was a lawyer. Some people who were setting up a new town brought him in to
00:12:14,00:12:18,"kind of sign the deeds and they said, would you mind if we named this town after you?"
00:12:18,00:12:19,"God, that's flattering."
00:12:19,00:12:25,"That's Lincoln, Illinois, which is still there today. And at noon that day, he purchased two"
00:12:25,00:12:31,"watermelons, carried them to the public square and squeezed the watermelon juice out onto the"
00:12:31,00:12:35,ground. Did he use his thighs? Call back.
00:12:35,00:12:40,"And then he said to the people, nothing bearing the name Lincoln ever amounted to much."
00:12:40,00:12:42,So he said that they shouldn't really have called it after him.
00:12:42,00:12:45,That's very cool.
00:12:45,00:12:50,One thing from the time that Lincoln was President was that the White House was an
00:12:50,00:12:53,"open house at the time, which is so bizarre to think of now obviously because there are"
00:12:53,00:12:57,two miles of security around it. But people were just walking in all the time.
00:12:57,00:13:01,You could just walk into the White House and people were free to climb in through the windows.
00:13:01,00:13:02,They camped outside his office door.
00:13:02,00:13:06,"If it's open, why'd they go through the windows?"
00:13:06,00:13:07,"Idea, actually."
00:13:07,00:13:11,"But they were demanding jobs from him. It was just, the whole thing was carnage."
00:13:11,00:13:13,He's the president of the country.
00:13:13,00:13:16,"He must have had one room where it was like, do not enter."
00:13:16,00:13:16,"Well, he had an office."
00:13:16,00:13:22,"They had to cut it down to two, five hour sessions a week where you could just"
00:13:22,00:13:25,knock on the door and go and see him and chat to him and ask for a job.
00:13:25,00:13:29,Ten hours a week of his working time was spent just being harangued by people
00:13:29,00:13:34,and he called them his public opinion baths and people would just leave inventions that
00:13:34,00:13:38,they thought he might like to look at. It's insane and he couldn't walk from the office
00:13:38,00:13:43,to his own private living quarters without being bothered along the way by people asking for jobs
00:13:43,00:13:46,"and the White House maintenance people had to build a partition to say, no, he actually just"
00:13:46,00:13:49,needs a corridor that he can walk along without being bothered all the time.
00:13:49,00:13:51,Corridor of power.
00:13:51,00:13:52,Yes. It's mad.
00:13:52,00:13:55,"I suppose it's kind of like an MP surgery, isn't it today?"
00:13:55,00:13:56,Yeah.
00:13:56,00:13:56,"But, you know."
00:13:56,00:13:57,For 10 hours a week.
00:13:57,00:13:58,For the quarter of your working time.
00:13:58,00:14:00,For the president of the United States.
00:14:00,00:14:00,I know.
00:14:00,00:14:02,I think he did more than 40 hours a week.
00:14:02,00:14:05,Maybe at the height of the war.
00:14:05,00:14:06,"Yeah, you're right."
00:14:06,00:14:11,And now he bothers presidents because isn't he constantly reported?
00:14:11,00:14:15,"Not constantly, but by a few, the ghost of Lincoln seen in the White House."
00:14:15,00:14:15,Right.
00:14:15,00:14:18,"The people of, you know, presidents have said, yeah, yeah, I saw the ghost of Lincoln."
00:14:18,00:14:19,Wow.
00:14:19,00:14:22,Yeah.
00:14:22,00:14:23,That's him.
00:14:23,00:14:34,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:14:34,00:14:37,"My fact this week is that 5,000 years ago,"
00:14:37,00:14:42,Scots built houses by dropping huge piles of stones to the bottom of locks
00:14:42,00:14:44,and building their home on top of them.
00:14:44,00:14:45,That's amazing.
00:14:45,00:14:46,It's so amazing.
00:14:46,00:14:48,It's such a weird way of doing it.
00:14:48,00:14:49,And we don't know why they did it.
00:14:49,00:14:51,These are things called crannogs.
00:14:51,00:14:53,"I mean, if you live in Scotland, it's very likely you know about them."
00:14:53,00:14:54,I actually didn't know about them at all.
00:14:54,00:14:55,"Yeah, never heard of them."
00:14:55,00:14:58,But there are about 600 of them known about so far.
00:14:58,00:15:02,They're artificial islands that were built in locks
00:15:02,00:15:05,and they would be connected to the shore by like a little causeway.
00:15:05,00:15:09,"And until quite recently, it was thought they'd dated back to about 800 BC."
00:15:09,00:15:12,And then they just did some radiocarbon dating of pottery
00:15:12,00:15:13,that's been sunken around them.
00:15:13,00:15:17,"And they found out it actually dates back to 3,600 BC."
00:15:17,00:15:19,"Oh, that's a good dough."
00:15:19,00:15:22,"Before Stonehenge, before the pyramids,"
00:15:22,00:15:24,the Scots were just piling up stones in locks
00:15:24,00:15:26,and building a house on top for no apparent reason.
00:15:26,00:15:28,"It's not just piling stones, right?"
00:15:28,00:15:30,Like there's so much engineering that goes around it.
00:15:30,00:15:31,"Yeah, it's so impressive."
00:15:31,00:15:35,So the word crannog is Gaelic for son of tree or young tree.
00:15:35,00:15:39,And the idea is because they would cut these huge long timber piles
00:15:39,00:15:41,and they ram them into the beds of the lock
00:15:41,00:15:43,and then they would pile the stones in around them.
00:15:43,00:15:46,So they had a solid wooden foundation.
00:15:46,00:15:48,So you've got like a scaffold that you can stuff full.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"Yeah, I think there are different types as well,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,aren't there? There are some that are just timber.
00:15:52,00:15:54,So they're just kind of wooden platforms
00:15:54,00:15:55,and then there are some that are stones.
00:15:55,00:15:56,"Yeah, exactly."
00:15:56,00:15:58,And we've tried to remake them in modern times
00:15:58,00:16:00,and it's taken about three years to construct one
00:16:00,00:16:04,"to be in a similar, using the technology and so on."
00:16:04,00:16:05,Drive the piles into the bed of the lock.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Exactly.
00:16:06,00:16:08,They have to get meters into the bed of the lock.
00:16:08,00:16:12,"And you know, that's obviously incredibly hard to do from a floating surface."
00:16:12,00:16:15,"Well, I think what happens is you put some stones"
00:16:15,00:16:18,near the shore and then you put some a little bit further away
00:16:18,00:16:21,and a little bit further away and you put like a path
00:16:21,00:16:22,"to the middle of the lock or not the middle,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,maybe a few meters away from the edge.
00:16:24,00:16:26,And then you build it from there.
00:16:26,00:16:28,So you kind of make a causeway first.
00:16:28,00:16:29,"And if you look from above,"
00:16:29,00:16:32,you can kind of see the little causeway underneath the water.
00:16:32,00:16:32,Yeah.
00:16:32,00:16:35,And then how do you get the pile to go so deep into the bed?
00:16:35,00:16:37,"Oh yeah, I mean, it's all crazy."
00:16:37,00:16:38,How do you do it?
00:16:38,00:16:40,I think we'll know.
00:16:40,00:16:42,You pile up on top like a circus trick.
00:16:42,00:16:44,You just have people standing in front of each other.
00:16:44,00:16:46,"It's the ghost of Lincoln, I think is coming out again."
00:16:46,00:16:48,In flyers stuff.
00:16:48,00:16:49,If it's the Loch Ness Monster.
00:16:49,00:16:52,"It's aliens, of course it's aliens."
00:16:52,00:16:54,"No, we have no idea, do we?"
00:16:54,00:16:56,It's absolutely amazing.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"Live there until the 17th century,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,apparently the last people were living on crannogs.
00:16:59,00:17:02,So pretty relatively recent compared with when they were built.
00:17:02,00:17:04,"I think the ones where we found the pottery,"
00:17:04,00:17:07,"we're not sure if people actually lived there, right?"
00:17:07,00:17:07,Yeah.
00:17:07,00:17:09,So the reason that we think they might not have lived
00:17:09,00:17:13,on these particular ones is because there isn't any domestic waste around there.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"You do have these pots, there's no human remains,"
00:17:17,00:17:20,so we don't think it's a funeral thing.
00:17:20,00:17:22,"So we think it might be some kind of feast,"
00:17:22,00:17:25,"maybe some kind of rite of passage, that kind of thing."
00:17:25,00:17:28,"So what has happened is people have brought some pots to this island,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,"this fake island, done something,"
00:17:31,00:17:33,thrown the pots in the water and then left.
00:17:33,00:17:34,It's a bar.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"I mean, that's obviously just a bar."
00:17:36,00:17:36,It could be.
00:17:36,00:17:37,Tiki bar.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"Yeah, it's a bar."
00:17:39,00:17:41,"You're pissed, you toss your pot away,"
00:17:41,00:17:42,you can't be asked to carry it home.
00:17:42,00:17:43,It's a Scottish pub.
00:17:43,00:17:45,The first pubs.
00:17:45,00:17:50,It sounds so exciting being the person who discovered that they were really old.
00:17:50,00:17:54,"So they are 3,000 years older than we thought they were."
00:17:54,00:17:57,And it was a retired navy diver called Chris Murray
00:17:57,00:17:59,who first kind of discovered this and it was 10 years ago
00:17:59,00:18:02,and he was just going for a dive and he saw some pots
00:18:02,00:18:05,and then he sent them off to be analysed and turned out
00:18:05,00:18:07,"they were 5,500 years old."
00:18:07,00:18:10,But he was saying that in 2020 he was going for a dive
00:18:10,00:18:14,"and he found a 5,500 year old drinking vessel."
00:18:14,00:18:16,He just saw a little fragment sticking out of the mud.
00:18:16,00:18:19,So he took it and then he took a sip of water from it
00:18:19,00:18:23,and you can think the last time someone did this
00:18:23,00:18:25,was over five millennia ago.
00:18:25,00:18:26,Yeah.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Isn't that so cool?
00:18:27,00:18:28,It is amazing.
00:18:28,00:18:32,Maybe people will be doing that with our old horrible ribena cartons
00:18:32,00:18:34,"and plastic festival cups in 5,000 years."
00:18:34,00:18:35,"Yeah, sure."
00:18:35,00:18:36,What a nice thought.
00:18:36,00:18:37,What a lovely thought.
00:18:37,00:18:39,"All the plastic will still be there, won't it?"
00:18:39,00:18:40,Yep.
00:18:40,00:18:40,Yeah.
00:18:40,00:18:42,Artificial islands?
00:18:42,00:18:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:43,00:18:43,Yeah.
00:18:43,00:18:47,So lots of artificial islands in the world.
00:18:47,00:18:50,I didn't know about the ones in Bolivia Imperial and Lake Titicaca.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"Yeah, I've heard that."
00:18:51,00:18:52,They're amazing.
00:18:52,00:18:53,I've stayed on them.
00:18:53,00:18:53,Thank you.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Thank you.
00:18:54,00:18:55,"Wow, the floating ones."
00:18:55,00:18:57,"The floating ones, the reed islands, yeah."
00:18:57,00:19:02,"So yeah, these are islands made of weeds woven together"
00:19:02,00:19:04,and they're made by indigenous people
00:19:04,00:19:06,and it seems like they were just made by the Uro people
00:19:06,00:19:08,and basically they got to the shores of Lake Titicaca
00:19:08,00:19:13,"hoping to set up camp and like take residence there 1,000 years ago"
00:19:13,00:19:15,and they realized there were people there.
00:19:15,00:19:17,"There was the Quechua people, the Aymara people there."
00:19:17,00:19:18,"So they were like, well, we can't live here."
00:19:18,00:19:19,What should we do?
00:19:19,00:19:21,So they built some platforms
00:19:21,00:19:22,and then just sailed out into the middle of a lake
00:19:22,00:19:23,and they still hang out there.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"Yeah, it's really cool."
00:19:24,00:19:27,"When I was there, they said that they went there"
00:19:27,00:19:30,because there was taxes they wanted to get away with.
00:19:30,00:19:34,So it was like a literal offshore account that they went so they can tax them.
00:19:34,00:19:37,But some people think it was because there was a war
00:19:37,00:19:39,and they went there so that people couldn't attack them.
00:19:39,00:19:42,"But yeah, they taught me how to make the reeds"
00:19:42,00:19:43,and stuff like that.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Oh, cool."
00:19:44,00:19:46,"So because you have to constantly sort of,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,"it's like repainting a bridge, right?"
00:19:48,00:19:50,Like you're constantly fixing the reeds.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"So near to where the islands are,"
00:19:52,00:19:54,there's loads of massive reeds and you go over there
00:19:54,00:19:58,"and you cut them down and then you kind of turn them into like little,"
00:19:58,00:20:01,"not like bricks, but like little groups of reeds."
00:20:01,00:20:03,And I went on a boat to the school
00:20:03,00:20:04,because they have a floating school
00:20:04,00:20:06,and a floating basketball court and stuff.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"Oh, wow."
00:20:07,00:20:10,I was staying with family of Uros and it was really cool.
00:20:10,00:20:11,Wow.
00:20:11,00:20:11,Highly recommend that.
00:20:11,00:20:12,It's so amazing.
00:20:12,00:20:14,Have you heard of Mischief Reef?
00:20:14,00:20:17,It's another created island.
00:20:17,00:20:21,And it's a new island that's been created by China.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"And it's in the, is it the South China Sea?"
00:20:23,00:20:24,I think it is.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Probably.
00:20:25,00:20:26,It's why they do most of their island creations.
00:20:26,00:20:28,They are creating a lot of islands at the moment.
00:20:28,00:20:30,And it's causing a lot of mischief.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Yeah.
00:20:31,00:20:32,"They are, they genuinely are."
00:20:32,00:20:34,"I tried to work out, was this called Mischief Reef"
00:20:34,00:20:38,before China started creating military runways
00:20:38,00:20:41,"and hangers and, you know, missile bases?"
00:20:41,00:20:42,It's quite an innocuous term.
00:20:42,00:20:44,It's Naughty Boy Island.
00:20:44,00:20:44,Yeah.
00:20:44,00:20:46,Silly Billy.
00:20:46,00:20:48,Mischief Reef is one of the biggest.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"And you can see photos of it from, you know,"
00:20:50,00:20:51,"15 years ago, photos now."
00:20:51,00:20:52,And it looks like a different place.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"It is a different place, actually,"
00:20:54,00:20:55,because it's been imported and installed
00:20:55,00:20:57,and concreted and all over.
00:20:57,00:21:00,But there's this bizarre war of attrition
00:21:00,00:21:01,"going on, kind of Cold War style,"
00:21:01,00:21:04,"between the China who are building these islands,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,"which are contested, by the way."
00:21:06,00:21:07,The ownership is contested.
00:21:07,00:21:08,And the US Navy.
00:21:08,00:21:11,So the US Navy keeps on sailing close to them
00:21:11,00:21:12,to make the point.
00:21:12,00:21:14,"They do a thing called a phonop,"
00:21:14,00:21:17,which is a freedom of navigation operation.
00:21:17,00:21:19,"And if you have a land,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,I think the barrier is 12 miles.
00:21:22,00:21:24,Like that's how far your border stretches
00:21:24,00:21:25,"into the ocean, if the island is definitely yours."
00:21:25,00:21:28,"I know there are different sort of definitions,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,but the USA pointedly sails within 12 miles
00:21:31,00:21:33,"of mischief reef to make the point,"
00:21:33,00:21:34,"these are international waters,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,according to the international community.
00:21:36,00:21:38,So we're going to keep on doing it.
00:21:38,00:21:40,And it hasn't broken into a conflict yet.
00:21:40,00:21:42,"Oh, a little bit, hasn't it?"
00:21:42,00:21:45,"Because, like, I think Philippines want it."
00:21:45,00:21:46,Japan wants it.
00:21:46,00:21:47,Indonesia wants it.
00:21:47,00:21:48,Russia wants it.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"It's like, yeah, it's dodgy."
00:21:50,00:21:51,But do you remember I was telling you guys
00:21:51,00:21:55,"about in Bhutan, on the border between Bhutan and China?"
00:21:55,00:21:57,China has just started building villages.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Yes, yes."
00:21:59,00:22:00,And no one noticed.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"And like, in Bhutan, they started."
00:22:02,00:22:04,"In Bhutan, yeah, like the Bhutanese noticed,"
00:22:04,00:22:05,"and they were like, well,"
00:22:05,00:22:07,shall we tell the Chinese not to do this anymore?
00:22:07,00:22:09,Or shall we just kind of leave it?
00:22:09,00:22:10,And they just kind of left it
00:22:10,00:22:12,because there are other things that they want
00:22:12,00:22:14,to have a good deal with China about.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"But then the international community are like,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,"well, last time we looked here,"
00:22:18,00:22:20,there weren't three villages and an airport.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"And they're, you know--"
00:22:21,00:22:22,"Oh, man."
00:22:22,00:22:22,Yeah.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"I thought it was called ""Mischief Islands"""
00:22:24,00:22:26,because of a ship.
00:22:26,00:22:26,"Oh, really?"
00:22:26,00:22:27,Called the mischief.
00:22:27,00:22:27,My lobby.
00:22:27,00:22:29,"Yeah, I think it's in dedication to a ship"
00:22:29,00:22:30,that used the passing that.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"I could be wrong about that, but--"
00:22:31,00:22:32,A GMS mischief.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"Yeah, I think that's possibly right."
00:22:34,00:22:35,"It's a party cruise ship, wasn't it?"
00:22:35,00:22:36,It's a Swingers cruise.
00:22:36,00:22:40,Here's an island that I'd never heard of.
00:22:40,00:22:42,Dejima.
00:22:42,00:22:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:43,00:22:45,This was created in Nagasaki Bay
00:22:45,00:22:47,in the 17th century in Japan.
00:22:47,00:22:48,"And during the Edo period,"
00:22:48,00:22:50,"Japan wanted to be a closed country,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,so it didn't want anyone else to come in.
00:22:52,00:22:55,The only people that were allowed to go anywhere near Japan
00:22:55,00:22:58,"were Chinese, Korean, and Dutch."
00:22:58,00:23:00,And they were allowed to do that for trading reasons.
00:23:00,00:23:01,OK.
00:23:01,00:23:02,Dutch is a bit of a wild card.
00:23:02,00:23:04,Feels like a Dutch got a weird free pass
00:23:04,00:23:04,that was about a year ago.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"OK, whatever, not offended."
00:23:06,00:23:09,"But basically, if you were a member"
00:23:09,00:23:10,of the Dutch East India Company
00:23:10,00:23:12,and you were trading
00:23:12,00:23:14,and you were like taking some silk there
00:23:14,00:23:15,"or some spices or whatever,"
00:23:15,00:23:19,you would go to this created island called Dejima
00:23:19,00:23:20,"and you would kind of live on there,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,but you weren't allowed onto the main island.
00:23:22,00:23:25,And there was like a bridge there with guards
00:23:25,00:23:27,which would stop you from going over.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"It's really, really cool."
00:23:29,00:23:30,"There's an amazing book,"
00:23:30,00:23:31,"David Mitchell book, set on Dejima,"
00:23:31,00:23:32,because it was very famous.
00:23:32,00:23:34,Japan's policy was
00:23:34,00:23:36,they didn't want any Western culture
00:23:36,00:23:38,"coming in and invading them,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,so which is why they really tried to block them out
00:23:40,00:23:41,and then wars happened
00:23:41,00:23:43,and we got involved and forced them out of it.
00:23:43,00:23:44,"But yeah, it's so brilliant."
00:23:44,00:23:44,What was the book?
00:23:44,00:23:46,The Thousand Autums of Jacob Dezoet.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"And yeah, so it's about this Dutch guy"
00:23:48,00:23:49,who goes over and stays there.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"But yeah, completely fake."
00:23:51,00:23:52,"Yeah, and while you're on there,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,"like the local kids would kind of,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"oh, look, there's a Dutch person."
00:23:56,00:23:58,Isn't that strange kind of thing?
00:23:58,00:24:00,"And also, you were required to tell the Japanese"
00:24:00,00:24:03,about anything that had happened in the world
00:24:03,00:24:04,while you were away.
00:24:04,00:24:05,Really?
00:24:05,00:24:07,You're a human newspaper
00:24:07,00:24:08,for the news of three years ago
00:24:08,00:24:10,when you last left the Western world.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"I find that really cool,"
00:24:12,00:24:14,"because at one point,"
00:24:14,00:24:17,Dejima was the only independent bit of the Netherlands.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"So at one point,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,the Netherlands was an artificial island.
00:24:21,00:24:23,So this is when the Netherlands was annexed
00:24:23,00:24:25,"by Napoleon, I think, in the Napoleonic Wars"
00:24:25,00:24:27,and like lots of Dutch territory was taken elsewhere.
00:24:27,00:24:29,And so that was where they lived.
00:24:29,00:24:30,And I think they succeeded there
00:24:30,00:24:31,because they're so used to living on
00:24:31,00:24:35,"basically artificial reclaimed land, right?"
00:24:35,00:24:38,The Netherlands is sort of mostly an artificial island
00:24:38,00:24:38,in itself.
00:24:38,00:24:41,About 60% of the land in the Netherlands
00:24:41,00:24:44,is just there because they've drained away the water
00:24:44,00:24:45,and they've built it up.
00:24:45,00:24:46,It's amazing.
00:24:46,00:24:47,"Yeah, it's incredible."
00:24:47,00:24:49,Most of the population lives on land
00:24:49,00:24:51,that shouldn't naturally be there.
00:24:51,00:24:51,Yeah.
00:24:52,00:24:55,"There's an entire province called Leverpolde,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,which is the 12th province of the Netherlands
00:24:57,00:24:58,and it's new.
00:24:58,00:25:00,It's just a new land.
00:25:00,00:25:02,"Oh, because polder is what they're called."
00:25:02,00:25:04,"It's a polder, the reclaimed land, isn't it?"
00:25:04,00:25:04,Yeah.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"It would make you nervous, I think."
00:25:06,00:25:07,That is incredible.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"I found a really cool new artificial island,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,which I'm so annoyed.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"I have not looked up the pronunciations,"
00:25:13,00:25:14,but I imagine you guys will know it.
00:25:14,00:25:15,So here we go.
00:25:15,00:25:18,It's a bridge which connects Copenhagen to Malmo.
00:25:18,00:25:20,And it's the Aurasund bridge.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"Aurasund, yeah."
00:25:21,00:25:22,Aurasund.
00:25:22,00:25:23,So have you been there?
00:25:23,00:25:25,"Okay, apparently you've been to every artificial island."
00:25:25,00:25:30,"So the Aurasund bridge, if you're passing it,"
00:25:30,00:25:31,you go in the bridge and then--
00:25:31,00:25:33,"In fact, it's what the TV show, The Bridge, is based on."
00:25:33,00:25:34,"Exactly, yes."
00:25:34,00:25:34,Yeah.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"And it goes down underneath, doesn't it?"
00:25:36,00:25:39,"As opposed to being a bridge that connects Copenhagen to Malmo,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,it goes bridge-like and then suddenly it becomes a tunnel
00:25:42,00:25:43,and you go underneath.
00:25:43,00:25:46,"And that tunnel bit has become an artificial island,"
00:25:46,00:25:48,which is called Pepa Holm.
00:25:48,00:25:49,And Pepa Holm is called that
00:25:49,00:25:51,because there is an actual island next to it
00:25:51,00:25:53,called Saltholm.
00:25:53,00:25:54,Nice.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Yeah.
00:25:55,00:25:56,So that's the--
00:25:56,00:25:58,They don't mention that in The Bridge.
00:25:58,00:25:58,Do they not?
00:25:58,00:26:00,It's a really great TV show.
00:26:00,00:26:02,"It's so exciting, Saganaren, Lansky Malmo."
00:26:02,00:26:04,It's really like cool and sexy and scandy.
00:26:04,00:26:05,And they don't ever say that.
00:26:05,00:26:06,If they just had one character
00:26:06,00:26:08,"who just gave bits of trivia about the area,"
00:26:08,00:26:09,that would be way better.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"It would have been a successful show, exactly."
00:26:11,00:26:14,"But so yeah, so it's become this artificial island."
00:26:14,00:26:15,And--
00:26:15,00:26:17,So how does the tunnel become an island?
00:26:17,00:26:19,There's a stretch of water between the two.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Between Malmo and--
00:26:20,00:26:20,Where is it?
00:26:20,00:26:21,Come here.
00:26:21,00:26:22,"Right, all right."
00:26:22,00:26:24,So you have a bridge over some of it.
00:26:24,00:26:26,Then there's an island at the end of the bridge.
00:26:26,00:26:28,And that island then contains the portal to a tunnel.
00:26:28,00:26:29,Yes.
00:26:29,00:26:31,The tunnel runs under the rest of the water.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Right.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"So the boats can still go past, but you can have a bridge."
00:26:35,00:26:36,I see.
00:26:36,00:26:37,I see.
00:26:37,00:26:38,Very clever.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"And so what's happened is this small,"
00:26:40,00:26:43,very concrete-looking island
00:26:43,00:26:46,has become a place where new species have migrated to
00:26:46,00:26:47,and set up shop.
00:26:47,00:26:49,And so you're only really allowed--
00:26:49,00:26:50,What are they selling?
00:26:50,00:26:52,"There's like a penguin going, ""Won't they fish?"
00:26:52,00:26:53,Won't they fish anyone?
00:26:53,00:26:53,"Any fish?"""
00:26:53,00:26:57,"So supposedly, I mean, this is--"
00:26:57,00:27:00,"I don't know if this is definitely still the case in 2021,"
00:27:00,00:27:01,"but for the last few years,"
00:27:01,00:27:03,it's been the case that you can only go there once a year.
00:27:03,00:27:06,And it's only biologists who are allowed to go there.
00:27:06,00:27:07,And what they found on it is amazing.
00:27:07,00:27:09,There's 12 species of bird that are living there.
00:27:09,00:27:12,"There were 20 species of spider, one really rare one,"
00:27:12,00:27:15,which they think might have migrated there via a train.
00:27:15,00:27:16,So it sort of popped off.
00:27:16,00:27:17,"Oh, nice."
00:27:17,00:27:18,While it was on the train.
00:27:18,00:27:19,There's a couple of rabbits there
00:27:19,00:27:21,that they think some people in a car
00:27:21,00:27:23,must have just let out and let them be on their own.
00:27:23,00:27:26,There's 345 species of beetle.
00:27:26,00:27:27,There's 421 species of butterfly.
00:27:27,00:27:30,Which vehicle did these all leave out of?
00:27:30,00:27:31,The beetles came in a yellow submarine.
00:27:31,00:27:41,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:27:41,00:27:43,And that is James.
00:27:43,00:27:46,"Okay, my fact this week is that the only known species"
00:27:46,00:27:50,of marine lichen was discovered by a person named Ivan Lam.
00:27:50,00:27:54,Their work often acknowledged the help of a Miss Elkie Mackenzie.
00:27:54,00:27:57,But that turned out to be one in the same person
00:27:57,00:28:00,as Lam later transitioned and took that name.
00:28:00,00:28:02,It's very cool.
00:28:02,00:28:03,Isn't that cool?
00:28:03,00:28:08,So Ivan Lam was basically thanking her future self.
00:28:08,00:28:09,Exactly.
00:28:09,00:28:10,Elkie Mackenzie.
00:28:10,00:28:11,Yeah.
00:28:11,00:28:11,Or teasing.
00:28:11,00:28:15,It's a trailer for.
00:28:16,00:28:17,Yeah.
00:28:17,00:28:20,So I read a no-bit tree of Elkie Mackenzie
00:28:20,00:28:21,written by Vernon Akmagian.
00:28:21,00:28:24,But I'd actually first come across Elkie Mackenzie
00:28:24,00:28:29,"in a blog by JSTOR, the website, by Sabrina Imbla."
00:28:29,00:28:31,"And in that blog, there was an amazing thing"
00:28:31,00:28:34,that said that Mackenzie had spent her whole life
00:28:34,00:28:37,"preparing this monograph of a particular type of lichen,"
00:28:37,00:28:40,only for her never to be able to quite make it.
00:28:40,00:28:43,Because sometimes her specimens got blown away
00:28:43,00:28:45,once she fell down an elevator shaft.
00:28:45,00:28:48,Did she fall down an elevator shaft?
00:28:48,00:28:49,Or did the light fall down?
00:28:49,00:28:50,It's really hard to tell.
00:28:50,00:28:52,But that was what really piqued my interest
00:28:52,00:28:53,about this person.
00:28:53,00:28:55,"It's like, what an amazing life."
00:28:55,00:28:59,"But yeah, a really cool person who kind of dedicated"
00:28:59,00:29:00,her life to lichen.
00:29:00,00:29:03,She worked in the Natural History Museum in London
00:29:03,00:29:07,as an assistant to Annie Lorraine Smith in the 1930s.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"And it's just so interesting that at the time,"
00:29:10,00:29:13,Annie Lorraine Smith was a huge character in the lichen world.
00:29:13,00:29:16,And she'd written a book which became the sort of seminal
00:29:16,00:29:18,textbook for the time about lichen.
00:29:18,00:29:22,Yet she was not officially hired by the Natural History Museum
00:29:22,00:29:24,because they didn't hire women at the time.
00:29:24,00:29:27,"So she had to have, her pay packet was outsourced"
00:29:27,00:29:29,to somewhere else that could fund it
00:29:29,00:29:31,because that was the only way that they could do it
00:29:31,00:29:33,because they didn't have women on the payroll.
00:29:33,00:29:34,Wow.
00:29:34,00:29:37,It's weird the reading about the history of lichenologists
00:29:37,00:29:41,because there do seem to be a lot of women in there.
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Like in the 19th century, a lot of the people"
00:29:42,00:29:45,"I was coming across were women, which was kind of exciting."
00:29:45,00:29:47,It was like a secret area that women knew
00:29:47,00:29:50,"that they were going to be led into almost, but not quite."
00:29:50,00:29:52,"And I did get excited that Carol Dodge,"
00:29:52,00:29:55,"who was Elkie McKenzie's main rival, was also a woman,"
00:29:55,00:29:57,but it's not a woman.
00:29:57,00:30:00,"But it's kind of sad, Carol Dodge, the Carol Dodge story"
00:30:00,00:30:02,because Elkie didn't like Dodge.
00:30:02,00:30:05,So what Elkie found that was really revolutionary
00:30:05,00:30:09,"in the lichen world was endemic Antarctic species, right?"
00:30:09,00:30:12,And she never got the chance to publish her Antarctic discoveries
00:30:12,00:30:14,for various reasons.
00:30:14,00:30:16,And she didn't like Dodge because she thought
00:30:16,00:30:17,Dodge's taxonomy was kind of reckless
00:30:17,00:30:20,and Dodge was just identifying things all over the shop.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"You pick up a bit of lichen, you go, ""Yeah, yeah, I bet that's a new one."
00:30:23,00:30:24,"Come and write it down."""
00:30:24,00:30:26,And now Dodge's record of Antarctic lichen
00:30:26,00:30:31,"is the kind of authority because McKenzie, for various reasons."
00:30:31,00:30:34,"One of which was that she said in, I can't remember what year"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"she transitioned, I think it was the late '70s maybe,"
00:30:37,00:30:42,"but she said, ""I am a woman, so I'm going to have the surgery."""
00:30:42,00:30:46,And she basically was made to take early retirement.
00:30:46,00:30:47,"Yeah, that's the implication, isn't it?"
00:30:47,00:30:50,"They sort of tried to rewrite the history in the moment,"
00:30:50,00:30:53,"didn't they, by saying, ""Oh, it's just for reasons."""
00:30:53,00:30:55,But it was quite obvious that that's why.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"Yeah, post McKenzie's retirement, she got into woodwork."
00:30:58,00:31:02,"Post, obviously felt like a bit of a wind down."
00:31:02,00:31:04,And I think she had some mental health problems
00:31:04,00:31:06,"that she admitted to, she'd been quite depressed."
00:31:06,00:31:10,And so she quit the whole lichen game
00:31:10,00:31:13,and decided to get really into making Siemens chests.
00:31:13,00:31:15,"So, you know."
00:31:15,00:31:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:17,00:31:18,Where else are you going to keep your Siemens?
00:31:18,00:31:22,"James, Siemens chests are a completely different thing"
00:31:22,00:31:24,to Siemens chests.
00:31:24,00:31:24,"Oh, no."
00:31:24,00:31:29,Then what am I keeping mine in?
00:31:32,00:31:32,"Oh, my God."
00:31:32,00:31:34,That's why they didn't invite you back on the boat.
00:31:34,00:31:35,"Oh, no."
00:31:35,00:31:39,"There's a treasure map out there where, one day when it's found,"
00:31:39,00:31:42,"it's going to be hugely disappointing, just a pool of Siemens."
00:31:42,00:31:44,"X marks, they're spunk more like."
00:31:44,00:31:47,"Wow, that was too far, wasn't it?"
00:31:47,00:31:48,"Too far, yeah."
00:31:48,00:31:51,She didn't make receptacles for Siemens.
00:31:51,00:31:52,It's just to make that very clear.
00:31:52,00:31:54,She was made receptacle for Siemens gear.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"You know, it's like that, it's like a suitcase."
00:31:56,00:31:59,The only notable thing really about them is that
00:31:59,00:32:01,"they're like a chest, but they have sides that tilt inwards"
00:32:01,00:32:05,"because if you're on a rocky boat, you don't want them to tip over."
00:32:05,00:32:05,Very clever.
00:32:05,00:32:06,Very clever.
00:32:06,00:32:10,And they have very intricate knots in the handles called beckets.
00:32:10,00:32:12,"And this is what Elkie got particularly into,"
00:32:12,00:32:12,is making these knots.
00:32:12,00:32:14,Just on Lycan.
00:32:14,00:32:16,Lycan are incredible.
00:32:16,00:32:17,I didn't really know what they were.
00:32:17,00:32:18,"God, me neither."
00:32:18,00:32:18,No.
00:32:18,00:32:20,Why have we never talked about them before?
00:32:20,00:32:23,And what they are is they're two things.
00:32:23,00:32:25,They're two species living in the same house.
00:32:25,00:32:25,It's mad.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"Or rather, it's one species living in a house built by another one."
00:32:28,00:32:33,So it's a fungus and normally an algae teaming up.
00:32:33,00:32:34,Sometimes it's an algae.
00:32:34,00:32:36,Sometimes it's a cyanobacteria.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Sometimes there are two algae.
00:32:37,00:32:38,It gets a bit complicated.
00:32:38,00:32:42,"But basically, basically the basic thing is it's a fungus"
00:32:42,00:32:45,which builds a structure and the algae lives in it
00:32:45,00:32:48,"and photosynthesizes sunlight, which produces sugar,"
00:32:48,00:32:49,which the fungus then eats.
00:32:49,00:32:51,So the fungus is providing the home
00:32:51,00:32:53,and the algae is bringing in the food.
00:32:53,00:32:54,And so what's the Lycan?
00:32:54,00:32:56,It's the collective thing for the Lycan.
00:32:56,00:32:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:32:57,00:32:59,"These two things that are working together,"
00:32:59,00:33:04,"as you say, in symbiosis, the word symbiosis was coined"
00:33:04,00:33:06,by a guy called Heinrich Anton de Barry.
00:33:06,00:33:10,And he was talking about Lycans when he coined that term.
00:33:10,00:33:15,"Although Vernon Matian, who wrote the obituary of algae,"
00:33:15,00:33:18,he doesn't think they're in symbiosis.
00:33:18,00:33:20,He thinks that actually the fungus
00:33:20,00:33:24,is a controlling parasite of the algae or cyanobacteria.
00:33:24,00:33:25,It's very interesting.
00:33:25,00:33:26,What's a stealing food of it?
00:33:26,00:33:29,"He's basically saying that, yeah, exactly,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,that the algae has no choice in the matter
00:33:32,00:33:34,and it could perfectly happily live
00:33:34,00:33:35,without a roof over its head.
00:33:35,00:33:38,There's no evidence that they need this building
00:33:38,00:33:39,that the fungi makes for them
00:33:39,00:33:41,and the fungi is getting a free ride.
00:33:41,00:33:42,But it's very controversial.
00:33:42,00:33:43,It's a big old debate.
00:33:43,00:33:45,"And it's like everyone knows couples like that,"
00:33:45,00:33:48,"where you think, should they be together?"
00:33:48,00:33:50,Isn't one of them fine without the other one?
00:33:50,00:33:52,Is it controlling parasitism?
00:33:52,00:33:54,"No, I think you can only judge these things"
00:33:54,00:33:57,from the inside unless you are an algae or a fungi.
00:33:57,00:33:59,You cannot comment.
00:33:59,00:34:02,So does the fungi absolutely need the algae then?
00:34:02,00:34:04,"Yeah, because it gets energy from the algae."
00:34:04,00:34:06,"So the fungi can't do what most fungi do,"
00:34:06,00:34:08,"which is eat decomposed matter,"
00:34:08,00:34:09,which is how fungi normally survive.
00:34:09,00:34:10,But they've now evolved to just eat the food
00:34:10,00:34:12,that's made for them by photosynthesis.
00:34:12,00:34:12,So they would starve.
00:34:12,00:34:14,And the argument is that the algae
00:34:14,00:34:16,is getting some protection in return.
00:34:16,00:34:18,But a lot of people think that actually
00:34:18,00:34:19,it doesn't need that protection.
00:34:19,00:34:20,Right.
00:34:20,00:34:21,It's controversial.
00:34:21,00:34:22,"Well, I've got actually"
00:34:22,00:34:23,something even more controversial
00:34:23,00:34:26,"to blow this even wider open,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,which is that they now think it's not--
00:34:28,00:34:30,a lichen is not two organisms.
00:34:30,00:34:31,It's three.
00:34:31,00:34:32,Three.
00:34:32,00:34:32,Yeah.
00:34:32,00:34:36,So that-- and this is a massive discovery
00:34:36,00:34:37,in the world of lichen.
00:34:37,00:34:40,So this is that there have been a bunch of mysteries about it.
00:34:40,00:34:43,"So one was that there were different lichen,"
00:34:43,00:34:45,which at a DNA level are exactly the same
00:34:45,00:34:46,"when they studied them,"
00:34:46,00:34:47,but that have different effects.
00:34:47,00:34:49,Like some will kill you when you eat them
00:34:49,00:34:50,and some are perfectly edible.
00:34:50,00:34:51,"They're like, how is this possible?"
00:34:51,00:34:53,They look like they're the same thing.
00:34:53,00:34:55,And they also had this problem
00:34:55,00:34:57,"where scientists can't recreate lichen in a lab,"
00:34:57,00:34:58,"which you should be able to,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,because you should be able to get the fungus
00:35:00,00:35:03,"and the bacteria or the algae shove them together,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,"create it, doesn't work."
00:35:05,00:35:07,"And now they found a way of looking at them closer,"
00:35:07,00:35:10,and they've realized they all have inside them
00:35:10,00:35:12,"a different fungus, which is more like a yeast."
00:35:12,00:35:15,"So right deep within their cells,"
00:35:15,00:35:18,single cells of this other fungus.
00:35:18,00:35:20,So is this every known lichen we're talking about?
00:35:20,00:35:23,It seems like it might be the definition of lichen
00:35:23,00:35:25,is this third thing.
00:35:25,00:35:27,It's a new order of fungus that does this.
00:35:27,00:35:28,"So it's an extra fungus,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,which is carried within the fungus
00:35:30,00:35:32,"that then takes to the, oh my God."
00:35:32,00:35:33,Exactly.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"It's very hard to blow this shit wide open,"
00:35:35,00:35:37,because a lot of it is just learning
00:35:37,00:35:39,about the original shit in the first place.
00:35:39,00:35:40,And I just blow some more shit wide open.
00:35:40,00:35:41,Please.
00:35:41,00:35:45,"So you know, there's a lot of species of lichen"
00:35:45,00:35:47,that they thought were just a single species.
00:35:47,00:35:48,"There's one in particular,"
00:35:48,00:35:51,which is called dic tionema glabratum.
00:35:51,00:35:53,And they thought it was just one species.
00:35:53,00:35:57,And it turns out that it's at least 126 different species
00:35:57,00:35:58,of lichen.
00:35:58,00:35:59,It's this one lichen that you'd never heard of.
00:35:59,00:36:00,I know.
00:36:00,00:36:03,It's actually 126 lichens that you'd never heard of.
00:36:03,00:36:04,It's amazing.
00:36:04,00:36:05,That's incredible.
00:36:05,00:36:08,Which lazy intern did the first count of that?
00:36:08,00:36:11,"Well, the problem is that when you take lichen"
00:36:11,00:36:12,"from the natural setting,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"if you see that in the, in the countryside,"
00:36:14,00:36:15,it might be lots of different colors.
00:36:15,00:36:17,It might be lots of different shapes and stuff like that.
00:36:17,00:36:19,"As soon as you take it into the lab,"
00:36:19,00:36:20,it loses all of its color.
00:36:20,00:36:24,It becomes like a boring gray brown sludge.
00:36:24,00:36:26,And they kind of all look the same at that point.
00:36:26,00:36:28,And so loads of people were finding the stuff
00:36:28,00:36:30,and bringing it back and they couldn't tell the difference.
00:36:30,00:36:32,And it's only when they look at the genes
00:36:32,00:36:33,that they can now tell the difference
00:36:33,00:36:34,between the different species.
00:36:34,00:36:35,"I'll tell you what,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"if anyone's thinking of becoming a lichenologist,"
00:36:37,00:36:39,"and I imagine after this chat,"
00:36:39,00:36:41,you're going to be applying.
00:36:41,00:36:41,Sure.
00:36:41,00:36:44,"Best place to do it, New Zealand, in my mind."
00:36:44,00:36:44,Really?
00:36:44,00:36:47,10% of the world's lichen is found in New Zealand.
00:36:47,00:36:50,"And as of 2019, they had fewer than five lichenologists."
00:36:50,00:36:51,Did they?
00:36:51,00:36:54,"You would have an absolute playground there,"
00:36:54,00:36:55,if you wanted to go and do that.
00:36:55,00:36:56,And wasn't that the place
00:36:56,00:36:58,that they had the sexy pavement lichen?
00:36:58,00:36:59,"It was, exactly."
00:36:59,00:37:00,Was it in one of our books?
00:37:00,00:37:02,We mentioned it in Book of the Year 2019.
00:37:02,00:37:04,"It was that New Zealanders, I believe,"
00:37:04,00:37:05,were told by the government
00:37:05,00:37:08,to stop licking lichen on the ground
00:37:08,00:37:10,because it was acting like Viagra.
00:37:10,00:37:13,But who was licking lichen off the ground?
00:37:13,00:37:13,"I don't think,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,I think they were taking it off the ground
00:37:15,00:37:16,and they were ingesting it in a different way.
00:37:16,00:37:18,Maybe in a tea or something.
00:37:18,00:37:18,"Oh, really?"
00:37:18,00:37:20,Mixed messages because the word lichen
00:37:20,00:37:22,comes from the Greek to lick.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"So, you know, what's going on there."
00:37:24,00:37:24,Lichen this.
00:37:24,00:37:25,Yeah.
00:37:25,00:37:26,"But yes, so they were getting an erection"
00:37:26,00:37:28,"when they had this lichen, right?"
00:37:28,00:37:28,"Yeah, exactly."
00:37:28,00:37:30,And so why were they not allowed to do it?
00:37:30,00:37:31,I think it was...
00:37:31,00:37:33,I can't actually remember.
00:37:33,00:37:33,Do you remember?
00:37:33,00:37:33,Yeah.
00:37:33,00:37:34,I think it was...
00:37:34,00:37:35,Who's going around stopping people
00:37:35,00:37:38,having perfectly healthy erections
00:37:38,00:37:41,based on snuffing pavement scrapings?
00:37:41,00:37:42,"Maybe if you get the wrong lichen,"
00:37:42,00:37:44,then maybe you deck falls off or something.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"You know, because they are hard to tell apart."
00:37:46,00:37:47,"So, that's probably that's true."
00:37:47,00:37:48,I do remember how it was.
00:37:48,00:37:49,What was it?
00:37:49,00:37:52,It was that basically you would get lots of heavy metals
00:37:52,00:37:55,leaching into it on the pavements and stuff.
00:37:55,00:37:57,You might get a dog poo in it.
00:37:57,00:37:58,You might get dog wee in it.
00:37:58,00:38:00,It's hard to regulate and make truly things.
00:38:00,00:38:01,It's hard to regulate.
00:38:01,00:38:03,There was high levels of lead they found.
00:38:03,00:38:05,They were found cadmium in it.
00:38:05,00:38:06,They found mercury.
00:38:06,00:38:07,They found arsenic.
00:38:07,00:38:09,And the US Food and Drugs Administration
00:38:09,00:38:11,bought one lot online
00:38:11,00:38:14,and found that it was actually 20% grass clippings
00:38:14,00:38:15,and 80% grammed up Viagra.
00:38:15,00:38:21,I would say be a lichenologist in Britain
00:38:21,00:38:22,"because the British Lichen Society,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,"as far as I can tell, are super on it."
00:38:24,00:38:26,They have an amazing website
00:38:26,00:38:28,and they just have a fabulous time.
00:38:28,00:38:30,They've got about 650 members.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"Oh yeah, a lot of competition there though, isn't there?"
00:38:32,00:38:34,Like Dan was saying only five lichen experts in New Zealand.
00:38:34,00:38:36,Fewer than five.
00:38:36,00:38:36,That's true.
00:38:36,00:38:38,I don't know why they're just in favor of the number.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"Yeah, that's what the auditorial said."
00:38:40,00:38:42,Surely you could just say three if that's what it was.
00:38:44,00:38:46,Actually in Britain it's useful to become a lichenologist
00:38:46,00:38:48,because I was going through the list of the presidents
00:38:48,00:38:51,"of this society, specifically the women."
00:38:51,00:38:52,And every single woman that I could find
00:38:52,00:38:55,"that had a Wikipedia article attached to their name,"
00:38:55,00:38:57,they've all got OBEs.
00:38:57,00:38:58,So I don't know what's going on in the lichen world
00:38:58,00:39:01,that the government is recognizing
00:39:01,00:39:02,"their work towards the country,"
00:39:02,00:39:04,but they've all got titles.
00:39:04,00:39:04,Wow.
00:39:04,00:39:06,"Yeah, so that's a quick way to an OBE,"
00:39:06,00:39:07,become a lichenologist.
00:39:07,00:39:10,"Wow, maybe there's some secret they're not telling us."
00:39:10,00:39:13,Doesn't feel like a quick way to become an OBE.
00:39:13,00:39:15,"Sorry, I think it takes years and years of craft."
00:39:15,00:39:18,It's not like become an OBE with this one weird trick.
00:39:18,00:39:22,I actually am not sure it does take that long.
00:39:22,00:39:24,Stop denigrating the work of the British lichen society.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"They're serious scientists, dude."
00:39:26,00:39:27,"Again, please don't write in."
00:39:27,00:39:29,It's the OBE committee that we're talking about.
00:39:29,00:39:31,"Oh, what they just see lichen and they just waggle it through."
00:39:31,00:39:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:32,00:39:33,"Oh, no, I'm saying it doesn't take long"
00:39:33,00:39:34,to become a lichenologist.
00:39:34,00:39:35,It takes a week.
00:39:35,00:39:36,"Okay, yeah, this is what Anna is saying."
00:39:36,00:39:38,That's my point.
00:39:38,00:39:41,This is because I was reading about Kerry Knudson
00:39:41,00:39:42,or Kerry Knudson.
00:39:43,00:39:46,Who's California's only professional lichenologist.
00:39:46,00:39:47,He's a really fun guy.
00:39:47,00:39:48,And he's published--
00:39:48,00:39:49,"He were then two, I believe."
00:39:49,00:39:51,California lichenologist.
00:39:51,00:39:52,He were then two.
00:39:52,00:39:55,He's published over 200 papers on them.
00:39:55,00:39:58,And he pretty much took up being a lichenologist
00:39:58,00:39:58,after he retired.
00:39:58,00:40:00,And now he maybe knows more about lichen
00:40:00,00:40:04,than anyone else in the world claims the Atlantic.
00:40:04,00:40:06,He was a construction worker for most of his life.
00:40:06,00:40:10,So he ran away from home at 16 to join an anarchist commune.
00:40:12,00:40:12,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
00:40:12,00:40:14,He was a construction worker.
00:40:14,00:40:14,Sorry.
00:40:14,00:40:16,So before he was a construction worker.
00:40:16,00:40:19,We built a lot of very wonky buildings along anarchic lines.
00:40:19,00:40:19,Yeah.
00:40:19,00:40:22,"No, he ran away at 16 before being a construction worker."
00:40:22,00:40:24,"Took lots of acid, wrote lots of poetry,"
00:40:24,00:40:27,"got into quite magic, was a big fan of Friend of the Podcast,"
00:40:27,00:40:28,Alistair Crowley.
00:40:28,00:40:32,And then he went off poetry
00:40:32,00:40:35,because he didn't like the modernism direction it was going in.
00:40:35,00:40:38,"So worked in construction, got some blood clots in his legs,"
00:40:38,00:40:40,had to retire prematurely in his 50s.
00:40:40,00:40:41,"And he said to his daughter,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,"""I'm going to go back behind the house"
00:40:43,00:40:45,"and I'm going to study whatever I find there."""
00:40:45,00:40:46,And he found lichen there.
00:40:46,00:40:49,And so now he's the world leading lichenologist.
00:40:49,00:40:52,And he named one after Obama.
00:40:52,00:40:54,That's his contribution to the lichen world.
00:40:54,00:40:55,"Oh, I've read about that one."
00:40:55,00:40:56,Yeah.
00:40:56,00:40:56,Yeah.
00:40:56,00:40:56,That was a big deal.
00:40:56,00:40:58,2008 huge deal.
00:40:58,00:41:03,You can age structures based on how fast lichen moves across it.
00:41:03,00:41:05,That's a fun thing to do.
00:41:05,00:41:06,Lichenometry.
00:41:06,00:41:08,"They're incredibly slow growing, some of them."
00:41:08,00:41:09,And I really like this.
00:41:09,00:41:12,The oldest lichens in the world are found in the Arctic.
00:41:12,00:41:16,And they're a species called rhizocarpum geographicum.
00:41:16,00:41:19,"And they have been aged at 8,600 years, some of them."
00:41:19,00:41:20,And they're still alive.
00:41:20,00:41:20,Yeah.
00:41:20,00:41:23,Which I think would make them the oldest living organism on the planet.
00:41:23,00:41:23,What?
00:41:23,00:41:26,"They also use them for detecting pollution levels, don't they?"
00:41:26,00:41:28,"So if you're in a very polluted area,"
00:41:28,00:41:32,"if a certain type of lichen is introduced and it doesn't grow,"
00:41:32,00:41:34,that means that the pollution levels are too high.
00:41:34,00:41:37,"And if you can bring them down and then the lichen starts growing there,"
00:41:37,00:41:39,that shows you that you're at the right level.
00:41:39,00:41:41,So it's a really interesting bar for--
00:41:41,00:41:43,"That's why, because there's always some dickhead on our country walk"
00:41:43,00:41:45,that you're going on when trees are covered in lichen.
00:41:45,00:41:48,"And there's always someone who goes, that's a good sign, actually."
00:41:48,00:41:50,That's because that means it's really clean air.
00:41:50,00:41:51,But isn't that true?
00:41:51,00:41:53,"Yes, it is, but it's just annoying."
00:41:53,00:41:54,They keep reminding me about it.
00:41:54,00:41:55,I get it.
00:41:55,00:41:56,OK.
00:41:56,00:41:57,"The tree looks a bit dirty, though."
00:41:57,00:41:59,It wouldn't like to be in your club.
00:41:59,00:42:01,This isn't a stressful country walking club.
00:42:01,00:42:04,"Hey, can I please get listeners to solve a crisis that I had this weekend,"
00:42:04,00:42:06,which is sort of like and related maybe.
00:42:08,00:42:09,I was in the children's.
00:42:09,00:42:12,I was staying in this little bit of woodland.
00:42:12,00:42:15,And we found a tree that was covered in ivy.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"And then the ivy looked like basically a dump truck,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"a dump, a load of mud on it."
00:42:19,00:42:22,"Like every single ivy leaf was covered in red, soily mud."
00:42:22,00:42:25,"And we realized we traced it, looking closely at the tree,"
00:42:25,00:42:28,"back to these sort of large dinner plate size,"
00:42:28,00:42:29,what looked like fungi.
00:42:29,00:42:33,"Bright white, kind of beautiful fungi growing straight out of the tree."
00:42:33,00:42:34,"And in their dinner plate, which was like a bowl,"
00:42:34,00:42:37,there were mountains of this red soil stuff.
00:42:37,00:42:42,"And I'm going to put, I am going to get a picture on the podcast Twitter feed."
00:42:42,00:42:43,On a drive engagement.
00:42:43,00:42:45,Some old degree.
00:42:45,00:42:46,And someone needs to tell me what it is.
00:42:46,00:42:50,Some names of lycan.
00:42:50,00:42:52,And you can tell me why they're called this.
00:42:52,00:42:52,OK.
00:42:52,00:42:55,"Um, so dog lycan."
00:42:55,00:42:56,Why is it called dog lycan?
00:42:56,00:42:57,Looks like a dog.
00:42:57,00:43:00,"No, it doesn't look like it's going to look like a dog."
00:43:00,00:43:02,It grows in the shape of Scooby-Doo.
00:43:02,00:43:05,It catches bulls in its mouth.
00:43:06,00:43:08,"No, not that."
00:43:08,00:43:14,"If dog's pee on it, it eats it up and makes it stronger than the other dog."
00:43:14,00:43:16,It grows towards the dog star.
00:43:16,00:43:16,Serious.
00:43:16,00:43:18,It's all amazing.
00:43:18,00:43:21,"Oh, it's, it's, it's hairy like a dog."
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Like if you were walking in the forest, you'd be like, that's a dog."
00:43:23,00:43:26,But that's the same as it looks like a dog.
00:43:26,00:43:28,That's just sea first answer.
00:43:28,00:43:29,Yeah.
00:43:29,00:43:29,"OK, I see."
00:43:29,00:43:31,Mix it with half a pint of warm milk.
00:43:31,00:43:34,And it can cure.
00:43:35,00:43:35,A dog?
00:43:35,00:43:36,Rabies.
00:43:36,00:43:38,"Rabies, correct."
00:43:38,00:43:41,"Named by Linnaeus in 1753, dog lycan."
00:43:41,00:43:41,Wow.
00:43:41,00:43:44,"Just in case anyone's listening who does happen to have bitten by a rabid dog,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,we should probably say it definitely doesn't cure rabies.
00:43:46,00:43:48,"No, go, go and get that."
00:43:48,00:43:50,Is the half pint of milk that does all the work out for rabies?
00:43:50,00:43:54,Genuinely glad you guys added that.
00:43:54,00:43:56,"Because in my head, that was how you cure it."
00:43:56,00:43:56,"OK, come on."
00:43:56,00:43:58,British soldier lycan.
00:43:58,00:44:00,"OK, for wounds on British soldiers, you would, you would put it."
00:44:00,00:44:00,That's good.
00:44:00,00:44:01,And it would sort of.
00:44:01,00:44:01,Nope.
00:44:01,00:44:02,I'm going to stick with my previous one.
00:44:02,00:44:04,Looks like a British soldier.
00:44:04,00:44:06,Does no one want to shag it?
00:44:06,00:44:09,You know how it was like the Americans came over and stole all the ladies?
00:44:09,00:44:09,Oh.
00:44:09,00:44:11,Because no one wants to shag the British.
00:44:11,00:44:12,Andy was right.
00:44:12,00:44:13,It looks like a British soldier.
00:44:13,00:44:15,Thank you very much.
00:44:15,00:44:18,"It has a red cap, which looks a bit like the red hats worn by British soldiers"
00:44:18,00:44:20,during the American Revolutionary War.
00:44:20,00:44:23,"And rock tripe, lycan."
00:44:23,00:44:24,Oh.
00:44:24,00:44:24,Rock tripe.
00:44:24,00:44:28,Tripe is innards and things like that.
00:44:28,00:44:28,So.
00:44:28,00:44:30,"Oh, is it one that lives inside a rock?"
00:44:30,00:44:33,"Because there are like, what are they called?"
00:44:33,00:44:35,They're like endolithic or something.
00:44:35,00:44:36,"Like, and they live literally inside rock."
00:44:36,00:44:37,That's cool.
00:44:37,00:44:38,Which is incredible.
00:44:38,00:44:42,"Outside a rock, but underneath a rock in a cave."
00:44:42,00:44:44,"Yeah, neither correct, but great answers."
00:44:44,00:44:44,Yeah.
00:44:44,00:44:45,That's really good.
00:44:45,00:44:46,Grows in a kind of string.
00:44:46,00:44:46,Andy.
00:44:46,00:44:47,Looks like tripe.
00:44:47,00:44:48,Looks like tripe.
00:44:48,00:44:48,Thank you.
00:44:48,00:44:51,Two out of three.
00:44:51,00:44:57,"Also was gathered by George Washington's troops, supposedly, and boiled into soup"
00:44:57,00:45:01,at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777.
00:45:01,00:45:02,"So that's, they ate it."
00:45:02,00:45:04,"Like tripe, but also it looks a bit like tripe."
00:45:04,00:45:08,"That's a pretty bad winter as well, when you're having to persuade yourself that what you're"
00:45:08,00:45:09,eating is tripe.
00:45:09,00:45:11,That's even worse than tripe.
00:45:11,00:45:16,There is a lycan called rock gnome lycan as well.
00:45:16,00:45:19,"And this is endangered, and no one's allowed to know where it is."
00:45:19,00:45:25,Because the US Fish and Wildlife Service said they had an option to label its location as
00:45:25,00:45:26,critical habitat.
00:45:26,00:45:30,"This is just, it's only found in like Georgia and the Carolinas and Tennessee in the mountains."
00:45:30,00:45:34,"And if you label something as critical habitat, that means people know where it is."
00:45:34,00:45:38,"You publish it, and then you get these lycan collectors who are over enthusiastic who go"
00:45:38,00:45:39,and nick it.
00:45:39,00:45:40,So they kept it super secret.
00:45:40,00:45:46,"And sweetly, the person who was in charge of guarding its location was a National Park"
00:45:46,00:45:47,Service botanist called Janet Rock.
00:45:47,00:45:49,That's cool.
00:45:49,00:45:51,And where is it in Georgia and the Carolinas?
00:45:51,00:45:53,"I'm not giving you any further details, James."
00:45:53,00:45:55,I'm just thinking I could do with an OBE quite soon.
00:45:56,00:46:05,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:46:05,00:46:07,And that is Andy.
00:46:07,00:46:11,My fact is that eBay employs staff whose job includes sniffing trainers.
00:46:11,00:46:12,Wow.
00:46:12,00:46:13,Yeah.
00:46:13,00:46:15,They're the shoe perverts of eBay.
00:46:15,00:46:17,And they are...
00:46:17,00:46:18,"For legal reasons, not."
00:46:18,00:46:21,"No, yeah, they're absolutely not perverts."
00:46:21,00:46:22,This is part of their job.
00:46:22,00:46:24,I don't want to need to make it any clearer.
00:46:24,00:46:25,These people are not perverts.
00:46:25,00:46:27,They're not getting a kick out of it.
00:46:27,00:46:28,Also got a sick thrill.
00:46:28,00:46:35,"This is because eBay sells a lot of shoes, which I didn't know because I'm not a sneak"
00:46:35,00:46:36,ahead is what they get called.
00:46:36,00:46:41,People who collect and trade and buy and sell and sometimes make a living selling shoes to
00:46:41,00:46:43,each other and collecting them.
00:46:43,00:46:45,Sounds like they're just people who wear them on the wrong bit of their body.
00:46:45,00:46:48,Could be the same.
00:46:50,00:46:57,"And so there are so many fake shoes on the market now, which are obviously not worth"
00:46:57,00:46:58,nearly as much as the real deal.
00:46:58,00:47:02,"You mean fake brands, the shoes, you could get your shoe onto your foot, right?"
00:47:02,00:47:03,It's not like you put your foot in it.
00:47:03,00:47:05,"You're like, ""Oh, that's an algae."""
00:47:05,00:47:08,It's not made of plamage and it turns out every damn time.
00:47:08,00:47:12,"No, they're real shoes, but they're not really made by Nike or whoever."
00:47:12,00:47:18,So eBay has got experts in trainer provenance whose job is to put shoes through their paces.
00:47:18,00:47:19,Nice.
00:47:19,00:47:20,Thank you.
00:47:20,00:47:25,To assess whether they're real or fake and any shoes that are worth over 150 quid that
00:47:25,00:47:27,are bought on eBay because they have to have some kind of lower floor in it.
00:47:27,00:47:28,They can't check all of them.
00:47:28,00:47:33,"Any shoes worth over 150 quid go through this center, sneak authentication center,"
00:47:33,00:47:36,and the seller doesn't get the money until the shoes have been authenticated and then
00:47:36,00:47:38,they get forwarded to the buyers.
00:47:38,00:47:42,And the smelling is part of that because there are so many different ways you can tell
00:47:42,00:47:43,whether a trainer is authentic or not.
00:47:43,00:47:48,"There's the stitching, there's the glue and the glue has a smell and all these other methods."
00:47:48,00:47:50,It's something like 52 elements.
00:47:50,00:47:52,They've identified the process to it.
00:47:52,00:47:54,"Yeah, so it's, as you say, it's the glue."
00:47:54,00:47:57,It's the quality of ink on the inside of the tongue.
00:47:57,00:47:59,There's the variations of color.
00:47:59,00:48:01,There's the smell check as well.
00:48:01,00:48:03,"Well, eBay are going on the road with this."
00:48:03,00:48:03,It's very exciting.
00:48:03,00:48:04,They're doing nationwide.
00:48:04,00:48:06,"What do you mean, like touring?"
00:48:06,00:48:06,I wouldn't watch that show.
00:48:06,00:48:08,Come to our show.
00:48:08,00:48:08,Come to our show instead.
00:48:08,00:48:09,Come to our show instead.
00:48:09,00:48:09,Come to our show instead.
00:48:09,00:48:11,It's basically that.
00:48:11,00:48:11,Okay.
00:48:11,00:48:14,"Well, I mean, basically they have an ice cream van."
00:48:14,00:48:16,I've slightly hyped up the nationwide tour element of it.
00:48:16,00:48:18,But the ice cream van is touring the country.
00:48:18,00:48:21,"And if you bring your sneakers along worth over a hundred quid,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,then they will authenticate them or not.
00:48:23,00:48:26,They will bust this shit wide open on your foot.
00:48:26,00:48:29,Will they fill one of my sneakers up with Mr. Whippy and put a flake in it?
00:48:29,00:48:31,"No, they won't."
00:48:31,00:48:33,"They're only doing a few dates as well on this tour,"
00:48:33,00:48:35,I think because ice cream vans can't go on the motorway.
00:48:35,00:48:37,And I presume they're going to have to take b-roads all the way around.
00:48:37,00:48:45,There was an amazing article on thisismoney.co.uk written by Grace Godson.
00:48:46,00:48:48,And she actually smelled the shoes
00:48:48,00:48:51,"and said that she could definitely tell the difference, the journalist."
00:48:51,00:48:55,"Yeah, she said that the ones that are fake"
00:48:55,00:48:59,"just kind of smell really chemically, a bit like nail varnish,"
00:48:59,00:49:03,"but the real ones smell more like tennis balls, according to her."
00:49:03,00:49:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:03,00:49:07,"And but she also said that if you want to work in these warehouses,"
00:49:07,00:49:10,"then you have to pass an entrance test,"
00:49:10,00:49:11,"which involves a blind test,"
00:49:11,00:49:14,whether can you tell a sneaker is real or fake just by smelling it?
00:49:15,00:49:17,So you have to pass that test to get the job.
00:49:17,00:49:18,"Wow, so weird."
00:49:18,00:49:19,Imagine them.
00:49:19,00:49:20,I think so they are blindfolded.
00:49:20,00:49:23,"Yeah, it's pretty weird, isn't it?"
00:49:23,00:49:23,That's cool.
00:49:23,00:49:25,It is cool. It's amazing.
00:49:25,00:49:26,"It must be so hard though,"
00:49:26,00:49:29,"because a lot of these sneakers, most of them are manufactured in China,"
00:49:29,00:49:30,in Chinese factories.
00:49:30,00:49:31,And the real ones?
00:49:31,00:49:33,"The real ones, but also the fake ones."
00:49:33,00:49:35,And the fake ones in the article I read say
00:49:35,00:49:38,that they're often attached literally to the real factory.
00:49:38,00:49:43,So you've got the sort of fake factory that's using 90% of the materials anyway.
00:49:43,00:49:46,So 90% of it is as close to the thing that you would have.
00:49:46,00:49:50,It's just the actual manufacturing and stitching together process.
00:49:50,00:49:51,That's so mad.
00:49:51,00:49:55,They're also employing trainers to test watches within the next couple of months.
00:49:55,00:49:56,Human trainers.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Human trainers.
00:49:57,00:49:58,Human trainers.
00:49:58,00:49:59,Humans sniff the trainers.
00:49:59,00:50:00,The trainers test the watches.
00:50:00,00:50:02,That's the centre.
00:50:02,00:50:04,I watched the trainers watching.
00:50:04,00:50:06,"I think the watches were first, actually."
00:50:06,00:50:08,"Oh, were they?"
00:50:08,00:50:09,"Oh, I think maybe they're upgrading."
00:50:09,00:50:12,I read that they were looking for a new tranche of watch trainers
00:50:12,00:50:14,in August this year.
00:50:14,00:50:18,I didn't realise that eBay gets almost all of its profits now from three items.
00:50:18,00:50:19,What are the three?
00:50:19,00:50:22,"Trainers, luxury watches, trading cards."
00:50:22,00:50:23,"Oh, really?"
00:50:23,00:50:24,Apparently.
00:50:24,00:50:30,The third category that has authentication from June 2021 is handbags.
00:50:30,00:50:32,Is it?
00:50:32,00:50:34,Maybe they're trying to branch out into a fourth direction.
00:50:34,00:50:35,Wow.
00:50:35,00:50:36,"As in you can get everything else on eBay,"
00:50:36,00:50:38,it's just that their shares are mostly going down.
00:50:38,00:50:41,People aren't buying other stuff on them anymore.
00:50:41,00:50:41,Interesting.
00:50:41,00:50:43,But those three things.
00:50:43,00:50:45,And the thing is with the authentication is
00:50:45,00:50:46,you as a buyer don't pay for it
00:50:46,00:50:48,and the seller doesn't pay for it either.
00:50:48,00:50:49,eBay pays for it.
00:50:49,00:50:51,"And you think, well, what's the point of that?"
00:50:51,00:50:54,"But actually, the sales of luxury items like watches and sneakers"
00:50:54,00:50:56,and probably soon handbags has gone up massively
00:50:56,00:50:59,since people have known that they're going to get the real deal.
00:50:59,00:51:00,Has it?
00:51:00,00:51:01,Interesting.
00:51:01,00:51:06,The growth in sneakers has gone up by triple digits year on year
00:51:06,00:51:07,for the last couple of years.
00:51:07,00:51:10,"Yeah, apparently they sell a pair every nine seconds."
00:51:11,00:51:14,"When companies make trainers and sneakers,"
00:51:14,00:51:16,"especially in the last 10, 15 years,"
00:51:16,00:51:19,"they often make them mostly in sizes eight, nine, and 10"
00:51:19,00:51:22,because they're the most popular sizes for men.
00:51:22,00:51:25,And men are the people who bought most of these trainers.
00:51:25,00:51:27,"But these days, more women are wanting these trainers."
00:51:27,00:51:30,And so the smaller sizes are rarer.
00:51:30,00:51:32,"And so if you're a counterfeiter,"
00:51:32,00:51:34,you're more likely to go for the smaller sizes
00:51:34,00:51:37,"because actually, you know, there's less on the market for them."
00:51:37,00:51:41,So you're more likely to find that women's trainers
00:51:41,00:51:43,are fake than the men's trainers.
00:51:43,00:51:46,But does it matter to sneakerheads?
00:51:46,00:51:47,A lot of these shoes are never worn.
00:51:47,00:51:48,That's the thing I find so weird and bizarre.
00:51:48,00:51:51,"But you still buy them in your size, usually."
00:51:51,00:51:53,"When you say never worn, are there really many people"
00:51:53,00:51:55,who are buying loads of sneakers that they don't intend to wear?
00:51:55,00:51:57,Collectors have hundreds of pairs.
00:51:57,00:51:57,It's mad.
00:51:57,00:52:00,"And a lot of them, they can't afford to wear themselves"
00:52:00,00:52:02,"because they don't want to wear out a $10,000 pair of sneakers."
00:52:02,00:52:03,They keep them because they have that value.
00:52:03,00:52:05,"If they wore them, they'd become really grubby"
00:52:05,00:52:06,and they'd lose their value.
00:52:06,00:52:08,But there can't be that many people that do that.
00:52:08,00:52:09,There are.
00:52:09,00:52:12,That's what's funding eBay and it's top three most important things.
00:52:12,00:52:14,It's a billion dollar industry.
00:52:14,00:52:16,"In the future, Dan, in 200 years, people will say,"
00:52:16,00:52:18,"""Did you know people used to wear these decorations on their feet?"""
00:52:18,00:52:21,"But yeah, that is true."
00:52:21,00:52:21,Yeah.
00:52:21,00:52:24,"And the other advantage of doing the women's shoes, for instance,"
00:52:24,00:52:27,"is because you need less materials to make them, of course."
00:52:27,00:52:29,So the markup is bigger.
00:52:29,00:52:31,I always buy shoes three sizes too big
00:52:31,00:52:34,so I can circumvent the possibility that they're fake.
00:52:34,00:52:39,"They do get, there are sometimes seizures of counterfeit sneakers"
00:52:39,00:52:41,at customs and ports and things like that.
00:52:41,00:52:46,"So in 2019, there was a Chinese guy called Qing Fuzeng"
00:52:46,00:52:50,who was arrested for allegedly importing 22 shipping containers
00:52:50,00:52:54,"of fake trainers into the USA disguised as napkins,"
00:52:54,00:52:56,"not disguised, labeled as napkins,"
00:52:56,00:53:00,which would have been worth $472 million.
00:53:00,00:53:03,It's just an insane amount of money that you can make
00:53:03,00:53:06,and he had this complicated system set up to get them in
00:53:06,00:53:07,and then get them distributed.
00:53:07,00:53:10,"That's why they make you take your shoes off as security, right?"
00:53:10,00:53:10,To test they're real.
00:53:10,00:53:14,"You just look back, the security people are huffing away at them,"
00:53:14,00:53:16,giving you a good sniff.
00:53:16,00:53:19,Anna was talking about buying shoes that were too big
00:53:19,00:53:21,and then putting loads of socks in there so that they fit.
00:53:21,00:53:24,"I didn't, I haven't actually come up with that workaround."
00:53:24,00:53:25,I just buy shoes that are too big.
00:53:25,00:53:27,But thank God you solved that blister problem.
00:53:27,00:53:31,"Well, the reason that I made that solution in my head"
00:53:31,00:53:34,is because I was reading about a guy called Jim Thorpe
00:53:34,00:53:36,who was the first Native American
00:53:36,00:53:37,to win a gold medal at the Olympics.
00:53:37,00:53:40,And he was in the Decathlon.
00:53:40,00:53:43,"So after the first day, he was miles ahead,"
00:53:43,00:53:45,but then someone stole his shoes.
00:53:45,00:53:48,So he didn't know what to do for the second day
00:53:48,00:53:50,because there were his only pair of shoes.
00:53:50,00:53:52,"So he looked around and he found like in the garbage,"
00:53:52,00:53:56,"like a couple of odd shoes and he wore them,"
00:53:56,00:53:58,but one of them was massively too big.
00:53:58,00:53:59,So he had to wear loads of pairs of socks.
00:54:00,00:54:01,And that fut.
00:54:01,00:54:05,So there are pictures of him in odd shoes
00:54:05,00:54:07,with one foot with loads of socks on.
00:54:07,00:54:10,"And in the second day, he won pretty much all the events"
00:54:10,00:54:13,and won the gold in the Decathlon in the 1912 Olympics.
00:54:13,00:54:15,"And on the same day, he also won,"
00:54:15,00:54:18,I think it was the long jump or the high jump
00:54:18,00:54:20,and the 110 meters hurdles
00:54:20,00:54:23,and the 1500 meters wearing odd shoes.
00:54:23,00:54:24,"Wow, very cool."
00:54:24,00:54:26,"Well, why doesn't everyone do that now?"
00:54:26,00:54:27,It's clearly an advantage.
00:54:27,00:54:28,"Must be, right?"
00:54:28,00:54:29,But also it sounds like he could have tried
00:54:29,00:54:31,"a bit harder just to get a pair of shoes, right?"
00:54:31,00:54:36,"Like if the Jamaicans were able to borrow a bobsled, surely."
00:54:36,00:54:38,"Guys, I only found out recently that shoes,"
00:54:38,00:54:40,you used to be able to inflate them yourself.
00:54:40,00:54:41,Sorry.
00:54:41,00:54:43,Because now I have to go to a shop to inflate them.
00:54:43,00:54:45,What are you talking about?
00:54:45,00:54:46,"All your shoes, blow up shoes."
00:54:46,00:54:48,"Okay, I'm glad you don't remember this, James,"
00:54:48,00:54:52,because this was during the sneaker wars of the 1990s.
00:54:52,00:54:52,You all remember.
00:54:52,00:54:54,The Nike versus Reebok.
00:54:54,00:54:55,"Oh, yeah."
00:54:55,00:54:56,"And this, yeah, yeah."
00:54:56,00:54:57,"And the pumps, yeah."
00:54:57,00:54:58,"The pumps, yeah."
00:54:58,00:55:00,"No, sorry, not with you on this."
00:55:00,00:55:00,Wasn't there Jordans?
00:55:00,00:55:02,"But they had the air pump as well, didn't they?"
00:55:02,00:55:02,Did there Jordans have a pump?
00:55:02,00:55:03,"Yeah, there Jordans had pumps."
00:55:03,00:55:06,"Look, I was not allowed to wear any cool shoes during the 1990s."
00:55:06,00:55:06,Okay.
00:55:06,00:55:07,Can someone explain this to me please?
00:55:07,00:55:08,So they used to be on the tongue.
00:55:08,00:55:10,"So, actually the pair of brogues, right?"
00:55:10,00:55:10,Thank you.
00:55:10,00:55:16,"You inflated them from the tongue,"
00:55:16,00:55:18,and this was an innovation by Reebok.
00:55:18,00:55:18,Their tongue.
00:55:18,00:55:19,Their...
00:55:19,00:55:24,Have you seen the movie Men in Tights?
00:55:24,00:55:25,"Robin Hood, Men in Tights."
00:55:25,00:55:25,I have not.
00:55:25,00:55:27,I wasn't allowed to watch that.
00:55:27,00:55:28,Okay.
00:55:29,00:55:31,But this apparently clinched it for Reebok for a while.
00:55:31,00:55:32,Nike's always been the big guy.
00:55:32,00:55:34,Reebok's always been the underdog.
00:55:34,00:55:37,And they had these self-inflate shoes.
00:55:37,00:55:38,So they...
00:55:38,00:55:39,No one bought them because they thought that's really weird.
00:55:39,00:55:42,And then there was just one slam dunk championship.
00:55:42,00:55:43,Basketball seems to be more about the shoes
00:55:43,00:55:44,than it is about the basketball.
00:55:44,00:55:47,You rarely get a team in barefoot winning the NBA.
00:55:47,00:55:49,Not since the 1912 Olympics.
00:55:49,00:55:53,"So this guy, D. Brown, did this move"
00:55:53,00:55:54,before he did his amazing slam dunk
00:55:54,00:55:56,"and won the competition,"
00:55:56,00:55:57,where he just bent down
00:55:57,00:55:59,and he pumped up his shoes with the tongue.
00:55:59,00:56:01,And then he slam dunked it.
00:56:01,00:56:03,"And then after that, the crowd went insane."
00:56:03,00:56:04,And then it became his thing.
00:56:04,00:56:06,"Every time he went to take a shot,"
00:56:06,00:56:06,he would pump up his shoes
00:56:06,00:56:08,and then deflate them afterwards.
00:56:08,00:56:09,"No, not in a match."
00:56:09,00:56:11,He wouldn't dribble the ball.
00:56:11,00:56:12,Not mid-match.
00:56:12,00:56:13,"Bend down, pump, yeah."
00:56:13,00:56:16,When you're doing a dunk from a standing position.
00:56:16,00:56:18,"You know the lingo, Dan."
00:56:18,00:56:19,You know what I'm trying to say.
00:56:19,00:56:21,"Well, and I don't know what we should just say for Andy."
00:56:21,00:56:23,I don't know the pump actually did anything.
00:56:23,00:56:25,"As in your shoe functioned,"
00:56:25,00:56:26,it wasn't like a deflated shoe
00:56:26,00:56:28,that you pumped air into.
00:56:28,00:56:29,It just was this sort of...
00:56:29,00:56:30,But this basketballer who pumped the tongue
00:56:30,00:56:32,"did that, that did have an effect, did it?"
00:56:32,00:56:33,"I mean, I don't know."
00:56:33,00:56:35,They always refused to say.
00:56:35,00:56:37,It suggested it had ankle support.
00:56:37,00:56:38,"And they were always asked,"
00:56:38,00:56:40,"""Does it give you a bit more bounce to make it pumpy?"""
00:56:40,00:56:40,"And they always said,"
00:56:40,00:56:43,"""We're refusing to say if I gave you a bit more bounce."""
00:56:43,00:56:44,"Well, I never noticed it."
00:56:44,00:56:45,You didn't know.
00:56:45,00:56:46,And you were pumped for ages.
00:56:46,00:56:48,It was just a cool thing to do.
00:56:48,00:56:49,It wasn't like having a pogo stick suddenly attached.
00:56:49,00:56:50,"No, exactly."
00:56:50,00:56:51,"Yeah, they weren't moonshoes."
00:56:51,00:56:53,There was a story this year
00:56:53,00:56:56,"about a lady who has made 2,500 pounds"
00:56:56,00:56:59,by selling old crisp packets from the 1980s.
00:56:59,00:57:00,"Oh, yeah."
00:57:00,00:57:01,But they had released figures
00:57:01,00:57:04,on how many of these ostensibly not very glamorous items
00:57:04,00:57:07,have been sold over a three-month period this year.
00:57:07,00:57:11,"350 crisp packets, 206 wine corks,"
00:57:11,00:57:14,"225 empty jam jars, 37 toilet roll tubes."
00:57:14,00:57:16,But it's hard to make a million from them
00:57:16,00:57:19,"because they, on average, go for two P each."
00:57:19,00:57:20,"That's a cheap telescope, though,"
00:57:20,00:57:21,if you want to make a...
00:57:21,00:57:23,That's true.
00:57:23,00:57:24,That's true.
00:57:24,00:57:25,I think people must be buying crisp packets
00:57:25,00:57:28,"to do the blow it up and bang it thing,"
00:57:28,00:57:29,which I love doing.
00:57:29,00:57:30,But I don't eat enough crisps
00:57:30,00:57:32,to do that as often as I'd want to.
00:57:32,00:57:33,I just thought it was set dressing
00:57:33,00:57:35,for a TV show in the 1980s.
00:57:35,00:57:37,It's weird where our brains go
00:57:37,00:57:38,because I was thinking you would buy it
00:57:38,00:57:40,and hopefully there's a few little crumbs of crisps
00:57:40,00:57:41,left in the car.
00:57:41,00:57:43,And you can lick your finger and get them out.
00:57:43,00:57:45,We've all got good reasons.
00:57:45,00:57:46,"But, I mean, that's true."
00:57:46,00:57:48,"You won't be able to taste the '80s again, will you?"
00:57:48,00:57:48,No.
00:57:48,00:57:50,That's slogan for your firm.
00:57:50,00:57:51,A trade on these things.
00:57:51,00:57:52,Taste the '80s.
00:57:52,00:57:53,"Yeah, great."
00:57:53,00:57:55,You can taste the 2010s
00:57:55,00:57:58,by buying the pre-sugar tax drinks
00:57:58,00:57:59,that are available on eBay.
00:57:59,00:58:01,I genuinely thought about buying
00:58:01,00:58:02,"one of these for my brother,"
00:58:02,00:58:04,who I've never seen him so furious
00:58:04,00:58:06,as when LucasAid halved the sugar content
00:58:06,00:58:07,in their drinks.
00:58:07,00:58:08,It hasn't been the same.
00:58:08,00:58:09,It doesn't taste the same.
00:58:09,00:58:12,"So, in 2018, the sugar in iron brew halved."
00:58:12,00:58:15,There was lots of rules over the last few years
00:58:15,00:58:16,"saying, you know, you've got to reduce your sugar."
00:58:16,00:58:19,And you can buy a LucasAid pre-2011
00:58:19,00:58:21,for £145.
00:58:21,00:58:21,OK.
00:58:21,00:58:23,I might just suck it out of order.
00:58:23,00:58:24,"That's quite a lot, isn't it?"
00:58:24,00:58:27,But imagine how good that's going to taste
00:58:27,00:58:28,now after all these years.
00:58:28,00:58:30,"I'm with your brother, actually."
00:58:30,00:58:32,I think modern pop is disgusting.
00:58:32,00:58:32,Really?
00:58:32,00:58:33,Can you taste the difference?
00:58:33,00:58:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:58:33,00:58:34,Really?
00:58:34,00:58:34,I don't think so.
00:58:34,00:58:35,"I don't think so, really."
00:58:35,00:58:37,"But ironically, you listen to a lot of modern pop,"
00:58:37,00:58:38,which I find disgusting.
00:58:38,00:58:46,"OK, that's it."
00:58:46,00:58:47,That is all of our facts.
00:58:47,00:58:48,Thank you so much for listening.
