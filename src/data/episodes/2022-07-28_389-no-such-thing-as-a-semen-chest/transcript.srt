1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,200
 Afternoon all, you must know by now if you've been paying attention over the last couple of months

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,800
 that I have for some reason committed to traveling the country with these three upcoming idiots.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,640
 We are going to all sorts of exotic places like Ipswich, Barnstable, Pool, Reading,

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,120
 Peterborough, Chesterfield, but popping over to Dublin, we're going up to Scotland,

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,240
 few locations there. Obviously, sitting on a tour bus for months on end with Dan, James and Andy

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,480
 is not how any sane person would choose to spend their time. The only thing that's going to make

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,080
 it bearable is if you guys come along too, please know such things at fish.com has all the details,

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,120
 get tickets, come and watch us. There'll be an exclusive first half which will never be available

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,760
 anywhere else and then we'll be doing a different podcast every night for the second half. See you there.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:01:05,120
 [Music]

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,360
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,080
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a humongous distance

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,360
 from Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,920
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,920
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that's my fact, my fact this week is that

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,600
 it would take people around 10 minutes to adjust to the way Abraham Lincoln sounded before they

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,520
 could enjoy his speeches. Wow. So the first 10 minutes of his speeches always really shit because

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,280
 he knows it has to be filler and at the 10 minute mark he launches into the real stuff. He does the

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,400
 whole what do you do, what's your job, you know, emceeing moments. Hang on Dan, Abraham Lincoln's

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,160
 most famous speech was the Gettysburg Address where I believe he spoke for two minutes.

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,720
 And also his most famous line is the first line of that address isn't it? Oh no, yeah you're right.

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,920
 It's true. Oh I would say it was the last line so it's the last line. Wasn't it Shall Not Parish from

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,040
 the Earth line? Yes it was the first line, four score. I really would have gone the four score

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,120
 as the big line. Would you? And I would go by the people too, the people four the people with the

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,040
 people. You didn't understand the first minute and a half though did you? That's true because I

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
 was so distracted by his weird voice. What's his weird voice? Did he have an accent? He did have an

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,040
 accent but he also had a much higher voice than you would think so I guess all of us probably had

28
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,120
 an introduction to Abraham Lincoln's supposed voice through the movies and so on. For me it was

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,400
 Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Incredibly Low. I watched that this weekend. Did you? Well

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,880
 you would have seen it then. My niece had never seen it, she's only nine and so yeah. Right.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,120
 Introduced her to it, it's brilliant. It's a fantastic movie. Talk about that.

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,240
 So he comes out at the end and he does the four score and it's a very baritone

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,920
 war score and that's what we know is Lincoln but all of the contemporary accounts of his

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,920
 speeches say that he had a tenor's voice, a much higher voice and as a result there's a historian

35
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,840
 called Harold Holzer who's written over 40 books on both Lincoln and the Civil War and he found

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
 that there were all these accounts of journalists saying that for the first 10 minutes people just

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,680
 really had to adjust to both the accent and the sound matched with this tall human who was quite

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,320
 gangly and just putting all the things together. It took 10 minutes before they could settle in

39
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,560
 and go oh okay he's actually saying amazing stuff. It sounds like a really weird voice

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
 all because obviously no recording. Your good at voices, Adley, can you do us a little?

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,120
 He had a thin tenor or rather falsetto voice almost as high-pitched as a Boson's whistle.

42
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:49,680
 All the reviews are so negative of him. The New York Herald said he had a frequent tendency

43
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,600
 to dwindle into a shrill and unpleasant sound. It just sounds yeah. Some people think it was

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,240
 useful though because like there were some famous debates he did with a guy called Stephen A. Douglas

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,120
 and he had quite a baritone voice Stephen A. Douglas but they think that maybe in a big crowd

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,200
 the baritone might sometimes get lost there and the people at the back will be able to hear the

47
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,440
 high pitch sounds better. Yes, how interesting. Is that like when your neighbours are having a party

48
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,960
 and you can hear the bass much more indistinctly but the high stuff is what really annoys you?

49
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,880
 Yeah. For me it's the bass. Is that a joke? No. The bass is the annoying bit right? The bass is

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,160
 the bit that keeps you. Yes, you're right. Okay, so it's like the opposite of my life with my neighbours.

51
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,760
 It's another brilliant analogy from Andy Murray. The whole thing of it being the voice being low,

52
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,240
 the first time I think I've then heard the higher voices when Daniel Day-Lewis played him

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,080
 in the Spielberg movie. It's a fantastic movie. It's still Bill and Ted. It's no Bill and Ted.

54
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
 Yeah, I read an article in the Library of Congress and they said that his voice is closer to that

55
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,840
 Daniel Day-Lewis voice than any other impression that anyone's ever done. They even said it was

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,000
 more close than the one Andy is going to do on the podcast in a few weeks' time on that article.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,480
 So when Daniel Day-Lewis was cast for the movie, which was after Liam Neeson had to drop out,

58
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,200
 he spent a year prepping. Was Liam Neeson going to play Lincoln? Liam Neeson was going to play Lincoln.

59
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,480
 I don't know if I take a role that I was second to Liam Neeson. Well, I think Daniel Day-Lewis

60
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,200
 was the original choice. He said no to it and then Liam Neeson got involved and then Liam Neeson

61
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,840
 had a horrible role. I know, yeah. Surely then Daniel Day-Lewis said, "Oh god, fine, I will do it,

62
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,680
 my lord. I'm going to find whoever stole my hat and I'm going to rip their heads from the body."

63
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:46,720
 Yeah, so he took on the role and he spent a year, possibly more, prepping for it. Read over 100

64
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,360
 books and that's when he was trying to find the voice, the voice of Lincoln. And when he

65
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
 eventually found it - Probably reading the wrong books, wasn't he? I made an audio book.

66
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,240
 Well, he eventually decided on what the voice was. He recorded it with a neighbour and he posted it

67
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,120
 to Steven Spielberg in a package where he drew a skull and crossbones on it and put a black mark on

68
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,520
 it because he wanted no one but Steven Spielberg to read to hear it first. Yeah, interesting and

69
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,160
 exciting to be tempered with. If it was just a blank envelope, I'd be like, "Yeah, fine, I'm not

70
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,880
 interested in that." All of a sudden, he didn't treasure that. Exactly. I don't know what he was

71
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,720
 thinking. It sounds very odd filming with him because he is your classic method actor, I guess.

72
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,680
 Daniel Day-Lewis and he insisted on being Lincoln on set, so he talked in that voice the entire

73
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,000
 time on and off set for months and months when they were filming. He never didn't talk in the voice.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,120
 He wouldn't allow any accents other than American accent around him in case that put him off his

75
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,040
 flow. He made everyone refer to him as Mr. President throughout filming. I think Spielberg

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,800
 insisted on that as well. Did he? Why they're both presidents? It was very confusing, battle of the

77
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,480
 presidents. No, no, he said, "Let's buy into this." Oh, so he said that everyone had to call Day-Lewis

78
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,200
 President? I believe so because he started coming in irreappropriate clothing as well as the director

79
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,320
 to sort of make it. Spielberg did that and Daniel Day-Lewis was not on the call sheet. Abraham

80
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,720
 Lincoln was on the call sheet instead. How do you dress irreappropriate as a film director if

81
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,280
 you're dressing for the 1860s? Surely, yeah, he just walks in and he went, "Sorry, we can't make a

82
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,720
 film because film hasn't been invented." Everyone go home. There's one journalist who described

83
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,880
 Lincoln as a slang-wanging stump speaker. That is a great phrase, isn't it? It's a really good

84
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,800
 phrase. He was known for being humble, which some people cast as maybe not sophisticated enough in

85
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,920
 his language, slang-wanging. He's wanging the slang around. His accent, we were saying before,

86
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,320
 was kind of different as well, right? So whenever he was supposed to say chairman, he would say

87
00:07:52,320 --> 00:08:00,880
 "Cheerman." Cheerman. Cheerman. Cheerman. What about this? If he ever said "Winder." Winder.

88
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,400
 That's window. Window, right. Learned would be "Larrant," and he would always say "Recum" instead

89
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:19,440
 of "Assume." That sounds really different. But equally strangely, he also had a lot of misspellings

90
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,640
 in his written work as well, and he would often spell the word "Inaugural" wrong. Oh, yeah.

91
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,920
 But we think that perhaps that gives a clue as to how he spoke as well. If he spelled it slightly

92
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,240
 differently, maybe he spoke it that way as well. Right. Was it radically different? Did it start

93
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,480
 with a Q? No, it would be "Inaugural" instead of "Inaugural." Right. "Inaugural."

94
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,520
 And he stood so still. This was another report of the way he spoke. So his law partner was a man

95
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,000
 called William Herndon, and Herndon recorded that, I don't know why he said this, but he said "You

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 could leave a silver dollar between his feet at the start of his speech, and it would still be

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,440
 there at the end." I have a theory for why he did this. So I was reading accounts of young Lincoln.

98
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
 I don't think he actually did that. I'm just - what do you mean? He didn't actually leave

99
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
 a dollar between his feet at the start. No, no, no, but he stood in credit. The point was

100
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,960
 to make the point. I thought you were saying that he had done that. I have a theory that the coin

101
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,760
 was magic. He used to be a busker, and he always put a few quotes there to just get people to know.

102
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,800
 No, my theory, which probably is an established reason as opposed to a theory,

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,120
 is when he was young, he used to sit up late at night, and he used to listen to his dad tell

104
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,040
 stories to all of his friends. Really funny stories. Lincoln was obsessed with them.

105
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,880
 So in the morning, he would go and he would find his friends, and he would tell all the stories

106
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,960
 that his dad had told the night before, and he would stand on a tree stump, and that is where

107
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,160
 he would deliver all of his speeches. So he didn't have much of a stage. He had the space

108
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,280
 of a tree stump, and that would have informed the lack of leg movement, which then took him

109
00:09:51,280 --> 00:10:02,240
 to presidency when he was doing his inaugural speech. The Gettysburg Address was not him.

110
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,840
 Wow, okay, this is a crazier theory than my tree stump theory.

111
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,400
 This is, he stood so still because it was actually a robot. No, the Gettysburg Address

112
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,600
 was someone else delivered it. So really, at the event where he delivered the Gettysburg Address,

113
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,000
 he was supposed to be giving a very short closing dedication, which is why it was only

114
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,240
 two minutes long. It was just very quick. Thanks for coming, guys. Thank God these bloats gave

115
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
 their lives for the Civil War, et cetera. If there's a carriage in the park with the license plate,

116
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,760
 it's blocking the way you need to move your carriage. Exactly. The person who was supposed

117
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,520
 to give what they were calling the Gettysburg Address at the time was this great orator and

118
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,760
 politician, pastor, who was called Edward Everett. And his was two hours long. So that could be the

119
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,680
 one we all knew off by heart. Wow, really? So did he actually do that two hour speech first?

120
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
 He did a two hour speech, which means it's incredible people had the energy to listen

121
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,320
 to Lincoln after that. He did the two hours and then. I wonder they loved it so much.

122
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,240
 I think he was sick at the time as well, Lincoln, when he then gave the speech afterwards and it

123
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,440
 kind of bombed, I guess, after a two hour speech. Yeah, it got terrible reviews everywhere. So

124
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,240
 the Times said that the inauguration of the cemetery at Gettysburg was an imposing ceremony

125
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,520
 only rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln.

126
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:27,680
 He got a really, yeah. And in fact, there was an apology issued in 2013 by a newspaper called

127
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,040
 The Patriot News, who gave him a really bad review at the time. They said it was silly remarks and

128
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,360
 that maybe he was drunk and that it deserved the veil of oblivion. And then in 2013, they recanted.

129
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,720
 Of all the things he should be apologizing for, it does feel quite far down the list.

130
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,840
 When did Lincoln become President? How do you all know? 1860?

131
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,280
 Yeah. So when do you think the first town was named after him?

132
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,960
 I would have guessed a few years after the Civil War or maybe soon after it.

133
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,440
 Okay, I'm going to go the opposite direction and say he was an influential lawyer and maybe that

134
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
 led to something. So two years before he was President as well.

135
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
 Wow. Who are you and what have you done with Dan Shriver? That is absolutely correct.

136
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,320
 It was 1853 because he was a lawyer. Some people who were setting up a new town brought him in to

137
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,560
 kind of sign the deeds and they said, would you mind if we named this town after you?

138
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,360
 God, that's flattering.

139
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,760
 That's Lincoln, Illinois, which is still there today. And at noon that day, he purchased two

140
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,200
 watermelons, carried them to the public square and squeezed the watermelon juice out onto the

141
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,920
 ground. Did he use his thighs? Call back.

142
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,320
 And then he said to the people, nothing bearing the name Lincoln ever amounted to much.

143
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
 So he said that they shouldn't really have called it after him.

144
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,680
 That's very cool.

145
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,240
 One thing from the time that Lincoln was President was that the White House was an

146
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,840
 open house at the time, which is so bizarre to think of now obviously because there are

147
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,840
 two miles of security around it. But people were just walking in all the time.

148
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,520
 You could just walk into the White House and people were free to climb in through the windows.

149
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
 They camped outside his office door.

150
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,400
 If it's open, why'd they go through the windows?

151
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,360
 Idea, actually.

152
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,920
 But they were demanding jobs from him. It was just, the whole thing was carnage.

153
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,280
 He's the president of the country.

154
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,080
 He must have had one room where it was like, do not enter.

155
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,880
 Well, he had an office.

156
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,160
 They had to cut it down to two, five hour sessions a week where you could just

157
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,200
 knock on the door and go and see him and chat to him and ask for a job.

158
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,840
 Ten hours a week of his working time was spent just being harangued by people

159
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,160
 and he called them his public opinion baths and people would just leave inventions that

160
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,960
 they thought he might like to look at. It's insane and he couldn't walk from the office

161
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,040
 to his own private living quarters without being bothered along the way by people asking for jobs

162
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,720
 and the White House maintenance people had to build a partition to say, no, he actually just

163
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,920
 needs a corridor that he can walk along without being bothered all the time.

164
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,280
 Corridor of power.

165
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,880
 Yes. It's mad.

166
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,680
 I suppose it's kind of like an MP surgery, isn't it today?

167
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,000
 Yeah.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,640
 But, you know.

169
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,600
 For 10 hours a week.

170
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,880
 For the quarter of your working time.

171
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
 For the president of the United States.

172
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,960
 I know.

173
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,800
 I think he did more than 40 hours a week.

174
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,760
 Maybe at the height of the war.

175
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,400
 Yeah, you're right.

176
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,440
 And now he bothers presidents because isn't he constantly reported?

177
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,280
 Not constantly, but by a few, the ghost of Lincoln seen in the White House.

178
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,680
 Right.

179
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,960
 The people of, you know, presidents have said, yeah, yeah, I saw the ghost of Lincoln.

180
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,440
 Wow.

181
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
 Yeah.

182
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,280
 That's him.

183
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:34,640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

184
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,520
 My fact this week is that 5,000 years ago,

185
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,560
 Scots built houses by dropping huge piles of stones to the bottom of locks

186
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,160
 and building their home on top of them.

187
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,360
 That's amazing.

188
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,000
 It's so amazing.

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
 It's such a weird way of doing it.

190
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,360
 And we don't know why they did it.

191
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,280
 These are things called crannogs.

192
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
 I mean, if you live in Scotland, it's very likely you know about them.

193
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,720
 I actually didn't know about them at all.

194
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,600
 Yeah, never heard of them.

195
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
 But there are about 600 of them known about so far.

196
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,640
 They're artificial islands that were built in locks

197
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,520
 and they would be connected to the shore by like a little causeway.

198
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,360
 And until quite recently, it was thought they'd dated back to about 800 BC.

199
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,160
 And then they just did some radiocarbon dating of pottery

200
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
 that's been sunken around them.

201
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,440
 And they found out it actually dates back to 3,600 BC.

202
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,520
 Oh, that's a good dough.

203
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,320
 Before Stonehenge, before the pyramids,

204
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
 the Scots were just piling up stones in locks

205
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,320
 and building a house on top for no apparent reason.

206
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,240
 It's not just piling stones, right?

207
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,960
 Like there's so much engineering that goes around it.

208
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,920
 Yeah, it's so impressive.

209
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,520
 So the word crannog is Gaelic for son of tree or young tree.

210
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,040
 And the idea is because they would cut these huge long timber piles

211
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,520
 and they ram them into the beds of the lock

212
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,920
 and then they would pile the stones in around them.

213
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
 So they had a solid wooden foundation.

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,400
 So you've got like a scaffold that you can stuff full.

215
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
 Yeah, I think there are different types as well,

216
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,160
 aren't there? There are some that are just timber.

217
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
 So they're just kind of wooden platforms

218
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,600
 and then there are some that are stones.

219
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,400
 Yeah, exactly.

220
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,320
 And we've tried to remake them in modern times

221
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,720
 and it's taken about three years to construct one

222
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,000
 to be in a similar, using the technology and so on.

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,680
 Drive the piles into the bed of the lock.

224
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,400
 Exactly.

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,240
 They have to get meters into the bed of the lock.

226
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,960
 And you know, that's obviously incredibly hard to do from a floating surface.

227
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,680
 Well, I think what happens is you put some stones

228
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,480
 near the shore and then you put some a little bit further away

229
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,040
 and a little bit further away and you put like a path

230
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,800
 to the middle of the lock or not the middle,

231
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
 maybe a few meters away from the edge.

232
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
 And then you build it from there.

233
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
 So you kind of make a causeway first.

234
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,360
 And if you look from above,

235
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,400
 you can kind of see the little causeway underneath the water.

236
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,560
 Yeah.

237
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,440
 And then how do you get the pile to go so deep into the bed?

238
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,600
 Oh yeah, I mean, it's all crazy.

239
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
 How do you do it?

240
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,240
 I think we'll know.

241
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,400
 You pile up on top like a circus trick.

242
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,080
 You just have people standing in front of each other.

243
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,720
 It's the ghost of Lincoln, I think is coming out again.

244
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,400
 In flyers stuff.

245
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,680
 If it's the Loch Ness Monster.

246
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,800
 It's aliens, of course it's aliens.

247
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,400
 No, we have no idea, do we?

248
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,240
 It's absolutely amazing.

249
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,760
 Live there until the 17th century,

250
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,920
 apparently the last people were living on crannogs.

251
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,960
 So pretty relatively recent compared with when they were built.

252
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,880
 I think the ones where we found the pottery,

253
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,040
 we're not sure if people actually lived there, right?

254
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,440
 Yeah.

255
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,680
 So the reason that we think they might not have lived

256
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,920
 on these particular ones is because there isn't any domestic waste around there.

257
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,200
 You do have these pots, there's no human remains,

258
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,000
 so we don't think it's a funeral thing.

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,240
 So we think it might be some kind of feast,

260
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,040
 maybe some kind of rite of passage, that kind of thing.

261
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,480
 So what has happened is people have brought some pots to this island,

262
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
 this fake island, done something,

263
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
 thrown the pots in the water and then left.

264
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,400
 It's a bar.

265
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,160
 I mean, that's obviously just a bar.

266
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,800
 It could be.

267
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,760
 Tiki bar.

268
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
 Yeah, it's a bar.

269
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,040
 You're pissed, you toss your pot away,

270
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,720
 you can't be asked to carry it home.

271
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,760
 It's a Scottish pub.

272
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,600
 The first pubs.

273
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,960
 It sounds so exciting being the person who discovered that they were really old.

274
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,240
 So they are 3,000 years older than we thought they were.

275
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
 And it was a retired navy diver called Chris Murray

276
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,600
 who first kind of discovered this and it was 10 years ago

277
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,720
 and he was just going for a dive and he saw some pots

278
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,280
 and then he sent them off to be analysed and turned out

279
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,360
 they were 5,500 years old.

280
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,720
 But he was saying that in 2020 he was going for a dive

281
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,160
 and he found a 5,500 year old drinking vessel.

282
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,800
 He just saw a little fragment sticking out of the mud.

283
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,600
 So he took it and then he took a sip of water from it

284
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,200
 and you can think the last time someone did this

285
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,680
 was over five millennia ago.

286
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,160
 Yeah.

287
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
 Isn't that so cool?

288
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,160
 It is amazing.

289
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,240
 Maybe people will be doing that with our old horrible ribena cartons

290
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,800
 and plastic festival cups in 5,000 years.

291
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,360
 Yeah, sure.

292
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,800
 What a nice thought.

293
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,680
 What a lovely thought.

294
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,520
 All the plastic will still be there, won't it?

295
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,160
 Yep.

296
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,960
 Yeah.

297
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
 Artificial islands?

298
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,520
 Oh, yeah.

299
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:43,760
 Yeah.

300
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,360
 So lots of artificial islands in the world.

301
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,320
 I didn't know about the ones in Bolivia Imperial and Lake Titicaca.

302
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,280
 Yeah, I've heard that.

303
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,080
 They're amazing.

304
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
 I've stayed on them.

305
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,840
 Thank you.

306
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,880
 Thank you.

307
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,760
 Wow, the floating ones.

308
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,520
 The floating ones, the reed islands, yeah.

309
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,080
 So yeah, these are islands made of weeds woven together

310
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
 and they're made by indigenous people

311
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
 and it seems like they were just made by the Uro people

312
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 and basically they got to the shores of Lake Titicaca

313
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,760
 hoping to set up camp and like take residence there 1,000 years ago

314
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
 and they realized there were people there.

315
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,440
 There was the Quechua people, the Aymara people there.

316
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
 So they were like, well, we can't live here.

317
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,520
 What should we do?

318
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
 So they built some platforms

319
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
 and then just sailed out into the middle of a lake

320
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,760
 and they still hang out there.

321
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,800
 Yeah, it's really cool.

322
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,120
 When I was there, they said that they went there

323
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,160
 because there was taxes they wanted to get away with.

324
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,960
 So it was like a literal offshore account that they went so they can tax them.

325
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,120
 But some people think it was because there was a war

326
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,840
 and they went there so that people couldn't attack them.

327
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,080
 But yeah, they taught me how to make the reeds

328
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,040
 and stuff like that.

329
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,240
 Oh, cool.

330
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,880
 So because you have to constantly sort of,

331
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
 it's like repainting a bridge, right?

332
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,560
 Like you're constantly fixing the reeds.

333
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,480
 So near to where the islands are,

334
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,560
 there's loads of massive reeds and you go over there

335
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,080
 and you cut them down and then you kind of turn them into like little,

336
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,360
 not like bricks, but like little groups of reeds.

337
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,200
 And I went on a boat to the school

338
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,560
 because they have a floating school

339
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,800
 and a floating basketball court and stuff.

340
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,600
 Oh, wow.

341
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,560
 I was staying with family of Uros and it was really cool.

342
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,200
 Wow.

343
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,920
 Highly recommend that.

344
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,960
 It's so amazing.

345
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
 Have you heard of Mischief Reef?

346
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,360
 It's another created island.

347
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,600
 And it's a new island that's been created by China.

348
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
 And it's in the, is it the South China Sea?

349
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,720
 I think it is.

350
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,120
 Probably.

351
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
 It's why they do most of their island creations.

352
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,560
 They are creating a lot of islands at the moment.

353
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,720
 And it's causing a lot of mischief.

354
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,120
 Yeah.

355
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,160
 They are, they genuinely are.

356
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
 I tried to work out, was this called Mischief Reef

357
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,080
 before China started creating military runways

358
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,200
 and hangers and, you know, missile bases?

359
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
 It's quite an innocuous term.

360
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,320
 It's Naughty Boy Island.

361
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:44,960
 Yeah.

362
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,000
 Silly Billy.

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,160
 Mischief Reef is one of the biggest.

364
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
 And you can see photos of it from, you know,

365
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,520
 15 years ago, photos now.

366
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
 And it looks like a different place.

367
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
 It is a different place, actually,

368
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
 because it's been imported and installed

369
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 and concreted and all over.

370
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,240
 But there's this bizarre war of attrition

371
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,760
 going on, kind of Cold War style,

372
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,800
 between the China who are building these islands,

373
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,000
 which are contested, by the way.

374
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,360
 The ownership is contested.

375
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,640
 And the US Navy.

376
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
 So the US Navy keeps on sailing close to them

377
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,640
 to make the point.

378
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
 They do a thing called a phonop,

379
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,040
 which is a freedom of navigation operation.

380
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,920
 And if you have a land,

381
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,080
 I think the barrier is 12 miles.

382
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,160
 Like that's how far your border stretches

383
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,920
 into the ocean, if the island is definitely yours.

384
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,080
 I know there are different sort of definitions,

385
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
 but the USA pointedly sails within 12 miles

386
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,360
 of mischief reef to make the point,

387
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,880
 these are international waters,

388
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
 according to the international community.

389
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
 So we're going to keep on doing it.

390
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,960
 And it hasn't broken into a conflict yet.

391
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
 Oh, a little bit, hasn't it?

392
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,360
 Because, like, I think Philippines want it.

393
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,400
 Japan wants it.

394
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,440
 Indonesia wants it.

395
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,320
 Russia wants it.

396
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,000
 It's like, yeah, it's dodgy.

397
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,280
 But do you remember I was telling you guys

398
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,600
 about in Bhutan, on the border between Bhutan and China?

399
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,840
 China has just started building villages.

400
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,520
 Yes, yes.

401
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,400
 And no one noticed.

402
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,080
 And like, in Bhutan, they started.

403
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,240
 In Bhutan, yeah, like the Bhutanese noticed,

404
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,520
 and they were like, well,

405
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,920
 shall we tell the Chinese not to do this anymore?

406
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,360
 Or shall we just kind of leave it?

407
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,640
 And they just kind of left it

408
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
 because there are other things that they want

409
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,720
 to have a good deal with China about.

410
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,040
 But then the international community are like,

411
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,160
 well, last time we looked here,

412
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,400
 there weren't three villages and an airport.

413
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,600
 And they're, you know--

414
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,240
 Oh, man.

415
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,720
 Yeah.

416
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,160
 I thought it was called "Mischief Islands"

417
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,000
 because of a ship.

418
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,400
 Oh, really?

419
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,040
 Called the mischief.

420
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,520
 My lobby.

421
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,120
 Yeah, I think it's in dedication to a ship

422
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
 that used the passing that.

423
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,360
 I could be wrong about that, but--

424
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,320
 A GMS mischief.

425
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,160
 Yeah, I think that's possibly right.

426
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,920
 It's a party cruise ship, wasn't it?

427
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,800
 It's a Swingers cruise.

428
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,480
 Here's an island that I'd never heard of.

429
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,080
 Dejima.

430
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,440
 Oh, yeah.

431
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,200
 This was created in Nagasaki Bay

432
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
 in the 17th century in Japan.

433
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,640
 And during the Edo period,

434
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
 Japan wanted to be a closed country,

435
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
 so it didn't want anyone else to come in.

436
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,760
 The only people that were allowed to go anywhere near Japan

437
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
 were Chinese, Korean, and Dutch.

438
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,720
 And they were allowed to do that for trading reasons.

439
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,360
 OK.

440
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,480
 Dutch is a bit of a wild card.

441
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,000
 Feels like a Dutch got a weird free pass

442
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,960
 that was about a year ago.

443
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,160
 OK, whatever, not offended.

444
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,280
 But basically, if you were a member

445
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
 of the Dutch East India Company

446
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
 and you were trading

447
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,400
 and you were like taking some silk there

448
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,840
 or some spices or whatever,

449
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,280
 you would go to this created island called Dejima

450
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,560
 and you would kind of live on there,

451
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,720
 but you weren't allowed onto the main island.

452
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,520
 And there was like a bridge there with guards

453
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,600
 which would stop you from going over.

454
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,120
 It's really, really cool.

455
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,400
 There's an amazing book,

456
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,920
 David Mitchell book, set on Dejima,

457
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,960
 because it was very famous.

458
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,320
 Japan's policy was

459
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,800
 they didn't want any Western culture

460
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,320
 coming in and invading them,

461
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
 so which is why they really tried to block them out

462
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
 and then wars happened

463
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
 and we got involved and forced them out of it.

464
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
 But yeah, it's so brilliant.

465
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,960
 What was the book?

466
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,880
 The Thousand Autums of Jacob Dezoet.

467
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
 And yeah, so it's about this Dutch guy

468
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,920
 who goes over and stays there.

469
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,440
 But yeah, completely fake.

470
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
 Yeah, and while you're on there,

471
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,880
 like the local kids would kind of,

472
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,560
 oh, look, there's a Dutch person.

473
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
 Isn't that strange kind of thing?

474
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,880
 And also, you were required to tell the Japanese

475
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,120
 about anything that had happened in the world

476
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,000
 while you were away.

477
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,920
 Really?

478
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,040
 You're a human newspaper

479
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
 for the news of three years ago

480
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,080
 when you last left the Western world.

481
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,640
 I find that really cool,

482
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,320
 because at one point,

483
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,840
 Dejima was the only independent bit of the Netherlands.

484
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,040
 So at one point,

485
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,120
 the Netherlands was an artificial island.

486
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
 So this is when the Netherlands was annexed

487
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
 by Napoleon, I think, in the Napoleonic Wars

488
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,760
 and like lots of Dutch territory was taken elsewhere.

489
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,040
 And so that was where they lived.

490
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,560
 And I think they succeeded there

491
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,920
 because they're so used to living on

492
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,120
 basically artificial reclaimed land, right?

493
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,240
 The Netherlands is sort of mostly an artificial island

494
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,800
 in itself.

495
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,600
 About 60% of the land in the Netherlands

496
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
 is just there because they've drained away the water

497
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
 and they've built it up.

498
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,320
 It's amazing.

499
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,760
 Yeah, it's incredible.

500
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
 Most of the population lives on land

501
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,040
 that shouldn't naturally be there.

502
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,280
 Yeah.

503
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,280
 There's an entire province called Leverpolde,

504
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
 which is the 12th province of the Netherlands

505
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,080
 and it's new.

506
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
 It's just a new land.

507
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
 Oh, because polder is what they're called.

508
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
 It's a polder, the reclaimed land, isn't it?

509
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,720
 Yeah.

510
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,160
 It would make you nervous, I think.

511
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,360
 That is incredible.

512
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,840
 I found a really cool new artificial island,

513
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,520
 which I'm so annoyed.

514
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,120
 I have not looked up the pronunciations,

515
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,640
 but I imagine you guys will know it.

516
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,280
 So here we go.

517
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,880
 It's a bridge which connects Copenhagen to Malmo.

518
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,560
 And it's the Aurasund bridge.

519
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,280
 Aurasund, yeah.

520
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,240
 Aurasund.

521
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,760
 So have you been there?

522
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,920
 Okay, apparently you've been to every artificial island.

523
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,160
 So the Aurasund bridge, if you're passing it,

524
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,120
 you go in the bridge and then--

525
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,200
 In fact, it's what the TV show, The Bridge, is based on.

526
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
 Exactly, yes.

527
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,800
 Yeah.

528
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,640
 And it goes down underneath, doesn't it?

529
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,920
 As opposed to being a bridge that connects Copenhagen to Malmo,

530
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,720
 it goes bridge-like and then suddenly it becomes a tunnel

531
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,680
 and you go underneath.

532
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
 And that tunnel bit has become an artificial island,

533
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,400
 which is called Pepa Holm.

534
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
 And Pepa Holm is called that

535
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
 because there is an actual island next to it

536
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
 called Saltholm.

537
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,720
 Nice.

538
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,680
 Yeah.

539
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
 So that's the--

540
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
 They don't mention that in The Bridge.

541
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,960
 Do they not?

542
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,320
 It's a really great TV show.

543
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,400
 It's so exciting, Saganaren, Lansky Malmo.

544
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,480
 It's really like cool and sexy and scandy.

545
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,520
 And they don't ever say that.

546
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,800
 If they just had one character

547
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
 who just gave bits of trivia about the area,

548
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,520
 that would be way better.

549
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,040
 It would have been a successful show, exactly.

550
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,720
 But so yeah, so it's become this artificial island.

551
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,680
 And--

552
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,360
 So how does the tunnel become an island?

553
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
 There's a stretch of water between the two.

554
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,480
 Between Malmo and--

555
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,880
 Where is it?

556
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,440
 Come here.

557
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,160
 Right, all right.

558
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,000
 So you have a bridge over some of it.

559
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Then there's an island at the end of the bridge.

560
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,880
 And that island then contains the portal to a tunnel.

561
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,280
 Yes.

562
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,600
 The tunnel runs under the rest of the water.

563
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,480
 Right.

564
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,840
 So the boats can still go past, but you can have a bridge.

565
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,320
 I see.

566
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,040
 I see.

567
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,320
 Very clever.

568
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,960
 And so what's happened is this small,

569
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,040
 very concrete-looking island

570
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,560
 has become a place where new species have migrated to

571
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,600
 and set up shop.

572
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,760
 And so you're only really allowed--

573
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,320
 What are they selling?

574
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
 There's like a penguin going, "Won't they fish?

575
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,440
 Won't they fish anyone?

576
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,920
 Any fish?"

577
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,360
 So supposedly, I mean, this is--

578
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,160
 I don't know if this is definitely still the case in 2021,

579
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,680
 but for the last few years,

580
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,920
 it's been the case that you can only go there once a year.

581
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,320
 And it's only biologists who are allowed to go there.

582
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,920
 And what they found on it is amazing.

583
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
 There's 12 species of bird that are living there.

584
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,480
 There were 20 species of spider, one really rare one,

585
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,760
 which they think might have migrated there via a train.

586
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,960
 So it sort of popped off.

587
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,440
 Oh, nice.

588
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,240
 While it was on the train.

589
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,680
 There's a couple of rabbits there

590
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,120
 that they think some people in a car

591
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,520
 must have just let out and let them be on their own.

592
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,000
 There's 345 species of beetle.

593
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
 There's 421 species of butterfly.

594
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
 Which vehicle did these all leave out of?

595
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,920
 The beetles came in a yellow submarine.

596
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:41,840
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

597
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,280
 And that is James.

598
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,480
 Okay, my fact this week is that the only known species

599
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,800
 of marine lichen was discovered by a person named Ivan Lam.

600
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,720
 Their work often acknowledged the help of a Miss Elkie Mackenzie.

601
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,600
 But that turned out to be one in the same person

602
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,720
 as Lam later transitioned and took that name.

603
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,640
 It's very cool.

604
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,840
 Isn't that cool?

605
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,880
 So Ivan Lam was basically thanking her future self.

606
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,360
 Exactly.

607
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,800
 Elkie Mackenzie.

608
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,200
 Yeah.

609
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,840
 Or teasing.

610
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,520
 It's a trailer for.

611
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,040
 Yeah.

612
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,160
 So I read a no-bit tree of Elkie Mackenzie

613
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,920
 written by Vernon Akmagian.

614
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,800
 But I'd actually first come across Elkie Mackenzie

615
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,280
 in a blog by JSTOR, the website, by Sabrina Imbla.

616
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,600
 And in that blog, there was an amazing thing

617
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,320
 that said that Mackenzie had spent her whole life

618
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,840
 preparing this monograph of a particular type of lichen,

619
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,160
 only for her never to be able to quite make it.

620
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,440
 Because sometimes her specimens got blown away

621
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
 once she fell down an elevator shaft.

622
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,400
 Did she fall down an elevator shaft?

623
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,440
 Or did the light fall down?

624
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,720
 It's really hard to tell.

625
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,640
 But that was what really piqued my interest

626
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,600
 about this person.

627
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
 It's like, what an amazing life.

628
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,840
 But yeah, a really cool person who kind of dedicated

629
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,960
 her life to lichen.

630
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,440
 She worked in the Natural History Museum in London

631
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,680
 as an assistant to Annie Lorraine Smith in the 1930s.

632
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,240
 And it's just so interesting that at the time,

633
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,840
 Annie Lorraine Smith was a huge character in the lichen world.

634
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,320
 And she'd written a book which became the sort of seminal

635
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,800
 textbook for the time about lichen.

636
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,240
 Yet she was not officially hired by the Natural History Museum

637
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,160
 because they didn't hire women at the time.

638
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,520
 So she had to have, her pay packet was outsourced

639
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,040
 to somewhere else that could fund it

640
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,120
 because that was the only way that they could do it

641
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,840
 because they didn't have women on the payroll.

642
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,880
 Wow.

643
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,680
 It's weird the reading about the history of lichenologists

644
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,120
 because there do seem to be a lot of women in there.

645
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,880
 Like in the 19th century, a lot of the people

646
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,360
 I was coming across were women, which was kind of exciting.

647
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,920
 It was like a secret area that women knew

648
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,560
 that they were going to be led into almost, but not quite.

649
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,720
 And I did get excited that Carol Dodge,

650
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,520
 who was Elkie McKenzie's main rival, was also a woman,

651
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,040
 but it's not a woman.

652
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,720
 But it's kind of sad, Carol Dodge, the Carol Dodge story

653
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,960
 because Elkie didn't like Dodge.

654
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
 So what Elkie found that was really revolutionary

655
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,280
 in the lichen world was endemic Antarctic species, right?

656
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,640
 And she never got the chance to publish her Antarctic discoveries

657
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,080
 for various reasons.

658
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,000
 And she didn't like Dodge because she thought

659
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,840
 Dodge's taxonomy was kind of reckless

660
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,480
 and Dodge was just identifying things all over the shop.

661
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,040
 You pick up a bit of lichen, you go, "Yeah, yeah, I bet that's a new one.

662
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,400
 Come and write it down."

663
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,800
 And now Dodge's record of Antarctic lichen

664
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,040
 is the kind of authority because McKenzie, for various reasons.

665
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,080
 One of which was that she said in, I can't remember what year

666
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,600
 she transitioned, I think it was the late '70s maybe,

667
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,320
 but she said, "I am a woman, so I'm going to have the surgery."

668
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,000
 And she basically was made to take early retirement.

669
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,840
 Yeah, that's the implication, isn't it?

670
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,880
 They sort of tried to rewrite the history in the moment,

671
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,200
 didn't they, by saying, "Oh, it's just for reasons."

672
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,520
 But it was quite obvious that that's why.

673
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,560
 Yeah, post McKenzie's retirement, she got into woodwork.

674
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,320
 Post, obviously felt like a bit of a wind down.

675
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,400
 And I think she had some mental health problems

676
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,720
 that she admitted to, she'd been quite depressed.

677
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,160
 And so she quit the whole lichen game

678
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,840
 and decided to get really into making Siemens chests.

679
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,600
 So, you know.

680
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,040
 Oh, yeah.

681
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,480
 Where else are you going to keep your Siemens?

682
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,640
 James, Siemens chests are a completely different thing

683
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,000
 to Siemens chests.

684
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,640
 Oh, no.

685
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,760
 Then what am I keeping mine in?

686
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,640
 Oh, my God.

687
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,560
 That's why they didn't invite you back on the boat.

688
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,520
 Oh, no.

689
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,040
 There's a treasure map out there where, one day when it's found,

690
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,720
 it's going to be hugely disappointing, just a pool of Siemens.

691
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,480
 X marks, they're spunk more like.

692
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,440
 Wow, that was too far, wasn't it?

693
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,240
 Too far, yeah.

694
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,040
 She didn't make receptacles for Siemens.

695
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,640
 It's just to make that very clear.

696
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,720
 She was made receptacle for Siemens gear.

697
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,640
 You know, it's like that, it's like a suitcase.

698
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,440
 The only notable thing really about them is that

699
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,680
 they're like a chest, but they have sides that tilt inwards

700
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,200
 because if you're on a rocky boat, you don't want them to tip over.

701
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,760
 Very clever.

702
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,400
 Very clever.

703
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,080
 And they have very intricate knots in the handles called beckets.

704
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,000
 And this is what Elkie got particularly into,

705
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,880
 is making these knots.

706
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,560
 Just on Lycan.

707
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,000
 Lycan are incredible.

708
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,440
 I didn't really know what they were.

709
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,480
 God, me neither.

710
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:18,960
 No.

711
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,400
 Why have we never talked about them before?

712
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,280
 And what they are is they're two things.

713
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,120
 They're two species living in the same house.

714
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,920
 It's mad.

715
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,960
 Or rather, it's one species living in a house built by another one.

716
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,280
 So it's a fungus and normally an algae teaming up.

717
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,320
 Sometimes it's an algae.

718
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
 Sometimes it's a cyanobacteria.

719
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,360
 Sometimes there are two algae.

720
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,240
 It gets a bit complicated.

721
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,080
 But basically, basically the basic thing is it's a fungus

722
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,280
 which builds a structure and the algae lives in it

723
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,560
 and photosynthesizes sunlight, which produces sugar,

724
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,760
 which the fungus then eats.

725
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,440
 So the fungus is providing the home

726
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,040
 and the algae is bringing in the food.

727
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,080
 And so what's the Lycan?

728
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,800
 It's the collective thing for the Lycan.

729
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,760
 Yeah, exactly.

730
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,920
 These two things that are working together,

731
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,320
 as you say, in symbiosis, the word symbiosis was coined

732
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,800
 by a guy called Heinrich Anton de Barry.

733
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,320
 And he was talking about Lycans when he coined that term.

734
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,200
 Although Vernon Matian, who wrote the obituary of algae,

735
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,560
 he doesn't think they're in symbiosis.

736
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,240
 He thinks that actually the fungus

737
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,640
 is a controlling parasite of the algae or cyanobacteria.

738
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,120
 It's very interesting.

739
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,640
 What's a stealing food of it?

740
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,360
 He's basically saying that, yeah, exactly,

741
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,160
 that the algae has no choice in the matter

742
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,000
 and it could perfectly happily live

743
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
 without a roof over its head.

744
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,160
 There's no evidence that they need this building

745
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
 that the fungi makes for them

746
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,280
 and the fungi is getting a free ride.

747
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,880
 But it's very controversial.

748
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,840
 It's a big old debate.

749
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,920
 And it's like everyone knows couples like that,

750
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,480
 where you think, should they be together?

751
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,720
 Isn't one of them fine without the other one?

752
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,480
 Is it controlling parasitism?

753
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
 No, I think you can only judge these things

754
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,920
 from the inside unless you are an algae or a fungi.

755
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,280
 You cannot comment.

756
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,160
 So does the fungi absolutely need the algae then?

757
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,320
 Yeah, because it gets energy from the algae.

758
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,480
 So the fungi can't do what most fungi do,

759
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,320
 which is eat decomposed matter,

760
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,520
 which is how fungi normally survive.

761
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,960
 But they've now evolved to just eat the food

762
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,160
 that's made for them by photosynthesis.

763
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,960
 So they would starve.

764
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,400
 And the argument is that the algae

765
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,880
 is getting some protection in return.

766
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,480
 But a lot of people think that actually

767
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,840
 it doesn't need that protection.

768
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,480
 Right.

769
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,680
 It's controversial.

770
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,800
 Well, I've got actually

771
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,920
 something even more controversial

772
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,480
 to blow this even wider open,

773
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,800
 which is that they now think it's not--

774
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,880
 a lichen is not two organisms.

775
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,760
 It's three.

776
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,320
 Three.

777
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,960
 Yeah.

778
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,160
 So that-- and this is a massive discovery

779
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,680
 in the world of lichen.

780
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,640
 So this is that there have been a bunch of mysteries about it.

781
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,520
 So one was that there were different lichen,

782
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,840
 which at a DNA level are exactly the same

783
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,640
 when they studied them,

784
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,920
 but that have different effects.

785
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,200
 Like some will kill you when you eat them

786
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,400
 and some are perfectly edible.

787
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,280
 They're like, how is this possible?

788
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
 They look like they're the same thing.

789
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,360
 And they also had this problem

790
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
 where scientists can't recreate lichen in a lab,

791
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,400
 which you should be able to,

792
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,240
 because you should be able to get the fungus

793
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,280
 and the bacteria or the algae shove them together,

794
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,120
 create it, doesn't work.

795
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,920
 And now they found a way of looking at them closer,

796
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,320
 and they've realized they all have inside them

797
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,960
 a different fungus, which is more like a yeast.

798
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,360
 So right deep within their cells,

799
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,160
 single cells of this other fungus.

800
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,880
 So is this every known lichen we're talking about?

801
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,680
 It seems like it might be the definition of lichen

802
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,120
 is this third thing.

803
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,200
 It's a new order of fungus that does this.

804
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,800
 So it's an extra fungus,

805
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,960
 which is carried within the fungus

806
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,560
 that then takes to the, oh my God.

807
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,360
 Exactly.

808
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,760
 It's very hard to blow this shit wide open,

809
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,280
 because a lot of it is just learning

810
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,120
 about the original shit in the first place.

811
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,880
 And I just blow some more shit wide open.

812
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,600
 Please.

813
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,280
 So you know, there's a lot of species of lichen

814
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,120
 that they thought were just a single species.

815
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,080
 There's one in particular,

816
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,760
 which is called dic tionema glabratum.

817
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,600
 And they thought it was just one species.

818
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,360
 And it turns out that it's at least 126 different species

819
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,080
 of lichen.

820
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,920
 It's this one lichen that you'd never heard of.

821
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,400
 I know.

822
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,760
 It's actually 126 lichens that you'd never heard of.

823
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,880
 It's amazing.

824
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,760
 That's incredible.

825
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
 Which lazy intern did the first count of that?

826
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,120
 Well, the problem is that when you take lichen

827
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,080
 from the natural setting,

828
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,000
 if you see that in the, in the countryside,

829
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,440
 it might be lots of different colors.

830
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
 It might be lots of different shapes and stuff like that.

831
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,760
 As soon as you take it into the lab,

832
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,880
 it loses all of its color.

833
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,400
 It becomes like a boring gray brown sludge.

834
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,480
 And they kind of all look the same at that point.

835
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,400
 And so loads of people were finding the stuff

836
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,240
 and bringing it back and they couldn't tell the difference.

837
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,560
 And it's only when they look at the genes

838
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,840
 that they can now tell the difference

839
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,960
 between the different species.

840
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,440
 I'll tell you what,

841
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,600
 if anyone's thinking of becoming a lichenologist,

842
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,760
 and I imagine after this chat,

843
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,120
 you're going to be applying.

844
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,520
 Sure.

845
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
 Best place to do it, New Zealand, in my mind.

846
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,640
 Really?

847
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,280
 10% of the world's lichen is found in New Zealand.

848
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,880
 And as of 2019, they had fewer than five lichenologists.

849
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,520
 Did they?

850
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,080
 You would have an absolute playground there,

851
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,520
 if you wanted to go and do that.

852
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,400
 And wasn't that the place

853
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
 that they had the sexy pavement lichen?

854
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,440
 It was, exactly.

855
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,400
 Was it in one of our books?

856
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,640
 We mentioned it in Book of the Year 2019.

857
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,480
 It was that New Zealanders, I believe,

858
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,840
 were told by the government

859
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,000
 to stop licking lichen on the ground

860
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,800
 because it was acting like Viagra.

861
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,440
 But who was licking lichen off the ground?

862
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,840
 I don't think,

863
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,200
 I think they were taking it off the ground

864
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,880
 and they were ingesting it in a different way.

865
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,320
 Maybe in a tea or something.

866
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,560
 Oh, really?

867
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,480
 Mixed messages because the word lichen

868
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,240
 comes from the Greek to lick.

869
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,080
 So, you know, what's going on there.

870
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,880
 Lichen this.

871
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,120
 Yeah.

872
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,880
 But yes, so they were getting an erection

873
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,240
 when they had this lichen, right?

874
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:28,640
 Yeah, exactly.

875
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,400
 And so why were they not allowed to do it?

876
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
 I think it was...

877
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,200
 I can't actually remember.

878
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,680
 Do you remember?

879
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:33,680
 Yeah.

880
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,160
 I think it was...

881
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,520
 Who's going around stopping people

882
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,240
 having perfectly healthy erections

883
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,280
 based on snuffing pavement scrapings?

884
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,640
 Maybe if you get the wrong lichen,

885
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,560
 then maybe you deck falls off or something.

886
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,000
 You know, because they are hard to tell apart.

887
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,360
 So, that's probably that's true.

888
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,640
 I do remember how it was.

889
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,440
 What was it?

890
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,960
 It was that basically you would get lots of heavy metals

891
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920
 leaching into it on the pavements and stuff.

892
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,360
 You might get a dog poo in it.

893
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,480
 You might get dog wee in it.

894
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
 It's hard to regulate and make truly things.

895
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,840
 It's hard to regulate.

896
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,920
 There was high levels of lead they found.

897
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,280
 They were found cadmium in it.

898
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,080
 They found mercury.

899
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
 They found arsenic.

900
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,680
 And the US Food and Drugs Administration

901
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,360
 bought one lot online

902
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,240
 and found that it was actually 20% grass clippings

903
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,840
 and 80% grammed up Viagra.

904
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,360
 I would say be a lichenologist in Britain

905
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,720
 because the British Lichen Society,

906
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,480
 as far as I can tell, are super on it.

907
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,320
 They have an amazing website

908
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,160
 and they just have a fabulous time.

909
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
 They've got about 650 members.

910
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
 Oh yeah, a lot of competition there though, isn't there?

911
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,800
 Like Dan was saying only five lichen experts in New Zealand.

912
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,080
 Fewer than five.

913
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,960
 That's true.

914
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,480
 I don't know why they're just in favor of the number.

915
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,400
 Yeah, that's what the auditorial said.

916
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
 Surely you could just say three if that's what it was.

917
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,560
 Actually in Britain it's useful to become a lichenologist

918
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,640
 because I was going through the list of the presidents

919
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,120
 of this society, specifically the women.

920
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,640
 And every single woman that I could find

921
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,760
 that had a Wikipedia article attached to their name,

922
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,040
 they've all got OBEs.

923
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,880
 So I don't know what's going on in the lichen world

924
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,040
 that the government is recognizing

925
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,720
 their work towards the country,

926
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,480
 but they've all got titles.

927
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:04,960
 Wow.

928
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,640
 Yeah, so that's a quick way to an OBE,

929
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,920
 become a lichenologist.

930
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,800
 Wow, maybe there's some secret they're not telling us.

931
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,040
 Doesn't feel like a quick way to become an OBE.

932
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,440
 Sorry, I think it takes years and years of craft.

933
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,240
 It's not like become an OBE with this one weird trick.

934
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,000
 I actually am not sure it does take that long.

935
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,480
 Stop denigrating the work of the British lichen society.

936
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,000
 They're serious scientists, dude.

937
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,200
 Again, please don't write in.

938
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,280
 It's the OBE committee that we're talking about.

939
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,360
 Oh, what they just see lichen and they just waggle it through.

940
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
 Yeah, yeah.

941
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,840
 Oh, no, I'm saying it doesn't take long

942
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,960
 to become a lichenologist.

943
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,360
 It takes a week.

944
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,960
 Okay, yeah, this is what Anna is saying.

945
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
 That's my point.

946
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,600
 This is because I was reading about Kerry Knudson

947
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,400
 or Kerry Knudson.

948
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,000
 Who's California's only professional lichenologist.

949
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
 He's a really fun guy.

950
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,480
 And he's published--

951
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,520
 He were then two, I believe.

952
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,440
 California lichenologist.

953
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,240
 He were then two.

954
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,440
 He's published over 200 papers on them.

955
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,080
 And he pretty much took up being a lichenologist

956
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,960
 after he retired.

957
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,880
 And now he maybe knows more about lichen

958
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,000
 than anyone else in the world claims the Atlantic.

959
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,880
 He was a construction worker for most of his life.

960
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,080
 So he ran away from home at 16 to join an anarchist commune.

961
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,800
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

962
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,320
 He was a construction worker.

963
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,720
 Sorry.

964
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
 So before he was a construction worker.

965
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,520
 We built a lot of very wonky buildings along anarchic lines.

966
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:19,920
 Yeah.

967
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,800
 No, he ran away at 16 before being a construction worker.

968
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,880
 Took lots of acid, wrote lots of poetry,

969
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,440
 got into quite magic, was a big fan of Friend of the Podcast,

970
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,320
 Alistair Crowley.

971
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,720
 And then he went off poetry

972
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,200
 because he didn't like the modernism direction it was going in.

973
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,400
 So worked in construction, got some blood clots in his legs,

974
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,320
 had to retire prematurely in his 50s.

975
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,600
 And he said to his daughter,

976
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,040
 "I'm going to go back behind the house

977
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
 and I'm going to study whatever I find there."

978
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,880
 And he found lichen there.

979
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,840
 And so now he's the world leading lichenologist.

980
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,880
 And he named one after Obama.

981
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,480
 That's his contribution to the lichen world.

982
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,680
 Oh, I've read about that one.

983
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,160
 Yeah.

984
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,160
 Yeah.

985
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,960
 That was a big deal.

986
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,160
 2008 huge deal.

987
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,680
 You can age structures based on how fast lichen moves across it.

988
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,440
 That's a fun thing to do.

989
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,320
 Lichenometry.

990
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,400
 They're incredibly slow growing, some of them.

991
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,760
 And I really like this.

992
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,080
 The oldest lichens in the world are found in the Arctic.

993
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,080
 And they're a species called rhizocarpum geographicum.

994
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,440
 And they have been aged at 8,600 years, some of them.

995
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,640
 And they're still alive.

996
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:20,880
 Yeah.

997
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,440
 Which I think would make them the oldest living organism on the planet.

998
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,840
 What?

999
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,480
 They also use them for detecting pollution levels, don't they?

1000
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,640
 So if you're in a very polluted area,

1001
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,800
 if a certain type of lichen is introduced and it doesn't grow,

1002
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,560
 that means that the pollution levels are too high.

1003
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,600
 And if you can bring them down and then the lichen starts growing there,

1004
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,200
 that shows you that you're at the right level.

1005
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,280
 So it's a really interesting bar for--

1006
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,520
 That's why, because there's always some dickhead on our country walk

1007
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,360
 that you're going on when trees are covered in lichen.

1008
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,400
 And there's always someone who goes, that's a good sign, actually.

1009
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,720
 That's because that means it's really clean air.

1010
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,920
 But isn't that true?

1011
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,360
 Yes, it is, but it's just annoying.

1012
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,720
 They keep reminding me about it.

1013
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,200
 I get it.

1014
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,080
 OK.

1015
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,600
 The tree looks a bit dirty, though.

1016
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,040
 It wouldn't like to be in your club.

1017
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,120
 This isn't a stressful country walking club.

1018
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,480
 Hey, can I please get listeners to solve a crisis that I had this weekend,

1019
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,560
 which is sort of like and related maybe.

1020
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,440
 I was in the children's.

1021
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,000
 I was staying in this little bit of woodland.

1022
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,360
 And we found a tree that was covered in ivy.

1023
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,440
 And then the ivy looked like basically a dump truck,

1024
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,360
 a dump, a load of mud on it.

1025
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,880
 Like every single ivy leaf was covered in red, soily mud.

1026
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,760
 And we realized we traced it, looking closely at the tree,

1027
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,400
 back to these sort of large dinner plate size,

1028
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,840
 what looked like fungi.

1029
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,040
 Bright white, kind of beautiful fungi growing straight out of the tree.

1030
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,800
 And in their dinner plate, which was like a bowl,

1031
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,280
 there were mountains of this red soil stuff.

1032
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,240
 And I'm going to put, I am going to get a picture on the podcast Twitter feed.

1033
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,440
 On a drive engagement.

1034
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,120
 Some old degree.

1035
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,880
 And someone needs to tell me what it is.

1036
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,480
 Some names of lycan.

1037
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,080
 And you can tell me why they're called this.

1038
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,880
 OK.

1039
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,520
 Um, so dog lycan.

1040
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,720
 Why is it called dog lycan?

1041
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,360
 Looks like a dog.

1042
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,080
 No, it doesn't look like it's going to look like a dog.

1043
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,320
 It grows in the shape of Scooby-Doo.

1044
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,440
 It catches bulls in its mouth.

1045
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,080
 No, not that.

1046
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:14,880
 If dog's pee on it, it eats it up and makes it stronger than the other dog.

1047
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,160
 It grows towards the dog star.

1048
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,480
 Serious.

1049
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,560
 It's all amazing.

1050
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,120
 Oh, it's, it's, it's hairy like a dog.

1051
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,760
 Like if you were walking in the forest, you'd be like, that's a dog.

1052
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,240
 But that's the same as it looks like a dog.

1053
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,080
 That's just sea first answer.

1054
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,120
 Yeah.

1055
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,920
 OK, I see.

1056
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,920
 Mix it with half a pint of warm milk.

1057
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,000
 And it can cure.

1058
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,760
 A dog?

1059
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,400
 Rabies.

1060
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,160
 Rabies, correct.

1061
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,200
 Named by Linnaeus in 1753, dog lycan.

1062
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,680
 Wow.

1063
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,400
 Just in case anyone's listening who does happen to have bitten by a rabid dog,

1064
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,800
 we should probably say it definitely doesn't cure rabies.

1065
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,240
 No, go, go and get that.

1066
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,720
 Is the half pint of milk that does all the work out for rabies?

1067
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,000
 Genuinely glad you guys added that.

1068
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,160
 Because in my head, that was how you cure it.

1069
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,320
 OK, come on.

1070
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,000
 British soldier lycan.

1071
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,720
 OK, for wounds on British soldiers, you would, you would put it.

1072
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:00,880
 That's good.

1073
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,600
 And it would sort of.

1074
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:01,920
 Nope.

1075
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,960
 I'm going to stick with my previous one.

1076
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,000
 Looks like a British soldier.

1077
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,240
 Does no one want to shag it?

1078
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,040
 You know how it was like the Americans came over and stole all the ladies?

1079
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,680
 Oh.

1080
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,920
 Because no one wants to shag the British.

1081
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,640
 Andy was right.

1082
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,760
 It looks like a British soldier.

1083
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,040
 Thank you very much.

1084
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,880
 It has a red cap, which looks a bit like the red hats worn by British soldiers

1085
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,560
 during the American Revolutionary War.

1086
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,360
 And rock tripe, lycan.

1087
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,480
 Oh.

1088
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:24,880
 Rock tripe.

1089
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,160
 Tripe is innards and things like that.

1090
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,880
 So.

1091
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,240
 Oh, is it one that lives inside a rock?

1092
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,360
 Because there are like, what are they called?

1093
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,200
 They're like endolithic or something.

1094
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
 Like, and they live literally inside rock.

1095
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,360
 That's cool.

1096
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,240
 Which is incredible.

1097
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,080
 Outside a rock, but underneath a rock in a cave.

1098
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
 Yeah, neither correct, but great answers.

1099
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,400
 Yeah.

1100
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,040
 That's really good.

1101
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,160
 Grows in a kind of string.

1102
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,480
 Andy.

1103
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,200
 Looks like tripe.

1104
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,000
 Looks like tripe.

1105
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,480
 Thank you.

1106
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,040
 Two out of three.

1107
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:57,760
 Also was gathered by George Washington's troops, supposedly, and boiled into soup

1108
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,040
 at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777.

1109
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,560
 So that's, they ate it.

1110
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,800
 Like tripe, but also it looks a bit like tripe.

1111
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,720
 That's a pretty bad winter as well, when you're having to persuade yourself that what you're

1112
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,360
 eating is tripe.

1113
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,600
 That's even worse than tripe.

1114
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,080
 There is a lycan called rock gnome lycan as well.

1115
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,760
 And this is endangered, and no one's allowed to know where it is.

1116
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,120
 Because the US Fish and Wildlife Service said they had an option to label its location as

1117
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,240
 critical habitat.

1118
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,400
 This is just, it's only found in like Georgia and the Carolinas and Tennessee in the mountains.

1119
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,560
 And if you label something as critical habitat, that means people know where it is.

1120
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,160
 You publish it, and then you get these lycan collectors who are over enthusiastic who go

1121
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,040
 and nick it.

1122
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,880
 So they kept it super secret.

1123
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,000
 And sweetly, the person who was in charge of guarding its location was a National Park

1124
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,600
 Service botanist called Janet Rock.

1125
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,360
 That's cool.

1126
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,760
 And where is it in Georgia and the Carolinas?

1127
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,280
 I'm not giving you any further details, James.

1128
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,760
 I'm just thinking I could do with an OBE quite soon.

1129
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:05,760
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1130
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,520
 And that is Andy.

1131
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,520
 My fact is that eBay employs staff whose job includes sniffing trainers.

1132
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,640
 Wow.

1133
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,280
 Yeah.

1134
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,840
 They're the shoe perverts of eBay.

1135
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,040
 And they are...

1136
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,240
 For legal reasons, not.

1137
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,520
 No, yeah, they're absolutely not perverts.

1138
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,640
 This is part of their job.

1139
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,160
 I don't want to need to make it any clearer.

1140
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,760
 These people are not perverts.

1141
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,520
 They're not getting a kick out of it.

1142
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,720
 Also got a sick thrill.

1143
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,360
 This is because eBay sells a lot of shoes, which I didn't know because I'm not a sneak

1144
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,480
 ahead is what they get called.

1145
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,840
 People who collect and trade and buy and sell and sometimes make a living selling shoes to

1146
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,200
 each other and collecting them.

1147
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,280
 Sounds like they're just people who wear them on the wrong bit of their body.

1148
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,320
 Could be the same.

1149
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:57,040
 And so there are so many fake shoes on the market now, which are obviously not worth

1150
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,560
 nearly as much as the real deal.

1151
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,560
 You mean fake brands, the shoes, you could get your shoe onto your foot, right?

1152
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,760
 It's not like you put your foot in it.

1153
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,280
 You're like, "Oh, that's an algae."

1154
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,560
 It's not made of plamage and it turns out every damn time.

1155
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,400
 No, they're real shoes, but they're not really made by Nike or whoever.

1156
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,400
 So eBay has got experts in trainer provenance whose job is to put shoes through their paces.

1157
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,280
 Nice.

1158
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,000
 Thank you.

1159
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,120
 To assess whether they're real or fake and any shoes that are worth over 150 quid that

1160
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,600
 are bought on eBay because they have to have some kind of lower floor in it.

1161
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,880
 They can't check all of them.

1162
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,360
 Any shoes worth over 150 quid go through this center, sneak authentication center,

1163
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,480
 and the seller doesn't get the money until the shoes have been authenticated and then

1164
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,080
 they get forwarded to the buyers.

1165
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,320
 And the smelling is part of that because there are so many different ways you can tell

1166
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,760
 whether a trainer is authentic or not.

1167
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,400
 There's the stitching, there's the glue and the glue has a smell and all these other methods.

1168
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,320
 It's something like 52 elements.

1169
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,960
 They've identified the process to it.

1170
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,640
 Yeah, so it's, as you say, it's the glue.

1171
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,680
 It's the quality of ink on the inside of the tongue.

1172
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,280
 There's the variations of color.

1173
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,840
 There's the smell check as well.

1174
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,120
 Well, eBay are going on the road with this.

1175
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,760
 It's very exciting.

1176
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,640
 They're doing nationwide.

1177
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,000
 What do you mean, like touring?

1178
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,960
 I wouldn't watch that show.

1179
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,720
 Come to our show.

1180
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:08,960
 Come to our show instead.

1181
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,200
 Come to our show instead.

1182
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,600
 Come to our show instead.

1183
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,280
 It's basically that.

1184
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,920
 Okay.

1185
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,480
 Well, I mean, basically they have an ice cream van.

1186
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,800
 I've slightly hyped up the nationwide tour element of it.

1187
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,800
 But the ice cream van is touring the country.

1188
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,600
 And if you bring your sneakers along worth over a hundred quid,

1189
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,360
 then they will authenticate them or not.

1190
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,560
 They will bust this shit wide open on your foot.

1191
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,360
 Will they fill one of my sneakers up with Mr. Whippy and put a flake in it?

1192
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,040
 No, they won't.

1193
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,040
 They're only doing a few dates as well on this tour,

1194
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,440
 I think because ice cream vans can't go on the motorway.

1195
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,600
 And I presume they're going to have to take b-roads all the way around.

1196
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:45,440
 There was an amazing article on thisismoney.co.uk written by Grace Godson.

1197
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,880
 And she actually smelled the shoes

1198
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,920
 and said that she could definitely tell the difference, the journalist.

1199
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,200
 Yeah, she said that the ones that are fake

1200
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,600
 just kind of smell really chemically, a bit like nail varnish,

1201
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,040
 but the real ones smell more like tennis balls, according to her.

1202
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,520
 Oh, yeah.

1203
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,680
 And but she also said that if you want to work in these warehouses,

1204
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,080
 then you have to pass an entrance test,

1205
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,520
 which involves a blind test,

1206
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,880
 whether can you tell a sneaker is real or fake just by smelling it?

1207
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,360
 So you have to pass that test to get the job.

1208
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,560
 Wow, so weird.

1209
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,360
 Imagine them.

1210
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,880
 I think so they are blindfolded.

1211
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,280
 Yeah, it's pretty weird, isn't it?

1212
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:23,760
 That's cool.

1213
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,120
 It is cool. It's amazing.

1214
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,480
 It must be so hard though,

1215
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,600
 because a lot of these sneakers, most of them are manufactured in China,

1216
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,800
 in Chinese factories.

1217
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,600
 And the real ones?

1218
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,200
 The real ones, but also the fake ones.

1219
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,200
 And the fake ones in the article I read say

1220
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,320
 that they're often attached literally to the real factory.

1221
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,120
 So you've got the sort of fake factory that's using 90% of the materials anyway.

1222
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,160
 So 90% of it is as close to the thing that you would have.

1223
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,080
 It's just the actual manufacturing and stitching together process.

1224
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,280
 That's so mad.

1225
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,760
 They're also employing trainers to test watches within the next couple of months.

1226
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,720
 Human trainers.

1227
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,280
 Human trainers.

1228
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,720
 Human trainers.

1229
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,680
 Humans sniff the trainers.

1230
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,960
 The trainers test the watches.

1231
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,320
 That's the centre.

1232
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,560
 I watched the trainers watching.

1233
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,080
 I think the watches were first, actually.

1234
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,080
 Oh, were they?

1235
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,360
 Oh, I think maybe they're upgrading.

1236
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,720
 I read that they were looking for a new tranche of watch trainers

1237
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,560
 in August this year.

1238
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,640
 I didn't realise that eBay gets almost all of its profits now from three items.

1239
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,760
 What are the three?

1240
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,480
 Trainers, luxury watches, trading cards.

1241
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,760
 Oh, really?

1242
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,320
 Apparently.

1243
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:30,880
 The third category that has authentication from June 2021 is handbags.

1244
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,160
 Is it?

1245
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
 Maybe they're trying to branch out into a fourth direction.

1246
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,200
 Wow.

1247
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,880
 As in you can get everything else on eBay,

1248
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
 it's just that their shares are mostly going down.

1249
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,280
 People aren't buying other stuff on them anymore.

1250
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,920
 Interesting.

1251
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,040
 But those three things.

1252
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,280
 And the thing is with the authentication is

1253
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,640
 you as a buyer don't pay for it

1254
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,240
 and the seller doesn't pay for it either.

1255
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,520
 eBay pays for it.

1256
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,200
 And you think, well, what's the point of that?

1257
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,640
 But actually, the sales of luxury items like watches and sneakers

1258
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,800
 and probably soon handbags has gone up massively

1259
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,440
 since people have known that they're going to get the real deal.

1260
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,640
 Has it?

1261
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,280
 Interesting.

1262
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,320
 The growth in sneakers has gone up by triple digits year on year

1263
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,440
 for the last couple of years.

1264
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,320
 Yeah, apparently they sell a pair every nine seconds.

1265
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,000
 When companies make trainers and sneakers,

1266
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,480
 especially in the last 10, 15 years,

1267
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,680
 they often make them mostly in sizes eight, nine, and 10

1268
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,400
 because they're the most popular sizes for men.

1269
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,200
 And men are the people who bought most of these trainers.

1270
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,760
 But these days, more women are wanting these trainers.

1271
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,880
 And so the smaller sizes are rarer.

1272
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,240
 And so if you're a counterfeiter,

1273
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,880
 you're more likely to go for the smaller sizes

1274
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,920
 because actually, you know, there's less on the market for them.

1275
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,280
 So you're more likely to find that women's trainers

1276
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,200
 are fake than the men's trainers.

1277
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,080
 But does it matter to sneakerheads?

1278
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,280
 A lot of these shoes are never worn.

1279
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,640
 That's the thing I find so weird and bizarre.

1280
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,040
 But you still buy them in your size, usually.

1281
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,760
 When you say never worn, are there really many people

1282
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,840
 who are buying loads of sneakers that they don't intend to wear?

1283
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,200
 Collectors have hundreds of pairs.

1284
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,840
 It's mad.

1285
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,080
 And a lot of them, they can't afford to wear themselves

1286
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,480
 because they don't want to wear out a $10,000 pair of sneakers.

1287
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,920
 They keep them because they have that value.

1288
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,600
 If they wore them, they'd become really grubby

1289
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,640
 and they'd lose their value.

1290
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,880
 But there can't be that many people that do that.

1291
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,440
 There are.

1292
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,160
 That's what's funding eBay and it's top three most important things.

1293
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,320
 It's a billion dollar industry.

1294
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,480
 In the future, Dan, in 200 years, people will say,

1295
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,800
 "Did you know people used to wear these decorations on their feet?"

1296
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,600
 But yeah, that is true.

1297
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:21,920
 Yeah.

1298
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,800
 And the other advantage of doing the women's shoes, for instance,

1299
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,840
 is because you need less materials to make them, of course.

1300
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,280
 So the markup is bigger.

1301
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,840
 I always buy shoes three sizes too big

1302
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,240
 so I can circumvent the possibility that they're fake.

1303
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,520
 They do get, there are sometimes seizures of counterfeit sneakers

1304
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,600
 at customs and ports and things like that.

1305
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,000
 So in 2019, there was a Chinese guy called Qing Fuzeng

1306
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,480
 who was arrested for allegedly importing 22 shipping containers

1307
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,800
 of fake trainers into the USA disguised as napkins,

1308
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,880
 not disguised, labeled as napkins,

1309
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,000
 which would have been worth $472 million.

1310
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,760
 It's just an insane amount of money that you can make

1311
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,400
 and he had this complicated system set up to get them in

1312
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,840
 and then get them distributed.

1313
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,080
 That's why they make you take your shoes off as security, right?

1314
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,800
 To test they're real.

1315
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,960
 You just look back, the security people are huffing away at them,

1316
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,320
 giving you a good sniff.

1317
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,120
 Anna was talking about buying shoes that were too big

1318
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,600
 and then putting loads of socks in there so that they fit.

1319
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,720
 I didn't, I haven't actually come up with that workaround.

1320
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,760
 I just buy shoes that are too big.

1321
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,680
 But thank God you solved that blister problem.

1322
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,760
 Well, the reason that I made that solution in my head

1323
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,080
 is because I was reading about a guy called Jim Thorpe

1324
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,080
 who was the first Native American

1325
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,920
 to win a gold medal at the Olympics.

1326
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,080
 And he was in the Decathlon.

1327
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,280
 So after the first day, he was miles ahead,

1328
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,040
 but then someone stole his shoes.

1329
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,320
 So he didn't know what to do for the second day

1330
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,240
 because there were his only pair of shoes.

1331
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,960
 So he looked around and he found like in the garbage,

1332
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,480
 like a couple of odd shoes and he wore them,

1333
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,000
 but one of them was massively too big.

1334
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,680
 So he had to wear loads of pairs of socks.

1335
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,840
 And that fut.

1336
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,120
 So there are pictures of him in odd shoes

1337
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,120
 with one foot with loads of socks on.

1338
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,560
 And in the second day, he won pretty much all the events

1339
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,760
 and won the gold in the Decathlon in the 1912 Olympics.

1340
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,760
 And on the same day, he also won,

1341
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,880
 I think it was the long jump or the high jump

1342
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,640
 and the 110 meters hurdles

1343
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,280
 and the 1500 meters wearing odd shoes.

1344
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,560
 Wow, very cool.

1345
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,240
 Well, why doesn't everyone do that now?

1346
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,280
 It's clearly an advantage.

1347
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,320
 Must be, right?

1348
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,760
 But also it sounds like he could have tried

1349
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,520
 a bit harder just to get a pair of shoes, right?

1350
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,320
 Like if the Jamaicans were able to borrow a bobsled, surely.

1351
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,640
 Guys, I only found out recently that shoes,

1352
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,400
 you used to be able to inflate them yourself.

1353
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,520
 Sorry.

1354
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,440
 Because now I have to go to a shop to inflate them.

1355
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,200
 What are you talking about?

1356
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,480
 All your shoes, blow up shoes.

1357
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,960
 Okay, I'm glad you don't remember this, James,

1358
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,000
 because this was during the sneaker wars of the 1990s.

1359
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,720
 You all remember.

1360
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,800
 The Nike versus Reebok.

1361
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,360
 Oh, yeah.

1362
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,960
 And this, yeah, yeah.

1363
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,840
 And the pumps, yeah.

1364
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,960
 The pumps, yeah.

1365
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,080
 No, sorry, not with you on this.

1366
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,720
 Wasn't there Jordans?

1367
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,560
 But they had the air pump as well, didn't they?

1368
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:02,960
 Did there Jordans have a pump?

1369
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,920
 Yeah, there Jordans had pumps.

1370
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,000
 Look, I was not allowed to wear any cool shoes during the 1990s.

1371
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,240
 Okay.

1372
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,440
 Can someone explain this to me please?

1373
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,720
 So they used to be on the tongue.

1374
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,480
 So, actually the pair of brogues, right?

1375
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:10,960
 Thank you.

1376
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,000
 You inflated them from the tongue,

1377
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,160
 and this was an innovation by Reebok.

1378
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,960
 Their tongue.

1379
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,200
 Their...

1380
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,240
 Have you seen the movie Men in Tights?

1381
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,120
 Robin Hood, Men in Tights.

1382
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,440
 I have not.

1383
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,200
 I wasn't allowed to watch that.

1384
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,400
 Okay.

1385
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,600
 But this apparently clinched it for Reebok for a while.

1386
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,800
 Nike's always been the big guy.

1387
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,560
 Reebok's always been the underdog.

1388
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,200
 And they had these self-inflate shoes.

1389
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,240
 So they...

1390
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,920
 No one bought them because they thought that's really weird.

1391
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,480
 And then there was just one slam dunk championship.

1392
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,760
 Basketball seems to be more about the shoes

1393
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,960
 than it is about the basketball.

1394
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,440
 You rarely get a team in barefoot winning the NBA.

1395
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,520
 Not since the 1912 Olympics.

1396
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,360
 So this guy, D. Brown, did this move

1397
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,800
 before he did his amazing slam dunk

1398
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,000
 and won the competition,

1399
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,360
 where he just bent down

1400
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,680
 and he pumped up his shoes with the tongue.

1401
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,120
 And then he slam dunked it.

1402
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,520
 And then after that, the crowd went insane.

1403
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,560
 And then it became his thing.

1404
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,000
 Every time he went to take a shot,

1405
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,960
 he would pump up his shoes

1406
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,240
 and then deflate them afterwards.

1407
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,680
 No, not in a match.

1408
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,280
 He wouldn't dribble the ball.

1409
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,080
 Not mid-match.

1410
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,520
 Bend down, pump, yeah.

1411
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,960
 When you're doing a dunk from a standing position.

1412
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,160
 You know the lingo, Dan.

1413
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,120
 You know what I'm trying to say.

1414
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,280
 Well, and I don't know what we should just say for Andy.

1415
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,200
 I don't know the pump actually did anything.

1416
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,360
 As in your shoe functioned,

1417
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,960
 it wasn't like a deflated shoe

1418
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,160
 that you pumped air into.

1419
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,520
 It just was this sort of...

1420
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,880
 But this basketballer who pumped the tongue

1421
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,400
 did that, that did have an effect, did it?

1422
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,920
 I mean, I don't know.

1423
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,360
 They always refused to say.

1424
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,760
 It suggested it had ankle support.

1425
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,560
 And they were always asked,

1426
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,240
 "Does it give you a bit more bounce to make it pumpy?"

1427
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,800
 And they always said,

1428
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,120
 "We're refusing to say if I gave you a bit more bounce."

1429
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,400
 Well, I never noticed it.

1430
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,120
 You didn't know.

1431
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,320
 And you were pumped for ages.

1432
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,080
 It was just a cool thing to do.

1433
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,760
 It wasn't like having a pogo stick suddenly attached.

1434
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,480
 No, exactly.

1435
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,600
 Yeah, they weren't moonshoes.

1436
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,680
 There was a story this year

1437
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,800
 about a lady who has made 2,500 pounds

1438
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,840
 by selling old crisp packets from the 1980s.

1439
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,400
 Oh, yeah.

1440
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,520
 But they had released figures

1441
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,800
 on how many of these ostensibly not very glamorous items

1442
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,840
 have been sold over a three-month period this year.

1443
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,520
 350 crisp packets, 206 wine corks,

1444
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,880
 225 empty jam jars, 37 toilet roll tubes.

1445
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,880
 But it's hard to make a million from them

1446
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,280
 because they, on average, go for two P each.

1447
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,800
 That's a cheap telescope, though,

1448
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,920
 if you want to make a...

1449
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,120
 That's true.

1450
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,080
 That's true.

1451
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,760
 I think people must be buying crisp packets

1452
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,480
 to do the blow it up and bang it thing,

1453
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,600
 which I love doing.

1454
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,720
 But I don't eat enough crisps

1455
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,320
 to do that as often as I'd want to.

1456
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,520
 I just thought it was set dressing

1457
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,440
 for a TV show in the 1980s.

1458
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,040
 It's weird where our brains go

1459
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,400
 because I was thinking you would buy it

1460
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,480
 and hopefully there's a few little crumbs of crisps

1461
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,280
 left in the car.

1462
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,600
 And you can lick your finger and get them out.

1463
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,040
 We've all got good reasons.

1464
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,160
 But, I mean, that's true.

1465
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,000
 You won't be able to taste the '80s again, will you?

1466
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,960
 No.

1467
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,240
 That's slogan for your firm.

1468
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,680
 A trade on these things.

1469
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,720
 Taste the '80s.

1470
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,680
 Yeah, great.

1471
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,280
 You can taste the 2010s

1472
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,400
 by buying the pre-sugar tax drinks

1473
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,440
 that are available on eBay.

1474
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,840
 I genuinely thought about buying

1475
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,960
 one of these for my brother,

1476
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,560
 who I've never seen him so furious

1477
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,720
 as when LucasAid halved the sugar content

1478
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,360
 in their drinks.

1479
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,480
 It hasn't been the same.

1480
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,520
 It doesn't taste the same.

1481
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,880
 So, in 2018, the sugar in iron brew halved.

1482
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,040
 There was lots of rules over the last few years

1483
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,560
 saying, you know, you've got to reduce your sugar.

1484
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,760
 And you can buy a LucasAid pre-2011

1485
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,120
 for £145.

1486
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,920
 OK.

1487
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,120
 I might just suck it out of order.

1488
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,160
 That's quite a lot, isn't it?

1489
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,280
 But imagine how good that's going to taste

1490
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,560
 now after all these years.

1491
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,000
 I'm with your brother, actually.

1492
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,160
 I think modern pop is disgusting.

1493
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,480
 Really?

1494
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,280
 Can you taste the difference?

1495
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,760
 Oh, yeah.

1496
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,080
 Really?

1497
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,480
 I don't think so.

1498
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,120
 I don't think so, really.

1499
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,520
 But ironically, you listen to a lot of modern pop,

1500
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,800
 which I find disgusting.

1501
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:46,400
 OK, that's it.

1502
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,520
 That is all of our facts.

1503
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,880
