00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.200
 Afternoon all, you must know by now if you've been paying attention over the last couple of months

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.800
 that I have for some reason committed to traveling the country with these three upcoming idiots.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.640
 We are going to all sorts of exotic places like Ipswich, Barnstable, Pool, Reading,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.120
 Peterborough, Chesterfield, but popping over to Dublin, we're going up to Scotland,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.240
 few locations there. Obviously, sitting on a tour bus for months on end with Dan, James and Andy

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.480
 is not how any sane person would choose to spend their time. The only thing that's going to make

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.080
 it bearable is if you guys come along too, please know such things at fish.com has all the details,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.120
 get tickets, come and watch us. There'll be an exclusive first half which will never be available

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.760
 anywhere else and then we'll be doing a different podcast every night for the second half. See you there.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:05.120
 [Music]

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.360
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.080
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a humongous distance

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.360
 from Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.920
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that's my fact, my fact this week is that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.600
 it would take people around 10 minutes to adjust to the way Abraham Lincoln sounded before they

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.520
 could enjoy his speeches. Wow. So the first 10 minutes of his speeches always really shit because

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.280
 he knows it has to be filler and at the 10 minute mark he launches into the real stuff. He does the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.400
 whole what do you do, what's your job, you know, emceeing moments. Hang on Dan, Abraham Lincoln's

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.160
 most famous speech was the Gettysburg Address where I believe he spoke for two minutes.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.720
 And also his most famous line is the first line of that address isn't it? Oh no, yeah you're right.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.920
 It's true. Oh I would say it was the last line so it's the last line. Wasn't it Shall Not Parish from

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.040
 the Earth line? Yes it was the first line, four score. I really would have gone the four score

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.120
 as the big line. Would you? And I would go by the people too, the people four the people with the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.040
 people. You didn't understand the first minute and a half though did you? That's true because I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.840
 was so distracted by his weird voice. What's his weird voice? Did he have an accent? He did have an

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.040
 accent but he also had a much higher voice than you would think so I guess all of us probably had

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.120
 an introduction to Abraham Lincoln's supposed voice through the movies and so on. For me it was

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.400
 Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Incredibly Low. I watched that this weekend. Did you? Well

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.880
 you would have seen it then. My niece had never seen it, she's only nine and so yeah. Right.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.120
 Introduced her to it, it's brilliant. It's a fantastic movie. Talk about that.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.240
 So he comes out at the end and he does the four score and it's a very baritone

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.920
 war score and that's what we know is Lincoln but all of the contemporary accounts of his

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.920
 speeches say that he had a tenor's voice, a much higher voice and as a result there's a historian

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.840
 called Harold Holzer who's written over 40 books on both Lincoln and the Civil War and he found

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.760
 that there were all these accounts of journalists saying that for the first 10 minutes people just

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.680
 really had to adjust to both the accent and the sound matched with this tall human who was quite

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.320
 gangly and just putting all the things together. It took 10 minutes before they could settle in

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.560
 and go oh okay he's actually saying amazing stuff. It sounds like a really weird voice

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.000
 all because obviously no recording. Your good at voices, Adley, can you do us a little?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.120
 He had a thin tenor or rather falsetto voice almost as high-pitched as a Boson's whistle.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.680
 All the reviews are so negative of him. The New York Herald said he had a frequent tendency

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.600
 to dwindle into a shrill and unpleasant sound. It just sounds yeah. Some people think it was

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.240
 useful though because like there were some famous debates he did with a guy called Stephen A. Douglas

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.120
 and he had quite a baritone voice Stephen A. Douglas but they think that maybe in a big crowd

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.200
 the baritone might sometimes get lost there and the people at the back will be able to hear the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.440
 high pitch sounds better. Yes, how interesting. Is that like when your neighbours are having a party

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.960
 and you can hear the bass much more indistinctly but the high stuff is what really annoys you?

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.880
 Yeah. For me it's the bass. Is that a joke? No. The bass is the annoying bit right? The bass is

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.160
 the bit that keeps you. Yes, you're right. Okay, so it's like the opposite of my life with my neighbours.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.760
 It's another brilliant analogy from Andy Murray. The whole thing of it being the voice being low,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.240
 the first time I think I've then heard the higher voices when Daniel Day-Lewis played him

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.080
 in the Spielberg movie. It's a fantastic movie. It's still Bill and Ted. It's no Bill and Ted.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.120
 Yeah, I read an article in the Library of Congress and they said that his voice is closer to that

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.840
 Daniel Day-Lewis voice than any other impression that anyone's ever done. They even said it was

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.000
 more close than the one Andy is going to do on the podcast in a few weeks' time on that article.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.480
 So when Daniel Day-Lewis was cast for the movie, which was after Liam Neeson had to drop out,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.200
 he spent a year prepping. Was Liam Neeson going to play Lincoln? Liam Neeson was going to play Lincoln.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.480
 I don't know if I take a role that I was second to Liam Neeson. Well, I think Daniel Day-Lewis

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.200
 was the original choice. He said no to it and then Liam Neeson got involved and then Liam Neeson

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.840
 had a horrible role. I know, yeah. Surely then Daniel Day-Lewis said, "Oh god, fine, I will do it,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.680
 my lord. I'm going to find whoever stole my hat and I'm going to rip their heads from the body."

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:46.720
 Yeah, so he took on the role and he spent a year, possibly more, prepping for it. Read over 100

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.360
 books and that's when he was trying to find the voice, the voice of Lincoln. And when he

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.960
 eventually found it - Probably reading the wrong books, wasn't he? I made an audio book.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.240
 Well, he eventually decided on what the voice was. He recorded it with a neighbour and he posted it

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.120
 to Steven Spielberg in a package where he drew a skull and crossbones on it and put a black mark on

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.520
 it because he wanted no one but Steven Spielberg to read to hear it first. Yeah, interesting and

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.160
 exciting to be tempered with. If it was just a blank envelope, I'd be like, "Yeah, fine, I'm not

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.880
 interested in that." All of a sudden, he didn't treasure that. Exactly. I don't know what he was

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.720
 thinking. It sounds very odd filming with him because he is your classic method actor, I guess.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.680
 Daniel Day-Lewis and he insisted on being Lincoln on set, so he talked in that voice the entire

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.000
 time on and off set for months and months when they were filming. He never didn't talk in the voice.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.120
 He wouldn't allow any accents other than American accent around him in case that put him off his

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.040
 flow. He made everyone refer to him as Mr. President throughout filming. I think Spielberg

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.800
 insisted on that as well. Did he? Why they're both presidents? It was very confusing, battle of the

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.480
 presidents. No, no, he said, "Let's buy into this." Oh, so he said that everyone had to call Day-Lewis

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.200
 President? I believe so because he started coming in irreappropriate clothing as well as the director

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.320
 to sort of make it. Spielberg did that and Daniel Day-Lewis was not on the call sheet. Abraham

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.720
 Lincoln was on the call sheet instead. How do you dress irreappropriate as a film director if

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:23.280
 you're dressing for the 1860s? Surely, yeah, he just walks in and he went, "Sorry, we can't make a

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.720
 film because film hasn't been invented." Everyone go home. There's one journalist who described

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.880
 Lincoln as a slang-wanging stump speaker. That is a great phrase, isn't it? It's a really good

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.800
 phrase. He was known for being humble, which some people cast as maybe not sophisticated enough in

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.920
 his language, slang-wanging. He's wanging the slang around. His accent, we were saying before,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.320
 was kind of different as well, right? So whenever he was supposed to say chairman, he would say

00:07:52.320 --> 00:08:00.880
 "Cheerman." Cheerman. Cheerman. Cheerman. What about this? If he ever said "Winder." Winder.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.400
 That's window. Window, right. Learned would be "Larrant," and he would always say "Recum" instead

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:19.440
 of "Assume." That sounds really different. But equally strangely, he also had a lot of misspellings

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.640
 in his written work as well, and he would often spell the word "Inaugural" wrong. Oh, yeah.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.920
 But we think that perhaps that gives a clue as to how he spoke as well. If he spelled it slightly

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.240
 differently, maybe he spoke it that way as well. Right. Was it radically different? Did it start

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.480
 with a Q? No, it would be "Inaugural" instead of "Inaugural." Right. "Inaugural."

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.520
 And he stood so still. This was another report of the way he spoke. So his law partner was a man

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.000
 called William Herndon, and Herndon recorded that, I don't know why he said this, but he said "You

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 could leave a silver dollar between his feet at the start of his speech, and it would still be

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.440
 there at the end." I have a theory for why he did this. So I was reading accounts of young Lincoln.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.440
 I don't think he actually did that. I'm just - what do you mean? He didn't actually leave

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.800
 a dollar between his feet at the start. No, no, no, but he stood in credit. The point was

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.960
 to make the point. I thought you were saying that he had done that. I have a theory that the coin

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.760
 was magic. He used to be a busker, and he always put a few quotes there to just get people to know.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:24.800
 No, my theory, which probably is an established reason as opposed to a theory,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.120
 is when he was young, he used to sit up late at night, and he used to listen to his dad tell

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.040
 stories to all of his friends. Really funny stories. Lincoln was obsessed with them.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.880
 So in the morning, he would go and he would find his friends, and he would tell all the stories

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.960
 that his dad had told the night before, and he would stand on a tree stump, and that is where

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.160
 he would deliver all of his speeches. So he didn't have much of a stage. He had the space

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.280
 of a tree stump, and that would have informed the lack of leg movement, which then took him

00:09:51.280 --> 00:10:02.240
 to presidency when he was doing his inaugural speech. The Gettysburg Address was not him.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.840
 Wow, okay, this is a crazier theory than my tree stump theory.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.400
 This is, he stood so still because it was actually a robot. No, the Gettysburg Address

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.600
 was someone else delivered it. So really, at the event where he delivered the Gettysburg Address,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.000
 he was supposed to be giving a very short closing dedication, which is why it was only

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.240
 two minutes long. It was just very quick. Thanks for coming, guys. Thank God these bloats gave

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.200
 their lives for the Civil War, et cetera. If there's a carriage in the park with the license plate,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.760
 it's blocking the way you need to move your carriage. Exactly. The person who was supposed

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.520
 to give what they were calling the Gettysburg Address at the time was this great orator and

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:47.760
 politician, pastor, who was called Edward Everett. And his was two hours long. So that could be the

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.680
 one we all knew off by heart. Wow, really? So did he actually do that two hour speech first?

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.640
 He did a two hour speech, which means it's incredible people had the energy to listen

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.320
 to Lincoln after that. He did the two hours and then. I wonder they loved it so much.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.240
 I think he was sick at the time as well, Lincoln, when he then gave the speech afterwards and it

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.440
 kind of bombed, I guess, after a two hour speech. Yeah, it got terrible reviews everywhere. So

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.240
 the Times said that the inauguration of the cemetery at Gettysburg was an imposing ceremony

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.520
 only rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.680
 He got a really, yeah. And in fact, there was an apology issued in 2013 by a newspaper called

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.040
 The Patriot News, who gave him a really bad review at the time. They said it was silly remarks and

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:39.360
 that maybe he was drunk and that it deserved the veil of oblivion. And then in 2013, they recanted.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.720
 Of all the things he should be apologizing for, it does feel quite far down the list.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.840
 When did Lincoln become President? How do you all know? 1860?

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.280
 Yeah. So when do you think the first town was named after him?

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.960
 I would have guessed a few years after the Civil War or maybe soon after it.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.440
 Okay, I'm going to go the opposite direction and say he was an influential lawyer and maybe that

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.480
 led to something. So two years before he was President as well.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.720
 Wow. Who are you and what have you done with Dan Shriver? That is absolutely correct.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.320
 It was 1853 because he was a lawyer. Some people who were setting up a new town brought him in to

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.560
 kind of sign the deeds and they said, would you mind if we named this town after you?

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.360
 God, that's flattering.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.760
 That's Lincoln, Illinois, which is still there today. And at noon that day, he purchased two

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.200
 watermelons, carried them to the public square and squeezed the watermelon juice out onto the

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.920
 ground. Did he use his thighs? Call back.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.320
 And then he said to the people, nothing bearing the name Lincoln ever amounted to much.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.480
 So he said that they shouldn't really have called it after him.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.680
 That's very cool.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.240
 One thing from the time that Lincoln was President was that the White House was an

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.840
 open house at the time, which is so bizarre to think of now obviously because there are

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.840
 two miles of security around it. But people were just walking in all the time.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.520
 You could just walk into the White House and people were free to climb in through the windows.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.960
 They camped outside his office door.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.400
 If it's open, why'd they go through the windows?

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.360
 Idea, actually.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.920
 But they were demanding jobs from him. It was just, the whole thing was carnage.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.280
 He's the president of the country.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.080
 He must have had one room where it was like, do not enter.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.880
 Well, he had an office.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.160
 They had to cut it down to two, five hour sessions a week where you could just

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.200
 knock on the door and go and see him and chat to him and ask for a job.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.840
 Ten hours a week of his working time was spent just being harangued by people

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.160
 and he called them his public opinion baths and people would just leave inventions that

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.960
 they thought he might like to look at. It's insane and he couldn't walk from the office

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.040
 to his own private living quarters without being bothered along the way by people asking for jobs

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.720
 and the White House maintenance people had to build a partition to say, no, he actually just

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.920
 needs a corridor that he can walk along without being bothered all the time.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.280
 Corridor of power.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.880
 Yes. It's mad.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.680
 I suppose it's kind of like an MP surgery, isn't it today?

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.000
 Yeah.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.640
 But, you know.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.600
 For 10 hours a week.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.880
 For the quarter of your working time.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.240
 For the president of the United States.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.960
 I know.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.800
 I think he did more than 40 hours a week.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.760
 Maybe at the height of the war.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.400
 Yeah, you're right.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.440
 And now he bothers presidents because isn't he constantly reported?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.280
 Not constantly, but by a few, the ghost of Lincoln seen in the White House.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:15.680
 Right.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.960
 The people of, you know, presidents have said, yeah, yeah, I saw the ghost of Lincoln.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.440
 Wow.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.720
 Yeah.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.280
 That's him.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:34.640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.520
 My fact this week is that 5,000 years ago,

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.560
 Scots built houses by dropping huge piles of stones to the bottom of locks

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.160
 and building their home on top of them.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.360
 That's amazing.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.000
 It's so amazing.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.320
 It's such a weird way of doing it.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.360
 And we don't know why they did it.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.280
 These are things called crannogs.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.280
 I mean, if you live in Scotland, it's very likely you know about them.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.720
 I actually didn't know about them at all.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.600
 Yeah, never heard of them.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.800
 But there are about 600 of them known about so far.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.640
 They're artificial islands that were built in locks

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.520
 and they would be connected to the shore by like a little causeway.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.360
 And until quite recently, it was thought they'd dated back to about 800 BC.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.160
 And then they just did some radiocarbon dating of pottery

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.920
 that's been sunken around them.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.440
 And they found out it actually dates back to 3,600 BC.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.520
 Oh, that's a good dough.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.320
 Before Stonehenge, before the pyramids,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.480
 the Scots were just piling up stones in locks

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.320
 and building a house on top for no apparent reason.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.240
 It's not just piling stones, right?

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.960
 Like there's so much engineering that goes around it.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.920
 Yeah, it's so impressive.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.520
 So the word crannog is Gaelic for son of tree or young tree.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.040
 And the idea is because they would cut these huge long timber piles

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.520
 and they ram them into the beds of the lock

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.920
 and then they would pile the stones in around them.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.000
 So they had a solid wooden foundation.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.400
 So you've got like a scaffold that you can stuff full.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.400
 Yeah, I think there are different types as well,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.160
 aren't there? There are some that are just timber.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
 So they're just kind of wooden platforms

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.600
 and then there are some that are stones.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.320
 And we've tried to remake them in modern times

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.720
 and it's taken about three years to construct one

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.000
 to be in a similar, using the technology and so on.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.680
 Drive the piles into the bed of the lock.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.400
 Exactly.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.240
 They have to get meters into the bed of the lock.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.960
 And you know, that's obviously incredibly hard to do from a floating surface.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.680
 Well, I think what happens is you put some stones

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.480
 near the shore and then you put some a little bit further away

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.040
 and a little bit further away and you put like a path

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.800
 to the middle of the lock or not the middle,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.720
 maybe a few meters away from the edge.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.160
 And then you build it from there.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
 So you kind of make a causeway first.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.360
 And if you look from above,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.400
 you can kind of see the little causeway underneath the water.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:32.560
 Yeah.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.440
 And then how do you get the pile to go so deep into the bed?

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.600
 Oh yeah, I mean, it's all crazy.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.960
 How do you do it?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.240
 I think we'll know.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.400
 You pile up on top like a circus trick.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.080
 You just have people standing in front of each other.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.720
 It's the ghost of Lincoln, I think is coming out again.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.400
 In flyers stuff.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.680
 If it's the Loch Ness Monster.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.800
 It's aliens, of course it's aliens.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.400
 No, we have no idea, do we?

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.240
 It's absolutely amazing.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.760
 Live there until the 17th century,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.920
 apparently the last people were living on crannogs.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.960
 So pretty relatively recent compared with when they were built.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.880
 I think the ones where we found the pottery,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.040
 we're not sure if people actually lived there, right?

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.440
 Yeah.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.680
 So the reason that we think they might not have lived

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.920
 on these particular ones is because there isn't any domestic waste around there.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.200
 You do have these pots, there's no human remains,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.000
 so we don't think it's a funeral thing.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.240
 So we think it might be some kind of feast,

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.040
 maybe some kind of rite of passage, that kind of thing.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.480
 So what has happened is people have brought some pots to this island,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.120
 this fake island, done something,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.600
 thrown the pots in the water and then left.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.400
 It's a bar.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.160
 I mean, that's obviously just a bar.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.800
 It could be.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.760
 Tiki bar.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.360
 Yeah, it's a bar.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.040
 You're pissed, you toss your pot away,

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.720
 you can't be asked to carry it home.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.760
 It's a Scottish pub.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.600
 The first pubs.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.960
 It sounds so exciting being the person who discovered that they were really old.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.240
 So they are 3,000 years older than we thought they were.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.120
 And it was a retired navy diver called Chris Murray

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.600
 who first kind of discovered this and it was 10 years ago

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.720
 and he was just going for a dive and he saw some pots

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.280
 and then he sent them off to be analysed and turned out

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.360
 they were 5,500 years old.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.720
 But he was saying that in 2020 he was going for a dive

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.160
 and he found a 5,500 year old drinking vessel.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.800
 He just saw a little fragment sticking out of the mud.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.600
 So he took it and then he took a sip of water from it

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.200
 and you can think the last time someone did this

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.680
 was over five millennia ago.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.160
 Yeah.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.440
 Isn't that so cool?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.160
 It is amazing.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.240
 Maybe people will be doing that with our old horrible ribena cartons

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.800
 and plastic festival cups in 5,000 years.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.360
 Yeah, sure.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.800
 What a nice thought.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.680
 What a lovely thought.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.520
 All the plastic will still be there, won't it?

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.160
 Yep.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.960
 Yeah.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.960
 Artificial islands?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:43.760
 Yeah.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.360
 So lots of artificial islands in the world.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.320
 I didn't know about the ones in Bolivia Imperial and Lake Titicaca.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.280
 Yeah, I've heard that.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.080
 They're amazing.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.200
 I've stayed on them.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.840
 Thank you.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.880
 Thank you.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.760
 Wow, the floating ones.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.520
 The floating ones, the reed islands, yeah.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.080
 So yeah, these are islands made of weeds woven together

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.080
 and they're made by indigenous people

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.320
 and it seems like they were just made by the Uro people

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.320
 and basically they got to the shores of Lake Titicaca

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.760
 hoping to set up camp and like take residence there 1,000 years ago

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.360
 and they realized there were people there.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.440
 There was the Quechua people, the Aymara people there.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.640
 So they were like, well, we can't live here.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.520
 What should we do?

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.120
 So they built some platforms

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.640
 and then just sailed out into the middle of a lake

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.760
 and they still hang out there.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.800
 Yeah, it's really cool.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.120
 When I was there, they said that they went there

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.160
 because there was taxes they wanted to get away with.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.960
 So it was like a literal offshore account that they went so they can tax them.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.120
 But some people think it was because there was a war

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.840
 and they went there so that people couldn't attack them.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.080
 But yeah, they taught me how to make the reeds

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.040
 and stuff like that.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.240
 Oh, cool.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.880
 So because you have to constantly sort of,

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.400
 it's like repainting a bridge, right?

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.560
 Like you're constantly fixing the reeds.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.480
 So near to where the islands are,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.560
 there's loads of massive reeds and you go over there

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.080
 and you cut them down and then you kind of turn them into like little,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.360
 not like bricks, but like little groups of reeds.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.200
 And I went on a boat to the school

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.560
 because they have a floating school

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.800
 and a floating basketball court and stuff.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.600
 Oh, wow.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.560
 I was staying with family of Uros and it was really cool.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.200
 Wow.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.920
 Highly recommend that.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.960
 It's so amazing.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.080
 Have you heard of Mischief Reef?

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.360
 It's another created island.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.600
 And it's a new island that's been created by China.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.760
 And it's in the, is it the South China Sea?

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.720
 I think it is.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.120
 Probably.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.720
 It's why they do most of their island creations.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.560
 They are creating a lot of islands at the moment.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.720
 And it's causing a lot of mischief.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.120
 Yeah.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.160
 They are, they genuinely are.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.160
 I tried to work out, was this called Mischief Reef

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.080
 before China started creating military runways

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.200
 and hangers and, you know, missile bases?

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.720
 It's quite an innocuous term.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.320
 It's Naughty Boy Island.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:44.960
 Yeah.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.000
 Silly Billy.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.160
 Mischief Reef is one of the biggest.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.160
 And you can see photos of it from, you know,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.520
 15 years ago, photos now.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.960
 And it looks like a different place.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.000
 It is a different place, actually,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.600
 because it's been imported and installed

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 and concreted and all over.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.240
 But there's this bizarre war of attrition

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.760
 going on, kind of Cold War style,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.800
 between the China who are building these islands,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.000
 which are contested, by the way.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.360
 The ownership is contested.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.640
 And the US Navy.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.600
 So the US Navy keeps on sailing close to them

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.640
 to make the point.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.240
 They do a thing called a phonop,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.040
 which is a freedom of navigation operation.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.920
 And if you have a land,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.080
 I think the barrier is 12 miles.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.160
 Like that's how far your border stretches

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.920
 into the ocean, if the island is definitely yours.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.080
 I know there are different sort of definitions,

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.120
 but the USA pointedly sails within 12 miles

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.360
 of mischief reef to make the point,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.880
 these are international waters,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.720
 according to the international community.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.240
 So we're going to keep on doing it.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.960
 And it hasn't broken into a conflict yet.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.320
 Oh, a little bit, hasn't it?

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.360
 Because, like, I think Philippines want it.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.400
 Japan wants it.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.440
 Indonesia wants it.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.320
 Russia wants it.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.000
 It's like, yeah, it's dodgy.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.280
 But do you remember I was telling you guys

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.600
 about in Bhutan, on the border between Bhutan and China?

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.840
 China has just started building villages.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.520
 Yes, yes.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.400
 And no one noticed.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.080
 And like, in Bhutan, they started.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.240
 In Bhutan, yeah, like the Bhutanese noticed,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.520
 and they were like, well,

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.920
 shall we tell the Chinese not to do this anymore?

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.360
 Or shall we just kind of leave it?

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.640
 And they just kind of left it

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.400
 because there are other things that they want

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.720
 to have a good deal with China about.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.040
 But then the international community are like,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.160
 well, last time we looked here,

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.400
 there weren't three villages and an airport.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.600
 And they're, you know--

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.240
 Oh, man.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.720
 Yeah.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.160
 I thought it was called "Mischief Islands"

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.000
 because of a ship.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.400
 Oh, really?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.040
 Called the mischief.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.520
 My lobby.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.120
 Yeah, I think it's in dedication to a ship

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.400
 that used the passing that.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.360
 I could be wrong about that, but--

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.320
 A GMS mischief.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.160
 Yeah, I think that's possibly right.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.920
 It's a party cruise ship, wasn't it?

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.800
 It's a Swingers cruise.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.480
 Here's an island that I'd never heard of.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.080
 Dejima.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.200
 This was created in Nagasaki Bay

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.120
 in the 17th century in Japan.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.640
 And during the Edo period,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.720
 Japan wanted to be a closed country,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.640
 so it didn't want anyone else to come in.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.760
 The only people that were allowed to go anywhere near Japan

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.000
 were Chinese, Korean, and Dutch.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.720
 And they were allowed to do that for trading reasons.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.360
 OK.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.480
 Dutch is a bit of a wild card.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.000
 Feels like a Dutch got a weird free pass

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.960
 that was about a year ago.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.160
 OK, whatever, not offended.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.280
 But basically, if you were a member

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.880
 of the Dutch East India Company

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.240
 and you were trading

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.400
 and you were like taking some silk there

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.840
 or some spices or whatever,

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.280
 you would go to this created island called Dejima

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.560
 and you would kind of live on there,

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.720
 but you weren't allowed onto the main island.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.520
 And there was like a bridge there with guards

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.600
 which would stop you from going over.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.120
 It's really, really cool.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.400
 There's an amazing book,

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.920
 David Mitchell book, set on Dejima,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.960
 because it was very famous.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.320
 Japan's policy was

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.800
 they didn't want any Western culture

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.320
 coming in and invading them,

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.080
 so which is why they really tried to block them out

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.520
 and then wars happened

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.120
 and we got involved and forced them out of it.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.320
 But yeah, it's so brilliant.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:44.960
 What was the book?

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.880
 The Thousand Autums of Jacob Dezoet.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.320
 And yeah, so it's about this Dutch guy

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.920
 who goes over and stays there.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.440
 But yeah, completely fake.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.640
 Yeah, and while you're on there,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.880
 like the local kids would kind of,

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.560
 oh, look, there's a Dutch person.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.160
 Isn't that strange kind of thing?

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.880
 And also, you were required to tell the Japanese

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.120
 about anything that had happened in the world

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.000
 while you were away.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.920
 Really?

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.040
 You're a human newspaper

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.240
 for the news of three years ago

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.080
 when you last left the Western world.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.640
 I find that really cool,

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.320
 because at one point,

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.840
 Dejima was the only independent bit of the Netherlands.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.040
 So at one point,

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.120
 the Netherlands was an artificial island.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.120
 So this is when the Netherlands was annexed

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.120
 by Napoleon, I think, in the Napoleonic Wars

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.760
 and like lots of Dutch territory was taken elsewhere.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.040
 And so that was where they lived.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.560
 And I think they succeeded there

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.920
 because they're so used to living on

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.120
 basically artificial reclaimed land, right?

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.240
 The Netherlands is sort of mostly an artificial island

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:38.800
 in itself.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.600
 About 60% of the land in the Netherlands

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.400
 is just there because they've drained away the water

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.600
 and they've built it up.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.320
 It's amazing.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.760
 Yeah, it's incredible.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.840
 Most of the population lives on land

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.040
 that shouldn't naturally be there.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:51.280
 Yeah.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.280
 There's an entire province called Leverpolde,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.280
 which is the 12th province of the Netherlands

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.080
 and it's new.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.080
 It's just a new land.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.640
 Oh, because polder is what they're called.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.400
 It's a polder, the reclaimed land, isn't it?

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:04.720
 Yeah.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.160
 It would make you nervous, I think.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.360
 That is incredible.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.840
 I found a really cool new artificial island,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.520
 which I'm so annoyed.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.120
 I have not looked up the pronunciations,

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.640
 but I imagine you guys will know it.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.280
 So here we go.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.880
 It's a bridge which connects Copenhagen to Malmo.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.560
 And it's the Aurasund bridge.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.280
 Aurasund, yeah.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.240
 Aurasund.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.760
 So have you been there?

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.920
 Okay, apparently you've been to every artificial island.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.160
 So the Aurasund bridge, if you're passing it,

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.120
 you go in the bridge and then--

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.200
 In fact, it's what the TV show, The Bridge, is based on.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.320
 Exactly, yes.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.800
 Yeah.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.640
 And it goes down underneath, doesn't it?

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.920
 As opposed to being a bridge that connects Copenhagen to Malmo,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.720
 it goes bridge-like and then suddenly it becomes a tunnel

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.680
 and you go underneath.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.240
 And that tunnel bit has become an artificial island,

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.400
 which is called Pepa Holm.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.920
 And Pepa Holm is called that

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.920
 because there is an actual island next to it

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.280
 called Saltholm.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.720
 Nice.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.680
 Yeah.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.960
 So that's the--

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.480
 They don't mention that in The Bridge.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:58.960
 Do they not?

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.320
 It's a really great TV show.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.400
 It's so exciting, Saganaren, Lansky Malmo.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.480
 It's really like cool and sexy and scandy.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.520
 And they don't ever say that.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.800
 If they just had one character

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.800
 who just gave bits of trivia about the area,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.520
 that would be way better.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.040
 It would have been a successful show, exactly.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.720
 But so yeah, so it's become this artificial island.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.680
 And--

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.360
 So how does the tunnel become an island?

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.360
 There's a stretch of water between the two.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.480
 Between Malmo and--

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:20.880
 Where is it?

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.440
 Come here.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.160
 Right, all right.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.000
 So you have a bridge over some of it.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Then there's an island at the end of the bridge.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.880
 And that island then contains the portal to a tunnel.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.280
 Yes.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.600
 The tunnel runs under the rest of the water.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.480
 Right.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.840
 So the boats can still go past, but you can have a bridge.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.320
 I see.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.040
 I see.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.320
 Very clever.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.960
 And so what's happened is this small,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.040
 very concrete-looking island

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.560
 has become a place where new species have migrated to

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.600
 and set up shop.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.760
 And so you're only really allowed--

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.320
 What are they selling?

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.320
 There's like a penguin going, "Won't they fish?

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.440
 Won't they fish anyone?

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:53.920
 Any fish?"

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.360
 So supposedly, I mean, this is--

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.160
 I don't know if this is definitely still the case in 2021,

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.680
 but for the last few years,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.920
 it's been the case that you can only go there once a year.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.320
 And it's only biologists who are allowed to go there.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.920
 And what they found on it is amazing.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.920
 There's 12 species of bird that are living there.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.480
 There were 20 species of spider, one really rare one,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.760
 which they think might have migrated there via a train.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.960
 So it sort of popped off.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.440
 Oh, nice.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.240
 While it was on the train.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.680
 There's a couple of rabbits there

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.120
 that they think some people in a car

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.520
 must have just let out and let them be on their own.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.000
 There's 345 species of beetle.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.760
 There's 421 species of butterfly.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.000
 Which vehicle did these all leave out of?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.920
 The beetles came in a yellow submarine.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:41.840
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.280
 And that is James.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.480
 Okay, my fact this week is that the only known species

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.800
 of marine lichen was discovered by a person named Ivan Lam.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.720
 Their work often acknowledged the help of a Miss Elkie Mackenzie.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.600
 But that turned out to be one in the same person

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.720
 as Lam later transitioned and took that name.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.640
 It's very cool.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.840
 Isn't that cool?

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.880
 So Ivan Lam was basically thanking her future self.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.360
 Exactly.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.800
 Elkie Mackenzie.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.200
 Yeah.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.840
 Or teasing.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.520
 It's a trailer for.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.040
 Yeah.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.160
 So I read a no-bit tree of Elkie Mackenzie

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.920
 written by Vernon Akmagian.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.800
 But I'd actually first come across Elkie Mackenzie

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.280
 in a blog by JSTOR, the website, by Sabrina Imbla.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.600
 And in that blog, there was an amazing thing

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.320
 that said that Mackenzie had spent her whole life

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.840
 preparing this monograph of a particular type of lichen,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.160
 only for her never to be able to quite make it.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.440
 Because sometimes her specimens got blown away

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.760
 once she fell down an elevator shaft.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.400
 Did she fall down an elevator shaft?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.440
 Or did the light fall down?

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.720
 It's really hard to tell.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.640
 But that was what really piqued my interest

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.600
 about this person.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.200
 It's like, what an amazing life.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.840
 But yeah, a really cool person who kind of dedicated

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.960
 her life to lichen.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.440
 She worked in the Natural History Museum in London

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.680
 as an assistant to Annie Lorraine Smith in the 1930s.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.240
 And it's just so interesting that at the time,

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.840
 Annie Lorraine Smith was a huge character in the lichen world.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.320
 And she'd written a book which became the sort of seminal

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.800
 textbook for the time about lichen.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.240
 Yet she was not officially hired by the Natural History Museum

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.160
 because they didn't hire women at the time.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.520
 So she had to have, her pay packet was outsourced

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.040
 to somewhere else that could fund it

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.120
 because that was the only way that they could do it

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.840
 because they didn't have women on the payroll.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.880
 Wow.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.680
 It's weird the reading about the history of lichenologists

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.120
 because there do seem to be a lot of women in there.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.880
 Like in the 19th century, a lot of the people

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.360
 I was coming across were women, which was kind of exciting.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.920
 It was like a secret area that women knew

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.560
 that they were going to be led into almost, but not quite.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.720
 And I did get excited that Carol Dodge,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.520
 who was Elkie McKenzie's main rival, was also a woman,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.040
 but it's not a woman.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.720
 But it's kind of sad, Carol Dodge, the Carol Dodge story

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.960
 because Elkie didn't like Dodge.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.600
 So what Elkie found that was really revolutionary

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.280
 in the lichen world was endemic Antarctic species, right?

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.640
 And she never got the chance to publish her Antarctic discoveries

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.080
 for various reasons.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.000
 And she didn't like Dodge because she thought

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.840
 Dodge's taxonomy was kind of reckless

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.480
 and Dodge was just identifying things all over the shop.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.040
 You pick up a bit of lichen, you go, "Yeah, yeah, I bet that's a new one.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.400
 Come and write it down."

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.800
 And now Dodge's record of Antarctic lichen

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.040
 is the kind of authority because McKenzie, for various reasons.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.080
 One of which was that she said in, I can't remember what year

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.600
 she transitioned, I think it was the late '70s maybe,

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.320
 but she said, "I am a woman, so I'm going to have the surgery."

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.000
 And she basically was made to take early retirement.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.840
 Yeah, that's the implication, isn't it?

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.880
 They sort of tried to rewrite the history in the moment,

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.200
 didn't they, by saying, "Oh, it's just for reasons."

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.520
 But it was quite obvious that that's why.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.560
 Yeah, post McKenzie's retirement, she got into woodwork.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.320
 Post, obviously felt like a bit of a wind down.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.400
 And I think she had some mental health problems

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.720
 that she admitted to, she'd been quite depressed.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.160
 And so she quit the whole lichen game

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.840
 and decided to get really into making Siemens chests.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.600
 So, you know.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.480
 Where else are you going to keep your Siemens?

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.640
 James, Siemens chests are a completely different thing

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.000
 to Siemens chests.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.640
 Oh, no.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.760
 Then what am I keeping mine in?

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.640
 Oh, my God.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.560
 That's why they didn't invite you back on the boat.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.520
 Oh, no.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.040
 There's a treasure map out there where, one day when it's found,

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.720
 it's going to be hugely disappointing, just a pool of Siemens.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.480
 X marks, they're spunk more like.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.440
 Wow, that was too far, wasn't it?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.240
 Too far, yeah.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.040
 She didn't make receptacles for Siemens.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.640
 It's just to make that very clear.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.720
 She was made receptacle for Siemens gear.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.640
 You know, it's like that, it's like a suitcase.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.440
 The only notable thing really about them is that

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.680
 they're like a chest, but they have sides that tilt inwards

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.200
 because if you're on a rocky boat, you don't want them to tip over.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.760
 Very clever.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.400
 Very clever.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.080
 And they have very intricate knots in the handles called beckets.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.000
 And this is what Elkie got particularly into,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.880
 is making these knots.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.560
 Just on Lycan.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.000
 Lycan are incredible.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.440
 I didn't really know what they were.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.480
 God, me neither.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:18.960
 No.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.400
 Why have we never talked about them before?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.280
 And what they are is they're two things.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.120
 They're two species living in the same house.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:25.920
 It's mad.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.960
 Or rather, it's one species living in a house built by another one.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.280
 So it's a fungus and normally an algae teaming up.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.320
 Sometimes it's an algae.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.320
 Sometimes it's a cyanobacteria.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.360
 Sometimes there are two algae.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.240
 It gets a bit complicated.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.080
 But basically, basically the basic thing is it's a fungus

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.280
 which builds a structure and the algae lives in it

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.560
 and photosynthesizes sunlight, which produces sugar,

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.760
 which the fungus then eats.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.440
 So the fungus is providing the home

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.040
 and the algae is bringing in the food.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.080
 And so what's the Lycan?

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.800
 It's the collective thing for the Lycan.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.920
 These two things that are working together,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.320
 as you say, in symbiosis, the word symbiosis was coined

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.800
 by a guy called Heinrich Anton de Barry.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.320
 And he was talking about Lycans when he coined that term.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.200
 Although Vernon Matian, who wrote the obituary of algae,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.560
 he doesn't think they're in symbiosis.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.240
 He thinks that actually the fungus

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.640
 is a controlling parasite of the algae or cyanobacteria.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.120
 It's very interesting.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.640
 What's a stealing food of it?

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.360
 He's basically saying that, yeah, exactly,

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.160
 that the algae has no choice in the matter

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.000
 and it could perfectly happily live

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.600
 without a roof over its head.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.160
 There's no evidence that they need this building

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.680
 that the fungi makes for them

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.280
 and the fungi is getting a free ride.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.880
 But it's very controversial.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.840
 It's a big old debate.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.920
 And it's like everyone knows couples like that,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.480
 where you think, should they be together?

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.720
 Isn't one of them fine without the other one?

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.480
 Is it controlling parasitism?

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.000
 No, I think you can only judge these things

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.920
 from the inside unless you are an algae or a fungi.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.280
 You cannot comment.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.160
 So does the fungi absolutely need the algae then?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.320
 Yeah, because it gets energy from the algae.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.480
 So the fungi can't do what most fungi do,

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.320
 which is eat decomposed matter,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.520
 which is how fungi normally survive.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.960
 But they've now evolved to just eat the food

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.160
 that's made for them by photosynthesis.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:12.960
 So they would starve.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.400
 And the argument is that the algae

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.880
 is getting some protection in return.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.480
 But a lot of people think that actually

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.840
 it doesn't need that protection.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.480
 Right.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.680
 It's controversial.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.800
 Well, I've got actually

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.920
 something even more controversial

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.480
 to blow this even wider open,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.800
 which is that they now think it's not--

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.880
 a lichen is not two organisms.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.760
 It's three.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.320
 Three.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:32.960
 Yeah.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.160
 So that-- and this is a massive discovery

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.680
 in the world of lichen.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.640
 So this is that there have been a bunch of mysteries about it.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.520
 So one was that there were different lichen,

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.840
 which at a DNA level are exactly the same

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.640
 when they studied them,

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.920
 but that have different effects.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.200
 Like some will kill you when you eat them

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.400
 and some are perfectly edible.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.280
 They're like, how is this possible?

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.280
 They look like they're the same thing.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.360
 And they also had this problem

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.360
 where scientists can't recreate lichen in a lab,

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.400
 which you should be able to,

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.240
 because you should be able to get the fungus

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.280
 and the bacteria or the algae shove them together,

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.120
 create it, doesn't work.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.920
 And now they found a way of looking at them closer,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.320
 and they've realized they all have inside them

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.960
 a different fungus, which is more like a yeast.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.360
 So right deep within their cells,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.160
 single cells of this other fungus.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.880
 So is this every known lichen we're talking about?

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.680
 It seems like it might be the definition of lichen

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.120
 is this third thing.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.200
 It's a new order of fungus that does this.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.800
 So it's an extra fungus,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.960
 which is carried within the fungus

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.560
 that then takes to the, oh my God.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.360
 Exactly.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.760
 It's very hard to blow this shit wide open,

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.280
 because a lot of it is just learning

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.120
 about the original shit in the first place.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.880
 And I just blow some more shit wide open.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.600
 Please.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.280
 So you know, there's a lot of species of lichen

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.120
 that they thought were just a single species.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.080
 There's one in particular,

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.760
 which is called dic tionema glabratum.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.600
 And they thought it was just one species.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.360
 And it turns out that it's at least 126 different species

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.080
 of lichen.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.920
 It's this one lichen that you'd never heard of.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.400
 I know.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.760
 It's actually 126 lichens that you'd never heard of.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.880
 It's amazing.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.760
 That's incredible.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.160
 Which lazy intern did the first count of that?

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.120
 Well, the problem is that when you take lichen

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.080
 from the natural setting,

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.000
 if you see that in the, in the countryside,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.440
 it might be lots of different colors.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.520
 It might be lots of different shapes and stuff like that.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.760
 As soon as you take it into the lab,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.880
 it loses all of its color.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.400
 It becomes like a boring gray brown sludge.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.480
 And they kind of all look the same at that point.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.400
 And so loads of people were finding the stuff

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.240
 and bringing it back and they couldn't tell the difference.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.560
 And it's only when they look at the genes

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.840
 that they can now tell the difference

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.960
 between the different species.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.440
 I'll tell you what,

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.600
 if anyone's thinking of becoming a lichenologist,

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.760
 and I imagine after this chat,

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.120
 you're going to be applying.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:41.520
 Sure.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.000
 Best place to do it, New Zealand, in my mind.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.640
 Really?

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.280
 10% of the world's lichen is found in New Zealand.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.880
 And as of 2019, they had fewer than five lichenologists.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.520
 Did they?

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.080
 You would have an absolute playground there,

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.520
 if you wanted to go and do that.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.400
 And wasn't that the place

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.400
 that they had the sexy pavement lichen?

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.440
 It was, exactly.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.400
 Was it in one of our books?

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.640
 We mentioned it in Book of the Year 2019.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.480
 It was that New Zealanders, I believe,

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.840
 were told by the government

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.000
 to stop licking lichen on the ground

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.800
 because it was acting like Viagra.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.440
 But who was licking lichen off the ground?

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:13.840
 I don't think,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.200
 I think they were taking it off the ground

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.880
 and they were ingesting it in a different way.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.320
 Maybe in a tea or something.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:18.560
 Oh, really?

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.480
 Mixed messages because the word lichen

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.240
 comes from the Greek to lick.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.080
 So, you know, what's going on there.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:24.880
 Lichen this.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.120
 Yeah.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.880
 But yes, so they were getting an erection

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.240
 when they had this lichen, right?

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:28.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.400
 And so why were they not allowed to do it?

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.440
 I think it was...

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.200
 I can't actually remember.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:33.680
 Do you remember?

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:33.680
 Yeah.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.160
 I think it was...

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.520
 Who's going around stopping people

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.240
 having perfectly healthy erections

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.280
 based on snuffing pavement scrapings?

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.640
 Maybe if you get the wrong lichen,

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.560
 then maybe you deck falls off or something.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.000
 You know, because they are hard to tell apart.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.360
 So, that's probably that's true.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.640
 I do remember how it was.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.440
 What was it?

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.960
 It was that basically you would get lots of heavy metals

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.920
 leaching into it on the pavements and stuff.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.360
 You might get a dog poo in it.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.480
 You might get dog wee in it.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.640
 It's hard to regulate and make truly things.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.840
 It's hard to regulate.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.920
 There was high levels of lead they found.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.280
 They were found cadmium in it.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.080
 They found mercury.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.360
 They found arsenic.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.680
 And the US Food and Drugs Administration

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.360
 bought one lot online

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.240
 and found that it was actually 20% grass clippings

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.840
 and 80% grammed up Viagra.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.360
 I would say be a lichenologist in Britain

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.720
 because the British Lichen Society,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.480
 as far as I can tell, are super on it.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.320
 They have an amazing website

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.160
 and they just have a fabulous time.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.160
 They've got about 650 members.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.160
 Oh yeah, a lot of competition there though, isn't there?

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.800
 Like Dan was saying only five lichen experts in New Zealand.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.080
 Fewer than five.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:36.960
 That's true.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.480
 I don't know why they're just in favor of the number.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.400
 Yeah, that's what the auditorial said.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.480
 Surely you could just say three if that's what it was.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.560
 Actually in Britain it's useful to become a lichenologist

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.640
 because I was going through the list of the presidents

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.120
 of this society, specifically the women.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.640
 And every single woman that I could find

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.760
 that had a Wikipedia article attached to their name,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.040
 they've all got OBEs.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.880
 So I don't know what's going on in the lichen world

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.040
 that the government is recognizing

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.720
 their work towards the country,

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.480
 but they've all got titles.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:04.960
 Wow.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.640
 Yeah, so that's a quick way to an OBE,

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.920
 become a lichenologist.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.800
 Wow, maybe there's some secret they're not telling us.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.040
 Doesn't feel like a quick way to become an OBE.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.440
 Sorry, I think it takes years and years of craft.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.240
 It's not like become an OBE with this one weird trick.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.000
 I actually am not sure it does take that long.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.480
 Stop denigrating the work of the British lichen society.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.000
 They're serious scientists, dude.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.200
 Again, please don't write in.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.280
 It's the OBE committee that we're talking about.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.360
 Oh, what they just see lichen and they just waggle it through.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.840
 Oh, no, I'm saying it doesn't take long

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.960
 to become a lichenologist.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.360
 It takes a week.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.960
 Okay, yeah, this is what Anna is saying.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.480
 That's my point.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.600
 This is because I was reading about Kerry Knudson

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.400
 or Kerry Knudson.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.000
 Who's California's only professional lichenologist.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.440
 He's a really fun guy.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.480
 And he's published--

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.520
 He were then two, I believe.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.440
 California lichenologist.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.240
 He were then two.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.440
 He's published over 200 papers on them.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.080
 And he pretty much took up being a lichenologist

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.960
 after he retired.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.880
 And now he maybe knows more about lichen

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.000
 than anyone else in the world claims the Atlantic.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.880
 He was a construction worker for most of his life.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.080
 So he ran away from home at 16 to join an anarchist commune.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:12.800
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.320
 He was a construction worker.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:14.720
 Sorry.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.160
 So before he was a construction worker.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.520
 We built a lot of very wonky buildings along anarchic lines.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:19.920
 Yeah.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.800
 No, he ran away at 16 before being a construction worker.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.880
 Took lots of acid, wrote lots of poetry,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.440
 got into quite magic, was a big fan of Friend of the Podcast,

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.320
 Alistair Crowley.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.720
 And then he went off poetry

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.200
 because he didn't like the modernism direction it was going in.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.400
 So worked in construction, got some blood clots in his legs,

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.320
 had to retire prematurely in his 50s.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.600
 And he said to his daughter,

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.040
 "I'm going to go back behind the house

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.040
 and I'm going to study whatever I find there."

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.880
 And he found lichen there.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.840
 And so now he's the world leading lichenologist.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.880
 And he named one after Obama.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.480
 That's his contribution to the lichen world.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.680
 Oh, I've read about that one.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.160
 Yeah.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:56.160
 Yeah.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:56.960
 That was a big deal.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.160
 2008 huge deal.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.680
 You can age structures based on how fast lichen moves across it.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.440
 That's a fun thing to do.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.320
 Lichenometry.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.400
 They're incredibly slow growing, some of them.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.760
 And I really like this.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.080
 The oldest lichens in the world are found in the Arctic.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.080
 And they're a species called rhizocarpum geographicum.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.440
 And they have been aged at 8,600 years, some of them.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.640
 And they're still alive.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:20.880
 Yeah.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.440
 Which I think would make them the oldest living organism on the planet.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:23.840
 What?

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.480
 They also use them for detecting pollution levels, don't they?

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.640
 So if you're in a very polluted area,

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.800
 if a certain type of lichen is introduced and it doesn't grow,

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.560
 that means that the pollution levels are too high.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.600
 And if you can bring them down and then the lichen starts growing there,

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.200
 that shows you that you're at the right level.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.280
 So it's a really interesting bar for--

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.520
 That's why, because there's always some dickhead on our country walk

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.360
 that you're going on when trees are covered in lichen.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.400
 And there's always someone who goes, that's a good sign, actually.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.720
 That's because that means it's really clean air.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.920
 But isn't that true?

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.360
 Yes, it is, but it's just annoying.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.720
 They keep reminding me about it.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.200
 I get it.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.080
 OK.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.600
 The tree looks a bit dirty, though.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.040
 It wouldn't like to be in your club.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.120
 This isn't a stressful country walking club.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.480
 Hey, can I please get listeners to solve a crisis that I had this weekend,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.560
 which is sort of like and related maybe.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.440
 I was in the children's.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.000
 I was staying in this little bit of woodland.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.360
 And we found a tree that was covered in ivy.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.440
 And then the ivy looked like basically a dump truck,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.360
 a dump, a load of mud on it.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.880
 Like every single ivy leaf was covered in red, soily mud.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.760
 And we realized we traced it, looking closely at the tree,

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.400
 back to these sort of large dinner plate size,

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.840
 what looked like fungi.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.040
 Bright white, kind of beautiful fungi growing straight out of the tree.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.800
 And in their dinner plate, which was like a bowl,

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.280
 there were mountains of this red soil stuff.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.240
 And I'm going to put, I am going to get a picture on the podcast Twitter feed.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.440
 On a drive engagement.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.120
 Some old degree.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.880
 And someone needs to tell me what it is.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.480
 Some names of lycan.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.080
 And you can tell me why they're called this.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.880
 OK.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.520
 Um, so dog lycan.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.720
 Why is it called dog lycan?

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.360
 Looks like a dog.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.080
 No, it doesn't look like it's going to look like a dog.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.320
 It grows in the shape of Scooby-Doo.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.440
 It catches bulls in its mouth.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.080
 No, not that.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:14.880
 If dog's pee on it, it eats it up and makes it stronger than the other dog.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.160
 It grows towards the dog star.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.480
 Serious.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.560
 It's all amazing.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.120
 Oh, it's, it's, it's hairy like a dog.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.760
 Like if you were walking in the forest, you'd be like, that's a dog.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.240
 But that's the same as it looks like a dog.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.080
 That's just sea first answer.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.120
 Yeah.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:29.920
 OK, I see.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.920
 Mix it with half a pint of warm milk.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.000
 And it can cure.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:35.760
 A dog?

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.400
 Rabies.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.160
 Rabies, correct.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.200
 Named by Linnaeus in 1753, dog lycan.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:41.680
 Wow.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.400
 Just in case anyone's listening who does happen to have bitten by a rabid dog,

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.800
 we should probably say it definitely doesn't cure rabies.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.240
 No, go, go and get that.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.720
 Is the half pint of milk that does all the work out for rabies?

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.000
 Genuinely glad you guys added that.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.160
 Because in my head, that was how you cure it.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.320
 OK, come on.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.000
 British soldier lycan.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.720
 OK, for wounds on British soldiers, you would, you would put it.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:00.880
 That's good.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.600
 And it would sort of.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:01.920
 Nope.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.960
 I'm going to stick with my previous one.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.000
 Looks like a British soldier.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.240
 Does no one want to shag it?

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.040
 You know how it was like the Americans came over and stole all the ladies?

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:09.680
 Oh.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.920
 Because no one wants to shag the British.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.640
 Andy was right.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.760
 It looks like a British soldier.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.040
 Thank you very much.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.880
 It has a red cap, which looks a bit like the red hats worn by British soldiers

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.560
 during the American Revolutionary War.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.360
 And rock tripe, lycan.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.480
 Oh.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:24.880
 Rock tripe.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.160
 Tripe is innards and things like that.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:28.880
 So.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.240
 Oh, is it one that lives inside a rock?

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.360
 Because there are like, what are they called?

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.200
 They're like endolithic or something.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.880
 Like, and they live literally inside rock.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.360
 That's cool.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.240
 Which is incredible.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.080
 Outside a rock, but underneath a rock in a cave.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.080
 Yeah, neither correct, but great answers.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:44.400
 Yeah.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.040
 That's really good.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.160
 Grows in a kind of string.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.480
 Andy.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.200
 Looks like tripe.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.000
 Looks like tripe.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.480
 Thank you.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.040
 Two out of three.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:57.760
 Also was gathered by George Washington's troops, supposedly, and boiled into soup

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.040
 at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.560
 So that's, they ate it.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.800
 Like tripe, but also it looks a bit like tripe.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.720
 That's a pretty bad winter as well, when you're having to persuade yourself that what you're

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.360
 eating is tripe.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.600
 That's even worse than tripe.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:16.080
 There is a lycan called rock gnome lycan as well.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.760
 And this is endangered, and no one's allowed to know where it is.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.120
 Because the US Fish and Wildlife Service said they had an option to label its location as

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.240
 critical habitat.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.400
 This is just, it's only found in like Georgia and the Carolinas and Tennessee in the mountains.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.560
 And if you label something as critical habitat, that means people know where it is.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.160
 You publish it, and then you get these lycan collectors who are over enthusiastic who go

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.040
 and nick it.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.880
 So they kept it super secret.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:46.000
 And sweetly, the person who was in charge of guarding its location was a National Park

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.600
 Service botanist called Janet Rock.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.360
 That's cool.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.760
 And where is it in Georgia and the Carolinas?

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.280
 I'm not giving you any further details, James.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.760
 I'm just thinking I could do with an OBE quite soon.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:05.760
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.520
 And that is Andy.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.520
 My fact is that eBay employs staff whose job includes sniffing trainers.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.640
 Wow.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.280
 Yeah.

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.840
 They're the shoe perverts of eBay.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.040
 And they are...

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.240
 For legal reasons, not.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.520
 No, yeah, they're absolutely not perverts.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.640
 This is part of their job.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.160
 I don't want to need to make it any clearer.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.760
 These people are not perverts.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.520
 They're not getting a kick out of it.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.720
 Also got a sick thrill.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:35.360
 This is because eBay sells a lot of shoes, which I didn't know because I'm not a sneak

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.480
 ahead is what they get called.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.840
 People who collect and trade and buy and sell and sometimes make a living selling shoes to

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.200
 each other and collecting them.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.280
 Sounds like they're just people who wear them on the wrong bit of their body.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.320
 Could be the same.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:57.040
 And so there are so many fake shoes on the market now, which are obviously not worth

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.560
 nearly as much as the real deal.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.560
 You mean fake brands, the shoes, you could get your shoe onto your foot, right?

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.760
 It's not like you put your foot in it.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.280
 You're like, "Oh, that's an algae."

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.560
 It's not made of plamage and it turns out every damn time.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.400
 No, they're real shoes, but they're not really made by Nike or whoever.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:18.400
 So eBay has got experts in trainer provenance whose job is to put shoes through their paces.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.280
 Nice.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.000
 Thank you.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.120
 To assess whether they're real or fake and any shoes that are worth over 150 quid that

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.600
 are bought on eBay because they have to have some kind of lower floor in it.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.880
 They can't check all of them.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.360
 Any shoes worth over 150 quid go through this center, sneak authentication center,

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.480
 and the seller doesn't get the money until the shoes have been authenticated and then

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.080
 they get forwarded to the buyers.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.320
 And the smelling is part of that because there are so many different ways you can tell

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.760
 whether a trainer is authentic or not.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.400
 There's the stitching, there's the glue and the glue has a smell and all these other methods.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.320
 It's something like 52 elements.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.960
 They've identified the process to it.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.640
 Yeah, so it's, as you say, it's the glue.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.680
 It's the quality of ink on the inside of the tongue.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.280
 There's the variations of color.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.840
 There's the smell check as well.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.120
 Well, eBay are going on the road with this.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.760
 It's very exciting.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.640
 They're doing nationwide.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.000
 What do you mean, like touring?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:06.960
 I wouldn't watch that show.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.720
 Come to our show.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:08.960
 Come to our show instead.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.200
 Come to our show instead.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:09.600
 Come to our show instead.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.280
 It's basically that.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.920
 Okay.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.480
 Well, I mean, basically they have an ice cream van.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.800
 I've slightly hyped up the nationwide tour element of it.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.800
 But the ice cream van is touring the country.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.600
 And if you bring your sneakers along worth over a hundred quid,

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.360
 then they will authenticate them or not.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.560
 They will bust this shit wide open on your foot.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.360
 Will they fill one of my sneakers up with Mr. Whippy and put a flake in it?

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.040
 No, they won't.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.040
 They're only doing a few dates as well on this tour,

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.440
 I think because ice cream vans can't go on the motorway.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.600
 And I presume they're going to have to take b-roads all the way around.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:45.440
 There was an amazing article on thisismoney.co.uk written by Grace Godson.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.880
 And she actually smelled the shoes

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.920
 and said that she could definitely tell the difference, the journalist.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.200
 Yeah, she said that the ones that are fake

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.600
 just kind of smell really chemically, a bit like nail varnish,

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.040
 but the real ones smell more like tennis balls, according to her.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.680
 And but she also said that if you want to work in these warehouses,

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.080
 then you have to pass an entrance test,

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.520
 which involves a blind test,

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.880
 whether can you tell a sneaker is real or fake just by smelling it?

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.360
 So you have to pass that test to get the job.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.560
 Wow, so weird.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.360
 Imagine them.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.880
 I think so they are blindfolded.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.280
 Yeah, it's pretty weird, isn't it?

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:23.760
 That's cool.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.120
 It is cool. It's amazing.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.480
 It must be so hard though,

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.600
 because a lot of these sneakers, most of them are manufactured in China,

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.800
 in Chinese factories.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.600
 And the real ones?

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.200
 The real ones, but also the fake ones.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.200
 And the fake ones in the article I read say

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.320
 that they're often attached literally to the real factory.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:43.120
 So you've got the sort of fake factory that's using 90% of the materials anyway.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.160
 So 90% of it is as close to the thing that you would have.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.080
 It's just the actual manufacturing and stitching together process.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.280
 That's so mad.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.760
 They're also employing trainers to test watches within the next couple of months.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.720
 Human trainers.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.280
 Human trainers.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.720
 Human trainers.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.680
 Humans sniff the trainers.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.960
 The trainers test the watches.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.320
 That's the centre.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.560
 I watched the trainers watching.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.080
 I think the watches were first, actually.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.080
 Oh, were they?

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.360
 Oh, I think maybe they're upgrading.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.720
 I read that they were looking for a new tranche of watch trainers

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.560
 in August this year.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.640
 I didn't realise that eBay gets almost all of its profits now from three items.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.760
 What are the three?

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.480
 Trainers, luxury watches, trading cards.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.760
 Oh, really?

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.320
 Apparently.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:30.880
 The third category that has authentication from June 2021 is handbags.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.160
 Is it?

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.160
 Maybe they're trying to branch out into a fourth direction.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.200
 Wow.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.880
 As in you can get everything else on eBay,

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.880
 it's just that their shares are mostly going down.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.280
 People aren't buying other stuff on them anymore.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:41.920
 Interesting.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.040
 But those three things.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.280
 And the thing is with the authentication is

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.640
 you as a buyer don't pay for it

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.240
 and the seller doesn't pay for it either.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.520
 eBay pays for it.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.200
 And you think, well, what's the point of that?

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.640
 But actually, the sales of luxury items like watches and sneakers

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.800
 and probably soon handbags has gone up massively

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.440
 since people have known that they're going to get the real deal.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.640
 Has it?

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.280
 Interesting.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.320
 The growth in sneakers has gone up by triple digits year on year

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.440
 for the last couple of years.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.320
 Yeah, apparently they sell a pair every nine seconds.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.000
 When companies make trainers and sneakers,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.480
 especially in the last 10, 15 years,

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.680
 they often make them mostly in sizes eight, nine, and 10

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.400
 because they're the most popular sizes for men.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.200
 And men are the people who bought most of these trainers.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.760
 But these days, more women are wanting these trainers.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.880
 And so the smaller sizes are rarer.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.240
 And so if you're a counterfeiter,

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.880
 you're more likely to go for the smaller sizes

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.920
 because actually, you know, there's less on the market for them.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.280
 So you're more likely to find that women's trainers

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.200
 are fake than the men's trainers.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.080
 But does it matter to sneakerheads?

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.280
 A lot of these shoes are never worn.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.640
 That's the thing I find so weird and bizarre.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.040
 But you still buy them in your size, usually.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.760
 When you say never worn, are there really many people

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.840
 who are buying loads of sneakers that they don't intend to wear?

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.200
 Collectors have hundreds of pairs.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:57.840
 It's mad.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.080
 And a lot of them, they can't afford to wear themselves

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.480
 because they don't want to wear out a $10,000 pair of sneakers.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.920
 They keep them because they have that value.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.600
 If they wore them, they'd become really grubby

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.640
 and they'd lose their value.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.880
 But there can't be that many people that do that.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.440
 There are.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.160
 That's what's funding eBay and it's top three most important things.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.320
 It's a billion dollar industry.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.480
 In the future, Dan, in 200 years, people will say,

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.800
 "Did you know people used to wear these decorations on their feet?"

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.600
 But yeah, that is true.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:21.920
 Yeah.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.800
 And the other advantage of doing the women's shoes, for instance,

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.840
 is because you need less materials to make them, of course.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.280
 So the markup is bigger.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.840
 I always buy shoes three sizes too big

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.240
 so I can circumvent the possibility that they're fake.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.520
 They do get, there are sometimes seizures of counterfeit sneakers

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.600
 at customs and ports and things like that.

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:46.000
 So in 2019, there was a Chinese guy called Qing Fuzeng

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.480
 who was arrested for allegedly importing 22 shipping containers

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.800
 of fake trainers into the USA disguised as napkins,

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.880
 not disguised, labeled as napkins,

00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.000
 which would have been worth $472 million.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.760
 It's just an insane amount of money that you can make

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.400
 and he had this complicated system set up to get them in

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.840
 and then get them distributed.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.080
 That's why they make you take your shoes off as security, right?

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:10.800
 To test they're real.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.960
 You just look back, the security people are huffing away at them,

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.320
 giving you a good sniff.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.120
 Anna was talking about buying shoes that were too big

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.600
 and then putting loads of socks in there so that they fit.

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.720
 I didn't, I haven't actually come up with that workaround.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.760
 I just buy shoes that are too big.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.680
 But thank God you solved that blister problem.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.760
 Well, the reason that I made that solution in my head

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.080
 is because I was reading about a guy called Jim Thorpe

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.080
 who was the first Native American

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.920
 to win a gold medal at the Olympics.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.080
 And he was in the Decathlon.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.280
 So after the first day, he was miles ahead,

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.040
 but then someone stole his shoes.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.320
 So he didn't know what to do for the second day

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.240
 because there were his only pair of shoes.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.960
 So he looked around and he found like in the garbage,

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.480
 like a couple of odd shoes and he wore them,

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.000
 but one of them was massively too big.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.680
 So he had to wear loads of pairs of socks.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.840
 And that fut.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.120
 So there are pictures of him in odd shoes

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.120
 with one foot with loads of socks on.

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.560
 And in the second day, he won pretty much all the events

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.760
 and won the gold in the Decathlon in the 1912 Olympics.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.760
 And on the same day, he also won,

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.880
 I think it was the long jump or the high jump

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.640
 and the 110 meters hurdles

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.280
 and the 1500 meters wearing odd shoes.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.560
 Wow, very cool.

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.240
 Well, why doesn't everyone do that now?

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.280
 It's clearly an advantage.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.320
 Must be, right?

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.760
 But also it sounds like he could have tried

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.520
 a bit harder just to get a pair of shoes, right?

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:36.320
 Like if the Jamaicans were able to borrow a bobsled, surely.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.640
 Guys, I only found out recently that shoes,

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.400
 you used to be able to inflate them yourself.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.520
 Sorry.

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.440
 Because now I have to go to a shop to inflate them.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.200
 What are you talking about?

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.480
 All your shoes, blow up shoes.

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.960
 Okay, I'm glad you don't remember this, James,

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.000
 because this was during the sneaker wars of the 1990s.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:52.720
 You all remember.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.800
 The Nike versus Reebok.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.960
 And this, yeah, yeah.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.840
 And the pumps, yeah.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.960
 The pumps, yeah.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.080
 No, sorry, not with you on this.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.720
 Wasn't there Jordans?

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.560
 But they had the air pump as well, didn't they?

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:02.960
 Did there Jordans have a pump?

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.920
 Yeah, there Jordans had pumps.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.000
 Look, I was not allowed to wear any cool shoes during the 1990s.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.240
 Okay.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.440
 Can someone explain this to me please?

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.720
 So they used to be on the tongue.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.480
 So, actually the pair of brogues, right?

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:10.960
 Thank you.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:16.000
 You inflated them from the tongue,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.160
 and this was an innovation by Reebok.

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:18.960
 Their tongue.

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.200
 Their...

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:24.240
 Have you seen the movie Men in Tights?

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.120
 Robin Hood, Men in Tights.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:25.440
 I have not.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.200
 I wasn't allowed to watch that.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.400
 Okay.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.600
 But this apparently clinched it for Reebok for a while.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.800
 Nike's always been the big guy.

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.560
 Reebok's always been the underdog.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.200
 And they had these self-inflate shoes.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.240
 So they...

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.920
 No one bought them because they thought that's really weird.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.480
 And then there was just one slam dunk championship.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.760
 Basketball seems to be more about the shoes

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.960
 than it is about the basketball.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.440
 You rarely get a team in barefoot winning the NBA.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.520
 Not since the 1912 Olympics.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:53.360
 So this guy, D. Brown, did this move

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.800
 before he did his amazing slam dunk

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.000
 and won the competition,

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.360
 where he just bent down

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.680
 and he pumped up his shoes with the tongue.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.120
 And then he slam dunked it.

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.520
 And then after that, the crowd went insane.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.560
 And then it became his thing.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.000
 Every time he went to take a shot,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.960
 he would pump up his shoes

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.240
 and then deflate them afterwards.

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.680
 No, not in a match.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.280
 He wouldn't dribble the ball.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.080
 Not mid-match.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.520
 Bend down, pump, yeah.

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.960
 When you're doing a dunk from a standing position.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.160
 You know the lingo, Dan.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.120
 You know what I'm trying to say.

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.280
 Well, and I don't know what we should just say for Andy.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.200
 I don't know the pump actually did anything.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.360
 As in your shoe functioned,

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.960
 it wasn't like a deflated shoe

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.160
 that you pumped air into.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.520
 It just was this sort of...

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.880
 But this basketballer who pumped the tongue

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.400
 did that, that did have an effect, did it?

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.920
 I mean, I don't know.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.360
 They always refused to say.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.760
 It suggested it had ankle support.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.560
 And they were always asked,

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.240
 "Does it give you a bit more bounce to make it pumpy?"

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:40.800
 And they always said,

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.120
 "We're refusing to say if I gave you a bit more bounce."

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.400
 Well, I never noticed it.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.120
 You didn't know.

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.320
 And you were pumped for ages.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.080
 It was just a cool thing to do.

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.760
 It wasn't like having a pogo stick suddenly attached.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.480
 No, exactly.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.600
 Yeah, they weren't moonshoes.

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.680
 There was a story this year

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.800
 about a lady who has made 2,500 pounds

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.840
 by selling old crisp packets from the 1980s.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.520
 But they had released figures

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.800
 on how many of these ostensibly not very glamorous items

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.840
 have been sold over a three-month period this year.

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.520
 350 crisp packets, 206 wine corks,

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.880
 225 empty jam jars, 37 toilet roll tubes.

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.880
 But it's hard to make a million from them

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.280
 because they, on average, go for two P each.

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.800
 That's a cheap telescope, though,

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.920
 if you want to make a...

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.120
 That's true.

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.080
 That's true.

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.760
 I think people must be buying crisp packets

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.480
 to do the blow it up and bang it thing,

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.600
 which I love doing.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.720
 But I don't eat enough crisps

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.320
 to do that as often as I'd want to.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.520
 I just thought it was set dressing

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.440
 for a TV show in the 1980s.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.040
 It's weird where our brains go

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.400
 because I was thinking you would buy it

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.480
 and hopefully there's a few little crumbs of crisps

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.280
 left in the car.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.600
 And you can lick your finger and get them out.

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.040
 We've all got good reasons.

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.160
 But, I mean, that's true.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.000
 You won't be able to taste the '80s again, will you?

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:48.960
 No.

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.240
 That's slogan for your firm.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.680
 A trade on these things.

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.720
 Taste the '80s.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.680
 Yeah, great.

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.280
 You can taste the 2010s

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.400
 by buying the pre-sugar tax drinks

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.440
 that are available on eBay.

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.840
 I genuinely thought about buying

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:02.960
 one of these for my brother,

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.560
 who I've never seen him so furious

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.720
 as when LucasAid halved the sugar content

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.360
 in their drinks.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.480
 It hasn't been the same.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.520
 It doesn't taste the same.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.880
 So, in 2018, the sugar in iron brew halved.

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.040
 There was lots of rules over the last few years

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.560
 saying, you know, you've got to reduce your sugar.

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.760
 And you can buy a LucasAid pre-2011

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.120
 for £145.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.920
 OK.

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.120
 I might just suck it out of order.

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.160
 That's quite a lot, isn't it?

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:27.280
 But imagine how good that's going to taste

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.560
 now after all these years.

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.000
 I'm with your brother, actually.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.160
 I think modern pop is disgusting.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:32.480
 Really?

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.280
 Can you taste the difference?

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:33.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.080
 Really?

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:34.480
 I don't think so.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.120
 I don't think so, really.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.520
 But ironically, you listen to a lot of modern pop,

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.800
 which I find disgusting.

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:46.400
 OK, that's it.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.520
 That is all of our facts.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.880
