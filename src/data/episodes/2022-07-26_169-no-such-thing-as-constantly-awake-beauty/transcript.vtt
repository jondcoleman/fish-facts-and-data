00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.080
 (Theme music playing)

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.960
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.000
 Comey to you this week from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 My name is Anna Toshinsky.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Alex Bell and James Harkin and once again

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.760
 we've gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.360
 days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.560
 Starting with Alex.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.760
 My fact this week is that baby elephants suck their trunks for comfort.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 Oh.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 It's very sweet.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 Is that the response you're going through?

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 Yeah, that's what I've got.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.200
 In fact adults do all sorts of things with their trunks as well when they're nervous

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.720
 or they don't know what they're doing.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.560
 They will pick their ears or kind of wipe their eyes and you know they do it like humans

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.560
 do with hands.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.560
 So it's just a social thing that they don't know what to do with their trunks.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.000
 Yeah, well actually when baby elephants are born they can't really control their trunks

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.760
 the first few days so they just wave around a bit wildly and also it's really sad.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.560
 They kind of tread on it and then they kind of scream because it really hurts.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.360
 They can't work out where the pain's coming from or how to make it stop.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.160
 Yeah, trunks are amazing.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.400
 Did you know that elephants can be left or right trunked even though they've only got one?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 What does that mean?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.000
 They will have a preference of picking up objects to their left or right from a really early age.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.400
 But surely if there is food on the left and they're right trunks they won't starve to death.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 That's true, I don't even know what that means.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 No, but they move over.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 Like a tennis player who doesn't have a backhand.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 Exactly.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 What they'll do is they will turn 340 degrees.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 And pick it up with their tail.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400
 Oh right, no.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400
 That would be 180.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 That would be another side of it.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400
 Like a FedEx driver.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
 Yeah.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 Has the FedEx driver thing been in the podcast before?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 Is that just going to sound like nonsense to anyone?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 Yeah, you should explain that.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 I'll explain it quickly that in America FedEx drivers aren't supposed to turn left.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 Instead they just do three right turns to get in the right direction.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.400
 And it works because America's on a grid system.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400
 That's what it saves petrol.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 It saves petrol.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 Yeah.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
 Because otherwise you're kind of sat there waiting for the traffic to go and go and go.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
 So if there's a clear road, right?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 Not allowed Andy.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 Not allowed.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 That's like saying, oh, the traffic light was red, but I didn't see anyone coming.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400
 So it went through it anyway.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 But the other thing is in America sometimes you're allowed to turn right on traffic lights.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.400
 Even if the traffic lights are red, you're allowed to turn because it's just the rules.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400
 Same in Australia.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.400
 It's very bewildering when you're a foreigner and you try to cross a road.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 Hang on.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 I don't see how turning right three times helps you if you're driving along the road.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
 And you need to turn left because there's a thing right there on the left.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.400
 So you're going north and then you turn right and now you're going east.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.400
 And then you turn right and now you're going south.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
 And now you turn right and now you're going west.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400
 And you need it to go west in the first place.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.400
 It does seem like it would be a massive detail, but they've done the stats.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.400
 I can't believe there are no circumstances.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 Do they disable the steering wheel so they can't turn left?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400
 So I think we're talking about elephants.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.400
 And adults do the trunk sucking sometimes as well.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 There's a behavioural ecologist who's called Joshua Plotnik who has been observing elephants.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.400
 And he says that when they get stressed out, then they put their trunks in each other's mouths.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 So there's comfort.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400
 Yeah.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400
 That sounds a bit kinky to me.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 It sounded a bit kinky.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.400
 It doesn't work as if it's for a human to put your thumb in someone else's mouth and say it's because I'm stressed.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.400
 But are we saying that your thumb is your equivalent to a trunk?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400
 It's not your nose in someone else's mouth.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400
 I would say it's more like that.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.400
 It's obviously the insertor who's doing the comforting, not the receiver.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.400
 So it's that you put your trunk in the mouth of an elephant who looks upset.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400
 Obviously.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400
 You've got a stupid error to make.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.400
 Well, when you start your thumb, you're not doing it to comfort the thumb.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400
 Are you?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400
 You're doing it to comfort the mouth.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 I don't know.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.400
 But that doesn't mean that whatever you put your thumb in will feel better about it.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 Yeah, it does.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400
 That's the rule in life.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 Go around inserting your thumbs into stuff and the world will be a happier place.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400
 Okay.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400
 So that's not the only thing elephants do with their trunks.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 They also use their trunks for mating.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.400
 The male will put his trunk to the tip of the female's private parts.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400
 And then he'll put it back in his mouth.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.400
 And he has a thing called a vomeronasal organ that he can smell, whether she's receptive

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.400
 and in the mood and on heat and so on.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 And giraffes do the same thing, I think.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 Lots of animals have that.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 They don't have trunks.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 They don't have trunks.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 So I think they giraffes, I think, you're an ateon each other.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 Oh, do they?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 Yeah.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 Yeah, they do, don't they?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 And then smell if they're on heat or whatever.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.400
 Yeah, which is amazing considering the neck thing.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.400
 Yeah.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 Because you're going to have to spray it quite high, aren't you?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400
 Yeah.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.400
 That's what I would have thought a good way for an elephant to tell if she's not up for it is by the fact that they will get kicked in the face

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 presumably when it sticks his trunk up at us.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 We've got two black eyes, but I'll give it a smell just in case.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.400
 Do you know elephants have a specific call to warn each other about bees?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 And they don't make this sound in any other scenario.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400
 This was a study that was done, I think it was last year.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.400
 And it's this certain rumbling sound they play, so if they're played audio of bees buzzing, they make this rumbling sound.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 And then if they're played audio of that specific rumbling sound, they also make the rumbling sound.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 Because they recognise that it's a sound that says bees.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.400
 Because bees are one of the few things that can actually hurt them.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 They fly up their trunks and sting them on the internet.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 It is a bit like us because we have a thing that we say whenever bees are around.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 Which is bees.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 So on the trunk, do you know what happened when Margaret Thatcher met an elephant?

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.400
 She and her husband Dennis went to the Sri Lankan president's garden party in Sri Lanka.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400
 And the Sri Lankan president's elephant was there.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.400
 And Dennis Thatcher didn't know much about elephant anatomy.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 And he was given some bananas to feed to that elephant.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 And instead of just offering them out to the elephant, he picked them up and he started shoving them up the elephant's trunk.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.400
 According to them, he kept through.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.400
 He got through nearly half a dozen and then it snorted yellow gunk over everybody present.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.400
 Thatcher started telling him off and he said, "I don't know."

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.400
 I think that's a fairly reasonable mistake to make.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 That's a pretty nice thing.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.400
 I've worked out that elephants don't eat elephants.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 But I think if you're not sure, just don't or ask.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.400
 To be fair, it sounds like it was six or one half or a dozen of the other on the blame game.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.400
 Because elephants are supposed to pick stuff up with their trunks like food and then inserting them out.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400
 You can blame the elephant.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.400
 I'm blaming the elephant.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400
 I'm reasonably polite, I think.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.400
 You're waiting until like six, but we were like, "No, this is not what it's supposed to be."

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 You're constantly taking Thatcher's side.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400
 It's another time.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.400
 It's a notorious thing.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.400
 But elephant's don't know that they can't eat and drink using their trunks either.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.400
 When their babies, they don't know how to suck water up with their trunks and hold it there and then put it in their mouth.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.400
 They have to be taught it and copy the other adults and their parents.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.400
 They're crap, aren't they, baby elephant?

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.400
 To begin with, they just just drink straight out of the pondoy, from their mouth.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.400
 They don't drink from their trunks, they drink straight from their mouths.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.400
 And then they eventually realise that they can suck it up with their trunks and it's a more dignified way of trunks.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.400
 It's sucking up through your nose and squirting it into your mouth.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.400
 I mean, if a human did that, they'd be kicked out of a restaurant.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.400
 But apparently it's dignified and elephant.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.400
 So the traditional Indian way of sobering up a drunk elephant was to feed it three pounds of melted butter.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400
 No.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.400
 It's just a fact.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400
 Three pounds.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400
 Three pounds of melted butter.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.400
 And feed it or shove it up the trunk.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.400
 That is such a coming home drunk, like meal to have.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.400
 There's nothing else.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.400
 It's medically in the fridge.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400
 We've just got three pounds of butter.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400
 Melt is immediately.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.400
 No, they used to, this isn't fun, but they used to make them drunk so they would fight each other.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.400
 They'd give them brown things so they'd fight each other in the old days.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.400
 And then to sell them up, they'd give them butter.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.400
 Oh, that is bad.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:54.400
 So they have, they're the only other animals other than humans that have anything that resembles a chin.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.400
 We should listen quite a chin, but they do have a bony protrusion underneath their bottom jaw.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.400
 Unlike a lot of conservatives.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:14.400
 All right, on to fact number two, and that is James.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.400
 My fact this week is that moviegoers blink in sync.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400
 Very good.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.400
 Is it true or is it just poetic?

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.400
 It's true because it rhymes.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.400
 Is that how it works?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:36.400
 It is true. This was a study done by the University of Tokyo and they gave a load of people movies to watch.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.400
 And also movies with no narrative like just an aquarium and also an audiobook.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.400
 And they showed that people watching the movie were blinking in sync about 30% of the time.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.400
 And the others just not in sync at all.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.400
 And the reason that they think it is is because when you're watching a film, you kind of keep your eyes open when it's really exciting.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.400
 But then when there's a kind of down bit, everyone kind of blinks at the same time.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.400
 Is that why if you're watching Die Hard, do you only blink twice throughout the whole film?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400
 I've never seen Die Hard, but is it really exciting?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400
 It's so exciting, is it?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400
 It's a constant thrill.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.400
 And this is basically what they thought was they worked out how often people spend blinking in a certain amount of time.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.400
 And if you're watching like a hundred minute film, then you're going to spend 10 or 15 minutes blinking.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.400
 And they're like, how can you still keep up with the story if you're not watching it?

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.400
 That's because you don't bunch up all your blinks in the one section.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.400
 You did that right at the beginning when they showed how the production credits is the blink loads then.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.400
 Well that's true, but then how do we know?

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
 That's the case until we do a study about it.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.400
 I know, but it just seemed like the most self-evident question to us in all of scientific history.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.400
 But if we're blinking in sync, then everyone is missing the same parts of the movie.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.400
 So there might be some really crucial bits in movies that everyone thinks is shit, but they're actually great movies.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.400
 It's just one nobody gets mull hole and drive.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.400
 Because he's lulled you into the blinking and then he really quickly throws in the crucial explanation as well.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.400
 It's a single one in sync, the whole bunch is written up there.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.400
 We do this though with other things, don't we?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.400
 So when you're reading, apparently humans tend to blink when you finish reading a sentence.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.400
 Or if you're listening to a speech, then we'll tend to blink when the person speaking finishes a sentence.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.400
 So we seem to blink at kind of rest moments.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.400
 And there's one thing that scientists have looked into is why do we blink so often?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.400
 Because we don't need to blink as much as we do for lubrication purposes.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.400
 Just quickly, does that explain why when I'm giving a speech?

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.400
 And I look at the audience after I've finished a sentence, they've all got their eyes shut.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400
 Yeah.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400
 Oh, good, okay.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400
 Only look when you finish sentences, aren't you?

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.400
 A baby's blink way less than adults do.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.400
 Yeah, this is insane.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.400
 Are we talking about baby humans now?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.400
 Because, well, the scientists think there's a several reasons. They think it's because A, they sleep more.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.400
 And eyes blink more when they're tired.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.400
 And what babies just aren't tired yet?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:57.400
 Well, they sleep more so they spend more time with their eyes closed and resting in a kind of eyes resting state.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.400
 I thought it was because babies were so tired.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.400
 That's what you always hear. Oh, he's just tired.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.400
 Well, it turns out he's not tired at all.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400
 He's not blinking. Is he?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.400
 Maybe he's just a arse.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.400
 And also because babies don't cry for, like, the first, like, few weeks of that, like, they don't produce tears.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.400
 They cry, they produce tears.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.400
 And that apparently changes the amount by which you need to blink to keep your eyes moist.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.400
 But the blinking thing is unbelievable, and it's a really massive difference.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.400
 So the average person blinks 15 to 20 times a minute.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.400
 And babies blink one or two times a minute.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.400
 So it's actually about 15 times more.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.400
 I don't believe I haven't noticed this, and I want everyone with a baby to verify this, please.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.400
 I almost texted my friend who's got a baby this morning being like, "Can you stir your child for a minute, please?"

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400
 Isn't that mad?

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.400
 That is mad.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400
 Once a minute.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.400
 If you had a load of babies in a movie theatre watching a movie, but they only blink twice a minute,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.400
 it must be weird because there'd be no blinking at all in the whole theatre.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.400
 And then suddenly they'll all just blink and then go back to normal again.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:03.400
 But it must be the case then that we need to ask babies what my hole in drivers are about.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.400
 The great tragedy is they can't tell us.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.400
 So on "winking" as opposed to blinking, if I can take the conversation in that direction,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.400
 there was a study in a journal called "Communication Research Reports", this is in 2009.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.400
 They surveyed people in a shopping mall and a campus.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.400
 And it was just to see is the intent of winking clear, basically.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.400
 And the experiment was as follows. Someone would approach pass by, ask for the time,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.400
 get them to tell them the time, then they'd thank them, then they'd wink, then they'd walk off.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.400
 And then immediately a researcher would pop up next to the pass by.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.400
 And if they'd worked creeped out enough already, and he started saying,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.400
 "Did you notice that wink? What did you think?"

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.400
 That was interesting because he rhymes.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.400
 And just to work out what the recipient of the wink had thought was the intent.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.400
 And this is the interesting thing. Most people thought it was saying, "Thank you, all being friendly, all being flirtatious."

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.400
 But that's already three separate things.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.400
 I can't think of any other reasons.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.400
 Well, other theories lowered down the list, including the possibility that the wink had an eye problem,

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.400
 was trying to seem cool, or was expressing some strange ulterior motive.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.400
 One person suggested, "They didn't really want to know the time."

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.400
 I love this only option for "was trying to be called not was being called."

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.400
 On "Winking" actually, I found, have you ever heard of 3D glasses?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.400
 Have you heard of 3D no glasses?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.400
 It's this really weird thing that I found online that's been developed by a Brazilian production company called Jonathan Post

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.400
 and two neurons attached to the side of your head on either side.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.400
 And they send little electronic signals that make one of the eyes blink.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.400
 And it makes the left eye wink, and then the right eye wink, and then the left eye wink,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.400
 and then the right eye wink, and it goes fast and fast and faster.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.400
 And so it's basically doing at like 25 times a second, and your eyes are set, you're essentially blinking, but out of sync.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.400
 So it's like left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.400
 And if you look at an object, and you close on it, and then you close the other one,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.400
 and you close on the image kind of move slightly, and that principle has been used,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.400
 so you can be able to watch 3D films without having to wear glasses.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.400
 And apparently it's really convincing 3D.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.400
 So, Andy, you and I have just been doing that while Alex has been talking.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.400
 And my eyes are quite sore, I think, as well.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400
 That's a lot of mine, yeah.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.400
 So I don't think this is going to be...

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.400
 I don't think so, there's no way this could be good for you.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400
 I'm just doing it with her fingers.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.400
 Yeah, the reason I'm doing that, James, is because I'm a natural scientist, and I know the reason your eyes are sore,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.400
 is that you're using your muscles, which presumably this doesn't.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.400
 So I'm just dragging her eyelids up and down manually, incredibly slowly.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.400
 Her eye muscles are fine, but her fingers are really soft.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.400
 Do you know, when you wink, you do it left-eyed or right, most people wink with a dominant eye.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.400
 Yeah, for me, it's left.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.400
 I didn't know that, me too.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400
 You didn't know that.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.400
 Well, my left eye naturally closes when I get drunk or when I'm tired.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.400
 And your persona is your right eye, as well.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.400
 We spend five years of our lives with our eye shut from blinking.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.400
 That's not including the time you spend sleeping.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.400
 That's assuming, like, what, a 70-year life span?

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.400
 Yeah, if you spend a third of your life asleep, and you live for 75 years, then that's 25 years of sleep.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.400
 A 50 years blink.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.400
 50 years of wake, and 10% of that, you're blinking.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.400
 Yeah.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.400
 So you spend a third of your life asleep.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.400
 Which third would it be if you had to choose one third?

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.400
 I mean, it's got to be the last third, right?

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.400
 Yeah.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.400
 But when you're retired, and you can play golf every day?

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.400
 Especially if I have to play golf every day.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.400
 Surely it'll be at your work time.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.400
 Or the middle third, when you're meant to be building up capital, hopefully.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.400
 Getting on the property ladder.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.400
 Who says he's asleep?

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400
 Hopefully.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.400
 You go straight from poor as the young person.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400
 Poor as an old person.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.400
 We'll be a very good way of having a very long marriage, if you've got married immediately before you fell asleep.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.400
 It's the opposite of sleeping beauty, isn't it?

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.400
 It comes to near wake beauty.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 Until the prince came along and then she fell asleep.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.400
 OK, anyone got anything else?

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.400
 Cinema advertising is less effective when audiences eat popcorn.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400
 Really?

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.400
 It's got into a study from Cologne University.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.400
 And the reason is quite fun.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:14.400
 It's because according to them, researchers remember new brands by simulating the pronunciation of a new name with their mouths.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:22.400
 So when you see an advert for, like, "Daz," and you've never heard of "Daz," you kind of just mouth the word "Daz."

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.400
 And that's how you remember it.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.400
 And if you're eating popcorn, you can't do that.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.400
 So if you go into a cinema and you face the audience, they're all blinking in synchrony

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.400
 and repeating the words on the adverts.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.400
 We must look like bunch of robots.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.400
 Do we mouth words in the films?

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.400
 Do you mouth important lines of dialogue?

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.400
 I'm not aware that I do it, but then I've never watched myself at the cinema.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.400
 But as you don't know it in advance, usually you know what product is.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.400
 When you've watched it, I've got the chance to know it in a new product, I think.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.400
 Yeah, the idea is you do it just afterwards.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400
 Oh, I see.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.400
 It's not like people have memorized adverts.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.400
 Like, always, but it's the "Daz" again. Everyone get ready to chant a lot.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.400
 Did you read about that guy this week who sued his date because she was texting in the cinema?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400
 Quite right, too.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.400
 He's a bit of a hero.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.400
 He's this guy called Brandon Fesmar, and he was going on a date with someone called Crystal.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.400
 They went to see the 3D version of Guardians of the Galaxy, the New Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.400
 Which is an extremely bad sign.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.400
 She apparently texted 10 to 20 times in the first 15 minutes of the film.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.400
 After when she leaned on him, said, "Would you mind not doing that?"

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.400
 And she refused.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.400
 So he said, "I'm really sorry.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.400
 Would you mind going outside, you're distracting me."

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.400
 At which point she walked out and drove home, and her car was his left home,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.400
 so abandoning him at the cinema.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.400
 And so he sent her a text, and he pay me back, please.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.400
 And she said, "No, so he took it to the small claims court."

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.400
 Do we have a result?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400
 Yeah, do we have a result?

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.400
 Or is it still making its way through the court?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.400
 No, it's supreme.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.400
 I think he's going to withdraw his claim because some newspaper set up a meeting

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.400
 between them where she begrudgingly gave him the cinema money.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.400
 But I noticed not the pizza money.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.400
 He'd also asked for $4 for a pizza, which she didn't return.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.400
 I think if they'd already enjoyed the pizza.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400
 That's fair enough.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400
 That's the deal.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.400
 But I also think he's taken her to a shit movie.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.400
 And she's having to sit there texting.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.400
 So he should pay for the price of the text.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.400
 I mean, I don't want to get old Judd Studio.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.400
 I think Judd James.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.400
 They've already generated enough press that no one is going to go out with either of them from now on.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.400
 But the job's been done.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.400
 Yeah, because people, you've heard about people sort of,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.400
 they're googled each other before going on dates now, before we do this.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.400
 People apparently do this because, thank God, I'm married.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.400
 He's actually had lots of propositions.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400
 It's been extremely good.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.400
 He's just lovely.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400
 Lots of girls have gone and touched.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400
 I totally agree with you.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400
 Will you go out with me instead?

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.400
 I promise I won't text at all.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.400
 He doesn't come out of it that well because of the small claims caught part of it.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.400
 Yeah, that's really good.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.400
 Maybe you could take me to the small claims caught part of it.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.400
 Where are we going on our first date?

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.400
 Have you ever heard of the small claims caught?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.400
 Okay.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.400
 The first 10 minutes of the Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty much the only watchable 10 minutes in the whole film.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.400
 It's quite a good song and it's a bit...

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400
 Yeah.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.400
 I can't believe it was such a good moment to end that section.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.400
 I can't believe you thought we just needed to have a quick review of the Guardians of the Galaxy before we did.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.400
 Any bits you'd recommend blinking in?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.400
 The rest of the film.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:19.400
 You can... you can...

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:26.400
 It's such a damning review to save up your blink.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.400
 Okay, let's move on to fact number three.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.400
 And that is Andy's fact.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:38.400
 My fact is that if you buy an apple today, it might have been taken off the tree in May 2014.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400
 Really?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400
 Yeah.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400
 That is incredible.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.400
 These are really brown and moldy ones at the back.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.400
 They're like some sort of spife in a good reason.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.400
 It's an organic one.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.400
 No, they're not.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.400
 These are perfectly good looking, healthy looking apples.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.400
 So this is from a book called The Apple Orchard by a food writer called Pete Brown.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.400
 It's all about the history of apples.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400
 It sounds...

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.400
 It used to be Pete Green.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400
 Oh, very nice.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.400
 I think he's always been called Pete Brown.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.400
 So the book is called The Apple Orchard.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.400
 And basically apples get picked in about May.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.400
 But then to ensure you have apples all year round, you need to keep them in a warehouse.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.400
 And so the average time that they stay there is six months to a year.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.400
 And they're kept in warehouses, which have had all the oxygen sucked out of them.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400
 Wow.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.400
 And they've just got nitrogen in them, like bags of crisps.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.400
 And library books.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.400
 And library books, as we've covered before, on this podcast.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400
 Yeah.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400
 And so I think it's amazing.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.400
 And they basically, they go into kind of hibernation.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.400
 They kind of breathe more slowly these apples.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.400
 But if you were in there with them, you'd be surrounded by healthy apples.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.400
 But you would suffocate.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.400
 It works out that iPhones and IMAX go through about three model changes a year.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.400
 And they will supersede each other.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.400
 So actually, if you walk into the Apple store, your Apple products and the Apple store

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.400
 are going to be fresher than the apples you've brought in.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.400
 It's very strong.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400
 Yeah, that's really funny.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400
 Pete Brown.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400
 Do you know the fact about Pete Brown?

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400
 Yeah.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400
 He is...

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.400
 I was Britain's leading apple researcher, Pete Brown.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.400
 He's got really into apples.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.400
 He used to be a beer insider writer.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.400
 And then you realise the thing you really love was apples.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.400
 And he discovered during the course of his research that he has a severe allergy to them.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.400
 So he's allergic to the one thing he loves.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400
 That's so sad.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.400
 He sounds during the course sounds like he went a couple of years without even touching them.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.400
 He wasn't really researching them properly.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400
 Right.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.400
 How'd he never had an apple before?

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.400
 This does confuse me because it's quite a severe reaction.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.400
 His whole throat expands and mouth blows up.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400
 So I don't maybe never try to...

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.400
 His mouth blows up.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.400
 Explosive on his face.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.400
 Yeah, well, I mean.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.400
 But yeah, poor guy.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400
 Yeah.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.400
 That's terrible.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400
 Is that why he's so obsessed with them?

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.400
 Because it's the one thing you can never have.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400
 Yes, that's true.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.400
 So in the 19th century, we had tens of thousands of apple varieties.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.400
 And they used to be all shapes and sizes.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.400
 So they'd be lumpy and some had really rough sand, papyrus skin.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.400
 And others would be really misshapen and look like potatoes.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.400
 And they'd range from cherry size to grapefruit size.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.400
 A grapefruit size apple.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400
 You get grapefruit size apples.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.400
 Except there would be apple size apples.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400
 Yes.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.400
 There was no apple size back then.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.400
 But then when we got into like larger scale farming and we realized it was cheaper to just take

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.400
 graftings of apples spread the same apple or the clones.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.400
 Then we massively reduced the number of apples we have.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.400
 And now I think in America, they used to be 17,000.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.400
 Some are between 14,000 and 17,000 varieties.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.400
 And now it has 90.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400
 Whoa.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.400
 So we've lost a lot of apples.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.400
 That is amazing.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400
 Yeah.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.400
 So yeah, every single granny smith come...

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.400
 Is genetically identical to one that was in a house in Sydney centuries ago.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.400
 Every single bramley apple grew from a tree in a garden in Nottinghamshire.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:39.400
 The Bramley apple tree has one fan club and its fan club is based in Japan.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.400
 And it's the one Bramley apple fan club in the world.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.400
 It's in O-Buse in Japan.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.400
 And because they imported Bramley apples, a Bramley apple graft 30 years ago.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.400
 And they just fell in love with it there.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:58.400
 And the mayor of the town and a bunch all the members of the Apple fan club flew all the way to Nottingham from Japan in 2012 to visit the tree.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.400
 And one said he nearly cried when he set eyes on it.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.400
 Nearly, nearly cried.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.400
 The sad thing about that fan club is they're all allergic to apples.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.400
 Actually, in that part of the world, I've just given it a way now.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.400
 But where the most of the world's apples get produced.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.400
 Is it somewhere near Japan?

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.400
 It's somewhere near East Japan, yeah.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.400
 Yeah, is it Japan?

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400
 No.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400
 Oh, China.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.400
 It's China.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.400
 By an insanely large amount, about 40 million tonnes a year have produced that.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.400
 And the next one is the US, which is 4 million.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.400
 Do you know what is the biggest brand of beer in the world?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.400
 Budweiser.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400
 No.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.400
 Is it that Australian one that everyone drinks?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400
 Foster's?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400
 No one drinks?

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400
 No, no one drinks.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.400
 That's what I mean.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.400
 No, it is snow lager.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.400
 And it's the main lager in China.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.400
 And it's completely unknown almost in the rest of the world.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.400
 But because China's so big, it means that they have something like four percent of all beers from snow.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.400
 Do you know some apples are non-vegan.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.400
 This is true.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.400
 Is it because they have a worm inside them?

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.400
 No, nice try, nice guess.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.400
 It must be some kind of thing they spray on it.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.400
 So a lot of apples, they have a natural wax on them, right?

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400
 Mm-hmm.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.400
 Which it preserves all the water inside the apple.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.400
 But when they're picked, then they get washed to get rid of all the dirt and that water's off the wax too.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.400
 So supermarkets spray them with wax.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400
 And it's not an unhealthy amount.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.400
 It's about two drops per apple that you eat.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400
 Like a really shiny apple.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.400
 But some of it is Brazilian palm leaves, the wax I mean.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.400
 Some of the wax is beeswax.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.400
 And some of it is shellac, which is derived from the secretions of an insect, a lac bug.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.400
 Do you know robots can count apples, but only at night?

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.400
 Shut up.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.400
 Yes, I'll live here, Dan, you're on holiday.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:45.400
 So this is the idea that if you are an orchard owner, you want to know how many apples are on your tree.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400
 Sure.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.400
 And humans can do it, but robots are cheaper.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:57.400
 But the problem is, how does a robot know what an apple is compared to a leaf or compared to whatever is really hard, especially in daytime?

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.400
 So what you can do.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.400
 What you can do is at night time, you can get a tree and you can have a robot looking at it.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.400
 And then you put a light on it and the light will reflect off the fruit and the leaves.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:17.400
 But the reflections from the fruit will be round and it can tell those round shapes better than in the daytime when actually all the branches and leaves all get in the way.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:26.400
 That sounds so terrifying to get stuck in an orchard at night when all the robots come out.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:34.400
 Actually, on robots, I did a bit of reading about warehouses for this fact, and Amazon warehouses and other distribution warehouses for huge shipping companies.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:41.400
 There used to be that you'd have, you know, rows and rows of shelves and then some people would be employed to pack and some people would be employed to go up and down the shelves, you know, moving stuff around.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:48.400
 Now, what happens is all the humans that work in there, they work around the edges at these packing stations and there's no one in the middle.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.400
 There's just loads and loads of tall narrow shelves and all those shelves can drive around by themselves.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.400
 So everyone stays around the edge and they either load the shelves or they just stand there and they wait for the shelves to come to them and they just take off what's needed.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.400
 Is it like the staircases at Hogwarts?

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.400
 It's like that on an amazing scale, so amazing videos to watch for this.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:12.400
 And what the best, this isn't even the best bit because so obviously you've got hundreds and hundreds of shelves moving around and there's no order to what needs to be on the shelves.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:19.400
 You can just put anything on the shelves in any order and any combination and as long as the computer knows what's on each shelf, it doesn't really matter where it's being stored because it could just drive anywhere it's needed.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:27.400
 When you close the warehouse at night, all the shelves like rearrange themselves every night, based on what's going to be needed for the next day.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:37.400
 So for example, when it's coming up to Valentine's Day and you know people are buying more like chocolates and roses and stuff, then all of that stuff and take this to Guardians of the Galaxy 2.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:44.400
 All of those shelves move to the close to the front of the warehouse because they're going to be needed more often.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400
 Wow.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.400
 It's going to be so cool.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.400
 Well done, Amazon.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:27:04.400
 Well, I just think they're going to be a big thing. That's my holiday. If you plant, everyone will know this who has a very interesting or culture, but if you plant the seeds of a certain type of apple tree, like a brave and apple tree, then of course it doesn't grow into the brave and does it.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.400
 That's why people do grafting.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.400
 I just don't understand that. I think that's mad.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.400
 Yeah, it's, yeah.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400
 It is mad, isn't it?

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.400
 It is mad because, yeah, it is mad.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.400
 It is mad.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.400
 It's like saying, if you, if two people sleep together, they might have any animal.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.400
 It could be a cow. It could be an otter.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.400
 God, how fun would life be? It would be amazing.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.400
 No, I am not giving birth to a cow, thanks very much.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.400
 It's a cossection in Clinton. It's like, it's a boy, it's a cow, it's a rabbit.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:48.400
 Okay, let's move on to our final fact, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that the first Western eye witness account of India described it as having answered.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.400
 The size of foxes.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.400
 This is so cool.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:28:02.400
 Yeah, so this is a first-hand report by Megastonese, who was the third century BC Greek ambassador to the Royal Court in Northern India, in what is now Northern India.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.400
 And yet he described these answers at the size of foxes and they mined for gold.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:13.400
 And so they mined gold and then they used to leave piles of gold up on the top of the ground while they went down and mined for more.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:23.400
 And he said that humans from India would go and try and steal the gold from the ants, and if the ants caught them, the giant ants they'd be engaged in a combat to the death.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.400
 And he's known as an eyewitness.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.400
 He's not even reporting this first hand.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.400
 But the amazing thing is that they are real, right?

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.400
 They are just kind of real.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:45.400
 There are mammoths who live in this area, who dig burrows, and then when they dig burrows, little bits of dust come out, which does have sand in and apparently people do collect the bits of gold.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:52.400
 So the only problem with that is how at some point someone decided that a moment looks exactly like a giant ant.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:29:00.400
 Well, no, because in Persian, supposedly, I haven't taken the original, the word for mammoth is equivalent to mountain ant.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:09.400
 And I was just thinking when you said that, in English, murmur ecology is the study of ants, which isn't a million miles from mammoths.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.400
 No, that must be from the same origin.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.400
 Why might be?

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.400
 That is just incredible.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.400
 There are giant ants, the size of foxes, which dig up gold.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.400
 They're not ants.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.400
 It's a great factor.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.400
 They're a mountain ant.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:30.400
 Yeah, there are mammoths, plus brackets.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:36.400
 Herodotus wrote about these as well, and he said they were bigger than foxes, but smaller than dogs.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.400
 Yes.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.400
 Dogs are such different sizes.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.400
 When did we first get the like apples?

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.400
 When did we first get this tiny dog?

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.400
 I think it was quite late on.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.400
 I imagine they were more, they've gone the opposite way about that suddenly.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.400
 I'm trying to think dinosaurs.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.400
 I think the Aztecs had like two hours, didn't they?

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.400
 I think so.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.400
 Is that an Aztec word?

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.400
 It's a Mexican word.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.400
 Yeah, so maybe.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.400
 Just to be clear, yeah, Herodotus did mention them.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.400
 You're right.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.400
 And now there are going to be people thinking, but he was before magasthenes.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:09.400
 I know everyone's now thinking that Herodotus is a little malving.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.400
 Herodotus did say it, but he'd heard it from other people.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.400
 And magasthenes was the first western person to go to India.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.400
 But yes, it was his room.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.400
 They've been going for hundreds of years.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.400
 They were ants, the size of foxes in India.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.400
 If they were the size of foxes, I'd watch out they'd be able to lift a cow.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400
 That's cool.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.400
 I would be inclined to bring back fox hunting if they were constantly carrying off cows.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:33.400
 How many times larger would you say the smallest foxes than the biggest ant?

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.400
 So the biggest ant is like four centimeters?

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.400
 I think four inches.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.400
 That's quite a big ant.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.400
 Yeah, that is a big ant.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.400
 I think it's an order of several, I think it's several orders of magnitude bigger.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.400
 Do you?

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.400
 I think a smallest fox is several thousand times bigger than the biggest ant.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400
 I'm going twice as big.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.400
 No, it's one order of magnitude.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400
 It's ten times bigger.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.400
 Oh, so the size of foxes.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.400
 Yeah, Alex is right that the biggest ant is a bullet ant, which is about four centimeters.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.400
 And the smallest fox is about 41 centimeters, which is the THENIC fox.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400
 Oh my goodness.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.400
 Oh, sweet.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.400
 That's not actually as small as I would have thought.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.400
 No.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.400
 So I wonder if that ant would be able to carry that fox?

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400
 Easily.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:24.400
 But a baby THENIC fox, presumably, would have a hard time taking on an ant in a fight.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.400
 It's such an embarrassing way to go in the fox community.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.400
 Some plants employ ants to scare away giraffes.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.400
 So these are ants that live in the tropics.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.400
 And the Acacia plants attract ants to them.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.400
 So ants live on the Acacia plant and they drink their nectar and the plants provide shelter for them.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.400
 But the plants actually make a chemical, which causes the ants to go into what was described by,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.400
 I think, National Geographic has, a defensive frenzy, which, and they do this when it's wrong.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.400
 It's like me after I've man's plane something.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.400
 No, no, no, I didn't mean that.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.400
 I mean that.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400
 I've obviously, you know that.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.400
 Oh, god.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.400
 So yeah, these ants go into this frenzy.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.400
 And they go away the giraffes because they can sting them.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.400
 They've got quite bad bites.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.400
 So giraff comes to eat the plant and the plant releases these chemicals into the ants that live on it.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.400
 To say, get rid of that giraffe and the giraffe starts trying to eat it.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.400
 And then it gets all these things in its mouth and it goes away.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.400
 Weirdly, there's a fact about, I think, is ethylene, which is a chemical that plants release.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.400
 And it's related to the previous one about apples.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.400
 So when plants release ethylene, if they're being eaten by, let's say, an antelope,

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.400
 they release ethylene and all the nearby plants will immediately put up their defenses.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.400
 They'll put up their defenses and they'll release large quantities of a chemical, which makes them inedible.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.400
 In fact, poisonously inedible to the antelope or whatever's eating them.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.400
 So the antelope has to kind of sneak up and eat as much as it can at the first plant,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:56.400
 before all the nearby plants are completely radioactive and poisonous to it.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.400
 Is ethylene is the stuff which makes fruit go off, isn't it?

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.400
 It's like when you have bananas and apples in the same bit of your fridge.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.400
 But the reason it's doing that is to make itself attractive to you.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.400
 Is it? It's like an advertising sign for the fruit.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.400
 But if I get a rotten banana, I'm not attracted to that.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.400
 I know, but animals are less facile than you, James.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.400
 So basically, once it releases the ethylene, all the fruit gets softer and sweeter

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.400
 and it changes color, meaning that the animals know, "Ah, that's ready to eat and it'll be delicious and sugary."

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.400
 And so the fruit is basically saying, "In your fruit bowl, humans are coming.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.400
 Make yourself look good."

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.400
 Really?

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.400
 So you'll be eating.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.400
 It's like taking someone on a date to guard into the galaxy.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.400
 It's a complete misjudgment of what that human might want.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.400
 You've just got a little plum texting in the car.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.400
 We also are just being employing ants.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.400
 They're at farms in any of the employ ants to help them farm.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.400
 They use Coca-Cola and Pepsi water down as a pesticide.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.400
 They spray it on the crops, not because they contain any pesticide chemicals,

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.400
 but because they contain loads of sugar.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.400
 And the sugar attracts the ants.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.400
 And then the ants will enjoy the sugar, but they'll also eat all the larvae of the bugs.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400
 Oh, wow.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.400
 It's almost as effective as other pesticides, but way way cheaper.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.400
 Really?

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.400
 It's not the cheapest way of getting sugar on your land, then.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.400
 It's like the cheapest sugar you can get.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.400
 It's a pretty cheap and easy way to do it, because you then just dilute it so it already comes.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.400
 The liquid is very sugary.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.400
 Well, we're not far off.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.400
 Because I would have thought off-brand would be actually cheaper.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400
 I wouldn't go for Coca-Cola.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.400
 I'd go for roller-cola.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.400
 Yeah, that's true. Why give the Coke?

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.400
 They did a study recently into personalities.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.400
 They, the scientists.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.400
 And they all like...

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.400
 What they found, James, is there all a real range of characteristics?

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400
 Although, yeah.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.400
 Sorry, I was being a bit ant-racist.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.400
 You were.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.400
 You were.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.400
 So they found that some ants are really fussy about where they live.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.400
 And so they'll move into what could be a nest.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.400
 And then be really choosy about it and dislike it and abandon it.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.400
 And then some ants are just really chilled out and liberal and relaxed.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.400
 And they'll go into any old, you know, hellhole piece of shit.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.400
 And just agree to live there.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.400
 And it actually turns out this is what makes their colonies work.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.400
 Because when you're looking for the ideal home,

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.400
 you need that really fussy guy who, you know, selects it very carefully.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.400
 And then when actually you're just in a rush to find somewhere,

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.400
 then the other guy takes over and becomes the dominant ant.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.400
 And he helps them make a fast decision and move into the nearest available nest.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.400
 What you're describing is the odd couple, but without the odd colony.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400
 That's cool.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.400
 That's so cool.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.400
 So they move into different places, ants.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.400
 I didn't even know that.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400
 It seems like they do, yeah.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.400
 Do you think ant landlords sometimes get confused because they say,

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.400
 "Oh, you've got tenants."

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.400
 And they're like, "Oh, well, I was hoping to have more of that."

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.400
 And it's like, "No, no, I just mean you've got tenants."

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400
 No.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.400
 No, maybe, yeah.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.400
 Do they, ants pronounce tenants tenants?

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.400
 Is that the one difference between humans and ants?

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.400
 Is that they pronounce it with that emphasis on the second syllable?

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.400
 I'm just thinking for Alex's sitcom of the Antopcom.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.400
 It's like the one possible story.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.400
 I was thinking for like an ant version of Friends,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.400
 where you've got kind of the monocurface-devious one.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.400
 Yes.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.400
 Chilled out Phoebe.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.400
 Yeah.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.400
 Just quickly on flying ant day.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.400
 Yeah.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.400
 Which always moves around.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.400
 There is no day, obviously.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.400
 Like Easter.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.400
 You're just like Easter.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.400
 It happens in a quarter-century literature.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.400
 No, but I did not know this.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.400
 So the male will deposit his sperm in the female.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.400
 I did know that something like that was probably going on somewhere.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:32.400
 I didn't know that the female and the queen can keep male ant sperm for 20 years.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.400
 Wow.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.400
 Imagine that.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.400
 It's her vagina full of nitrogen.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:42.400
 I think that's a great basis for an ant romcom, right,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.400
 in which an ant finds out 20 years later.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.400
 It's pregnant.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.400
 You might have a kid.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.400
 Oh, no, the bloke ant finds out.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.400
 Oh, we just had one thing.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400
 It was on flying ant day.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.400
 Yeah.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.400
 Well, bad news.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.400
 You've got 250,000 children.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.400
 Can I pitch you my 10 ant's chilt for that one?

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.400
 You can pitch it.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400
 Yeah.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.400
 That's Bridget Jones' baby.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.400
 That's true.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.400
 Well, actually, this will never happen because as soon as the male has inserted his genitalia

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.400
 into the female and deposited his sperm, his genitalia explode inside her and he dies.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.400
 No, that is Bridget Jones' baby.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.400
 I must have blinked in that bit.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.400
 I've got one more thing, but it's just about this guy, Magastheni,

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.400
 he's just one other thing that he reported that I quite liked.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.400
 When he went to India, he, first of all, he described the people.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.400
 This is how I guess know that the ant's thing might have been a bit.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.400
 He might have exaggerated the truth.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.400
 He said that an India lived men with no noses and with no smell.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.400
 How do they smell?

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:48.400
 That joke would have been original back then.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.400
 There were other men with no mouths who fed by inhalation,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.400
 but could be killed by too strong a smell.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.400
 I guess when they hang out with them, there were no noses, then they all dropped dead.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.400
 And then there were men with dog's heads.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.400
 But then he also described.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.400
 He was an ambassador, so he was in the king's talkings court.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400
 It's funny.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.400
 We've got some pretty wacky ambassadors tonight, but no one's sending this kind of shit back.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.400
 So he lived in the king's court and he'd said the king of India liked to...

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.400
 He judged legal cases. That was one of his responsibilities.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.400
 But he only did it while being continually massaged.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.400
 And he had a swarm of parrots that flew above his head at all times.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.400
 And he was considered the embodiment of the city, which was a city called Patala Putra.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:34.400
 And so every time the king washed his hair, a celebratory festival was held.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.400
 Celebrate his hair washing.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.400
 I wonder how often he did it.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400
 Yeah, it would be such a hassle, I think.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.400
 So maybe you'd not do it that often.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:51.400
 He would never attend, because he was like, "Sorry, I'm washing my hair."

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.400
