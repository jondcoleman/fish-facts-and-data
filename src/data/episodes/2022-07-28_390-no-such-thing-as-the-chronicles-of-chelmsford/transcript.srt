00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Before we get going, we just want

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,560
 to let you know that we have a very special guest on this week. So James is away on holiday

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,440
 at the moment, doing, you know, classic Jamesy things. I'm sure you're going to hear about

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,000
 it on a future podcast when he's back. He's probably eating, you know, weird testicles

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,040
 and living in a cave, that sort of stuff. Classic Harken holiday. Anyway, in his place,

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,600
 we have the brilliant comedian, Shaperak Korsandi. Shaperak's a really good friend of ours. She's

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,480
 been on Fish before. She did the comic relief marathon, and that video is up on YouTube

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,120
 if you want to watch it. But she's here for an actual episode this time. And she's not

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,200
 only a comedian, she's a brilliant author as well. She's written three books. Her latest

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,040
 book, which has just come out, is called Kissing Emma. It's a novel for young adults, and

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,080
 it is a modern fable of the untold story of Emma Hamilton, who is Lord Nelson's mistress.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,440
 So if you have a young adult in your life, do get the book for them, but also do get

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,920
 it for yourself because it is for adults as well. And Shaperak is such a great writer,

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,580
 so funny, so interesting. It's going to be a great read. Anyway, that book is available

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,040
 online and in stores now, so do get a copy. But until then, enjoy Shaperak on no such thing

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:30,440
 as a fish. Here we go. Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,680
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Shriver.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,240
 I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and special guest, it's Shaperak

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,200
 Kossandi. And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,480
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:58,520
 fact number one, and that's Shaperak. So hello. And my fact is that a doctor in India,

22
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:06,640
 Ashok Aswani, would prescribe DVDs of Charlie Chaplin to his patients to convince them that

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,800
 joy and laughter was the remedy to their malady. Does he do it if he's run out of medicine

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,200
 for that day? It's interesting. I mean, look, we say doctor, but he was, and this is a new

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,760
 word that I've learned, you've vedic medicine. So it sounds like you've called him a dick.

26
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,680
 You want to say that again? I have a dick. I have a dick. Thank you very much. Is that

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,080
 homeopathy? It's lots of different things. Yeah, it's traditional medicine. There's

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,600
 breathing and there are dietary things and there's herbal treatments and that kind of

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,000
 stuff. That's Ayurveda, I think. Yeah, I think 80% of people in India roughly would practice

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,800
 Ayurvedic medicine. Yeah. But yeah, it's what we would say is alternative medicine. Exactly.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,160
 Or mindfulness, you know, I think that it's the practice of looking after the self and

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,960
 your body and being connected with yourself. But let's be clear, if you're going for your

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,640
 COVID vaccination and they run out of Pfizer, do not accept the gold rush as a substitute.

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,160
 Absolutely. Likewise, if you've broken your leg, the kid will do nothing for you. Just

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,080
 to clarify, even though we're talking about Ayurveda medicine and how it is alternative,

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,600
 actually Aswani prescribes chaplain for mood disorders, right? And psychological problems.

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,200
 So it's people who come with anxiety or depression. And that doesn't seem completely out of this

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,520
 world for some of those issues. And so there's a lot of science that says the old GSOH is

39
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,160
 associated with living longer. I think there was a study in Norway that it took like 54,000

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,200
 people and it looked at how good their senses of humor were. Don't know how they did that.

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,640
 And then it went back 15 years later. And the ones with the best senses of humor were

42
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,760
 more likely to have survived. Wow. So maybe this guy knows what he's into. I think there

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,920
 is something to it. I think, you know, we've spoken about this on the podcast before where

44
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,000
 when people were put under pain and duress, when they put their, I think their hands were

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 in ice buckets, listening to Billy Connolly made them feel the pain less.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,840
 They did show Charlie Chaplin films in hospital. They screen it on hospital ceilings for casualties

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,400
 of World War One because Chaplin was such a massive star that his very silhouette would

48
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,760
 make people feel overjoyed and happy. How do you get the mustache into the silhouette?

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,560
 You've got to do sideways aren't I suppose? No, he's iconic outside. You're not looking

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,080
 at the cane bent with the hat going, who is that? Who is that? Who is it? Well, there

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,120
 is someone else that could have been because you know how he, one of his most famous films

52
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,320
 is called The Great Dictator and he was satirizing Hitler. I didn't know this. He and Hitler

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,960
 were born four days apart. That doesn't mean they have the same silhouette on the ceiling.

54
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,040
 Well, some say that Hitler copied Chaplin's mustache, but was that mustache the fashion

55
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
 that then the way big beards are now amongst the young and her suit?

56
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,200
 Yeah, I mean, Hitler was a fashionable guy. And yeah, I don't think there's ever been

57
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,940
 evidence, but there is someone who did copy Chaplin's mustache overtly. And that is Marcel

58
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
 Proust.

59
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,080
 Why did Marcel Proust copy it? Was it a direct tribute to Charlie Chaplin?

60
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,920
 Yes. And because he was the biggest thing ever. I mean, at the time people were saying

61
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,280
 he was the most famous person who had ever lived, which was probably true in about 1915,

62
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,520
 16, wasn't it? Because, you know, movies had just become this global thing. He was the

63
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,120
 Mr. Bean of his time. He could transcend all language in that he did not rely on language.

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,560
 And in fact, he resisted the talkies when they started talking films. Chaplin was like,

65
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,640
 oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, this takes away the purity of what we do. And this is just

66
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,640
 a passing fad. And it took him a good long time to make a talking film. I think I've

67
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,200
 watched "The Great Dictator" even more times than I've watched "Grease".

68
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
 Wow.

69
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
 Really?

70
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 One of those films I know off my heart.

71
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,480
 But we do need to know how many times you've seen "Grease" in order for this fact to have

72
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
 true punch.

73
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,880
 Oh, I think I watched "Grease" every Saturday for about four, five years.

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,720
 Okay, now that's the great dictator thing. That throws it into an entirely new light.

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 That's amazing.

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,520
 Well, you know how a lot of people during their sort of darker times in their teens

77
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,460
 will listen to music. I would just watch "The Great Dictator" over and over again. And I'd

78
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,520
 make my friends watch it. And I lost quite a few friends with my obsession with that

79
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
 particular film.

80
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
 That's amazing.

81
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,280
 We should say "The Great Dictator" because this is a movie that a lot of listeners might

82
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,920
 not know the plotline of or aware of its impact. This was a movie that Charlie Chaplin

83
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,080
 made in 1940. This was a movie that basically satirized Adolf Hitler and showed exactly

84
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,200
 what his plans were and his hatred towards the Jewish people of the world and how he

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,200
 was putting them away and how he wanted global dictatorship. And this was at a point where

86
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,800
 not everyone was really ready to say that that's what Hitler was doing. And Charlie

87
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,480
 Chaplin got in a lot of trouble for it. But this movie came out while Hitler was really

88
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,080
 at the beginning of what he was about to do. And it caused huge ruckus. Hitler saw it

89
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 twice.

90
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,000
 It's astonishing that this movie was made.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 How many times did he see Greece? We need to know that for context.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,600
 You better shape up was apparently one of his favorite songs. It bellows my mind that

93
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,520
 Hitler saw this. How can you be Hitler and watch that final speech? Don't fight for these

94
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,000
 machine men with machine hearts and machine minds. You are not machines. You are men.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,440
 You are the love of humanity in your heart. How did that not cure Hitler?

96
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,000
 He thought that was the satirist. That's the problem with satire. It's too ambiguous.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,800
 That must have really hit home interestingly in your family as well because your dad is

98
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:49,080
 a satirist and you effectively had to flee Iran because of his direct satire towards the

99
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 power there, right?

100
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,440
 Yeah, I think my father was a huge reason why I fell in love with Chaplin. That scene

101
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,640
 in The Great Dictator when he's on the roof with Paulette Goddard and they're literally

102
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,440
 escaping with the shirts on their backs and then he sees his barbershop blow up because

103
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,960
 the Nazis have blown it up and he's like, "There goes the barbershop." That simple little

104
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,840
 line, "There goes the barbershop. There goes everything I have, everything I've worked

105
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,560
 for, just gone. Now we have to flee everything we know because of these guys," which is exactly

106
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,360
 what happened, of course, to our family. It's a horrible thing. Chaplin, of course,

107
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,840
 was exiled from America. Yeah, it was a McCarthyism, wasn't it? And he was understandably criticised

108
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,720
 it and then had to leave and move to Switzerland, I think.

109
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,440
 Well, he didn't originally move back to Switzerland. He was on his way back to England and then

110
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,000
 they told him on board the ship, "By the way, you're not going to be allowed back into

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,160
 the States unless you appear in front of the immigration authorities on charges of political

112
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,200
 and moral turpitude." So effectively, he couldn't go back.

113
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,600
 I went to his house in Vervet. Did you? Really? The extraordinary thing about it is the Alps

114
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,640
 are just looking down at you, like wherever you look. It's just this art of beauty. And

115
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,200
 it was, for someone of his wealth, it wasn't an opulent place at all. It was just a lovely

116
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,640
 family home. Yeah, I mean, I would live there if I was on route to the UK, but I chanced

117
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,640
 upon this place in Vervet. There was this huge problem when he was on his way, which is

118
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,960
 he had a million dollars buried in his garden. Really? And the story is, and I think there's

119
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,120
 debate about how much of it is true, is that he asked his wife to get a spade, go to the

120
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,920
 garden, dig it up, convert it into $1,000 bills, sew them into her mink coat, and then just

121
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,920
 bring them to Switzerland. That's a big ask, isn't it? You've got to, I think I'd go

122
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
 over to Vals over that. Did she make it? Well, I mean, they lived together in Switzerland

123
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,680
 until his death. So yeah, she did. Did she bring the millions with her? I think that has

124
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,120
 been, a veil has been drawn over that, so we don't know. Let's dig up his old garden

125
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,080
 for God's sake. They might still be there. Don't dig up Charlie Chaplin because that's

126
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,520
 exactly what happened to him after his death. This is the weirdest element of his story.

127
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,760
 He was body snatched. Yes. By these two guys who wanted to bury him under where he was

128
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,080
 buried, right? His corpse was stolen really shortly after he died in the 1970s. '75, yeah.

129
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,480
 '75. And it was these guys who wanted to basically extort Una, one of his last wife,

130
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
 and said, "Give us all this money because we've stolen your husband's body." And

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
 they traced the cause and they caught the guys. And the guys basically said, "We didn't

132
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,240
 really mean anything by it. We just wanted to dig him up, bury him a bit beneath where

133
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,920
 he had been buried before, so it looked like he was gone. And then we had to leg it and

134
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,720
 bury him in a cornfield." No. I mean, that is the worst alibi I've ever heard. They

135
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,320
 wanted $600,000 or the equivalent of $600,000 today for his return. And the police did this

136
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,640
 incredible sting operation. They launched surveillance operations on 200 phone booths

137
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,120
 in the area when they were waiting for the call to be made, which is, you know, substantial

138
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,240
 effort, I would say. They did never claim to be fair to them that they weren't trying

139
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,560
 to extort the wife. They just said, "We weren't going to steal the body. We were just going

140
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,480
 to hide it." And they did apologize to Una afterwards and she did forgive them. It's

141
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,560
 what he would have wanted. He was a comic. He would have got the joke. It's just a bit

142
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,560
 of slapstick. It's amazing that this happened in 1975 as well, isn't it? Like, that's pretty

143
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:21,120
 extraordinary. Why? What do you mean? Well, because he died in 1977, so. Oh my God. I thought

144
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,280
 her sounded early. I'm so sorry. Why have I written that down? Because I'm wrong. Wait,

145
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,960
 what year did Greece come out? What year did? Oh, Greece come out. Oh, I don't know. 78.

146
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,120
 It came out 1978. Are we pretending there's no connection here? Are we really going to

147
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,120
 sit there? Well, I didn't come to the UK until 79, so I missed Chaplin's death. The stars

148
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,520
 of all the lights, you see? I came in time for Thatcher. Well done. You timed it right.

149
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,520
 Her films were rubbish. Can we talk a bit more about the insane early popularity of Charlie

150
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,920
 Chaplin? Because we talk a lot about his later career with The Great Dictator, but his early

151
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,640
 films, when he moved to the USA, because he grew up in England, incredibly poor, moved

152
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,920
 to the USA. In his first year there, he made 36 films in 1914. So I read his obituary in

153
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,120
 the New York Times, and it's full of these unbelievable details about the Chaplin mania,

154
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,000
 the craze. So for example, I'm quoting directly here from his obituary, one New York theatre

155
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,480
 played his films continuously from 1914 to 1923, stopping only because the building burned

156
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,000
 down. That was how popular he was. I know, I know. But at one point he went to the ballet

157
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,680
 in Los Angeles. And again, I'm quoting directly, it's dancers spotted Chaplin in the audience

158
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,480
 and halted the show for half an hour while they embraced him. Wow. Imagine that. It was

159
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,320
 a disease. You know, going back to the original theme, it was called Chaplinitis. And literally

160
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,920
 from 1915, basically as soon as he become famous, people were reported Chaplinitis,

161
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,560
 and he was everywhere, like from China, Africa, Russia, in Japan, he was referred to as Professor

162
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,800
 Alcohol because of the way he swayed, which is like mad level of global fame for that

163
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,400
 time. But he always wanted it. I hadn't realised he was so fame crazed. Yeah. On the boat over

164
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,800
 to America, he basically said, I'm coming to conquer you. Every man, woman and child

165
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,000
 shall have my name on their lips. And you know who he is on that boat with, who I believe

166
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,880
 witnessed that moment of him saying I'm going to conquer America was Stan Laurel. Tim Kardashian.

167
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,800
 Yeah, Stan Laurel, who was part of the British group of comedians that they were with, they

168
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,160
 both went to America together, they lived together for a while as well. And he was like, yeah,

169
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,440
 this guy was insanely ambitious. When they were living in America, obviously they weren't

170
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,200
 successful. As soon as they arrived, they lived in a flat together. And apparently they weren't

171
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,480
 allowed to cook in the flat. That was one of the rules of the tenancy or whatever. So when

172
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,680
 they were frying pork chops, Stan Laurel would fry the pork chops and Chaplin would

173
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,440
 play the violin incredibly loudly to mask the sound of sizzling meat.

174
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:05,560
 My favourite Chaplin fact is that Jackie Coogan, who played the kid, I don't think I've ever

175
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,720
 sobbed so much as when I saw the kid being put on the cart and taken away from Chaplin

176
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:18,800
 and outstretching his arms. And in that film, that line for all of this horrific treatment

177
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:28,080
 of women in his life, that beginning line where he says, a woman, I cry when I even

178
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:35,320
 say this out loud, a woman whose crime was motherhood. Such a simple thing to say at

179
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,720
 a time when so many unmarried mothers had to abandon their kids or put them up for adoption.

180
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:50,920
 And that to me was such a support, early support of single motherhood. Of course, his mother

181
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,520
 was a single mum, so he had a lot of compassion for women in that predicament. Anyway, Jackie

182
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,680
 Coogan went on to become Uncle Fester in the Addams family.

183
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,200
 Yes, in the Addams family. Yes.

184
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 What?

185
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
 Yeah.

186
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,560
 That cute, cute little kid that went around with the tramp smashing windows turned out

187
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,680
 to be the gruesome bald headed uncle Fester.

188
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,040
 Can we quickly go back to the man of who this whole fact was born from?

189
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
 Oh yeah.

190
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
 The doctor.

191
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,360
 The doctor, Ashok Aswani. He's such a great character and it's wonderful when you have

192
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,840
 people championing other characters as their whole life's mission. So he discovered Chaplin

193
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,800
 when he was very young and he fell in love with him and he tried to get into being a

194
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,360
 performer himself off the back of Chaplin and doing mime and so on, but it didn't work

195
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,360
 out for him. And so he went to become this doctor and just while being a doctor, he continued

196
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,840
 his love. So he used to dress up as Chaplin in the streets. He went on to set up a big

197
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,880
 festival and when I say big, I think there's something like 300 people go to it every year.

198
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,720
 But it's a tiny town in Gujarat. It's not a big place and people from around the world

199
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,520
 come to visit it and they dress up as Chaplin and they cut a Chaplin cake.

200
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,920
 Imagine trying to find your friend in that crowd. Imagine even worse, him being your

201
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,120
 doctor and you having a severe case of Chaplinitis booking in to see him. He turns up dressed

202
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,280
 as Chaplin and gives you a Chaplin DVD.

203
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:32,040
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that no one

204
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:39,000
 really knows what order the Chronicles of Narnia should be read in, not even C.S. Lewis knew.

205
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,160
 Is it actually the wardrobe, the witch and the lion? And there's been in a wrong order

206
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,520
 all this time.

207
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,640
 So basically this is something that's been bubbling away in the background amongst academics

208
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,880
 who love C.S. Lewis and just fans of the Chronicles of Narnia where they don't actually know

209
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,680
 which order to read the book in because there's been various publications over the years that

210
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,080
 have them put in different orders. So there's a book that appears quite late in the series

211
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,640
 called The Magician's Nephew which is actually a prequel to what is thought to be the first

212
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,640
 book, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. So when certain publishers have republished

213
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,040
 the book series they'll make The Magician's Nephew book number one. But people argue that

214
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,680
 no, that should be later on in the series like they were originally published. And so the only

215
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,000
 thing that we really know about C.S. Lewis' preference came from a letter that he wrote

216
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,120
 to an 11 year old boy in 1957 who said that he thinks that it should be read in the chronological

217
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,280
 order but his mother thought it should be in the original publication order starting with

218
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,320
 the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe. So he wrote back C.S. Lewis saying "I think I agree with your order

219
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,560
 for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned beforehand as she

220
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,880
 thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. So perhaps it

221
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,320
 does not matter very much in which order anyone reads them." So even he was like "I'm not going

222
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,680
 to settle on a side." And as a result that letter has been analysed so many times by different

223
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,600
 academics who use it as him with that final line saying it doesn't matter what order and then the

224
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,240
 other academics go to the top of the letter and say no he thinks he agrees with the boy's order

225
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,760
 and so we just don't know. Christ, which academics are analysing and re-analyzing this very brief

226
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,000
 letter from C.S. Lewis? It's not Don Jowen is it? He said it doesn't matter. Just accept it and move

227
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,320
 on. Yeah and also you don't know how busy he was when he was writing this letter. Like he might

228
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,720
 have been like "Oh honestly it doesn't matter. Leave me alone." He just had a thing that he had to

229
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,200
 respond to letters and he just said something flippantly and didn't really analyse it himself

230
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,000
 because they all stand alone books aren't they? Yes. So you're a fan aren't you? Have you read

231
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,960
 them all? No I haven't read them all but I'm a massive fan of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe

232
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,680
 which I've just started reading to my daughter actually as of last night. I'm such a dipstick

233
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,720
 that years and years into my adult life having been obsessed with The Lion, The Witch and the

234
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,400
 Wardrobe all my life I had to go on a television programme and talk about it and there was a Q&A

235
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,000
 and someone asked me about the fact that it was a Christian allegory and I didn't realise

236
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,920
 up until they asked that question. I went "Oh yeah!" That's brilliant. Absolutely clueless. There was

237
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:26,680
 very little religion in my life as a child and I just thought this resurrection was coincidental

238
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,880
 with what happened to Jesus. But why would you? I mean there is no reason why you would know as

239
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,760
 a child and it must be interesting reading it as an adult because I read all the books in

240
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,520
 the order that they came in the box set, Magician's Nephew first and when you're seven or whatever

241
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,240
 you're not really looking for the message and in fact even if the message is round down your

242
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,560
 throat you're likely to miss it because you're excited by the idea of going into a cupboard.

243
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 C.S. Lewis, he was a serious Christian in lots of ways and in fact I think he was described in his

244
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,880
 obituary as more of a Christian thinker. One of his main obituries in the New York Times didn't even

245
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,640
 mention the lie of the witch in the wardrobe, didn't mention Narnia, described him as a Christian

246
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,600
 apologist and... C.S. Lewis, oh come on that is wantonly highbrow to a really pretentious extent.

247
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,240
 It was his biggest hit by a long way. C.S. Lewis, it was his biggest hit yeah but he converted to

248
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,760
 Christianity. I really like this fact on a trip to Whipsnade Zoo and specifically in a motorbike

249
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,040
 sidecar en route to Whipsnade Zoo. C.S. Lewis, what? C.S. Lewis, I think he went with his brother or

250
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,080
 brother-in-law and he wrote later on "When we set out I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the

251
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,880
 Son of God and when we reached the zoo I did" and the journey was on a motorbike and he was in

252
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,720
 the sidecar so he had a conversion to Christianity in a motorbike sidecar. C.S. Lewis, oh wow what

253
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,320
 happened? What possibly happened in that sidecar? C.S. Lewis, I mean I think it was probably the

254
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,920
 culmination of a process. It wasn't as though they saw a burning bush en route and he just thought

255
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,960
 "oh okay". C.S. Lewis, the parrot the zoo told him. C.S. Lewis, do you know that we know the population

256
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,400
 of Narnia exactly? It's 19,252. C.S. Lewis, is that including the squirrels? C.S. Lewis,

257
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,800
 oh that's a good point. Human population, sorry. C.S. Lewis, is that because there's a real place

258
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,840
 called Narnia. Narnia exists. It's in Italy. It's called Narnie these days but in classical

259
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,960
 times it was called Narnia and C.S. Lewis saw it as a young man on a classical map which was written

260
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,480
 in Latin and it just labelled it Narnia and the name just stuck with him. C.S. Lewis, imagine it

261
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:30,040
 could have been Chelmsford. C.S. Lewis, I don't know if that would have caught his eye in quite the

262
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,920
 same way, maybe. C.S. Lewis, I looked into Narnia in Italy and it didn't look as if

263
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,760
 they had done anything specifically to capitalise on, you know, you could quite easily turn yourself

264
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,480
 into a tourist town, couldn't you? C.S. Lewis, yeah, I think they've probably got the dignity to resist

265
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,760
 it. It's my hunch. Do you think? C.S. Lewis, yeah, it's Italy. It's not some coastal town in the

266
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,400
 north of Ingalls the Italians were talking about. They've got really nice places they don't need to

267
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,720
 nix C.S. Lewis, I think. I think they're missing a trick. Yeah, because if that was in Britain,

268
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,160
 they'd be selling little Mr. Tumnus key rings. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, even just some sort of like

269
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,520
 carpentry cupboard shop that has a tie in, you know, do something, use it. What cupboards were the

270
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,760
 false back? That's a good idea, actually. That could be really fun. Well, Dan, I know you're always

271
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,120
 looking for a pilgrimage to go on to see great places associated with great people. You can see

272
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,040
 the wardrobe. The wardrobe is in Illinois for weird reasons. It's the Lewis family wardrobe,

273
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,040
 which was at his family home in Belfast for years. And then it got moved to his adult home. So it's

274
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,520
 definitely the wardrobe. And it was auctioned off and taken to a place called Wheaton College.

275
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,800
 And it's there these days with Tolkien's desk. So they're united even in death.

276
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,960
 And I bet that's the place that's capitalising on the connection. I suspect Illinois is making more

277
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,560
 of that. You know, the first time walking through a cupboard, it wasn't in the line

278
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,800
 The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was in a 1946 essay that he wrote called Different Tastes in

279
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:04,600
 Literature. Wow. Yeah. Not as catchy a kid's book, no. That's the he uses it as an analogy of the

280
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,640
 experience of reading poetry, you know, you walk through a wardrobe into another realm. And he

281
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,680
 uses that in that book. So, you know, recycled a lot of his ideas. Did you ever try to get into

282
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:21,480
 Narnia as children? Yes. Oh, my Lord. Yeah, like pushing through the. Yeah, just going if I if I

283
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,480
 just do it, maybe this way, maybe if I just close my eyes, I'll be in Narnia hours I spent in the

284
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,960
 cupboard. It was very controversial for him when he was writing it, because he wrote about the

285
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,280
 cupboard, the wardrobe. And then he sent a draft of the book to his friend Owen Barfield, whose

286
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:44,280
 daughter was Lucy. Lucy was C.S. Lewis's goddaughter, after whom the character of Lucy is named.

287
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,960
 And anyway, Lucy's mom, Owen Barfield's wife said, Well, this is really dangerous. You can't

288
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,360
 have this Pete. Kids will start locking themselves in cupboards. That's really dangerous. Lucy's

289
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,600
 going to lock herself in a cupboard. And then so you'll notice he added all these amendments to

290
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,240
 the text. There are four or five references in the text. So yeah, do you remember that? Absolutely.

291
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,320
 Saying burnt in the cupboard, leaving it open just a bit because it is very foolish to shut

292
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:16,360
 oneself into a wardrobe. And he said that repeatedly. Exactly. Very sort of like rammed in

293
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,720
 to make sure. And that probably saved you from locking yourself in a wardrobe multiple times.

294
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,320
 You know what? To this day, whenever I climb into a wardrobe, I'm careful to leave it open just a

295
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:38,360
 little. Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is Andy. My fact is that the only dog to

296
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:44,440
 have been to both the North and South Poles was not a husky nor any kind of adventure dog, but a

297
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,600
 small Jack Russell terrier solo mission, solo mission. No, slightly accompanied, slightly

298
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,680
 accompanied by being Ronald Fiennes's dog, which did help the odds of getting there. Sure. Well,

299
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:03,000
 Randolph and Virginia finds his dog. So we've spoken about Randolph finds before. We haven't

300
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,600
 spoken about Lady Twisselton Wickham finds known to her friends as Jenny, who was his wife.

301
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,880
 And the dog was called Bothy. And this was the trans globe expedition they were on,

302
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,840
 which we've mentioned so briefly in passing. But basically it was the mission to cross Antarctica

303
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,680
 and the Arctic Ocean and to go to both poles on the same trip, which had never been tried before.

304
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,440
 With the dog, do we know? I mean, why the dog? Was the Jack Russell going to come in useful? Was

305
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,040
 it a backup food supply? Was the Jack Russell pulling all the sleds? Do you know how expensive it

306
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:41,720
 would be to put it in a kennels for all that time? Well, exactly. I think that they just loved the dog.

307
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,920
 And Jenny said, Well, this is going to take three years. I'm not leaving the dog at home for three

308
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:50,840
 years. And she and the dog were very, very close because I think she'd lost her previous terrier.

309
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,080
 I think it had some awful ending. It's sort of drowned in a slurry pit or something. It was

310
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,840
 really, really traumatic. She was absolutely inconsolable. So then Rannell got to this new

311
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,320
 dog, Bothy, and they were inseparable. And she said, Right, we're going to take him

312
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,280
 all the way around the world. And they did. So up until this point, I've known Rannell Fiennes as

313
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,800
 this extraordinary explorer. But I have to say, Ginny Fiennes is the coolest person I've read

314
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,080
 about in years. She's a legend, isn't she? What's your favorite feature? Your favorite Ginny feature?

315
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,440
 She kind of ran the show. And no one really ever acknowledged that she would organise the

316
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,080
 entire teams that would go along with him. She would set up the camp and she would have the

317
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,040
 radio going where she would sit and monitor, listening out for Morse code for days on end,

318
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,280
 like listening and then having to organise whatever weird request. I need a whalership

319
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,760
 to pick me up in two days. Okay, I'll just do that then, shall I? Sitting here in my cardboard box,

320
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,640
 which she did. She sat in a cardboard box most of the time. Hang on, hang on, hang on.

321
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,080
 Yeah, I've gone too far, as always. Your enthusiasm carried you away. There were cardboard, though.

322
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,120
 She designed cardboard huts, laminated cardboard huts, which were for when they needed to stay

323
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,360
 for the winter in Antarctica. It's not the first material you think of, is it? When you think,

324
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,080
 what am I going to buy? The wise man built his house out of cardboard? That's not a problem.

325
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,760
 No, you're absolutely right. And then they got covered in snow. And I think that's what kept

326
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,840
 them warm. I guess they were light and easily transportable, which is a good thing. And they

327
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,040
 had tunnels in between the huts. And the other little piggy built their heart out of tin.

328
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,600
 Thank God there are no wolves in Antarctica, that's all I could say. No, just Bothie the dog,

329
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,640
 who apparently repeatedly, Bothie was a terror. Bothie shat in the snow tunnels between the huts.

330
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,720
 Randall Fine said it's impossible to teach Bothie the difference between outside, outside,

331
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,840
 and outside, which is a snow tunnel between the huts. And even on the ship all the way down,

332
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,040
 Bothie was leaving little presents in everyone's cabins. That's a nightmare. But it was very brave,

333
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,840
 according to Ginny, and all dog owners are biased, but apparently was only afraid once.

334
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,720
 And that was when he came across a bowl shaped Antarctic sort of snow bowl. And he barked into

335
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,880
 it. And then it barked back because of the echo and freaked the hell out. But aside from that,

336
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,000
 very brave dog. Yeah. Yeah. My dog is a bit of a hero. And also I'm a little bit appalled at myself

337
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,920
 talking about Ginny in the Antarctic with her dog, because all I thought about was I hope Ginny

338
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:23,400
 cleared up after her dog in the Antarctic and didn't leave little green bags of dog poo all over

339
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,760
 the snow. No, it's really, that is a very good point. I actually don't know if they did tidy up

340
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,400
 and they have banned dogs from the Antarctic now. Because you see, ruined it for everyone.

341
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,560
 Because Ginny left such a mess. Yeah. Exactly. No, not Ginny, not Bothie,

342
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:44,680
 not Ginny. We don't know about either. So Bothie, Bothie the dog. Yeah, no, but that's probably

343
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,960
 means that no dog after Bothie will ever go to the Arctic and Antarctic again. If the rules don't

344
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,840
 change. There might be a generation of kids in the UK that are aware of Bothie, even though they

345
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,720
 don't realise it. Bothie used to appear on Blue Peter a lot. And there was a book that was written

346
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,000
 by Randolph and Ginny about Bothie the dog. Not by Bothie, I thought you were going to say.

347
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,840
 Bothie won pet of the year, I believe, in 1982, I think after the expedition. And then he was also

348
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,200
 invited to present a prize at the 1983 Crufts. I don't know how. He turned it down on moral grounds,

349
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,560
 didn't he? He doesn't agree. She did win prizes as well. Ginny, she got the Polar Medal in 1987.

350
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,320
 I think she was the first woman to get it. And that was because she did important scientific

351
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,160
 work in the Antarctic, mostly with her radio stuff. She was pioneering. And she was the first

352
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,960
 woman ever to be invited to join the Antarctic Club. Chopra, have you been part of any kind of

353
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,760
 expeditions? I feel like it's a celebrity comedian thing you get invited to. I would love to. I would

354
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,880
 love to do that. But no, I haven't. I've only done I'm a celebrity. Get me out of here where we just

355
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,480
 really stayed put, apart from the occasional jumping out of a helicopter. But no, the Arctic,

356
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,120
 I mean, who doesn't want to go there? It's like my dream to do a trip like that. And just hearing

357
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,600
 you guys talking about Ginny and her tech work and how she pulled the whole show together makes

358
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:13,960
 me feel like such a knob for taking almost an hour to even get on this call with you guys

359
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:22,120
 and wasting all of your time. So I think that was that was your equivalent of an intrepid journey.

360
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,280
 Like that was, you know, what that was, persistence and grit. And I think it shortened my life in

361
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:35,240
 some ways. I mean, Ginny also, she's definitely suffered for her work. She once got in the Antarctic,

362
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,480
 she got glued to a lavatory seat because it was minus 50 degrees Celsius outside. Once she went

363
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,000
 out into the snow and she had a cigarette lighter, metal zippo lighter in her pocket,

364
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,200
 and it burned into her thigh. It burned the shape of the zippo and the lighter into her thigh because

365
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,760
 of how cold it was out there. I mean, it's not the same, but I had a similar experience and I'm

366
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,280
 a celebrity, get me out of here because I got glued to the wooden toilet seat because I went in

367
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,880
 after several of the blokes. And it wasn't the sort of seat that you can flip up. It was horrific.

368
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,880
 Yeah, because they would we in the dunny, you couldn't flip it up. And then you couldn't really

369
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,480
 wipe it either. So their pee would just soak down into it. And there was no getting away from it.

370
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,600
 And there was a limited amount of loo paper. It was horrific. Oh my God, did this make, did this

371
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,560
 fact make it to air? Or is this you giving us exclusive content about? This is exclusive content

372
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:36,360
 about the unhygienic. Who's pee? Who's pee? Name names? No, God, Dan, no. Legally, no. But I will

373
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:46,360
 tell you that Stanley Johnson and I had to share a towel for the entire time because they wouldn't

374
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,760
 let us have fresh towels. And my towel had got so full of debris, like there's so much woodchip,

375
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:00,280
 it was unusable. And so we had this situation that we never talked out of ever again of just we

376
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,920
 were never sure whose towel was who. You see, I think that is hardship. I think that is qualified

377
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,920
 for some kind of, not the entire club, but something. I think you deserve a polar medal.

378
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,760
 Thank you. I mean, compare that to having a Zippo branded onto your thigh. I think me having to

379
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,600
 share towels in Australia's Gold Coast was a lot worth. With Boris Johnson's dad, we should say,

380
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:27,400
 for foreign listeners. Yeah, just back to Ginny for a second. Before she was doing these adventures

381
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,720
 with Ranoff, she had amazing adventures in her own right. One really bizarre one, which is in 1972,

382
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,400
 she was commissioned by Woman's Own Magazine to go and live with an Omani shake in a village

383
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:46,520
 for two months, the idea being that she would be his third wife. And there was a very, very strict

384
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,800
 understanding between all parties that there was going to be no hanky-panky, that it was just purely

385
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,840
 her living the life to see what the life was like. And she did it. She went out there and she lived

386
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,960
 with them. And she basically fell in love with the family to the point where she decided not to

387
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,320
 submit the article because she wanted to respect their privacy. And then in that area, it's where

388
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:14,440
 she then, with Ranoff finds, went and found a completely lost city to time. Oh yeah. It's just

389
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,280
 amazing, the lost city of Ubar. They'd heard rumors about it. No one could find it. Ranoff and Ginny

390
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,840
 obsessed over it, spent years and years looking for it. And eventually it was solved when we started

391
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,680
 getting aerial shots via satellite that they were able to spot something in the sand, and they uncovered

392
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,720
 it and they found it. It's completely lost city of Ubar. The frankincense city, I think it was

393
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,280
 where they did all the frankincense trading. So it must have been this incredible, rich, scented place.

394
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:46,600
 Do you think they smelled it out? I'm sure. I'm probably buffy. And she did all this stuff without

395
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,720
 being, you know, she wasn't physically tough. So for example, she could do two laps of a running

396
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,880
 track and then she had to lie down. She wasn't a strong woman, but I mean, but she still went on

397
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,720
 this 35,000 mile transglobe expedition. She had to take a hot water bottle to the Arctic because

398
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,160
 Ranoff like sleeping with the windows open, which I find completely. Jesus Christ. I mean, what?

399
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,800
 Yeah. And sometimes when they were, you know, overwintering, this is at the other end of the

400
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:18,280
 planet on the Antarctic, she wouldn't answer the radio. And twice Ranoff came back to the

401
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,760
 cardboard hut and found that she was unconscious from carbon monoxide poisoning. What? And I know.

402
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,520
 From what? Oh, God knows, a bit of the equipment going wrong or, I don't know what exactly caused

403
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,400
 it. But yeah, there were just so many moments of near total peril and failure on this expedition.

404
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,200
 And she took it all pretty well, didn't she? She was clearly very hardy. She sounds formidable,

405
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,440
 I think is probably the word you would use. So everyone was kind of terrified of her.

406
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,680
 Like your most respected, but strict headmistress is how I imagine her. I think when she heard

407
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,080
 that Ranoff had to have his fingers amputated, you know, he had to amputate the ends of his

408
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,200
 five fingers. It was through frostbite, right? Yes. But then he sawed them off himself at home.

409
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Her first response was, oh, damn, we'll be short-handed on the farm now. Not a lot

410
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,960
 of sympathy. Is that a short-handed joke because his fingers are literally shorter because he sawed

411
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,880
 them off? I don't think it was an intentional pun, but it obviously has that other layer

412
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,480
 that you can enjoy. Great. That's how good she was. She won. One kind of really amazing fact

413
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,120
 about Ginny is that she died, I think, in 2003, although Dan, you may well tell me it was actually

414
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:30,200
 2005. But it was 2004. You're kidding. Unbelievable. You know what? I'm going to start writing days

415
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,640
 down. All right, she died in 2004. I think she may have been diagnosed with cancer in 2003.

416
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,720
 She found out about her illness when Ranoff, her husband, was away. He was running seven marathons

417
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,720
 on seven continents in seven days. And she didn't mention it to him in case he abandoned the attempt

418
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,440
 and changed it if he wanted him to get on with it and finish it. And I think that is a sign of the

419
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,920
 kind of woman she was completely. That strong spousing. Yeah. Extremely brave. Guys, can I tell

420
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,080
 you about the first all-female expedition to the North Pole? Because it's a really fun story.

421
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:10,440
 This was in the '90s. And basically, this woman, Caroline Hamilton, who was a financier, she hated

422
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,600
 all forms of exercise, never done really any in her life, decided, I'm going to take a bunch of

423
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,480
 women to the North Pole. And she put an advert in the newspaper, in the Telegraph, I think, saying,

424
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,200
 "Hey, are you a woman who has no hiking or exploring experience? And do you want to come

425
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,360
 to the North Pole? Get in touch." And all these women did. And it's the coolest story. They went

426
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,720
 on a trial weekend somewhere in the UK, which was quite rough. I think it was in Dartmoor,

427
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,920
 an induction weekend. And there was this woman called Ann Daniels, who was a mother to Toddler

428
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,440
 Triplett, who I think his marriage wasn't going that well. She was not sportier outdoorsy at all.

429
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,000
 She cried her way through the induction weekend. And it was all sorts of women like this.

430
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,960
 And they did it. It was five teams of four who were selected, just from ordinary women.

431
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,480
 And it was sponsored by McVitties. So they had 7,000 biscuits to get them through the trip.

432
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,600
 7,000 biscuits. 7,000 biscuits. Yeah. Nothing else. And yeah, they made it. And now

433
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,160
 there are a bunch of them are explorers. So Ann Daniels is one of Britain's leading explorers.

434
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,400
 She's done 10 polar exhibitions now. She's amazing. Yeah. When they got back from their first trip,

435
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,880
 they must have had a lot of diplomatic receptions and things to go to. They must have done a lot

436
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:33,560
 of hobnobbing. That has cured all my ailments. Thank you. Dr Murray. I had mild eczema on my thumb,

437
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:46,120
 and it's just disappeared. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that is Anna.

438
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:52,360
 My fact this week is that the character of Don Corleone in the novel The Godfather was based

439
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:59,320
 on the author's mother, which is great. Because when you watch The Godfather,

440
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,560
 it's Marlon Brando. So it's a completely different character. But this is the guy who

441
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:09,160
 wrote the book, Mario Puzo, said that he'd never met a gangster. A lot of people assumed because

442
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,920
 it was kind of such a real portrayal that he'd been embedded in gang life for years. Never

443
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,280
 met a gangster. And so he said, whenever The Godfather opened his mouth in my books, in my own

444
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,080
 mind, I heard the voice of my mother. And he describes his mother as having the wisdom, the

445
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,360
 ruthlessness, the unconquerable love for her family and for life itself. But his mother,

446
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,760
 he was from an Italian immigrant family and lived in New York. And his father was committed for

447
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,360
 schizophrenia quite early on in his life. So his mother raised seven children on her own,

448
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:46,840
 and was clearly this another formidable woman. The side that he relates as his mother being similar

449
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,920
 to is things like when the father was committed to the asylum, he could have returned. But the

450
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,560
 mother made the decision not to let him out. Puzo said that she thought he'd be a burden on

451
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,720
 the family. And he says that's a very mafia decision that she was like, no, keep him away.

452
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:08,360
 Puzo also said that whenever he heard Brando speak the lines, he could hear his mother's voice.

453
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,880
 He was like, ah, it's mum again. So like properly even in the movie interpretation of it. Yeah.

454
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,000
 Okay, the other really, really weird thing about Mario Puzo, The Godfather was the second novel

455
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,960
 he wrote based on his mother. He wrote one called The Fortunate Pilgrim. That was his second book.

456
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,720
 And the main character in that is the woman called Lucia Santa. And he said that she is based on

457
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,840
 his mum as well. Yeah, there was a publisher who read The Fortunate Pilgrim and said, look,

458
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,240
 didn't really love the book. But that one tiny gangster character, that was good. Do you think

459
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,840
 you could expand that? That's amazing. And he just went away and wrote The Godfather because of that.

460
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,960
 The amazing thing was just how successful it was. Because his first two novels in total had earned him

461
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,680
 $6,500. So his lifetime earning from books at that point was six and a half thousand.

462
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,840
 I'm so glad things have changed with books.

463
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:03,320
 It was really interesting his career because he had written these failed novels and he desperately

464
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,200
 wanted to be an author. And it was only into his 40s that he then started writing The Godfather.

465
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,680
 And that's where his life changed. And he knew that this was the last attempt. And if it didn't

466
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,360
 work, he was going to do something else. And he tried to work for other people. Like he worked for

467
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,000
 Stan Lee at one point when Stan Lee was doing comic books. And he was almost a comic book

468
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,720
 writer, but he just couldn't make it work. But we could have had Mario Puzo Spiderman.

469
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,600
 I'm happy with Mario Puzo, Godfather. I'll stick to that.

470
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,040
 Yeah, I don't think being bitten by a radioactive horse is as thrilling.

471
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,080
 We did have Mario Puzo Superman because he is the screenwriter behind Superman One and

472
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,080
 Superman Two with Christopher Reed. Of course. Yeah.

473
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:49,480
 But there's this great story that when he was writing screenplays post Godfather One and Two,

474
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,960
 he sort of got anxiety realising, you know, I'm an author. I've adapted my books into

475
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,000
 being screenplays. But I don't really know how to do this. So he bought a book on screenwriting.

476
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,400
 And he said he had to stop reading it because in the first chapter, the book said, "Study Godfather One."

477
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,840
 It's the model screenplay.

478
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,680
 Sheprack with your novel, because he's used characters from real life in the latest one,

479
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,040
 Kissing Emma. Are any family members going to look at that and go, hang on a sec?

480
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,600
 No, I've written two novels and absolutely none of my characters or events have been based on

481
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,440
 any persons in real life. Sheprack, why are you reading that off the card?

482
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:33,080
 No, of course I have. What is it? They say that when there's a writer in the family,

483
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:41,160
 there's a traitor in the family. There's a really grim part in Puzo's book that didn't

484
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:48,120
 make the film. I can't remember how old I was when I read the book, but I was a kid or a young

485
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:59,400
 teenager that absolutely mortified and distressed me. And it was a very early clue of what the

486
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,120
 Hollywood scene was like way before Harvey Weinstein and all that. Do you know the part I

487
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:14,440
 mean where there's a famous Hollywood producer and it's a tiny little blink and you'll miss it

488
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:22,120
 detail where he sleeps with a very young girl of about 12 or 13 and it says, "Since his wife died,

489
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:28,360
 his heart's been so broken that he can only get aroused by very, very young girls who were taken

490
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:35,560
 to him to sleep with by their mothers in the hope that he'll put them in a film." And it describes

491
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:44,680
 the scene where this young girl is being held up by her mum. That then makes you feel better about

492
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,800
 the gruesome way that this producer is then treated. And obviously they left that out of the

493
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:58,440
 film because it's not there. But even in the book, that's a part of it that when I first read it as

494
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:05,080
 a young girl myself that really stuck with me. Is that what they do? Is that what happens in

495
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:11,480
 Hollywood? It's just really interesting how that bit was really bypassed, but it was a massive

496
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,840
 clue. And I wonder how much Puzo did know about the industry and how common knowledge that was.

497
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,720
 I think we've blown this open in that Puzo had some kind of amazing prescience or psychic

498
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,320
 powers because he was not involved in Hollywood at all, so he would not have known. But he could

499
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,080
 see, he could see into gangsters, he could see into Hollywood. He saw this. Yeah, it's the

500
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:37,560
 Nostradamus of the crime world. The cousin Nostradamus. Nice. They were pretty heavily involved

501
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:44,120
 in the filming of The Godfather, The Mafia. It's this crazy story. They only allowed The Godfather

502
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,200
 to be made on the grounds that the word mafia was never spoken. So this was because they wanted

503
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,880
 to film in New York. They had to film in New York. They couldn't use a set. It wouldn't look real.

504
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,720
 And the mob boss in New York at the time was this guy called Joe Colombo,

505
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:06,200
 Sr. And he basically said to the producer, Albert Ruddy, "Okay, you can't mention The Mafia because

506
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,640
 The Mafia doesn't exist, mate. We don't know, it's not a thing. And you're just going to give

507
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,800
 Italian immigrants a bad name." This was while he was running the head of one of the biggest

508
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,400
 gangs in New York. So he said, "Don't mention The Mafia. And also, we want all the proceeds

509
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,800
 from the film premiere. Just the premiere." If we don't get them, something bad could happen.

510
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,880
 Terrible. Well, it works. It works. And Albert Ruddy, he actually promised all the premiere

511
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,240
 proceeds. Oh, my God. And awfully, the studio then went back on that promise, which must have been

512
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,240
 a terrifying moment for Ruddy when they said, "We're not actually going to pay them."

513
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,600
 And I'm going, "Okay, what's going to happen to me?" Good news is, we no longer need die for

514
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,040
 the red carpet. It's just going to be naturally red, actually. So the thing I love about the

515
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,880
 book as well is that Puzo wrote it from research, didn't know any gangsters, but he met gangsters

516
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,760
 through the success of the book, who flat out refused to believe that he'd never been a gangster

517
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:07,240
 himself. And then, mafiosi themselves, they started doing the cheek-to-cheek kisses based on the

518
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:13,640
 movie. No one called each other a godfather before Puzo did. And then that became a mafia term.

519
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,840
 The mafia basically are a tribute act to the novel The Godfather these days.

520
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,160
 And if they've heard this, Andy, you are in serious trouble, tribute act to a movie.

521
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,440
 Something else that came up in his book, which didn't make it in, did you guys read about this?

522
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,920
 Well, you will have read it, Shabrak. This is the subplot about Connie's, so you know,

523
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,920
 Connie, the daughter who has the wedding at the start, her maid of honour, Lucy Mancini,

524
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:47,240
 who has a vagina that's too big. Yeah, absolutely bizarre plot. She's going out with Sonny,

525
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,360
 if you remember the character of Sonny, but he can go out with her and it works because he's

526
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:58,440
 quite well endowed. And then he doesn't last the first film even. And I think she struggles.

527
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,320
 Anna, that's I forgot about that bit until you just said. And now, of course,

528
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:08,280
 the memories of how I felt reading that, of coming flooding back to me. And I'm thinking,

529
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:14,760
 perhaps I was probably too young to read that book, because she was she was a gorgeous woman.

530
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:21,880
 She's described as a gorgeous woman, this big baggy Fanny. And it was it was so graphic.

531
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:30,760
 It was like Bukowski style graphic. How funny that as a bloke, he sat down and he created this

532
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,280
 character that needed a lot anyway. It's not it's not a female author, is it? Once you get to that

533
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,240
 bit. It is not a female author. That woman has written that. What a bizarre subplot.

534
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:47,240
 Thank God it wasn't relevant to the storyline. He didn't have to keep it in.

535
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,880
 Doesn't seem like he could keep it in, frankly. I really hope you know how his publisher read the

536
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,720
 previous book and spotted that tiny mafia character and went do a whole book about that.

537
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,680
 I really hope you saw that character with that big Fanny lady. That's the next book.

538
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:11,000
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you would like to
