00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
 Hello and welcome to the last episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,480
 Fact Ball", the only football podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,160
 football whatsoever.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,020
 Brought to you by the QILVs in association with visitinglyn.com.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,020
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,400
 I'm sitting here with Anarch Zinski, Alex Bell, and James Harkin.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,660
 And here for the final time, the last two countries, it is South Korea vs Ghana.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,660
 And let's begin with South Korea.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,240
 Okay, I have something which is unfortunately slightly about football.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,820
 Well it's the last one we can mention football, I guess.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,500
 As we have in every other one.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
 Yeah, wow.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,980
 Our game are rules.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,980
 Yeah.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,940
 I got sent this fact by a guy on Twitter @elison11.

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,340
 And he told me that the lowest paid footballer in this World Cup is Lee Cune Ho, who earns

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,780
 only $150 a month in the South Korean army.

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,780
 Wow.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,220
 Yeah, so compare that with Cristiano Ronaldo or Lena Messi.

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,220
 That's so weird.

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,820
 It's like part of army training.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,820
 I don't get it.

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,300
 Well, it's like government service, it's service for your country, on the football field instead

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
 of on the battlefield.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,140
 So they're really looking on this as war.

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,980
 This is a popular war.

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,780
 South Korea right now are in war.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
 Yeah.

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,780
 Do you guys remember an incident at the end of last year between North and South Korea where

30
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:24,700
 there was a little escalating of tensions and North Korea sent a fax to South Korea when

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,060
 the tensions are escalating, threatening, merciless attack without notice.

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,540
 I just really like the idea that war has been declared via fax.

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,540
 By a fax machine.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
 By a fax machine.

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,540
 Yeah.

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,900
 Phil Collins supposedly dumped his wife by fax.

37
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,900
 Did he?

38
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,900
 Apparently.

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,220
 I don't know if that's true, but it's just one of those fax toides that you hear every

40
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,220
 now and then.

41
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,140
 I always assume that South Korea were the slightly more sensible ones when it came to things

42
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,140
 like faxing and that you would have seen that North Korea would always start things.

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,380
 But in between North and South Korea there's the demilitarized zone and inside that there's

44
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,540
 a place called the Truce Village which is where the two sort of diplomatic parties from

45
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,980
 North and South Korea meet up to have negotiations and conferences and there was one negotiation

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,380
 period where they were both there and the night before one of the conferences South Korea's

47
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,820
 delegation snuck into one of the Truce tents and sawed all the legs down on the chairs

48
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,700
 of the North Korea inside the table so that they would be sitting lower and they had to

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,020
 sit lower in the meeting.

50
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,740
 So the North Koreans then left because they got really annoyed at this.

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,860
 And the next day then South Korea then brought their flag along to the table and put their

52
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,340
 flag, a little flag on the table which really pissed off the North Koreans again.

53
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,700
 So the next day the North Koreans brought their own flag that was slightly bigger and this

54
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,140
 kept on going and they kept bringing bigger and bigger flags until they had to organize

55
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,220
 a special meeting to deal with the problem of the flags because they were getting too

56
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,700
 big to fit inside the tent.

57
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
 That's incredible.

58
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,540
 I like the idea of them getting pissed off enough that they go back to Kim Jong-un like

59
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,580
 you need to send a fax.

60
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:53,140
 I read a thing about Valentine's Day in South Korea.

61
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,380
 So Valentine's Day celebrated on the same day February 14th but instead of it being a sort

62
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,060
 of a mutual gift giving process, basically it's all about the women giving presents to

63
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,940
 the men to show how much they love each other.

64
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,540
 But then the month after in March 14th, which is called White Day, the man has to then

65
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,020
 reciprocate with the present.

66
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,180
 It's like another Valentine's Day but the rule is that whatever present was bought for him,

67
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,220
 the present he then buys back for the person he loves has to be three times the amount in

68
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
 cash.

69
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,220
 Oh, wow.

70
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,220
 So if you make a real profit.

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,220
 Exactly.

72
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,860
 If you bought something quite expensive, the guy's probably going, "Jesus Christ, am I going

73
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
 to afford this?"

74
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,580
 Actually, it's really interesting.

75
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,140
 The 14th of every month seems to be an event for them.

76
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,140
 So as well as White Day and Valentine's Day on the 14th of December, it's Hug Day.

77
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,660
 On the 14th of June, it's Kiss Day, very self-explanatory.

78
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,820
 It encourages you to kiss people, encourages you to hug people.

79
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,260
 On the 14th of January, it's Diary Day.

80
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,780
 You would think it'd be on the 1st of January?

81
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,780
 It's a bit late, isn't it?

82
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
 Yeah.

83
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,460
 Diary Day should be in December, really.

84
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,740
 And then in April, it's Black Day and that's when single people mourn their lack of love

85
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
 by eating.

86
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,500
 And also, I think the single people probably don't feel great on the Hug Day or Kiss Day,

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 either.

88
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,460
 It's quite common for Korean men to wear makeup as well.

89
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
 I like that.

90
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,460
 That's great.

91
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,220
 Because in the past, I've done, I mean, James, you were on only Connect.

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,700
 I don't know if they require basic touch-ups in makeup.

93
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,780
 Yeah, we're going to be on only Connect in the autumn and yeah, we had to wear makeup for

94
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
 that.

95
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,420
 Yeah, and I've done a few TV things where they put on makeup and it's amazing.

96
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,980
 Makeup, Alex, I highly recommend makeup.

97
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,380
 Yeah, I think 20% of South Korean men wear makeup apparently and there was a quote from

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,460
 someone who works in the makeup industry in South Korea recently who said, "I think

99
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,060
 a lot of Korean guys get into this kind of thing while doing their military service."

100
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,160
 Which seems a really bizarre place to get into putting on makeup.

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,860
 Which is why on the football field, Leaky Unho is wearing lipstick and mascara.

102
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,780
 They have a lot of plastic surgeons in South Korea and their plastic surgeons are so good

103
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,460
 that people going over from Japan and China go back over but the passports don't look the

104
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,180
 same as what they look like after the plastic surgery and so they need to get special

105
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,700
 certificates from the plastic surgeons to say that they've had the surgery.

106
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
 That's amazing.

107
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
 Wow.

108
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:17,020
 On plastic surgery, there's a kind of surgery pioneered by South Koreans called smile-lipped.

109
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
 You guys see that?

110
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
 Look it up.

111
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
 It's so disgusting.

112
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,420
 They make incisions in either corner of your mouth so you have a permanent smile and it's

113
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,580
 really grotesque but South Korean women are getting quite into it.

114
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
 Yeah.

115
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,580
 Just on technology with South Korea because I think they are actually kind of leading the

116
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,980
 way in their attitude as well towards technology.

117
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,940
 Well they have 5G there now.

118
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
 Exactly.

119
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,460
 You can download a whole movie in less than one minute.

120
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
 No.

121
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
 Oh my god.

122
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
 That is speeding.

123
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
 That is fungerously.

124
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,460
 Why do they still using fags machines?

125
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,260
 They have this new thing on buses that Duncan Donuts has been doing so they'll play radio

126
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,580
 out, allowed on the buses and any time that there's a Duncan Donuts jingle, it sets off

127
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,900
 a little spray which is in the bus, that sprays the smell of Duncan Donuts.

128
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,140
 So it's a smell accompaniment to the advert, the jingle that they're hearing and they've

129
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,780
 found as a result of this they had an increase in sales of 16% of Duncan Donuts.

130
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,940
 Now they're not doing this worldwide but they are still doing it in South Korea.

131
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,340
 You've mentioned Duncan Donuts quite a lot of times in that last sentence as well and

132
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,140
 we are hoping for delivery.

133
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,980
 I am hoping for it.

134
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,860
 Another thing they're really in two food wise spam, super into spam, that was the second

135
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,980
 largest consumer of spam and it's traditionally in Korea on their annual lunar Thanksgiving holiday

136
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,580
 to go and visit family and to pay your respects, you give and receive packaged cans of spam.

137
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,060
 I think the highest eaters of spam are Guam, just off the top of my head although Hawaii eats

138
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,060
 a lot as well.

139
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,260
 They eat it off the top of your head.

140
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,340
 Okay we're going to have to wrap up on South Korea, half time whistles on its way to see the

141
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,460
 referee pulling it out of the pocket.

142
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,700
 So if we've got any final facts, let's try and get them in quickly.

143
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,900
 More than half of all Koreans are called Kim Lee, Park Choi, or Jung.

144
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,420
 There's a penis park, it's very odd, there's a mythology behind it, but if you actually,

145
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:17,620
 if you Google penis park, Google penis park South Korea and you will see these giant

146
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,860
 penises, it's a public park.

147
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,860
 As I've just said, one of the most popular surnames in Korea is Park.

148
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:31,260
 So I imagine penis park is quite an insult to quite a few people.

149
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,700
 As the whistle told you was coming, half time has arrived and before we head off to the second

150
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,220
 half of our match, we are going to now do our half time show, which comes in the form

151
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,140
 of a QI quiz sponsored by VisitEngland.com.

152
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,500
 So we've got three questions for this half time show, we're going to start with Alex.

153
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
 What have you got?

154
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,100
 My question is, under the rule of Henry VIII, if you were convicted of poisoning someone

155
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,300
 deliberately, how were you punished?

156
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
 James?

157
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,300
 My question is, other than the Bible, what was the most popular book in 16th century England?

158
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,660
 Okay, and Anna.

159
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:15,860
 My question is, so Dublin is obviously a city in Ireland, but there's a town in England

160
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,940
 that has the exact same name, but in a different language.

161
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
 What is that town?

162
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,940
 You know, right?

163
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
 I do know, yes.

164
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
 James knows it.

165
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
 Okay.

166
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
 From my neck of the woods.

167
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
 Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
 So it's Bolton.

169
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,940
 Not quite Bolton.

170
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,940
 Not quite Bolton.

171
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,420
 Okay, well, if you want to find out the answers to those questions, you're going to have

172
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,940
 to stay tuned to the rest of the podcast where we will be revealing them at the end, but

173
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,660
 in the meantime, it is time to get back to our match and making their way to the field.

174
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,660
 It's Ghana.

175
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,700
 I've got a fact that I like.

176
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,740
 The world record for running 100 meters is held by a man from Ghana.

177
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
 No.

178
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
 Well, you've mistaken running forwards.

179
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,740
 Could I just assume that?

180
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:05,500
 The 100-meter running backwards record is held by a Ghanaian called Ferdi Alto Abobo, and

181
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,900
 he set the record in 13.6 seconds, and he was actually matched in the 100 meters by

182
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,580
 someone, but I believe he still owns the 100 yards record, and it's actually turned into

183
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,940
 a massive thing, the whole idea of the backwards Olympics as such.

184
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,180
 I'd like to see the backwards javelin where you have to catch it.

185
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,180
 Yeah, that's a lovely idea.

186
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,420
 It's being picked up by a lot of people, John Voit, who's the father of Angelina Jolie.

187
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,340
 He thinks that reverse running helps you clear your head.

188
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,340
 This guy, this Ghanaian guy, has set an absolute trend around the world.

189
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
 Everyone's picking up on it.

190
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,300
 But I thought Ghana was quite progressive, but that's pretty backwards, isn't it?

191
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,780
 Oh, goodness.

192
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,100
 Goodness.

193
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,300
 Yeah, there's only one word from Ghana that we've adopted into the English language.

194
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
 Okay.

195
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
 What would that be?

196
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
 It is...

197
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
 I know what it is.

198
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
 Oh, say.

199
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
 Corsica.

200
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
 Yes.

201
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
 Yeah.

202
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
 What?

203
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
 Yeah, we always talk about Corsica.

204
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
 You know, oh, Corsica.

205
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
 Corsica.

206
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
 Corsica.

207
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
 It's protein deficiency, isn't it?

208
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
 Yeah.

209
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
 I think it's the one where you get the really swollen stomach.

210
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,260
 Oh, I've never heard that word before.

211
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,260
 It's the only word that's made it into the English language.

212
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,340
 Here's a word that we should get from Ghanaian.

213
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
 Yeah.

214
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,140
 This is from the Booly language in Ghana.

215
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,300
 The word is polinty, and it means to move hot food around your mouth.

216
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,100
 So it's like, if you eat something, which is a little bit too hot, and you go, "Oh, ah!"

217
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
 That's great.

218
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
 Yeah, it's good words.

219
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
 That's a very good word, yeah.

220
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,020
 Speaking of words and naming things, conjunctivitis in bits of Ghana is known as Apollo,

221
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:43,020
 because it started breaking out in 1969 when Moonlinings took place, and so there was just a connection

222
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
 there.

223
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,020
 Maybe a few people believed it was connected, but mainly it was just a tradition, but it's

224
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
 called Apollo.

225
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
 Yeah, that's very cool.

226
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
 That's a good fact.

227
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,020
 Yeah.

228
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,740
 I found this in the QI database, which is known as Squire.

229
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,220
 Stools are sacred to the Ashanti, and the Ashanti itself, Ghana.

230
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
 What?

231
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,060
 Alex was thinking of the other version of the word stool.

232
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
 I'm talking about chairs.

233
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,060
 I'm talking about chairs.

234
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,060
 Yeah, yeah.

235
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,060
 No, according to legend, the first king of the Ashanti witnessed a golden stool coming

236
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
 down from the sky.

237
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,980
 Well, now that you've put that on the chair.

238
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,580
 It came from a cloud of white dust, landed on his knees.

239
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,820
 At the coronation, the Ashanti king was lifted up over the stool, but you're never allowed

240
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
 to sit on the stool.

241
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,620
 In fact, the stool itself has a stool that it sits on.

242
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,100
 I think, if memory serves, there was a bit of a wall, wasn't there, because the English

243
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,940
 stole the stool or something?

244
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
 Oh, my God.

245
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
 I don't know.

246
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
 Someone will have to Google that.

247
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,620
 Speaking of stool, there's a can sauce in Ghana called Shaito.

248
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
 Nice.

249
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
 And they have pea beer as well.

250
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
 Peek-peek.

251
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,220
 Apparently, it looks like pea tastes like pea, and it should be served at room temperature.

252
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,940
 I really like the story that Gordon Brown re-told, and we don't ever spoke of it, but when

253
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,780
 Nixon went to visit Ghana on Ghana in Independence Day in 1957, he was going around congratulating

254
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,380
 all the Ghanaians, being like, oh, well done, you guys, you're free now.

255
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,460
 Congratulations on the Yoke of Colonialism, and the first person he spoke to you to say,

256
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,460
 how does it feel to be free?

257
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,260
 He responded, saying, how would I know?

258
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
 I come from Alabama.

259
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,900
 I think there's an awkward moment in his presidency.

260
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,420
 Well, Shirley Temple was the US ambassador to Ghana between 1974 and 1977.

261
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
 Oh, shit.

262
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
 Yeah.

263
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
 And Czechoslovakia.

264
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,420
 Yeah.

265
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,100
 Fetish pre-stess is quite a big thing in Ghana, or I think.

266
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,500
 And it's like a modern-day oracle, so you go to visit your fetish pre-stess.

267
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,860
 And there's a person who serves the mediator between the spirit and the living.

268
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,500
 And so you go to ask them to do you magical spiritual favors, or they can also cast curses

269
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
 on you.

270
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
 Yeah, we had that on QI.

271
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:47,380
 We did a question about West Africa, and we asked one of the picture guys to go to the

272
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,380
 shop and buy some fetish items, and we meant, like, things used in, like, witch-doctory.

273
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,020
 But that's not what he came back with.

274
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,420
 And that episode's now going to be in the pee-for-porn series, coming up in a few years'

275
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
 time.

276
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
 Okay, final facts.

277
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,940
 Before the final whistle of the whole series.

278
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
 Yeah.

279
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
 The final, final whistle.

280
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,500
 And I really like the guard tribe, the coastal guard tribe in Ghana.

281
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,620
 When you die, you have a funeral earner or a coffin that represents how you lived or something

282
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,500
 about your character, or, and they're awesome, and it's a big industry, so you get coffins

283
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,460
 in the shape of all-nate fish, or, like, a car coffin if you love to race cars.

284
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,980
 Giant mobile phone, I think.

285
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,980
 Yeah, exactly.

286
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
 Yeah, definitely.

287
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,060
 I would definitely recommend people Google, Ghanaian coffins, because the pictures are amazing.

288
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,780
 In 2009, a 29-year-old Ghanaian woman married her dog.

289
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,740
 She was called Miss Marbu, and she said, "For so long, I've been praying for a life partner

290
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,420
 who will have all the qualities of my dad."

291
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,380
 My dad was kind, faithful, and loyal to my mom, and he never let her down.

292
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,500
 I've been in relationships with so many men, and they're all the same.

293
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,980
 My dog is kind and loyal to me.

294
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,340
 He treats me with so much respect.

295
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,060
 My dad also had four legs and used to shit on the carpet.

296
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
 [laughter]

297
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,140
 All right, that's the end of our match.

298
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,540
 Both good efforts from both sides.

299
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,700
 But before we find out who has won the match, why don't we get the answers to that visitingland.com quiz?

300
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,620
 Three questions, starting with you, Alex.

301
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,340
 My question was, under the rule of Henry VIII, if you were convicted of poisoning someone's

302
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,820
 liberally, how are you punished, and the answer is you were boiled alive.

303
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,860
 In just a big pot?

304
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,860
 I don't know.

305
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
 I imagine so, yeah.

306
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,620
 I think it was a big pot, yeah.

307
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
 Was that served up as like a side dish?

308
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,060
 Yeah, I didn't know if you were in a stew or whether it was just water.

309
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,060
 Yeah.

310
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
 I think it was oil.

311
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,060
 Oil.

312
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,060
 Oh, my God.

313
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
 Okay, James.

314
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,580
 Okay, my question was, what was the best-selling book other than the Bible in 16th century England?

315
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:45,180
 And it was a book by Dutch philosopher Erasmus called On Civility in Children.

316
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,740
 And it was a book telling children how to behave like the Dutch.

317
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,740
 Yeah.

318
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,740
 Okay.

319
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
 Great.

320
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
 And Anna, last question.

321
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,740
 I think my question was something along the lines of, so Dublin, the Irish city, there's

322
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,260
 an English town with the same name, but in a different language.

323
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,180
 And that is because Dublin in Irish means black pool.

324
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,180
 Ah!

325
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
 Black pool.

326
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,180
 Okay, cool.

327
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
 There you go.

328
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,620
 Okay, so that's the, there's the answers to our quiz.

329
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,100
 Sadly, no prizes there.

330
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,020
 If you've got any of those right, however, if you do go over to visitingland.com, there

331
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,780
 are a bunch of QI goodies, including caps and t-shirts and books.

332
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:28,340
 And if you do win, send us a photo, someone sent us a photo of the prize that they got.

333
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,940
 And, you know, we just, we'd like to look at it.

334
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,300
 So yeah, so head over there if you want to, if you want to win a prize.

335
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,140
 But now it's time to find out who was won this final match in our international factball

336
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,900
 and I'm going to go with Anna for you to make the decision.

337
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,700
 I am going to go with Ghana so that I can be buried in a cool coffin.

338
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
 Okay.

339
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
 So that's it.

340
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,180
 Ghana has won this final bout in our international factball competition and that's it.

341
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,180
 That's us done.

342
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,340
 That's all the teams who've been playing in that alternative football competition that's

343
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,340
 been going on.

344
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,100
 I believe it's called the World Cup.

345
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,900
 And that leaves us just with the final words.

346
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,020
 You can contact us on our Twitter handles.

347
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,580
 You can get me on @Sriberland, Alex @AlexBell_James @Xshaped and Anna.

348
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:17,060
 I will be tweeting my fax number from @Quickipedia because I'll be there.

349
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
 And so that's it.

350
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,060
 Now, this is the last in our international factball.

351
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,140
 However, we are going to be doing one special final episode in which we actually talk about

352
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
 football.

353
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,820
 Only the interesting things about football, right?

354
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
 Only the interesting things.

355
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,260
 We're not going to be debating the relative merits of Messi and it's going to be the no such

356
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,220
 thing as a fish take on football.

357
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,740
 And we're going to be joined by special guests, the founder of QI, John Lloyd, who knows

358
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,420
 even less about football than we do.

359
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,940
 That's very exciting.

360
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,100
 But we will see you again tomorrow when we go back to our regular no such thing as a fish

361
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
 podcast.

362
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,580
 Four of our favorite facts that we've learned from the last seven days.

363
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,580
 So tune in for that.
