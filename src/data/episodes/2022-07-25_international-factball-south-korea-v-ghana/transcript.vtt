00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
 Hello and welcome to the last episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.480
 Fact Ball", the only football podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.160
 football whatsoever.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.020
 Brought to you by the QILVs in association with visitinglyn.com.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.020
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.400
 I'm sitting here with Anarch Zinski, Alex Bell, and James Harkin.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.660
 And here for the final time, the last two countries, it is South Korea vs Ghana.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.660
 And let's begin with South Korea.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.240
 Okay, I have something which is unfortunately slightly about football.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.820
 Well it's the last one we can mention football, I guess.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.500
 As we have in every other one.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 Yeah, wow.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.980
 Our game are rules.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.980
 Yeah.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.940
 I got sent this fact by a guy on Twitter @elison11.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.340
 And he told me that the lowest paid footballer in this World Cup is Lee Cune Ho, who earns

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.780
 only $150 a month in the South Korean army.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780
 Wow.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.220
 Yeah, so compare that with Cristiano Ronaldo or Lena Messi.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 That's so weird.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.820
 It's like part of army training.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 I don't get it.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.300
 Well, it's like government service, it's service for your country, on the football field instead

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.300
 of on the battlefield.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.140
 So they're really looking on this as war.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.980
 This is a popular war.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.780
 South Korea right now are in war.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 Yeah.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.780
 Do you guys remember an incident at the end of last year between North and South Korea where

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.700
 there was a little escalating of tensions and North Korea sent a fax to South Korea when

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.060
 the tensions are escalating, threatening, merciless attack without notice.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.540
 I just really like the idea that war has been declared via fax.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.540
 By a fax machine.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 By a fax machine.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.540
 Yeah.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.900
 Phil Collins supposedly dumped his wife by fax.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.900
 Did he?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.900
 Apparently.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.220
 I don't know if that's true, but it's just one of those fax toides that you hear every

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 now and then.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.140
 I always assume that South Korea were the slightly more sensible ones when it came to things

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 like faxing and that you would have seen that North Korea would always start things.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.380
 But in between North and South Korea there's the demilitarized zone and inside that there's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.540
 a place called the Truce Village which is where the two sort of diplomatic parties from

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.980
 North and South Korea meet up to have negotiations and conferences and there was one negotiation

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.380
 period where they were both there and the night before one of the conferences South Korea's

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.820
 delegation snuck into one of the Truce tents and sawed all the legs down on the chairs

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.700
 of the North Korea inside the table so that they would be sitting lower and they had to

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.020
 sit lower in the meeting.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.740
 So the North Koreans then left because they got really annoyed at this.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.860
 And the next day then South Korea then brought their flag along to the table and put their

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.340
 flag, a little flag on the table which really pissed off the North Koreans again.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.700
 So the next day the North Koreans brought their own flag that was slightly bigger and this

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.140
 kept on going and they kept bringing bigger and bigger flags until they had to organize

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.220
 a special meeting to deal with the problem of the flags because they were getting too

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.700
 big to fit inside the tent.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700
 That's incredible.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.540
 I like the idea of them getting pissed off enough that they go back to Kim Jong-un like

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.580
 you need to send a fax.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.140
 I read a thing about Valentine's Day in South Korea.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.380
 So Valentine's Day celebrated on the same day February 14th but instead of it being a sort

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.060
 of a mutual gift giving process, basically it's all about the women giving presents to

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.940
 the men to show how much they love each other.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.540
 But then the month after in March 14th, which is called White Day, the man has to then

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.020
 reciprocate with the present.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.180
 It's like another Valentine's Day but the rule is that whatever present was bought for him,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.220
 the present he then buys back for the person he loves has to be three times the amount in

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.220
 cash.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.220
 Oh, wow.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.220
 So if you make a real profit.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.220
 Exactly.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.860
 If you bought something quite expensive, the guy's probably going, "Jesus Christ, am I going

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.860
 to afford this?"

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.580
 Actually, it's really interesting.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.140
 The 14th of every month seems to be an event for them.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.140
 So as well as White Day and Valentine's Day on the 14th of December, it's Hug Day.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.660
 On the 14th of June, it's Kiss Day, very self-explanatory.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.820
 It encourages you to kiss people, encourages you to hug people.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.260
 On the 14th of January, it's Diary Day.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.780
 You would think it'd be on the 1st of January?

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.780
 It's a bit late, isn't it?

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.780
 Yeah.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.460
 Diary Day should be in December, really.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.740
 And then in April, it's Black Day and that's when single people mourn their lack of love

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.740
 by eating.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.500
 And also, I think the single people probably don't feel great on the Hug Day or Kiss Day,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.500
 either.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.460
 It's quite common for Korean men to wear makeup as well.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.460
 I like that.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.460
 That's great.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.220
 Because in the past, I've done, I mean, James, you were on only Connect.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.700
 I don't know if they require basic touch-ups in makeup.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.780
 Yeah, we're going to be on only Connect in the autumn and yeah, we had to wear makeup for

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.780
 that.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.420
 Yeah, and I've done a few TV things where they put on makeup and it's amazing.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.980
 Makeup, Alex, I highly recommend makeup.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.380
 Yeah, I think 20% of South Korean men wear makeup apparently and there was a quote from

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.460
 someone who works in the makeup industry in South Korea recently who said, "I think

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.060
 a lot of Korean guys get into this kind of thing while doing their military service."

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.160
 Which seems a really bizarre place to get into putting on makeup.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.860
 Which is why on the football field, Leaky Unho is wearing lipstick and mascara.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.780
 They have a lot of plastic surgeons in South Korea and their plastic surgeons are so good

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.460
 that people going over from Japan and China go back over but the passports don't look the

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.180
 same as what they look like after the plastic surgery and so they need to get special

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.700
 certificates from the plastic surgeons to say that they've had the surgery.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.700
 That's amazing.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.700
 Wow.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.020
 On plastic surgery, there's a kind of surgery pioneered by South Koreans called smile-lipped.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.020
 You guys see that?

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.020
 Look it up.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.020
 It's so disgusting.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.420
 They make incisions in either corner of your mouth so you have a permanent smile and it's

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.580
 really grotesque but South Korean women are getting quite into it.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.580
 Yeah.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.580
 Just on technology with South Korea because I think they are actually kind of leading the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.980
 way in their attitude as well towards technology.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.940
 Well they have 5G there now.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.940
 Exactly.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.460
 You can download a whole movie in less than one minute.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.460
 No.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.460
 Oh my god.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.460
 That is speeding.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.460
 That is fungerously.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.460
 Why do they still using fags machines?

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.260
 They have this new thing on buses that Duncan Donuts has been doing so they'll play radio

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.580
 out, allowed on the buses and any time that there's a Duncan Donuts jingle, it sets off

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.900
 a little spray which is in the bus, that sprays the smell of Duncan Donuts.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.140
 So it's a smell accompaniment to the advert, the jingle that they're hearing and they've

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.780
 found as a result of this they had an increase in sales of 16% of Duncan Donuts.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.940
 Now they're not doing this worldwide but they are still doing it in South Korea.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.340
 You've mentioned Duncan Donuts quite a lot of times in that last sentence as well and

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.140
 we are hoping for delivery.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.980
 I am hoping for it.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.860
 Another thing they're really in two food wise spam, super into spam, that was the second

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.980
 largest consumer of spam and it's traditionally in Korea on their annual lunar Thanksgiving holiday

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.580
 to go and visit family and to pay your respects, you give and receive packaged cans of spam.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.060
 I think the highest eaters of spam are Guam, just off the top of my head although Hawaii eats

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.060
 a lot as well.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.260
 They eat it off the top of your head.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.340
 Okay we're going to have to wrap up on South Korea, half time whistles on its way to see the

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.460
 referee pulling it out of the pocket.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.700
 So if we've got any final facts, let's try and get them in quickly.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.900
 More than half of all Koreans are called Kim Lee, Park Choi, or Jung.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.420
 There's a penis park, it's very odd, there's a mythology behind it, but if you actually,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:17.620
 if you Google penis park, Google penis park South Korea and you will see these giant

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.860
 penises, it's a public park.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.860
 As I've just said, one of the most popular surnames in Korea is Park.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:31.260
 So I imagine penis park is quite an insult to quite a few people.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.700
 As the whistle told you was coming, half time has arrived and before we head off to the second

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.220
 half of our match, we are going to now do our half time show, which comes in the form

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.140
 of a QI quiz sponsored by VisitEngland.com.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.500
 So we've got three questions for this half time show, we're going to start with Alex.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.500
 What have you got?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.100
 My question is, under the rule of Henry VIII, if you were convicted of poisoning someone

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.300
 deliberately, how were you punished?

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.300
 James?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:05.300
 My question is, other than the Bible, what was the most popular book in 16th century England?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.660
 Okay, and Anna.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:15.860
 My question is, so Dublin is obviously a city in Ireland, but there's a town in England

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.940
 that has the exact same name, but in a different language.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.940
 What is that town?

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.940
 You know, right?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.940
 I do know, yes.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.940
 James knows it.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.940
 Okay.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.940
 From my neck of the woods.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.940
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.940
 So it's Bolton.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.940
 Not quite Bolton.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.940
 Not quite Bolton.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.420
 Okay, well, if you want to find out the answers to those questions, you're going to have

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.940
 to stay tuned to the rest of the podcast where we will be revealing them at the end, but

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.660
 in the meantime, it is time to get back to our match and making their way to the field.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.660
 It's Ghana.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.700
 I've got a fact that I like.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:52.740
 The world record for running 100 meters is held by a man from Ghana.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.740
 No.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.740
 Well, you've mistaken running forwards.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.740
 Could I just assume that?

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:05.500
 The 100-meter running backwards record is held by a Ghanaian called Ferdi Alto Abobo, and

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.900
 he set the record in 13.6 seconds, and he was actually matched in the 100 meters by

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.580
 someone, but I believe he still owns the 100 yards record, and it's actually turned into

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.940
 a massive thing, the whole idea of the backwards Olympics as such.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.180
 I'd like to see the backwards javelin where you have to catch it.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.180
 Yeah, that's a lovely idea.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.420
 It's being picked up by a lot of people, John Voit, who's the father of Angelina Jolie.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.340
 He thinks that reverse running helps you clear your head.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.340
 This guy, this Ghanaian guy, has set an absolute trend around the world.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.340
 Everyone's picking up on it.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.300
 But I thought Ghana was quite progressive, but that's pretty backwards, isn't it?

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.780
 Oh, goodness.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.100
 Goodness.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:53.300
 Yeah, there's only one word from Ghana that we've adopted into the English language.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.300
 Okay.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.300
 What would that be?

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.300
 It is...

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.300
 I know what it is.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.300
 Oh, say.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300
 Corsica.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300
 Yes.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.300
 Yeah.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300
 What?

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.300
 Yeah, we always talk about Corsica.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.300
 You know, oh, Corsica.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.300
 Corsica.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.300
 Corsica.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.300
 It's protein deficiency, isn't it?

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.300
 Yeah.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.300
 I think it's the one where you get the really swollen stomach.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.260
 Oh, I've never heard that word before.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
 It's the only word that's made it into the English language.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.340
 Here's a word that we should get from Ghanaian.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.340
 Yeah.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.140
 This is from the Booly language in Ghana.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.300
 The word is polinty, and it means to move hot food around your mouth.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.100
 So it's like, if you eat something, which is a little bit too hot, and you go, "Oh, ah!"

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.100
 That's great.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.100
 Yeah, it's good words.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.100
 That's a very good word, yeah.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.020
 Speaking of words and naming things, conjunctivitis in bits of Ghana is known as Apollo,

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:43.020
 because it started breaking out in 1969 when Moonlinings took place, and so there was just a connection

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.020
 there.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.020
 Maybe a few people believed it was connected, but mainly it was just a tradition, but it's

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.020
 called Apollo.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.020
 Yeah, that's very cool.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.020
 That's a good fact.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.020
 Yeah.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:56.740
 I found this in the QI database, which is known as Squire.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.220
 Stools are sacred to the Ashanti, and the Ashanti itself, Ghana.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.220
 What?

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.060
 Alex was thinking of the other version of the word stool.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.060
 I'm talking about chairs.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.060
 I'm talking about chairs.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.060
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.060
 No, according to legend, the first king of the Ashanti witnessed a golden stool coming

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.060
 down from the sky.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.980
 Well, now that you've put that on the chair.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.580
 It came from a cloud of white dust, landed on his knees.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:26.820
 At the coronation, the Ashanti king was lifted up over the stool, but you're never allowed

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.820
 to sit on the stool.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.620
 In fact, the stool itself has a stool that it sits on.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.100
 I think, if memory serves, there was a bit of a wall, wasn't there, because the English

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.940
 stole the stool or something?

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.940
 Oh, my God.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.940
 I don't know.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.940
 Someone will have to Google that.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.620
 Speaking of stool, there's a can sauce in Ghana called Shaito.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.620
 Nice.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.620
 And they have pea beer as well.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.620
 Peek-peek.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.220
 Apparently, it looks like pea tastes like pea, and it should be served at room temperature.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.940
 I really like the story that Gordon Brown re-told, and we don't ever spoke of it, but when

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:01.780
 Nixon went to visit Ghana on Ghana in Independence Day in 1957, he was going around congratulating

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.380
 all the Ghanaians, being like, oh, well done, you guys, you're free now.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.460
 Congratulations on the Yoke of Colonialism, and the first person he spoke to you to say,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.460
 how does it feel to be free?

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.260
 He responded, saying, how would I know?

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.260
 I come from Alabama.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.900
 I think there's an awkward moment in his presidency.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.420
 Well, Shirley Temple was the US ambassador to Ghana between 1974 and 1977.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.420
 Oh, shit.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.420
 Yeah.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.420
 And Czechoslovakia.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.420
 Yeah.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.100
 Fetish pre-stess is quite a big thing in Ghana, or I think.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.500
 And it's like a modern-day oracle, so you go to visit your fetish pre-stess.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.860
 And there's a person who serves the mediator between the spirit and the living.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.500
 And so you go to ask them to do you magical spiritual favors, or they can also cast curses

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.500
 on you.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.500
 Yeah, we had that on QI.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.380
 We did a question about West Africa, and we asked one of the picture guys to go to the

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.380
 shop and buy some fetish items, and we meant, like, things used in, like, witch-doctory.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.020
 But that's not what he came back with.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.420
 And that episode's now going to be in the pee-for-porn series, coming up in a few years'

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.420
 time.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.420
 Okay, final facts.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.940
 Before the final whistle of the whole series.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.940
 Yeah.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.940
 The final, final whistle.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.500
 And I really like the guard tribe, the coastal guard tribe in Ghana.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.620
 When you die, you have a funeral earner or a coffin that represents how you lived or something

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.500
 about your character, or, and they're awesome, and it's a big industry, so you get coffins

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.460
 in the shape of all-nate fish, or, like, a car coffin if you love to race cars.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.980
 Giant mobile phone, I think.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.980
 Yeah, exactly.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.980
 Yeah, definitely.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.060
 I would definitely recommend people Google, Ghanaian coffins, because the pictures are amazing.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.780
 In 2009, a 29-year-old Ghanaian woman married her dog.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.740
 She was called Miss Marbu, and she said, "For so long, I've been praying for a life partner

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.420
 who will have all the qualities of my dad."

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.380
 My dad was kind, faithful, and loyal to my mom, and he never let her down.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.500
 I've been in relationships with so many men, and they're all the same.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.980
 My dog is kind and loyal to me.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.340
 He treats me with so much respect.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.060
 My dad also had four legs and used to shit on the carpet.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.060
 [laughter]

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.140
 All right, that's the end of our match.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.540
 Both good efforts from both sides.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:09.700
 But before we find out who has won the match, why don't we get the answers to that visitingland.com quiz?

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.620
 Three questions, starting with you, Alex.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.340
 My question was, under the rule of Henry VIII, if you were convicted of poisoning someone's

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.820
 liberally, how are you punished, and the answer is you were boiled alive.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.860
 In just a big pot?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.860
 I don't know.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.860
 I imagine so, yeah.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.620
 I think it was a big pot, yeah.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.620
 Was that served up as like a side dish?

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.060
 Yeah, I didn't know if you were in a stew or whether it was just water.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.060
 Yeah.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.060
 I think it was oil.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.060
 Oil.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.060
 Oh, my God.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.060
 Okay, James.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.580
 Okay, my question was, what was the best-selling book other than the Bible in 16th century England?

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:45.180
 And it was a book by Dutch philosopher Erasmus called On Civility in Children.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.740
 And it was a book telling children how to behave like the Dutch.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.740
 Yeah.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.740
 Okay.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.740
 Great.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.740
 And Anna, last question.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.740
 I think my question was something along the lines of, so Dublin, the Irish city, there's

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.260
 an English town with the same name, but in a different language.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.180
 And that is because Dublin in Irish means black pool.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.180
 Ah!

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.180
 Black pool.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.180
 Okay, cool.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.180
 There you go.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.620
 Okay, so that's the, there's the answers to our quiz.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.100
 Sadly, no prizes there.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.020
 If you've got any of those right, however, if you do go over to visitingland.com, there

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:22.780
 are a bunch of QI goodies, including caps and t-shirts and books.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:28.340
 And if you do win, send us a photo, someone sent us a photo of the prize that they got.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.940
 And, you know, we just, we'd like to look at it.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.300
 So yeah, so head over there if you want to, if you want to win a prize.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.140
 But now it's time to find out who was won this final match in our international factball

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.900
 and I'm going to go with Anna for you to make the decision.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.700
 I am going to go with Ghana so that I can be buried in a cool coffin.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.700
 Okay.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.700
 So that's it.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.180
 Ghana has won this final bout in our international factball competition and that's it.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.180
 That's us done.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.340
 That's all the teams who've been playing in that alternative football competition that's

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.340
 been going on.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.100
 I believe it's called the World Cup.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.900
 And that leaves us just with the final words.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.020
 You can contact us on our Twitter handles.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:11.580
 You can get me on @Sriberland, Alex @AlexBell_James @Xshaped and Anna.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:17.060
 I will be tweeting my fax number from @Quickipedia because I'll be there.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.060
 And so that's it.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.060
 Now, this is the last in our international factball.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:26.140
 However, we are going to be doing one special final episode in which we actually talk about

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.140
 football.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.820
 Only the interesting things about football, right?

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.820
 Only the interesting things.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.260
 We're not going to be debating the relative merits of Messi and it's going to be the no such

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.220
 thing as a fish take on football.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.740
 And we're going to be joined by special guests, the founder of QI, John Lloyd, who knows

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.420
 even less about football than we do.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.940
 That's very exciting.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.100
 But we will see you again tomorrow when we go back to our regular no such thing as a fish

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.100
 podcast.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.580
 Four of our favorite facts that we've learned from the last seven days.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.580
 So tune in for that.
