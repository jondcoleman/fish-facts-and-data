00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 (phone rings)

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.920
 (speaking foreign language)

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.500
 (upbeat music)

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.820
 - Hi, good day, mate.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.660
 - Hello, Andy.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.600
 - Hi, everybody.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.680
 - We've been in this room for, what, three hours now?

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.520
 - Yeah.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.360
 - And you're only just saying hi?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.200
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.200
 (laughing)

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.480
 - Welcome, everybody, to Drop As Align,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.280
 our audience feedback show.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.220
 You've been sending in lots of emails,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.520
 and we're gonna read out probably 1% of them now,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.760
 but the best 1%.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.840
 - If you've sent one in that hasn't been read today,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.720
 don't lose hope.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.840
 - No, but do buck your ideas up.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.680
 - Yeah.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.960
 - Andy did not like them.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.680
 (laughing)

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 - No, I should say, often we read out emails

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.000
 and they get onto the show,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.040
 but often we read out emails

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 and we don't have anything funny to say about them.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.560
 We just appreciate them, cut them in the edit and move on.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.200
 So if you haven't had your email read out on Drop As Align,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.960
 it's probable that it's so good, but we failed.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.160
 - Are we gonna have a compilation outtake show

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 of letters that didn't make Jules?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.480
 - Because they're a good email

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.600
 followed by us being not at all funny,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 yeah, for like 30 to 40 seconds, and then we, yeah, yeah.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.200
 - So it's just you, we're not in it, it's just you.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.760
 (laughing)

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.920
 - Here is an idea for bonus content stuffs,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.160
 writes Aaron Michael Reed.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.760
 You lot play and commentate on playing board and card games.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.600
 He says, "It would be hilarious and very fascinating

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.080
 "to hear an ongoing live commentary

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.120
 "on various games being played and reviewed

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.960
 "through your unique prism of being elves.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.320
 "Hope this doesn't qualify me for possibly being dull

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.440
 "for wanting this."

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.160
 Regards, Aaron, a board game fan.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.960
 - I do very much question the hilarious

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.360
 and fascinating claims.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 (laughing)

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.760
 - So does Aaron mean a visual?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.160
 Like we're on YouTube, we are watching a game

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.560
 being played out like a game of chess

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.040
 or a board game like monopoly.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.400
 We're playing it and just talking?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.560
 - Yeah.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.800
 I think it sounds nice.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.280
 - Night to D4.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920
 (laughing)

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.760
 - Is that it?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.600
 - Yeah, that's it.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.320
 - Okay.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440
 - Maybe we'll play risk or boggle.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.280
 - Right.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.040
 I think after trying it, I think it could be fun actually.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.880
 - Yeah.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 - Snakes and ladders.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 Something like snakes and ladders

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.840
 and then just get really into the strategy.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 (laughing)

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.520
 - Okay, thanks.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.000
 - Dan's saying thanks.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.120
 - I'm saying no thanks.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.960
 - There we go.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.800
 And Anna's saying but.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.840
 - I'll go with the flow.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.360
 - Okay, thank you, Aaron.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.520
 All right, here's another one.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.280
 Indy Carmichael writes,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.560
 in your most recent drop as a line,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.080
 a listener asked, what were your worst received facts?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.160
 I feel you all missed the most obvious ones

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.000
 through the years.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.840
 - Oh, God.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.360
 - So here are our worst received facts.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.680
 (laughing)

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.720
 - That's a great idea for you.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.760
 - Here we go.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.960
 So Anna says Indy.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.800
 - Oh, wow.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.920
 Thanks for kicking off with me, Indy.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.560
 - An underground worker who was blasted through the earth

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.080
 and meters into the air

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.160
 by I think compressed gas of some description.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.440
 No one believed her despite having a reputable source.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.280
 - Yeah.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.720
 - Oh, there's still one of the great moments

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.200
 of the podcast, that story.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.480
 - I enjoyed that reception.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.920
 I don't take the criticism.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.760
 - Okay.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.040
 Andy, who could forget the dead frog orgy debacle?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.880
 I believe you may have been booed.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.240
 I think I have forgotten.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.840
 This was in Cardiff at the Glee Club.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.160
 I remember strongly because there's a frog

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.320
 that has sort of necrotic or horrible orgies to breed.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.160
 - I remember.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.000
 - And it's all--

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.720
 - And usually you tell the stories

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.440
 and the audience goes with you, don't they?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.280
 - They just didn't.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.120
 - They really didn't.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.960
 (laughing)

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.560
 - A conservative crowd, clearly on and off night.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.760
 - And they hated it.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.040
 They absolutely hated it.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.680
 Dan, the airplane loop-de-loop guy who fell out of

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.160
 and landed back in his plane.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.080
 - Didn't you verify that months later?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.920
 - Got a great source.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.760
 - You got a good source.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.000
 - Got a great source for it, yeah.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.600
 - Even though it obviously did in the house.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.440
 - Go on.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.480
 - James, no specific badly received fact springs

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.320
 to mine for James.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.160
 - I like this guy.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.400
 - Except, except, says Andy,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.320
 I do remember a great deal of tension

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.160
 over the QWERTY keyboard.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.080
 - Oh, that was just me and Anna arguing over

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.560
 which was better, the Dwarf Jack or the QWERTY.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.640
 - Gosh, I don't remember that.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.480
 - Sorry, it's--

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.800
 - I'd like that you have to remind me which side I was on

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.960
 to make sure that I argue the right side again.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.000
 - Actually, I do remember an argument you two had,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 James and Anna, over whether the best way to cut tomatoes

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.040
 was with a normal knife or a bread knife.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.520
 - Don't get us started.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.600
 - Oh my God.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.080
 - I can't remember who was on which side.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.880
 - So let me just say, I have adjudicated,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.040
 the best way to cut tomatoes is with a bread knife.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.000
 I don't know whose side I've taken there.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.680
 I've taken Anna's side, there we go.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.520
 - And therefore, the logical conclusion

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.960
 of your argument is that we do not need knives

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.520
 to have tips because you'd never use them.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.600
 James uses the tip to stab his tomato

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.400
 with a serrated knife.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.520
 - I have extremely sharp knives in my house,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.240
 so I don't need a bread knife.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.000
 - But that means you also don't need the tip to stab it.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.840
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.040
 - What about your bread with just a normal knife?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.440
 - I buy pre-sliced bread.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.880
 - That's an even better idea.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.200
 - Best idea since.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.960
 - It does get pretty intense when you three lock horns

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.600
 in whatever combination.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.560
 It never happens with me because I'm like never lump bottom.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.800
 I'm just like, I blow myself up

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.000
 when I'm trying to cast a spell,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.080
 but you guys are like Dumbledore and Voldemort.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.600
 You've got power.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.920
 - I must admit, of all of those arguments,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.040
 I hadn't remembered what side I was on for any of that.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.960
 - I don't like the reminder me of the tip thing,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.200
 which I do remember now.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.360
 - Oh yeah, I still got resentment about the knife issue.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.520
 - All right, let's go on.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.160
 Sam Funk writes.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.080
 "My question is potentially some sort of meat."

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.920
 Or whatever you call the inside baseball questions

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.760
 that he says.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.600
 Do you remember that spicy?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.440
 - Spicy meat.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.760
 - We should get a little sting made.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.120
 That's a good idea.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.080
 - Spicy meat, yeah.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.920
 - All right, anyway.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.760
 - I thought you just used that.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.880
 - Yeah, just used that.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.200
 - Maybe if you're listening at home,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.880
 you can take that little bit of audio

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.800
 that Andy said, spicy meat,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.680
 and then make something amazing.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.440
 - Oh yeah, I'll do a clean version now.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.640
 Hang on, I didn't get it right the last time.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.880
 Spicy meat.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.720
 There we go.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.200
 - There's someone that's using that to their sex soundtrack.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.040
 - No.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.880
 - Who is to come now.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.720
 - Soundtrack.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.560
 - And there's nothing you can do.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.600
 - A whole soundtrack, like to a film or something.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.600
 - Yeah, you'll see a couple of soundtracks

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.440
 to get through.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.280
 - You just need a single.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.360
 You just need one of the old two and a half minute

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.360
 radio edit single 45s.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.440
 - Okay.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.800
 It's like all the meat that Sam brings to the table

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.280
 is actually very vanilla meat, I would say.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.520
 - Terrible flavor for meat.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.480
 - Do you do the episodes regularly in a weekly schedule?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.560
 Yes, we do.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.640
 How long do you take to research other people's facts?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.040
 - I didn't assign up to this interview.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.880
 What's this one?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.800
 This is the top 1%.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800
 (laughing)

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.760
 - I'll be honest.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.440
 It was partly just, I love the name Sam Funk.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.080
 That is a way of getting a good, you know.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.920
 - Yeah, it is.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.960
 It's an easy way, isn't it?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.800
 It's an easy way.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.120
 - About a day for the full four facts.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.400
 Do you have a more chaotic approach

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.280
 where sometimes it's weekly

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.680
 and sometimes it's several in bulk in quick succession?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.520
 - Not usually.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.240
 - Touring is bulk.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.400
 James will always have pre-researched the entire tour.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.400
 I think Andy, you get to like either 100%

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.120
 or 90% in previous ones.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.960
 You and me were on the fly.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.320
 - Me and Dan until a minute before we go on stage.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
 Anyway, hope that helps, Sam.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.840
 Lucas Trevino writes,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.400
 "As a Michigander," didn't know that was the name.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.600
 - No, nice.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.800
 - "Your discussion of isolated US highways

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.440
 reminded me of a Michigan fact.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.200
 There is a Michigan State Highway M185

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.200
 that no cars are allowed on."

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.080
 - Oh, is it a riddle me this?

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.920
 - It's a riddle me this.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.760
 - Okay.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.920
 - Is it technically like a path

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.400
 that goes through the Lake Michigan?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.800
 - Nice, you're thinking creatively.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.640
 - Like a fish highway.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.120
 - Is it one of those, yeah, animal roads?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.360
 - No, that's good, though.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.200
 That's very good.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.080
 - Is it something that has been called a road

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.120
 but actually isn't really a road?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.440
 - You're getting close.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.160
 - Is it, are the vehicles allowed on it?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.560
 Is it like a bicycle thing or is it like no vehicles go on it?

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.040
 It's not that kind of highway.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.880
 - Okay, I'm gonna tell you

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.160
 'cause you've basically got it.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.120
 It circles Mackinac Island.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.960
 - Oh, yeah.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.560
 - Which very few cars are allowed on at all,

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.040
 except VP Mike Pence a few years back.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.880
 Everyone gets around by bike or horse.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.880
 So in general, unless you're the Vice President,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.720
 no cars are allowed.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.120
 - Okay, nice.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.960
 - Good riddle.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.800
 - Yeah, that was cool.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.120
 - Erin Thomas writes,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.240
 "I've been listening to old episodes."

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.920
 - Can I just say this is gonna be a great one

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.400
 because it's a relatively normal name.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.240
 So presumably, I think the Connie may selection.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.160
 - You never know.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.440
 I might pick a bad email with a normal name.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.920
 - This is a little history corner.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.200
 Fishery corner.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.280
 Old fish is what this new section is called.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.520
 - Do this thing.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.280
 - Old fish.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.280
 Sort of an old timey, you know.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.680
 Maybe some lute music on that.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.880
 - I think like ♪ Diddle it in ♪

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.720
 ♪ Diddle it in ♪

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.560
 ♪ Did it ♪

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.400
 ♪ Did it ♪

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.240
 ♪ Did it ♪

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.720
 ♪ Old fish ♪

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.560
 - That's good.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.440
 I've been listening to old episodes of the Fish podcast

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.040
 and I'm currently at episode 167

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.200
 when we were all in short trousers.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.920
 This is a long time ago.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.880
 - James just said,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.720
 I'm so sorry, James,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.920
 to pick up on this seven years after it went out.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.760
 - That's fine.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.760
 - That you can no longer get "I can't believe it's not butter"

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.240
 because they have changed the name.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.280
 However, I live in Winnipeg, Canada

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.600
 and I literally have a container of

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.800
 "I can't believe it's not butter" in my fridge.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.920
 - I can't believe it's "I can't believe that it's not butter".

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.760
 - How old is it, though?

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.600
 - Yeah.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.680
 - It expired in 1999.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.520
 - That's true.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.360
 - That's true.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.200
 - This is a woman writing in about an episode

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.040
 from seven years ago.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.760
 So we know she craves old things.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.720
 - So it could be a very aged container.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.440
 - I feel glad to have to know that

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.160
 because obviously it appears

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.040
 that it's available in Canada,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.280
 although it's certainly not available in the UK.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.200
 - That's fair.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.680
 - But that's a good bit of knowledge.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.520
 I'm happy.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.960
 - And it was available here?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960
 - It was, yeah.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.800
 - Used to be.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.160
 But it's like how in Malta they still have a mother care.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.000
 - Yes.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.820
 - We just don't have one here.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.160
 I think they've got an early learning centre as well.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.800
 - I think they've got British home styles as well.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.040
 They've got a lot of old school stuff.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.880
 - They do.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.920
 - Well, it must be like going back in time.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.920
 - It really is.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.920
 - That's awesome.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.760
 - Yeah.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.200
 - Wendy Mabbott writes,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.160
 "I have just listened to your latest podcast.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.800
 "I am a knitter and know that there are several companies

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.880
 "available online and I have seen adverts for

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.100
 "in my knitting magazines that will take your pet hair

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.480
 "and use it to make yarn."

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.320
 - Okay.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.160
 - That's good.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.100
 - The yarn is called, I love this,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.880
 Chiangora, which is French for dog.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.560
 Chiangora, like Angora.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.560
 You can then use the yarn with any knitting pattern

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.520
 of the same yarn weight.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.800
 You don't need to be an artist to do it.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.760
 - I think they even, there's an old QI fact,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.120
 which is that they bred dogs specifically for

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.280
 shearing and making stuff out of them.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.440
 - I was gonna say, we've got a book behind us somewhere

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.720
 here in the QI library, which is a book that shows you

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.040
 how to knit out of your pet's fur.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.880
 - Yeah.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.920
 - It's like a picture of you with the dog

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.760
 and then the dog's hair.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.600
 - Knitting the dog hair.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.480
 - Yeah, knitting which was published by John Metchanson,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.600
 formerly QI sort of co-founder.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.440
 - Yeah.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.280
 - He published that.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.480
 - I think that it won the award for weir this title.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480
 - Yes, you're right.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.320
 - Amazing.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.420
 - You're absolutely right.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.400
 Lucy Malcolm.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.320
 - Yeah.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.320
 - Says, she thinks this is spicy meat,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.800
 but she's not certain.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.240
 While Anna was on maternity leave,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.920
 every episode had Dan, Andy and James with one guest.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.720
 Did that mean none of them had any time off

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.800
 for the whole of Anna's mat leave?

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.640
 - Yeah.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.480
 - She has-

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.320
 - Largely true.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.280
 - I hope this doesn't lead to resentment,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.160
 souring relations and eventual breakup.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.000
 - Yeah.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.760
 - No, we just ended up occasionally did a couple of week,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.600
 I think, to make up for that.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.640
 - Yeah, we did Soho Theater,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.320
 which had this crammed in a couple of weeks.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.160
 - But interestingly,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.440
 I think we were all three of us were on every episode,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.280
 I think.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.100
 - I think so.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.940
 - You must have been.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.780
 - She has a follow-up.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.160
 Has there ever been an episode that hasn't had three

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.000
 of the four main fish on?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.840
 - Yes.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.680
 - Three?

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.500
 - Oh, it was two, sorry.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.340
 Sorry.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.180
 - No, there hasn't been.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.320
 So the fewest of the four of us on was an episode

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.160
 with me, Dan, Greg Jenner and Alex Heddleman.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.000
 - Yes.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.840
 - Although Anna-

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.860
 - And there was one with me, Dan, Piz and Justin.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.680
 - Yeah.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.360
 - Or me and one of you and Piz and Justin.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.200
 - I don't remember.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.440
 - I think Anna was a fact-checker in that Greg Jenner show.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.920
 So you were kind of on the show.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.760
 - Interesting.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.800
 - Oh my goodness.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.560
 James, I think there were times in the very early days,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.280
 says Lucy, where there were at least three of you,

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.920
 but one of you in the fact-checker role,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.400
 rather the main fact-deliverer.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.880
 - I remember we used to have a fact-checker.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.840
 - Yeah.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.920
 Whatever happened to them?

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.600
 Well, we get everything right these days,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.440
 at first, don't we?

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.240
 - She says, I've been mulling this question for a while

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.440
 and then listened to the recent episode

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.160
 where Dan was stuck on a train.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.080
 Seemed an app time to actually ask it.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.880
 - Well, that was the first episode where it was

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.880
 literally three of you.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.720
 - That was crazy.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.520
 - Did you get lots of people writing and saying

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.480
 it was better with three of us?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.320
 - Yeah, it doesn't.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.160
 It doesn't have people writing.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.380
 - I got a lot of DMs about it.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.740
 (laughing)

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.580
 - No, we didn't actually.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.420
 We didn't get much.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.260
 - Good.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.520
 - There was almost no response either way.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.480
 - Didn't notice.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.160
 - Okay, here's Mick Bremner.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.000
 Dan.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.840
 - Yeah?

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.680
 - writes Mick.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.160
 "Fishing chips are still wrapped up in newspaper.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.960
 It's just that it's never been used or printed on."

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.080
 - What?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.120
 - I know, this is nuts.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.440
 I used to work for a company who supplied chip shops

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.240
 with sundries.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.440
 The 12.5 kilo packs of paper are called white news.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.280
 - That's great.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.520
 - So it's literally the same paper.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.680
 - That's fantastic.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.240
 - That's really good, 'cause it is actually,

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.760
 when you get it, it's that exact--

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.600
 - Crinkly.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.760
 - I always thought it was just grease-proof paper.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.600
 How is that?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.440
 - It's not as crunchy as grease-proof, is it?

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.280
 It's newspaper.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.120
 - That's really interesting.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.960
 - Very cool.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.000
 - On a no-news day.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.760
 (laughing)

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.040
 - So thank you, Mick.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.360
 - That's a really good fact.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.760
 - Yeah, it's a really, a very--

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.560
 - Is it printed by the same company

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.440
 that prints newspapers then?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.200
 Do you think there's a newspaper printing company

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.120
 that prints a load of news

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.280
 and then prints loads of blank ones?

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.880
 - Put it through the printing.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.840
 They just put on like a 1000 page word document

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.720
 with nothing on it and they just print it.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.360
 - Oh, no, I've left the header and footer in.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.080
 It's got page numbers.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.440
 (laughing)

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.800
 - That's great, thank you, Mick.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800
 - Jill Kendall.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.640
 First of all, I just want to say I'm a huge fan

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.840
 and I listen to the show all the time.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.440
 As a fan of the show, I'm sure you will find it

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.720
 not at all as surprising that I am a bit of a pedant.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.000
 I was listening to the June 6th show,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.720
 no such thing as the SS Enterprise,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.240
 and it came up that Microsoft interviews

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.760
 would include such questions as,

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.960
 "Why are manhole covers round?"

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.680
 This may have been a type of question asked at one time,

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.040
 but it isn't anymore.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.280
 My expertise is that I've worked in tech in Seattle

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.000
 since 2008.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.280
 I've done hundreds of interviews,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.240
 both as the interviewer and the interviewee.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.520
 I have never worked at Microsoft,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.920
 but I have interviewed there twice.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.360
 My husband also has worked in tech in Seattle since 2010.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.080
 Neither of us have ever been asked a brain teaser question

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.480
 or asked one.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.400
 The reason is that it really doesn't help us determine

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.640
 if a candidate will be good at software engineering.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.400
 (laughing)

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.880
 - Because you go into Microsoft, of course,

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.960
 into the coding room and they're all just there

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.520
 with their manhole covers.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.200
 'Cause Jeremy Corbin, of course,

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.320
 is a big fan of manhole covers.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.280
 He knows everything about manhole covers.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.560
 - And he's got a big job at Microsoft now, hasn't he?

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.920
 (laughing)

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.640
 - He's following Nick Clegg to Facebook,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.960
 called me good to Microsoft.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.040
 That's great.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.000
 So what's being suggested here, that it's all fake?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.480
 - Maybe if old mate had got around

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.440
 to the second round of interviews at Microsoft.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.280
 (laughing)

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.640
 That's one of these questions.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.800
 - I feel like it's something that happened

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.040
 in the very, very early days of Seattle Tech

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.480
 and probably hasn't happened for 20, 30 years.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.320
 - Yeah.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.160
 - You've definitely gone out of favor

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.680
 of that style of question now, I think,

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.800
 because it's quite, I think it's seen as quite elitist

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.320
 because maybe I think it favors

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.040
 your more confident public school.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.080
 I feel like I've read something along these lines.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.440
 And also it's kind of bollocks that it tells you

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.600
 anything useful that you need to know

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.800
 about someone for a job.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800
 - Throw this brick through this window.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.920
 You know that one?

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.760
 - No.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.000
 - And then see if they open the window.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.840
 - That's right.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.840
 The idiot candidate throws the brick through the window.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.920
 The coward candidate doesn't.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.920
 The successful candidate opens the window

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.520
 and then throws the brick through it.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.760
 - And they get sued by the person who hits.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.440
 - Praying a passerby, yeah.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.400
 - Has someone told you to get a brick into that room?

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.240
 - No, no.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.360
 For the last question in the interview,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.760
 when you've aced it so far,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.760
 they whip a cloth off the table beneath it,

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.600
 a common brick, and they say,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.280
 "Throw this brick through that window there, please."

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.600
 As your final test.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.120
 And then they see if you open the window.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.960
 - I see.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.640
 How many windows do you think had to be repaired?

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.040
 It's just, I want to get sorry,

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.600
 the interviewers have been held up.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.760
 - I just, we just got to call the.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.840
 - Yeah, we've got 20 people to go through

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.400
 for the end of the day.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.280
 - I just threw it through mine directly

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.400
 at the guy's computer 'cause we were at Microsoft

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.920
 and when he said, "Throw it at windows."

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.760
 - There you go.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.600
 You got the job.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.440
 - Lovely.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.680
 - So yeah, I sort of felt like when I said it,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.960
 it was like this is a thing that has happened

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960
 as opposed to like a current,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.960
 I don't even think I thought it was a current day thing.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.360
 - No, I don't know.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.200
 - There we go.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.040
 - It might not have ever happened.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.240
 It might be just the kind of thing

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.680
 that they make up, but I don't know.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.120
 - I'm glad if it doesn't happen because all that stuff,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.640
 you know that there's you would hear about people saying

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.120
 they get all the CVs on the table

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.720
 and they would take the top 20 and chuck them on the floor

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.040
 and say, "I don't employ unlucky people."

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040
 Like that kind of shit.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.880
 I'm not into that.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.200
 - I actually always liked the idea of the brain teasers

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.000
 'cause I think really it's one of my strengths

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.440
 is answering brain teasers.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.280
 - Oh yeah.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.920
 - And probably my weaknesses is everything else in life.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.280
 (laughing)

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.720
 In a meeting, I think that would be good for me.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.960
 - So they're like, "So Mr. Harkin,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.520
 "we've got this new code that's coming."

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.080
 And you're like, "Well, actually, before you get to that."

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:21.920
 (laughing)

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.720
 - A diver is found up a tree.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.980
 (laughing)

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.400
 - Oh, that's great.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.400
 We've got a few amazing names.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.740
 - Cool.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.480
 - Is this another like amazing name, shit emails?

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.120
 Is this part of that section?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.280
 - The other thing, amazing name, shitty email.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.200
 - There you go, you have that one, that's great.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.560
 Ian Not, quite a good name.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.280
 - It's a relatively normal name.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.000
 - Right, is that the tone?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.880
 - It's with a K and two T's, so like double knotted.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.640
 - My old game's teacher was a Mr. Not.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.960
 - Maybe some relation.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.840
 - Could be, he was brilliant, game's teacher.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.520
 - There we go, Ian Not writes.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.160
 - Has James kept up his practice?

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.920
 (laughing)

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.560
 - It's just a link to someone in New Zealand

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560
 who works with penguins.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.800
 And she has a double barreled last name.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.760
 - He was married to someone from New Zealand, Mr. Not.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.600
 - Oh, really?

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.440
 - Yeah.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.280
 - This is not.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.040
 (laughing)

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.960
 - Ian writes, just stumbled across this

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.800
 and I'm still blown away.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.920
 This woman works with penguins

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.720
 and her double barreled last name contains not one,

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.040
 but two birds.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.880
 - Yep.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.240
 - And she's called Geraldine Gillimott, peacock.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.080
 - Whoa.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.920
 - That's incredible name.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.760
 - She works with penguins.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.600
 - That's quite fantastic.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.600
 - Gillimott is a very unusual surname.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.440
 - I'll say.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.360
 - Yeah.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.880
 - Also, we've got Laura McCarthy who writes,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.920
 I've just found out there's a very talented musician,

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.480
 the keyboardist and musical director

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.240
 of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour,

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.240
 who's called Karina De Piano.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.560
 (laughing)

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.640
 - Good name.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.560
 - De Piano.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.400
 - De Piano.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.240
 - That's a real surname.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.080
 - Yep.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.900
 - Wow.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.120
 - De Piano.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.160
 And finally, I'm writing to submit myself

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.400
 for an honorable mention in Andy's list of names

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.480
 that are sentences.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.680
 I say honorable mention because I am not a sentence

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.240
 but a present perfect continuous tense verb.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.080
 - Okay.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.160
 - And that is from Ben Cumming.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.960
 (laughing)

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.800
 Childish.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.320
 - That's very funny.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.200
 - I just read yesterday that the law

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.840
 that was repealed in the 1950s, I think,

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.040
 against interracial marriage in America was,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.000
 it was the court case,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.520
 was loving versus the state of Virginia.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.360
 Is that nice?

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.200
 - That's great.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.200
 - 'Cause there was a couple, the loving couple,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.920
 Mr. Loving married Mrs. Loving.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.760
 - Brilliant.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.920
 - And loving couple.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.040
 - Loving beat Virginia.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.000
 - That's really good.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.840
 - That's a great fact.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.920
 - Isn't that nice?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.960
 - We should write in, Anna.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.800
 - Yeah.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.000
 (laughing)

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.200
 - That's a really good fact.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.920
 - I've seen his filtration system

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.320
 and it's not making it through.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.160
 (laughing)

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.720
 - We have had a lot of emails from people

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.760
 who can write, hand write,

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.040
 because we did handwriting recently.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.040
 - Yes, that's right.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.000
 - So--

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.520
 - Yeah, well they say they can hand write

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520
 but they've sent you an email.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.360
 (laughing)

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.200
 - That's true.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.080
 Leah Denman from Oakland, California

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.000
 has dear fish team and Andy specifically reading this first.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.840
 - Thank you.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.880
 - You discuss professions with specific handwriting styles.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.240
 In the USA, all architects and civil engineers

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.900
 typically have a boxy, all caps writing style.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.720
 And Leah studied architecture.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.360
 And I was in the last class to be required

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.800
 to learn a standard writing style

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.900
 for drafting plans using graph paper.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.720
 So there is a specific--

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.000
 - Oh, so because you're writing in graph paper,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.320
 'cause you're putting, drawing your houses

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.640
 or whatever architects do,

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.440
 you tend to put a letter in each box.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.280
 - Exactly that.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.120
 - And how interesting.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120
 - And she says I currently work

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.360
 in the home building industry

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.080
 and there's a clear divide of handwriting styles

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.840
 between generations who were taught to draw plans

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.760
 on paper versus computers.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.600
 - Mm.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.440
 - They're nuts.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.280
 - Yeah.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.120
 - Interesting.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.960
 - She adds also there's given me a chance

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.840
 to segue into a thanks but no thanks.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.120
 For the fish email inbox,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.640
 is there a reason you don't call it the fin box?

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.880
 No, actually.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.720
 - She doesn't come up with anything

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.720
 that clever at this time.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.800
 - Oh, that clever, yeah.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.600
 (laughing)

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.160
 We did that thing ages ago about Meghan Markle

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.320
 before she was princess.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.240
 She was a cursive hand writer for wedding invitations

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.440
 and she did Robin Thickey's wedding.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.200
 (laughing)

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.360
 - Right, just remember that.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.480
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.680
 - You used to write on graph paper

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.360
 when you remember when you learned to write

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.400
 and but you weren't good enough

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.080
 to be left to write freestyle on a line

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.480
 and you wrote on graph paper.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.320
 Do you remember that?

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.160
 - I don't remember that.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.000
 - We never did that.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.840
 - Maybe you guys didn't do it.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.880
 - But you can surely lined paper does the trick.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.000
 As in, what are the vertical lines for that?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.960
 - Just to make the size 'cause little squares are smaller.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.840
 So technically like the round bit of a B

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.320
 I think would be in one square.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.160
 - One square.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.840
 - That's clever.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.680
 - That was very neat.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.280
 And then you get on line paper and it's just chaos.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.280
 - Well, while we're on inadequate educational methods,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.600
 let's turn to Martha Everett.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.720
 (laughing)

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.720
 She says, "I've just been listening

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.520
 "to the latest episode in which Anna said,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.920
 "we were all taught a script.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.480
 "This is not quite true.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.000
 "In primary school, my brother and I

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.160
 "were part of an experiment called emergent writing

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.400
 "in which children were basically just not taught cursive

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.040
 "but left to develop our own."

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.520
 - Okay, so you see the letters printed I suppose

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.800
 and then you just mimic them however you think is right.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.640
 - That's interesting.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.480
 - Interesting, yeah.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.320
 - She says--

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.160
 - She's now a literate.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.200
 - Well, she says, "I only discovered this as an adult

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.360
 "when my mum told me and I was furious.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.600
 "I only printed for ages

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.440
 "and I've always had terrible writing.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.320
 "And as an adult, I spent a few years laboriously

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.440
 "teaching myself cursive from the internet."

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.240
 - Oh, from the internet.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.080
 - Yeah.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.920
 - Oh my God.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.640
 - And now I write and wing big.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.920
 (all laughing)

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.520
 - The email came in in comic sans.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.520
 On the one hand, the British education system

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.280
 has failed me, on the other, such an optimist,

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.800
 I got to design my own bespoke handwriting.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.640
 - Well, in a way, it is, I mean,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.360
 obviously it's an experiment on children.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.200
 - Yep.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.600
 - And it's not done well for them in later life

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.760
 but we have learned from it.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.840
 And no result is still a good result, isn't it?

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.240
 - Just so, yeah, she says that she finishes

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.440
 her email, James, exactly like that.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.080
 The system was abandoned in the late 80s

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.520
 as it was discovered after years of testing this method

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.040
 that not teaching children something

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.080
 means they don't learn it.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.560
 (all laughing)

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.920
 - That is, like, yeah?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.880
 - Children are idiots, conclusion.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.280
 - I mean, gosh, yeah.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.360
 And then can I tell you one more on this?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.320
 - Yeah. - Last one.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.320
 - Last one on this.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.800
 Eva Hafner, I'm ambidextrous, she says.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.640
 - Show off.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.840
 - And I've been writing with my left hand

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.200
 but since childhood I've taught myself

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.000
 to write with my right hand purely

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.920
 for the purpose of having a second set of handwriting

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.000
 to forge my parents' notes for school.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.760
 - Right. - That's clever.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.600
 - Interesting.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.480
 - I used to write left handed as well, actually.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.440
 - Did you? - Sometimes, yeah.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.680
 I taught myself at uni

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.200
 just 'cause I used to get a tired hand

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.680
 so I would swap.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.520
 - Get away.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.520
 - No, I did and 'cause I taught myself

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.040
 and I had a lot of time 'cause I was at uni

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.840
 so it was quite reasonably good

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.880
 but it would always slant

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.440
 in exactly the opposite direction.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.800
 - Wow. - So can you still, like,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.640
 'cause I would be able to begin?

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.840
 - No, I don't think so. - Really?

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.760
 - Yeah, it was probably for a couple of years

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.080
 I could do it relatively well

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.040
 and then once I stopped practicing I just lost it.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.880
 - Gosh. - Wow.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.240
 - Could you ever do mirror writing?

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.720
 - No. - My mum can do mirror writing.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.560
 It's very cool. - Yeah, really.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.400
 - That's really cool. - Where you write

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.240
 with one hand and the other at the same time

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.560
 a reverse image.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.080
 - Oh, I didn't know that was what meant.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.120
 I thought you just meant writing in,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.160
 you know, some kids naturally do mirror writing

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.280
 when they're learning to write.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.360
 They do letters backwards

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.520
 but she does it at the same time as writing forwards.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.560
 Yeah, that's incredible.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.760
 - Do you remember when I went to,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.600
 did I tell you as this?

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.720
 When I went to the British Museum

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.600
 and I saw the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.440
 - Oh, yeah.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.120
 - And so I was looking at him for ages

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.440
 and I was like, oh man, I can't,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.760
 I realized why I can't read these.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.880
 He wrote in mirror writing.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.720
 He always wrote backwards.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.360
 No wonder I can't understand.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.280
 Failing to remember that it wasn't in English anyway.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.640
 (laughing)

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.720
 But that to me was like, oh yeah,

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.080
 that's why I'm not getting this covered.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.000
 - That's funny.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.800
 - There was a president who could write.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.640
 - Yeah, James Garfield.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.960
 - Garfield in Latin with both hands at the same time.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.360
 - Latin with one and Greek with the other.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.040
 - That's so impressive.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.520
 Eva goes on, she's just a little bit more detail.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.640
 So she has completely different

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.760
 left and right handwriting styles, right?

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.400
 And she's sent some samples.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.120
 She adds, for science, I also deep throated a pen

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.160
 to send you a sample of my mouth writing.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.520
 - Okay.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.440
 Okay, so we said that your handwriting,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.840
 if you put a pen in your mouth and write it,

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.840
 it will be similar to your actual handwriting.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.400
 So that's why she's referencing here.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.240
 - I've forgotten that.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.800
 (laughing)

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.280
 - 'Cause she can write with both hands

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.600
 at the same time, from right to left.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.440
 - That's great.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.400
 - Ella Da Vinci, exactly.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.280
 And if she repeats this writing a hundred times,

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.840
 all these handwriting will be distinct and consistent,

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.840
 except the mouth writing,

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840
 I've never tried this before

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.080
 and I don't want to repeat it either.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.480
 - Couldn't she have just used one of those

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.680
 small election pencils

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.360
 rather than taking a full pen to the throat?

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.200
 (laughing)

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.040
 - I think, yes.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.480
 - Was it one of those giant pencils

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.440
 you get from Blackpool?

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.720
 (laughing)

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.560
 - Two more.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.480
 Mark Lipsky writes,

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.920
 "I was listening to episode 527

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.960
 "where you mentioned someone with the surname POOSE

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.640
 "and it reminded me of my own experience

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.480
 "with the surname, with the surname..."

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.320
 (laughing)

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.480
 - I had a POOSE on it.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.800
 (laughing)

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.480
 - Here's a photo, you're sincerely Mark.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.240
 (laughing)

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.400
 - Mark says, "I'm a classical musician, brackets.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.040
 "It was a struggle to keep my peace during bassoon gate."

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.280
 (laughing)

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.760
 - Often, when I'm playing with a particular orchestra

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.080
 for the first time, I don't know everyone.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.960
 There could be 90 people in the ensemble.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.880
 Once when we were waiting to go on stage

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.240
 a few minutes before the concert began,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.880
 I was idly reading the playlist

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.360
 and came across the name Henrietta POOSE.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.560
 I found it so funny that I completely coerced

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.760
 and struggled to stop laughing

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.440
 as I was going on stage.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.240
 - Mark continues, "Several years later,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.560
 "I was walking in a park

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.720
 "and noticed that a park bench

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.200
 "had a little memorial plaque on it

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.440
 "and it was dedicated to a Mr. Henry Pease."

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.280
 - That's very good.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.400
 - Oh, nice if they married with him.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.160
 - "I immediately thought that Mr. Pease

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.120
 "and Ms. POOSE absolutely need to get married

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.560
 "and double barrel their surnames,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.080
 "except of course that Henry Pease is dead."

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.840
 (laughing)

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.920
 - Okay. - Great email.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.080
 - Yeah, very good.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.080
 - Henry and Henrietta as well, Henrietta POOSE.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.200
 - Yeah, I feel like that's part of the nice coincidence.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.200
 Wouldn't it be cool, it's such a shame

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.440
 that you know the room about the brown note

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.040
 that would always bounce round,

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.240
 that there's a note you can play

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.720
 that makes people shit themselves.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.280
 - It's such a shame that's not real

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.200
 'cause if you were in an orchestra with Henrietta POOSE,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.800
 you would plot one day before she arrives,

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.960
 you'd be like, "When she walks in, let's all do it."

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.680
 (laughing)

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.600
 And it would be the best moment of your life.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.680
 - True, true, true.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.320
 - Unfortunately, the thing with the brown note

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.640
 is it makes everyone poo.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.480
 - Yeah. (laughing)

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.440
 - You can't just direct it straight at Henrietta,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.240
 so there would be a bit of a...

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.200
 - The audience is coming in 10 minutes.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.400
 What were you thinking?

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.240
 (laughing)

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.360
 - We don't have that many new pairs of black trousers.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.120
 Right, everyone's just gonna do the whole gig,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.040
 no trousers, all right?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.280
 (laughing)

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.400
 - All right, one last one.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.200
 - Yeah. - It's from Matt Duffin.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.520
 I saw Andrew wandering through the streets of Soho today

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.520
 and was, didn't he look handsome?

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.360
 (laughing)

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.440
 He was also carrying lots of copies of his book,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.640
 which I must say I've read and is a really great read.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.160
 - It's okay, James, I told you to stay out of the inbox.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.360
 (laughing)

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.620
 Sorry, fin box.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.320
 No, it's just, I saw Andrew wandering

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.560
 through the streets of Soho today

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.480
 and was very impressed by the volume of his whistle.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.560
 (laughing)

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.520
 - That's disgusting.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.640
 (laughing)

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.600
 Why were you doing that?

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.920
 Well, you read so well, I guess.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.920
 - I remember walking through Soho whistling jointly.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.480
 - What do you whistle?

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.920
 - At the moment, tequila.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.400
 I was whistling tequila the other day.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.320
 - Tequila. - By television.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.880
 - That's a tough tune. - I know the old one.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.720
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.080
 - Trust me, we're all just fan-sing it.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.960
 - Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.120
 - It reminded me of a fun fact.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.120
 There's a town in South Carolina

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.400
 where it's illegal to whistle after 11 p.m.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.080
 - Is it, though? - Is it?

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:03.920
 Maybe.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.000
 Maybe. - It'd be.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.280
 - Anyway, just, just nice, you know,

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.240
 let us know if you spot us around.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.560
 - Well done, you whistle.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.320
 - I'm available for whistling gigs, I'm sorry,

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.160
 I'm trying to set up. - Are you sure

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.200
 you didn't see a sexy woman from the 1970s

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.360
 and that's why you're whistling?

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.440
 (all laugh)

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.440
 - You saw Jessica Rabbit walk past.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.800
 - Yeah, but just so you know, that's nice, thank you.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.080
 - I didn't know you did that, that's--

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.920
 - What, whistle? - Yeah.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.240
 - I whistle a lot.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.320
 - I've never heard you whistle.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.400
 - I'm the only one on the street normally whistling

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.680
 and it's a bit annoying to other people around me, I think.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.480
 'Cause I do whistle quite loud.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.600
 And if you're walking, if you're keeping pace with--

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.320
 - Not that loud, not like a dinner lady.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.280
 Not like he's--

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.520
 - No, not like summoning a taxi, you know.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.880
 I can do that, I bet you can do that, Anna.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.600
 I bet you can do the fingers in your mouth.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.160
 - Oh, I tried for years.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.880
 I just, no, it's too breathy.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.440
 But I don't think it's annoying if you walk past it.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.400
 I think it's annoying to be in a house with a whistler,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.360
 which I--

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.480
 - Yes, or someone who goes, "Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom."

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.320
 (all laugh)

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.160
 - Who was that? - Who was that?

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.240
 (all laugh)

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.720
 - Or someone you're living with to be.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.560
 (all laugh)

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.600
 - Sometimes, for example, sometimes at a classical concert,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.360
 you might end up next to someone who--

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.440
 - Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.920
 - Really? - Who sort of does a bit

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.000
 of the music for himself, normally himself, I must say.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.320
 - Did I have sheet music to help them?

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.080
 (all laugh)

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.600
 - Have you actually sat in the orchestra?

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.960
 (all laugh)

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.200
 - So rude, this guy next to me had a bassoon

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.960
 he was playing throughout the concert.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.920
 - And no pants.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.320
 (all laugh)

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.560
 - Perfect.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.400
 Bye.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.980
 (upbeat music)

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:46.320
 Please send more emails to podcast@qi.com

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.240
 and you have a 1% chance, we just get a lot of emails,

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.720
 you know, I wish we could do more.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.440
 I wish we could do these for longer,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.200
 but the certain, some people--

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.800
 - I think we're doing exactly the right amount.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.640
 - That's the right amount, I'm sorry.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.200
 - Three people, think they go on a bit too long as it is.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.360
 (all laugh)

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.640
 Anyway, but thank you for listening

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.040
 and please do send us an email, please.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.880
 Okay, bye.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.320
 - Bye. - Bye.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.440
 - Bye.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.920
 - All right, nice. - Yeah.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.500
 (upbeat music)

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:26.500
