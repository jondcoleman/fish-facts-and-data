00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 (phone rings)

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,920
 (speaking foreign language)

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,500
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,820
 - Hi, good day, mate.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,660
 - Hello, Andy.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,600
 - Hi, everybody.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,680
 - We've been in this room for, what, three hours now?

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,520
 - Yeah.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,360
 - And you're only just saying hi?

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,200
 - Yeah, that's right.

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,200
 (laughing)

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,480
 - Welcome, everybody, to Drop As Align,

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,280
 our audience feedback show.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,220
 You've been sending in lots of emails,

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,520
 and we're gonna read out probably 1% of them now,

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,760
 but the best 1%.

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,840
 - If you've sent one in that hasn't been read today,

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,720
 don't lose hope.

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,840
 - No, but do buck your ideas up.

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,680
 - Yeah.

21
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,960
 - Andy did not like them.

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,680
 (laughing)

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,960
 - No, I should say, often we read out emails

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,000
 and they get onto the show,

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,040
 but often we read out emails

26
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,760
 and we don't have anything funny to say about them.

27
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,560
 We just appreciate them, cut them in the edit and move on.

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,200
 So if you haven't had your email read out on Drop As Align,

29
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,960
 it's probable that it's so good, but we failed.

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,160
 - Are we gonna have a compilation outtake show

31
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,280
 of letters that didn't make Jules?

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,480
 - Because they're a good email

33
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,600
 followed by us being not at all funny,

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,920
 yeah, for like 30 to 40 seconds, and then we, yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,200
 - So it's just you, we're not in it, it's just you.

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,760
 (laughing)

37
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,920
 - Here is an idea for bonus content stuffs,

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,760
 You lot play and commentate on playing board and card games.

40
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,600
 He says, "It would be hilarious and very fascinating

41
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,080
 "to hear an ongoing live commentary

42
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,120
 "on various games being played and reviewed

43
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,960
 "through your unique prism of being elves.

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,320
 "Hope this doesn't qualify me for possibly being dull

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,440
 "for wanting this."

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,160
 Regards, Aaron, a board game fan.

47
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,960
 - I do very much question the hilarious

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,360
 and fascinating claims.

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
 (laughing)

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,760
 - So does Aaron mean a visual?

51
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,160
 Like we're on YouTube, we are watching a game

52
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,560
 being played out like a game of chess

53
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,040
 or a board game like monopoly.

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,400
 We're playing it and just talking?

55
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,560
 - Yeah.

56
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,800
 I think it sounds nice.

57
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,280
 - Night to D4.

58
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,920
 (laughing)

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,760
 - Is that it?

60
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
 - Yeah, that's it.

61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,320
 - Okay.

62
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,440
 - Maybe we'll play risk or boggle.

63
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,280
 - Right.

64
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,040
 I think after trying it, I think it could be fun actually.

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
 - Yeah.

66
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
 - Snakes and ladders.

67
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
 Something like snakes and ladders

68
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,840
 and then just get really into the strategy.

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,640
 (laughing)

70
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,520
 - Okay, thanks.

71
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,000
 - Dan's saying thanks.

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,120
 - I'm saying no thanks.

73
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
 - There we go.

74
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,800
 And Anna's saying but.

75
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,840
 - I'll go with the flow.

76
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,360
 - Okay, thank you, Aaron.

77
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
 All right, here's another one.

78
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,280
 Indy Carmichael writes,

79
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,560
 in your most recent drop as a line,

80
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,080
 a listener asked, what were your worst received facts?

81
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
 I feel you all missed the most obvious ones

82
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,000
 through the years.

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
 - Oh, God.

84
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
 - So here are our worst received facts.

85
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,680
 (laughing)

86
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,720
 - That's a great idea for you.

87
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,760
 - Here we go.

88
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,960
 So Anna says Indy.

89
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
 - Oh, wow.

90
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,920
 Thanks for kicking off with me, Indy.

91
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,560
 - An underground worker who was blasted through the earth

92
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,080
 and meters into the air

93
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,160
 by I think compressed gas of some description.

94
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,440
 No one believed her despite having a reputable source.

95
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,280
 - Yeah.

96
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,720
 - Oh, there's still one of the great moments

97
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,200
 of the podcast, that story.

98
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
 - I enjoyed that reception.

99
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
 I don't take the criticism.

100
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,760
 - Okay.

101
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,040
 Andy, who could forget the dead frog orgy debacle?

102
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,880
 I believe you may have been booed.

103
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,240
 I think I have forgotten.

104
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,840
 This was in Cardiff at the Glee Club.

105
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,160
 I remember strongly because there's a frog

106
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,320
 that has sort of necrotic or horrible orgies to breed.

107
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
 - I remember.

108
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,000
 - And it's all--

109
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,720
 - And usually you tell the stories

110
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,440
 and the audience goes with you, don't they?

111
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,280
 - They just didn't.

112
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,120
 - They really didn't.

113
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
 (laughing)

114
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,560
 - A conservative crowd, clearly on and off night.

115
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,760
 - And they hated it.

116
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,040
 They absolutely hated it.

117
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,680
 Dan, the airplane loop-de-loop guy who fell out of

118
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,160
 and landed back in his plane.

119
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,080
 - Didn't you verify that months later?

120
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,920
 - Got a great source.

121
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,760
 - You got a good source.

122
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,000
 - Got a great source for it, yeah.

123
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
 - Even though it obviously did in the house.

124
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
 - Go on.

125
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
 - James, no specific badly received fact springs

126
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,320
 to mine for James.

127
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
 - I like this guy.

128
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,400
 - Except, except, says Andy,

129
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,320
 I do remember a great deal of tension

130
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,160
 over the QWERTY keyboard.

131
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,080
 - Oh, that was just me and Anna arguing over

132
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
 which was better, the Dwarf Jack or the QWERTY.

133
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,640
 - Gosh, I don't remember that.

134
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
 - Sorry, it's--

135
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
 - I'd like that you have to remind me which side I was on

136
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,960
 to make sure that I argue the right side again.

137
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,000
 - Actually, I do remember an argument you two had,

138
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 James and Anna, over whether the best way to cut tomatoes

139
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,040
 was with a normal knife or a bread knife.

140
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,520
 - Don't get us started.

141
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,600
 - Oh my God.

142
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,080
 - I can't remember who was on which side.

143
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,880
 - So let me just say, I have adjudicated,

144
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
 the best way to cut tomatoes is with a bread knife.

145
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,000
 I don't know whose side I've taken there.

146
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,680
 I've taken Anna's side, there we go.

147
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,520
 - And therefore, the logical conclusion

148
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,960
 of your argument is that we do not need knives

149
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,520
 to have tips because you'd never use them.

150
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,600
 James uses the tip to stab his tomato

151
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,400
 with a serrated knife.

152
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
 - I have extremely sharp knives in my house,

153
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,240
 so I don't need a bread knife.

154
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,000
 - But that means you also don't need the tip to stab it.

155
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,840
 - Yeah, that's true.

156
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,040
 - What about your bread with just a normal knife?

157
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,440
 - I buy pre-sliced bread.

158
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,880
 - That's an even better idea.

159
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,200
 - Best idea since.

160
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,960
 - It does get pretty intense when you three lock horns

161
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,600
 in whatever combination.

162
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
 It never happens with me because I'm like never lump bottom.

163
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
 I'm just like, I blow myself up

164
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
 when I'm trying to cast a spell,

165
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
 but you guys are like Dumbledore and Voldemort.

166
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
 You've got power.

167
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,920
 - I must admit, of all of those arguments,

168
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,040
 I hadn't remembered what side I was on for any of that.

169
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,960
 - I don't like the reminder me of the tip thing,

170
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,200
 which I do remember now.

171
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,360
 - Oh yeah, I still got resentment about the knife issue.

172
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,520
 - All right, let's go on.

173

 Or whatever you call the inside baseball questions

176
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
 that he says.

177
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,600
 Do you remember that spicy?

178
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,440
 - Spicy meat.

179
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,760
 - We should get a little sting made.

180
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,120
 That's a good idea.

181
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,080
 - Spicy meat, yeah.

182
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
 - All right, anyway.

183
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
 - I thought you just used that.

184
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,880
 - Yeah, just used that.

185
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
 - Maybe if you're listening at home,

186
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
 you can take that little bit of audio

187
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,800
 that Andy said, spicy meat,

188
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,680
 and then make something amazing.

189
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,440
 - Oh yeah, I'll do a clean version now.

190
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,640
 Hang on, I didn't get it right the last time.

191
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,880
 Spicy meat.

192
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,720
 There we go.

193
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,200
 - There's someone that's using that to their sex soundtrack.

194
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,040
 - No.

195
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
 - Who is to come now.

196
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,720
 - Soundtrack.

197
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,560
 - And there's nothing you can do.

198
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,600
 - A whole soundtrack, like to a film or something.

199
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
 - Yeah, you'll see a couple of soundtracks

200
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,440
 to get through.

201
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,280
 - You just need a single.

202
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,360
 You just need one of the old two and a half minute

203
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
 radio edit single 45s.

204
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,440
 - Okay.

205
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,800
 It's like all the meat that Sam brings to the table

206
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,280
 is actually very vanilla meat, I would say.

207
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,520
 - Terrible flavor for meat.

208
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,480
 - Do you do the episodes regularly in a weekly schedule?

209
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,560
 Yes, we do.

210
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,640
 How long do you take to research other people's facts?

211
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,040
 - I didn't assign up to this interview.

212
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,880
 What's this one?

213
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,800
 This is the top 1%.

214
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
 (laughing)

215
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,760
 - I'll be honest.

216
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,440
 It was partly just, I love the name Sam Funk.

217
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,080
 That is a way of getting a good, you know.

218
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
 - Yeah, it is.

219
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,960
 It's an easy way, isn't it?

220
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,800
 It's an easy way.

221
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,120
 - About a day for the full four facts.

222
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,400
 Do you have a more chaotic approach

223
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,280
 where sometimes it's weekly

224
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,680
 and sometimes it's several in bulk in quick succession?

225
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,520
 - Not usually.

226
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,240
 - Touring is bulk.

227
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,400
 James will always have pre-researched the entire tour.

228
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,400
 I think Andy, you get to like either 100%

229
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,120
 or 90% in previous ones.

230
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,960
 You and me were on the fly.

231
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,320
 - Me and Dan until a minute before we go on stage.

232
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
 - Yeah, that's true.

233
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,160
 Yeah, yeah.

234
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
 Anyway, hope that helps, Sam.

235
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
 Lucas Trevino writes,

236
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,400
 "As a Michigander," didn't know that was the name.

237
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
 - No, nice.

238
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,800
 - "Your discussion of isolated US highways

239
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,440
 reminded me of a Michigan fact.

240
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,200
 There is a Michigan State Highway M185

241
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 that no cars are allowed on."

242
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,080
 - Oh, is it a riddle me this?

243
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,920
 - It's a riddle me this.

244
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
 - Okay.

245
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,920
 - Is it technically like a path

246
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,400
 that goes through the Lake Michigan?

247
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
 - Nice, you're thinking creatively.

248
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,640
 - Like a fish highway.

249
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,120
 - Is it one of those, yeah, animal roads?

250
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
 - No, that's good, though.

251
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
 That's very good.

252
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,080
 - Is it something that has been called a road

253
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,120
 but actually isn't really a road?

254
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,440
 - You're getting close.

255
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,160
 - Is it, are the vehicles allowed on it?

256
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
 Is it like a bicycle thing or is it like no vehicles go on it?

257
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,040
 It's not that kind of highway.

258
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,880
 - Okay, I'm gonna tell you

259
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,160
 'cause you've basically got it.

260
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,120
 It circles Mackinac Island.

261
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,960
 - Oh, yeah.

262
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
 - Which very few cars are allowed on at all,

263
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,040
 except VP Mike Pence a few years back.

264
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,880
 Everyone gets around by bike or horse.

265
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
 So in general, unless you're the Vice President,

266
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,720
 no cars are allowed.

267
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,120
 - Okay, nice.

268
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,960
 - Good riddle.

269
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
 - Yeah, that was cool.

270
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
 - Erin Thomas writes,

271
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,240
 "I've been listening to old episodes."

272
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,920
 - Can I just say this is gonna be a great one

273
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,400
 because it's a relatively normal name.

274
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,240
 So presumably, I think the Connie may selection.

275
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,160
 - You never know.

276
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,440
 I might pick a bad email with a normal name.

277
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,920
 - This is a little history corner.

278
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,200
 Fishery corner.

279
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,280
 Old fish is what this new section is called.

280
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,520
 - Do this thing.

281
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,280
 - Old fish.

282
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
 Sort of an old timey, you know.

283
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,680
 Maybe some lute music on that.

284
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,880
 - I think like ♪ Diddle it in ♪

285
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,720
 ♪ Diddle it in ♪

286
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
 ♪ Did it ♪

287
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,400
 ♪ Did it ♪

288
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,240
 ♪ Did it ♪

289
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
 ♪ Old fish ♪

290
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,560
 - That's good.

291
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,440
 I've been listening to old episodes of the Fish podcast

292
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,040
 and I'm currently at episode 167

293
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,200
 when we were all in short trousers.

294
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,920
 This is a long time ago.

295
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,880
 - James just said,

296
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,720
 I'm so sorry, James,

297
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
 to pick up on this seven years after it went out.

298
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,760
 - That's fine.

299
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
 - That you can no longer get "I can't believe it's not butter"

300
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,240
 because they have changed the name.

301
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,280
 However, I live in Winnipeg, Canada

302
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,600
 and I literally have a container of

303
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,800
 "I can't believe it's not butter" in my fridge.

304
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,920
 - I can't believe it's "I can't believe that it's not butter".

305
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,760
 - How old is it, though?

306
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,600
 - Yeah.

307
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,680
 - It expired in 1999.

308
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,520
 - That's true.

309
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,360
 - That's true.

310
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
 - This is a woman writing in about an episode

311
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
 from seven years ago.

312
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,760
 So we know she craves old things.

313
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,720
 - So it could be a very aged container.

314
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
 - I feel glad to have to know that

315
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,160
 because obviously it appears

316
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,040
 that it's available in Canada,

317
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,280
 although it's certainly not available in the UK.

318
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,200
 - That's fair.

319
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,680
 - But that's a good bit of knowledge.

320
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,520
 I'm happy.

321
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,960
 - And it was available here?

322
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
 - It was, yeah.

323
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
 - Used to be.

324
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,160
 But it's like how in Malta they still have a mother care.

325
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,000
 - Yes.

326
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,820
 - We just don't have one here.

327
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,160
 I think they've got an early learning centre as well.

328
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,800
 - I think they've got British home styles as well.

329
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,040
 They've got a lot of old school stuff.

331
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,880
 - They do.

332
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,920
 - Well, it must be like going back in time.

333
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
 - It really is.

334
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
 - That's awesome.

335
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,760
 - Yeah.

336
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,200
 - Wendy Mabbott writes,

337
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,160
 "I have just listened to your latest podcast.

338
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,800
 "I am a knitter and know that there are several companies

339
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,100
 "in my knitting magazines that will take your pet hair

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,480
 "and use it to make yarn."

342
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,320
 - Okay.

343
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,160
 - That's good.

344
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,100
 - The yarn is called, I love this,

345
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,880
 Chiangora, which is French for dog.

346
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,560
 Chiangora, like Angora.

347
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
 You can then use the yarn with any knitting pattern

348
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,520
 of the same yarn weight.

349
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,800
 You don't need to be an artist to do it.

350
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,760
 - I think they even, there's an old QI fact,

351
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,120
 which is that they bred dogs specifically for

352
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,280
 shearing and making stuff out of them.

353
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,440
 - I was gonna say, we've got a book behind us somewhere

354
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
 here in the QI library, which is a book that shows you

355
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,040
 how to knit out of your pet's fur.

356
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,880
 - Yeah.

357
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,920
 - It's like a picture of you with the dog

358
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,760
 and then the dog's hair.

359
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,600
 - Knitting the dog hair.

360
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,480
 - Yeah, knitting which was published by John Metchanson,

361
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,600
 formerly QI sort of co-founder.

362
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,440
 - Yeah.

363
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,280
 - He published that.

364
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,480
 - I think that it won the award for weir this title.

365
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 - Yes, you're right.

366
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
 - Amazing.

367
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,420
 - You're absolutely right.

368
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,400
 Lucy Malcolm.

369
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,320
 - Yeah.

370
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
 - Says, she thinks this is spicy meat,

371
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,800
 but she's not certain.

372
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,240
 While Anna was on maternity leave,

373
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,920
 every episode had Dan, Andy and James with one guest.

374
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
 Did that mean none of them had any time off

375
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,800
 for the whole of Anna's mat leave?

376
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
 - Yeah.

377
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,480
 - She has-

378
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,320
 - Largely true.

379
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,280
 - I hope this doesn't lead to resentment,

380
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,160
 souring relations and eventual breakup.

381
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,000
 - Yeah.

382
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
 - No, we just ended up occasionally did a couple of week,

383
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,600
 I think, to make up for that.

384
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
 - Yeah, we did Soho Theater,

385
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,320
 which had this crammed in a couple of weeks.

386
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,160
 - But interestingly,

387
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,440
 I think we were all three of us were on every episode,

388
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,280
 I think.

389
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,100
 - I think so.

390
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,940
 - You must have been.

391
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,780
 - She has a follow-up.

392
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,160
 Has there ever been an episode that hasn't had three

393
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,000
 of the four main fish on?

394
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,840
 - Yes.

395
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,680
 - Three?

396
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,500
 - Oh, it was two, sorry.

397
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,340
 Sorry.

398
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,180
 - No, there hasn't been.

399
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,320
 So the fewest of the four of us on was an episode

400
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,160
 with me, Dan, Greg Jenner and Alex Heddleman.

401
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
 - Yes.

402
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,840
 - Although Anna-

403
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,860
 - And there was one with me, Dan, Piz and Justin.

404
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,680
 - Yeah.

405
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,360
 - Or me and one of you and Piz and Justin.

406
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,200
 - I don't remember.

407
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,440
 - I think Anna was a fact-checker in that Greg Jenner show.

408
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,920
 So you were kind of on the show.

409
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,760
 - Interesting.

410
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,800
 - Oh my goodness.

411
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,560
 James, I think there were times in the very early days,

412
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,280
 says Lucy, where there were at least three of you,

413
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,920
 but one of you in the fact-checker role,

414
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,400
 rather the main fact-deliverer.

415
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,880
 - I remember we used to have a fact-checker.

416
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,840
 - Yeah.

417
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,920
 Whatever happened to them?

418
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,600
 Well, we get everything right these days,

419
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
 at first, don't we?

420
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,240
 - She says, I've been mulling this question for a while

421
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
 and then listened to the recent episode

422
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,160
 where Dan was stuck on a train.

423
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,080
 Seemed an app time to actually ask it.

424
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,880
 - Well, that was the first episode where it was

425
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
 literally three of you.

426
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,720
 - That was crazy.

427
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,520
 - Did you get lots of people writing and saying

428
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,480
 it was better with three of us?

429
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
 - Yeah, it doesn't.

430
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,160
 It doesn't have people writing.

431
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,380
 - I got a lot of DMs about it.

432
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,740
 (laughing)

433
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,580
 - No, we didn't actually.

434
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,420
 We didn't get much.

435
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,260
 - Good.

436
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,520
 - There was almost no response either way.

437
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,480
 - Didn't notice.

438
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,160
 - Okay, here's Mick Bremner.

439
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,000
 Dan.

440
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
 - Yeah?

441
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,680
 - writes Mick.

442
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,160
 "Fishing chips are still wrapped up in newspaper.

443
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,960
 It's just that it's never been used or printed on."

444
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,080
 - What?

445
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
 - I know, this is nuts.

446
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,440
 I used to work for a company who supplied chip shops

447
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,240
 with sundries.

448
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,440
 The 12.5 kilo packs of paper are called white news.

449
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,280
 - That's great.

450
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
 - So it's literally the same paper.

451
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,680
 - That's fantastic.

452
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,240
 - That's really good, 'cause it is actually,

453
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,760
 when you get it, it's that exact--

454
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,600
 - Crinkly.

455
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,760
 - I always thought it was just grease-proof paper.

456
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,600
 How is that?

457
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,440
 - It's not as crunchy as grease-proof, is it?

458
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,280
 It's newspaper.

459
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,120
 - That's really interesting.

460
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,960
 - Very cool.

461
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,000
 - On a no-news day.

462
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,760
 (laughing)

463
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,040
 - So thank you, Mick.

464
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,360
 - That's a really good fact.

465
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,760
 - Yeah, it's a really, a very--

466
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,560
 - Is it printed by the same company

467
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,440
 that prints newspapers then?

468
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,200
 Do you think there's a newspaper printing company

469
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
 that prints a load of news

470
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,280
 and then prints loads of blank ones?

471
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,880
 - Put it through the printing.

472
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,840
 They just put on like a 1000 page word document

473
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,720
 with nothing on it and they just print it.

474
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,360
 - Oh, no, I've left the header and footer in.

475
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,080
 It's got page numbers.

476
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,440
 (laughing)

477
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,800
 - That's great, thank you, Mick.

478
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
 - Jill Kendall.

479
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,640
 First of all, I just want to say I'm a huge fan

480
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,840
 and I listen to the show all the time.

481
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,440
 As a fan of the show, I'm sure you will find it

482
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,720
 not at all as surprising that I am a bit of a pedant.

483
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,000
 I was listening to the June 6th show,

484
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,720
 no such thing as the SS Enterprise,

485
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,240
 and it came up that Microsoft interviews

486
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,760
 would include such questions as,

487
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,960
 "Why are manhole covers round?"

488
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,680
 This may have been a type of question asked at one time,

489
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,040
 but it isn't anymore.

490
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,280
 My expertise is that I've worked in tech in Seattle

491
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,000
 since 2008.

492
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,280
 I've done hundreds of interviews,

493
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,240
 both as the interviewer and the interviewee.

494
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,520
 I have never worked at Microsoft,

495
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,920
 but I have interviewed there twice.

496
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,360
 My husband also has worked in tech in Seattle since 2010.

497
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,080
 Neither of us have ever been asked a brain teaser question

498
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,480
 or asked one.

499
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,400
 The reason is that it really doesn't help us determine

500
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,640
 if a candidate will be good at software engineering.

501
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,400
 (laughing)

502
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,880
 - Because you go into Microsoft, of course,

503
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,960
 into the coding room and they're all just there

504
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,520
 with their manhole covers.

505
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,200
 'Cause Jeremy Corbin, of course,

506
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,320
 is a big fan of manhole covers.

507
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,280
 He knows everything about manhole covers.

508
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,560
 - And he's got a big job at Microsoft now, hasn't he?

509
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,920
 (laughing)

510
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,640
 - He's following Nick Clegg to Facebook,

511
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,960
 called me good to Microsoft.

512
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,040
 That's great.

513
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,000
 So what's being suggested here, that it's all fake?

514
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,480
 - Maybe if old mate had got around

515
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,440
 to the second round of interviews at Microsoft.

516
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,280
 (laughing)

517
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,640
 That's one of these questions.

518
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,800
 - I feel like it's something that happened

519
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,040
 in the very, very early days of Seattle Tech

520
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,480
 and probably hasn't happened for 20, 30 years.

521
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,320
 - Yeah.

522
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,160
 - You've definitely gone out of favor

523
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
 of that style of question now, I think,

524
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,800
 because it's quite, I think it's seen as quite elitist

525
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,320
 because maybe I think it favors

526
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,040
 your more confident public school.

527
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,080
 I feel like I've read something along these lines.

528
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,440
 And also it's kind of bollocks that it tells you

529
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,600
 anything useful that you need to know

530
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
 about someone for a job.

531
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
 - Throw this brick through this window.

532
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
 You know that one?

533
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,760
 - No.

534
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,000
 - And then see if they open the window.

535
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,840
 - That's right.

536
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,840
 The idiot candidate throws the brick through the window.

537
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,920
 The coward candidate doesn't.

538
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
 The successful candidate opens the window

539
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,520
 and then throws the brick through it.

540
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,760
 - And they get sued by the person who hits.

541
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,440
 - Praying a passerby, yeah.

542
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,400
 - Has someone told you to get a brick into that room?

543
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,240
 - No, no.

544
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,360
 For the last question in the interview,

545
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,760
 when you've aced it so far,

546
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
 they whip a cloth off the table beneath it,

547
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,600
 a common brick, and they say,

548
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,280
 "Throw this brick through that window there, please."

549
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,600
 As your final test.

550
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,120
 And then they see if you open the window.

551
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,960
 - I see.

552
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,640
 How many windows do you think had to be repaired?

553
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,040
 It's just, I want to get sorry,

554
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,600
 the interviewers have been held up.

555
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,760
 - I just, we just got to call the.

556
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,840
 - Yeah, we've got 20 people to go through

557
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,400
 for the end of the day.

558
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,280
 - I just threw it through mine directly

559
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,400
 at the guy's computer 'cause we were at Microsoft

560
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,920
 and when he said, "Throw it at windows."

561
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,760
 - There you go.

562
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,600
 You got the job.

563
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
 - Lovely.

564
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,680
 - So yeah, I sort of felt like when I said it,

565
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,960
 it was like this is a thing that has happened

566
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
 as opposed to like a current,

567
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
 I don't even think I thought it was a current day thing.

568
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,360
 - No, I don't know.

569
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
 - There we go.

570
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,040
 - It might not have ever happened.

571
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
 It might be just the kind of thing

572
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,680
 that they make up, but I don't know.

573
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,120
 - I'm glad if it doesn't happen because all that stuff,

574
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,640
 you know that there's you would hear about people saying

575
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,120
 they get all the CVs on the table

576
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,720
 and they would take the top 20 and chuck them on the floor

577
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,040
 and say, "I don't employ unlucky people."

578
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
 Like that kind of shit.

579
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
 I'm not into that.

580
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,200
 - I actually always liked the idea of the brain teasers

581
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,000
 'cause I think really it's one of my strengths

582
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,440
 is answering brain teasers.

583
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,280
 - Oh yeah.

584
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,920
 - And probably my weaknesses is everything else in life.

585
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,280
 (laughing)

586
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,720
 In a meeting, I think that would be good for me.

587
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,960
 - So they're like, "So Mr. Harkin,

588
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,520
 "we've got this new code that's coming."

589
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,080
 And you're like, "Well, actually, before you get to that."

590
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,920
 (laughing)

591
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,720
 - A diver is found up a tree.

592
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,980
 (laughing)

593
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,400
 - Oh, that's great.

594
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,400
 We've got a few amazing names.

595
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,740
 - Cool.

596
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,480
 - Is this another like amazing name, shit emails?

597
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,120
 Is this part of that section?

598
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,280
 - The other thing, amazing name, shitty email.

599
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,200
 - There you go, you have that one, that's great.

600
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,560
 Ian Not, quite a good name.

601
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,280
 - It's a relatively normal name.

602
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,000
 - Right, is that the tone?

603
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,880
 - It's with a K and two T's, so like double knotted.

604
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,640
 - My old game's teacher was a Mr. Not.

605
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,960
 - Maybe some relation.

606
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,840
 - Could be, he was brilliant, game's teacher.

607
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,520
 - There we go, Ian Not writes.

608
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,160
 - Has James kept up his practice?

609
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,920
 (laughing)

610
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,560
 - It's just a link to someone in New Zealand

611
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 who works with penguins.

612
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,800
 And she has a double barreled last name.

613
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,760
 - He was married to someone from New Zealand, Mr. Not.

614
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,600
 - Oh, really?

615
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,440
 - Yeah.

616
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,280
 - This is not.

617
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,040
 (laughing)

618
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,960
 - Ian writes, just stumbled across this

619
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,800
 and I'm still blown away.

620
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,920
 This woman works with penguins

621
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,720
 and her double barreled last name contains not one,

622
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,040
 but two birds.

623
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,880
 - Yep.

624
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,240
 - And she's called Geraldine Gillimott, peacock.

625
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,080
 - Whoa.

626
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,920
 - That's incredible name.

627
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,760
 - She works with penguins.

628
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,600
 - That's quite fantastic.

629
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
 - Gillimott is a very unusual surname.

630
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,440
 - I'll say.

631
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,360
 - Yeah.

632
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,880
 - Also, we've got Laura McCarthy who writes,

633
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,920
 I've just found out there's a very talented musician,

634
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,480
 the keyboardist and musical director

635
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,240
 of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour,

636
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
 who's called Karina De Piano.

637
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,560
 (laughing)

638
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
 - Good name.

639
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,560
 - De Piano.

640
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,400
 - De Piano.

641
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,240
 - That's a real surname.

642
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,080
 - Yep.

643
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,900
 - Wow.

644
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,120
 - De Piano.

645
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,160
 And finally, I'm writing to submit myself

646
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,400
 for an honorable mention in Andy's list of names

647
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,480
 that are sentences.

648
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,680
 I say honorable mention because I am not a sentence

649
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,240
 but a present perfect continuous tense verb.

650
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,080
 - Okay.

651
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,160
 - And that is from Ben Cumming.

652
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,960
 (laughing)

653
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,800
 Childish.

654
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,320
 - That's very funny.

655
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,200
 - I just read yesterday that the law

656
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,840
 that was repealed in the 1950s, I think,

657
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,040
 against interracial marriage in America was,

658
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,000
 it was the court case,

659
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,520
 was loving versus the state of Virginia.

660
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,360
 Is that nice?

661
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,200
 - That's great.

662
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 - 'Cause there was a couple, the loving couple,

663
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,920
 Mr. Loving married Mrs. Loving.

664
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,760
 - Brilliant.

665
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,920
 - And loving couple.

666
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,040
 - Loving beat Virginia.

667
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,000
 - That's really good.

668
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,840
 - That's a great fact.

669
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,920
 - Isn't that nice?

670
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,960
 - We should write in, Anna.

671
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,800
 - Yeah.

672
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
 (laughing)

673
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
 - That's a really good fact.

674
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,920
 - I've seen his filtration system

675
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,320
 and it's not making it through.

676
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,160
 (laughing)

677
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,720
 - We have had a lot of emails from people

678
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,760
 who can write, hand write,

679
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
 because we did handwriting recently.

680
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
 - Yes, that's right.

681
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,000
 - So--

682
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,520
 - Yeah, well they say they can hand write

683
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
 but they've sent you an email.

684
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,360
 (laughing)

685
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,200
 - That's true.

686
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,080
 Leah Denman from Oakland, California

687
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,000
 has dear fish team and Andy specifically reading this first.

688
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,840
 - Thank you.

689
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,880
 - You discuss professions with specific handwriting styles.

690
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,240
 In the USA, all architects and civil engineers

691
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,900
 typically have a boxy, all caps writing style.

692
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,720
 And Leah studied architecture.

693
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,360
 And I was in the last class to be required

694
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,800
 to learn a standard writing style

695
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,900
 for drafting plans using graph paper.

696
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,720
 So there is a specific--

697
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,000
 - Oh, so because you're writing in graph paper,

698
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,320
 'cause you're putting, drawing your houses

699
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,640
 or whatever architects do,

700
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
 you tend to put a letter in each box.

701
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,280
 - Exactly that.

702
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,120
 - And how interesting.

703
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
 - And she says I currently work

704
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,360
 in the home building industry

705
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,080
 and there's a clear divide of handwriting styles

706
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,840
 between generations who were taught to draw plans

707
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,760
 on paper versus computers.

708
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
 - Mm.

709
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,440
 - They're nuts.

710
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,280
 - Yeah.

711
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,120
 - Interesting.

712
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,960
 - She adds also there's given me a chance

713
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,840
 to segue into a thanks but no thanks.

714
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,120
 For the fish email inbox,

715
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,640
 is there a reason you don't call it the fin box?

716
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
 No, actually.

717
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
 - She doesn't come up with anything

718
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
 that clever at this time.

719
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,800
 - Oh, that clever, yeah.

720
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,600
 (laughing)

721
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,160
 We did that thing ages ago about Meghan Markle

722
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,320
 before she was princess.

723
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,240
 She was a cursive hand writer for wedding invitations

724
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,440
 and she did Robin Thickey's wedding.

725
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,200
 (laughing)

726
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,360
 - Right, just remember that.

727
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,480
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

728
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
 - You used to write on graph paper

729
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,360
 when you remember when you learned to write

730
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,400
 and but you weren't good enough

731
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,080
 to be left to write freestyle on a line

732
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,480
 and you wrote on graph paper.

733
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,320
 Do you remember that?

734
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,160
 - I don't remember that.

735
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,000
 - We never did that.

736
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,840
 - Maybe you guys didn't do it.

737
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,880
 - But you can surely lined paper does the trick.

738
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,000
 As in, what are the vertical lines for that?

739
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
 - Just to make the size 'cause little squares are smaller.

740
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,840
 So technically like the round bit of a B

741
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,320
 I think would be in one square.

742
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,160
 - One square.

743
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

744
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,840
 - That's clever.

745
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,680
 - That was very neat.

746
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,280
 And then you get on line paper and it's just chaos.

747
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
 - Well, while we're on inadequate educational methods,

748
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,600
 let's turn to Martha Everett.

749
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,720
 (laughing)

750
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
 She says, "I've just been listening

751
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,520
 "to the latest episode in which Anna said,

752
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,920
 "we were all taught a script.

753
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,480
 "This is not quite true.

754
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,000
 "In primary school, my brother and I

755
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,160
 "were part of an experiment called emergent writing

756
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,400
 "in which children were basically just not taught cursive

757
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,040
 "but left to develop our own."

758
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,520
 - Okay, so you see the letters printed I suppose

759
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,800
 and then you just mimic them however you think is right.

760
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,640
 - That's interesting.

761
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,480
 - Interesting, yeah.

762
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,320
 - She says--

763
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,160
 - She's now a literate.

764
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,200
 - Well, she says, "I only discovered this as an adult

765
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,360
 "when my mum told me and I was furious.

766
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
 "I only printed for ages

767
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
 "and I've always had terrible writing.

768
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,320
 "And as an adult, I spent a few years laboriously

769
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,440
 "teaching myself cursive from the internet."

770
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,240
 - Oh, from the internet.

771
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,080
 - Yeah.

772
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,920
 - Oh my God.

773
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,640
 - And now I write and wing big.

774
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,920
 (all laughing)

775
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,520
 - The email came in in comic sans.

776
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,520
 On the one hand, the British education system

777
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,280
 has failed me, on the other, such an optimist,

778
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,800
 I got to design my own bespoke handwriting.

779
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,640
 - Well, in a way, it is, I mean,

780
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,360
 obviously it's an experiment on children.

781
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,200
 - Yep.

782
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,600
 - And it's not done well for them in later life

783
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,760
 but we have learned from it.

784
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,840
 And no result is still a good result, isn't it?

785
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,240
 - Just so, yeah, she says that she finishes

786
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,440
 her email, James, exactly like that.

787
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,080
 The system was abandoned in the late 80s

788
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,520
 as it was discovered after years of testing this method

789
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,040
 that not teaching children something

790
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,080
 means they don't learn it.

791
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,560
 (all laughing)

792
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,920
 - That is, like, yeah?

793
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,880
 - Children are idiots, conclusion.

794
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,280
 - I mean, gosh, yeah.

795
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,360
 And then can I tell you one more on this?

796
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,320
 - Yeah. - Last one.

797
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
 - Last one on this.

798
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,800
 Eva Hafner, I'm ambidextrous, she says.

799
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,640
 - Show off.

800
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,840
 - And I've been writing with my left hand

801
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,200
 but since childhood I've taught myself

802
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
 to write with my right hand purely

803
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,920
 for the purpose of having a second set of handwriting

804
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
 to forge my parents' notes for school.

805
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,760
 - Right. - That's clever.

806
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,600
 - Interesting.

807
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,480
 - I used to write left handed as well, actually.

808
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,440
 - Did you? - Sometimes, yeah.

809
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,680
 I taught myself at uni

810
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,200
 just 'cause I used to get a tired hand

811
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,680
 so I would swap.

812
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,520
 - Get away.

813
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
 - No, I did and 'cause I taught myself

814
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,040
 and I had a lot of time 'cause I was at uni

815
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,840
 so it was quite reasonably good

816
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
 but it would always slant

817
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,440
 in exactly the opposite direction.

818
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,800
 - Wow. - So can you still, like,

819
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,640
 'cause I would be able to begin?

820
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,840
 - No, I don't think so. - Really?

821
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,760
 - Yeah, it was probably for a couple of years

822
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,080
 I could do it relatively well

823
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,040
 and then once I stopped practicing I just lost it.

824
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
 - Gosh. - Wow.

825
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,240
 - Could you ever do mirror writing?

826
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,720
 - No. - My mum can do mirror writing.

827
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,560
 It's very cool. - Yeah, really.

828
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,400
 - That's really cool. - Where you write

829
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,240
 with one hand and the other at the same time

830
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,560
 a reverse image.

831
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,080
 - Oh, I didn't know that was what meant.

832
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,120
 I thought you just meant writing in,

833
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,160
 you know, some kids naturally do mirror writing

834
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,280
 when they're learning to write.

835
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,360
 They do letters backwards

836
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
 but she does it at the same time as writing forwards.

837
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,560
 Yeah, that's incredible.

838
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
 - Do you remember when I went to,

839
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,600
 did I tell you as this?

840
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,720
 When I went to the British Museum

841
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,600
 and I saw the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci.

842
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,440
 - Oh, yeah.

843
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
 - And so I was looking at him for ages

844
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,440
 and I was like, oh man, I can't,

845
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,760
 I realized why I can't read these.

846
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,880
 He wrote in mirror writing.

847
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,720
 He always wrote backwards.

848
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,360
 No wonder I can't understand.

849
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,280
 Failing to remember that it wasn't in English anyway.

850
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,640
 (laughing)

851
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,720
 But that to me was like, oh yeah,

852
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,080
 that's why I'm not getting this covered.

853
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,000
 - That's funny.

854
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,800
 - There was a president who could write.

855
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,640
 - Yeah, James Garfield.

856
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,960
 - Garfield in Latin with both hands at the same time.

857
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,360
 - Latin with one and Greek with the other.

858
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,040
 - That's so impressive.

859
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,520
 Eva goes on, she's just a little bit more detail.

860
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,640
 So she has completely different

861
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,760
 left and right handwriting styles, right?

862
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
 And she's sent some samples.

863
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,120
 She adds, for science, I also deep throated a pen

864
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,160
 to send you a sample of my mouth writing.

865
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,520
 - Okay.

866
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,440
 Okay, so we said that your handwriting,

867
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,840
 if you put a pen in your mouth and write it,

868
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,840
 it will be similar to your actual handwriting.

869
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,400
 So that's why she's referencing here.

870
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,240
 - I've forgotten that.

871
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,800
 (laughing)

872
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,280
 - 'Cause she can write with both hands

873
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,600
 at the same time, from right to left.

874
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,440
 - That's great.

875
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,400
 - Ella Da Vinci, exactly.

876
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,280
 And if she repeats this writing a hundred times,

877
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
 all these handwriting will be distinct and consistent,

878
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
 except the mouth writing,

879
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
 I've never tried this before

880
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,080
 and I don't want to repeat it either.

881
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,480
 - Couldn't she have just used one of those

882
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
 small election pencils

883
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,360
 rather than taking a full pen to the throat?

884
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,200
 (laughing)

885
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,040
 - I think, yes.

886
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,480
 - Was it one of those giant pencils

887
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,440
 you get from Blackpool?

888
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,720
 (laughing)

889
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,560
 - Two more.

890
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,480
 Mark Lipsky writes,

891
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,920
 "I was listening to episode 527

892
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,960
 "where you mentioned someone with the surname POOSE

893
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,640
 "and it reminded me of my own experience

894
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,480
 "with the surname, with the surname..."

895
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,320
 (laughing)

896
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,480
 - I had a POOSE on it.

897
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,800
 (laughing)

898
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,480
 - Here's a photo, you're sincerely Mark.

899
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,240
 (laughing)

900
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
 - Mark says, "I'm a classical musician, brackets.

901
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,040
 "It was a struggle to keep my peace during bassoon gate."

902
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,280
 (laughing)

903
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,760
 - Often, when I'm playing with a particular orchestra

904
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,080
 for the first time, I don't know everyone.

905
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,960
 There could be 90 people in the ensemble.

906
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,880
 Once when we were waiting to go on stage

907
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,240
 a few minutes before the concert began,

908
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,880
 I was idly reading the playlist

909
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,360
 and came across the name Henrietta POOSE.

910
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,560
 I found it so funny that I completely coerced

911
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,760
 and struggled to stop laughing

912
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
 as I was going on stage.

913
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

914
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,240
 - Mark continues, "Several years later,

915
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,560
 "I was walking in a park

916
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,720
 "and noticed that a park bench

917
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,200
 "had a little memorial plaque on it

918
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,440
 "and it was dedicated to a Mr. Henry Pease."

919
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,280
 - That's very good.

920
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,400
 - Oh, nice if they married with him.

921
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,160
 - "I immediately thought that Mr. Pease

922
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,120
 "and Ms. POOSE absolutely need to get married

923
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,560
 "and double barrel their surnames,

924
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,080
 "except of course that Henry Pease is dead."

925
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,840
 (laughing)

926
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,920
 - Okay. - Great email.

927
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,080
 - Yeah, very good.

928
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,080
 - Henry and Henrietta as well, Henrietta POOSE.

929
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,200
 - Yeah, I feel like that's part of the nice coincidence.

930
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
 Wouldn't it be cool, it's such a shame

931
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,440
 that you know the room about the brown note

932
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,040
 that would always bounce round,

933
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,240
 that there's a note you can play

934
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,720
 that makes people shit themselves.

935
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,280
 - It's such a shame that's not real

936
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,200
 'cause if you were in an orchestra with Henrietta POOSE,

937
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,800
 you would plot one day before she arrives,

938
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,960
 you'd be like, "When she walks in, let's all do it."

939
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,680
 (laughing)

940
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,600
 And it would be the best moment of your life.

941
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,680
 - True, true, true.

942
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,320
 - Unfortunately, the thing with the brown note

943
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,640
 is it makes everyone poo.

944
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,480
 - Yeah. (laughing)

945
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,440
 - You can't just direct it straight at Henrietta,

946
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,240
 so there would be a bit of a...

947
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,200
 - The audience is coming in 10 minutes.

948
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
 What were you thinking?

949
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,240
 (laughing)

950
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,360
 - We don't have that many new pairs of black trousers.

951
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,120
 Right, everyone's just gonna do the whole gig,

952
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,040
 no trousers, all right?

953
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,280
 (laughing)

954
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,400
 - All right, one last one.

955
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,200
 - Yeah. - It's from Matt Duffin.

956
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,520
 I saw Andrew wandering through the streets of Soho today

957
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
 and was, didn't he look handsome?

958
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
 (laughing)

959
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,440
 He was also carrying lots of copies of his book,

960
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,640
 which I must say I've read and is a really great read.

961
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,160
 - It's okay, James, I told you to stay out of the inbox.

962
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,360
 (laughing)

963
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,620
 Sorry, fin box.

964
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,320
 No, it's just, I saw Andrew wandering

965
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,560
 through the streets of Soho today

966
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,480
 and was very impressed by the volume of his whistle.

967
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,560
 (laughing)

968
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,520
 - That's disgusting.

969
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,640
 (laughing)

970
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,600
 Why were you doing that?

971
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,920
 Well, you read so well, I guess.

972
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
 - I remember walking through Soho whistling jointly.

973
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,480
 - What do you whistle?

974
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,920
 - At the moment, tequila.

975
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,400
 I was whistling tequila the other day.

976
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,320
 - Tequila. - By television.

977
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,880
 - That's a tough tune. - I know the old one.

978
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,720
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

979
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,080
 - Trust me, we're all just fan-sing it.

980
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,960
 - Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah.

981
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,120
 - It reminded me of a fun fact.

982
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
 There's a town in South Carolina

983
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,400
 where it's illegal to whistle after 11 p.m.

984
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,080
 - Is it, though? - Is it?

985
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,920
 Maybe.

986
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,000
 Maybe. - It'd be.

987
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,280
 - Anyway, just, just nice, you know,

988
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,240
 let us know if you spot us around.

989
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,560
 - Well done, you whistle.

990
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,320
 - I'm available for whistling gigs, I'm sorry,

991
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,160
 I'm trying to set up. - Are you sure

992
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,200
 you didn't see a sexy woman from the 1970s

993
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,360
 and that's why you're whistling?

994
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,440
 (all laugh)

995
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
 - You saw Jessica Rabbit walk past.

996
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,800
 - Yeah, but just so you know, that's nice, thank you.

997
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,080
 - I didn't know you did that, that's--

998
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,920
 - What, whistle? - Yeah.

999
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,240
 - I whistle a lot.

1000
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,320
 - I've never heard you whistle.

1001
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,400
 - I'm the only one on the street normally whistling

1002
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,680
 and it's a bit annoying to other people around me, I think.

1003
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,480
 'Cause I do whistle quite loud.

1004
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,600
 And if you're walking, if you're keeping pace with--

1005
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,320
 - Not that loud, not like a dinner lady.

1006
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,280
 Not like he's--

1007
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,520
 - No, not like summoning a taxi, you know.

1008
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,880
 I can do that, I bet you can do that, Anna.

1009
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,600
 I bet you can do the fingers in your mouth.

1010
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,160
 - Oh, I tried for years.

1011
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,880
 I just, no, it's too breathy.

1012
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,440
 But I don't think it's annoying if you walk past it.

1013
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,400
 I think it's annoying to be in a house with a whistler,

1014
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,360
 which I--

1015
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,480
 - Yes, or someone who goes, "Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom."

1016
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,320
 (all laugh)

1017
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,160
 - Who was that? - Who was that?

1018
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,240
 (all laugh)

1019
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,720
 - Or someone you're living with to be.

1020
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,560
 (all laugh)

1021
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,600
 - Sometimes, for example, sometimes at a classical concert,

1022
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,360
 you might end up next to someone who--

1023
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,440
 - Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

1024
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,920
 - Really? - Who sort of does a bit

1025
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,000
 of the music for himself, normally himself, I must say.

1026
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,320
 - Did I have sheet music to help them?

1027
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,080
 (all laugh)

1028
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,600
 - Have you actually sat in the orchestra?

1029
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,960
 (all laugh)

1030
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,200
 - So rude, this guy next to me had a bassoon

1031
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,960
 he was playing throughout the concert.

1032
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,920
 - And no pants.

1033
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,320
 (all laugh)

1034
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,560
 - Perfect.

1035
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,400
 Bye.

1036
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,980
 (upbeat music)

1037
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:46,320
 Please send more emails to podcast@qi.com

1038
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,240
 and you have a 1% chance, we just get a lot of emails,

1039
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,720
 you know, I wish we could do more.

1040
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,440
 I wish we could do these for longer,

1041
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,200
 but the certain, some people--

1042
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,800
 - I think we're doing exactly the right amount.

1043
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,640
 - That's the right amount, I'm sorry.

1044
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,200
 - Three people, think they go on a bit too long as it is.

1045
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,360
 (all laugh)

1046
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,640
 Anyway, but thank you for listening

1047
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,040
 and please do send us an email, please.

1048
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,880
 Okay, bye.

1049
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
 - Bye. - Bye.

1050
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,440
 - Bye.

1051
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,920
 - All right, nice. - Yeah.

1052
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,500
 (upbeat music)

1053
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:26,500
