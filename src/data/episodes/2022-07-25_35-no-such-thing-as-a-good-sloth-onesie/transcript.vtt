00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.520
 It is not such thing as a fish. No seriously. It's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.480
 It says it right there. First paragraph. No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:24.800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.520
 This time coming to you from the Turtle Comedy Book Festival in Camden, London.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Andy Murray.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.680
 And it's Zinsky and James Harkin. And this week all of our facts are coming from the new QI book.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.200
 1,411 QI facts to knock you sideways. So here are the four facts that we entered into that book.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.880
 And in no particular order here they are. Fact number one, James.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:55.680
 So my fact this week is Viking names included Desirus of Beer, Squat Wiggle,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.760
 Lust Hostage, Short Penis. Able to fill a bay with fish by magic.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.400
 The man who mixes his drinks. And the man without trousers.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.160
 But so, okay, when you say that these are Viking names, were they like,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.760
 were there more than two sometimes in a ship? Was it like, you did you have to be like,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.720
 do we have a surname here? Because we got two short penises on the loan.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.440
 I don't know about that. There's a great long list of them. These comes from names of people

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.760
 actually from the sagas, from the Icelandic sagas and the Norwegian sagas.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.080
 And these are the kind of nicknames rather than actual first names, I think.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.280
 Did you find out anything about the specific, like, a Squat Wiggle? Do we know what that is?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.240
 What it is? What it is? Well, I can tell I don't know.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.360
 I assume the person who was called it, did it? Squat Swat?

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.320
 And Wiggle. Yeah.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.400
 Is that the thing you do on a dance floor where you, like, go down to the floor and then up again?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.120
 But I do on the dance floor. Yeah. Or in the office sometimes, we all find a bit weird.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.720
 I think it's what, like, when a dog wipes its bum on the ground, on the carpet,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.960
 you know, it does that. Yeah. Little Squat Wiggle.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.640
 So, you know how Native Americans name their children after the first thing they see after they

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.960
 give birth? Do they? Yeah, do you think Squat Wiggle's parents saw this dog doing the thing

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.920
 on the floor? Wait, what? Really? Yeah, that's the idea.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.120
 I always thought that was a myth as well. Yeah, they called me. I'll show you some myth.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.120
 So, someone gave birth next to a sitting bull and that's how they got their name.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.800
 Yeah, that's the idea. Oh, jumping Badger. Is that literally what it was?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.320
 Well, that's the idea. I don't know if it's really true.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.520
 I think it depends what kind of next American you were, what tribe you were from.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.960
 Some of them named their children, I think, the me walk tribe named their kids after how

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.640
 the nearest stream looked when they gave birth. Oh, really? Yeah.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.360
 It's probably a limited number of. Yeah, you've got to be very emancipated in the adjectives.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.400
 Yeah, wet, wet, muddy. Is that where the band got the name?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.840
 They were all in the me walk tribe. I like the, I hope the short penis and the man without trousers

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.080
 were friends with each other. I hope one named the other.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.400
 I found out a few more of them. They're all from the land namabok, which is medieval work

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.040
 about when the Norse went to Iceland and settled it. And so there's a load of, it's a bit like

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.400
 a doomsday book. There are loads of records of people and why they live and all of this.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:41.040
 And a few more of them, same name, same source, harm fart, arson victim.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.360
 That was a name, arson victim, a person in trouble or in disgrace, but I think that's

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.320
 inactually transcribed and able to remain warm in winter.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.960
 That sounds like a euphemism of fat, doesn't it?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.520
 Are you able to remain warm in winter?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.880
 One of my favourite ones is King Ragnar Harry Britches. We might have mentioned him on QI actually,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.480
 a few people know him. He got his name because his wife made him hairy trousers from animal

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.800
 skins and they were supposed to protect him in battle, magic trousers.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.240
 Yeah, magic trousers. Did they work? Did they, well, we said what are you saying?

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.320
 I like that. You know that situation when you're in a room and someone comes up to you

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.880
 who blatantly know and you've forgotten their name. I'd love to see that scene in Viking times.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.160
 Short penis? No, sorry. Ugly? There is face? Dickhead?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 And you look like a dickhead. I'm sorry. You're right.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.320
 Maybe they were more catchy in North. Did you? Yeah, they were quite long-winded, aren't they?

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.400
 Yeah. That's actually your name of a person if you're quite long-winded.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.920
 Yeah. I think I'm stuck on a dinner table with the long-winded.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:06.400
 Did you, the word gun is "norse"? How weird is that? Gun? Gun? Yeah, and it's because

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.560
 there's an inventory of weapons from the Tower of London, which was in 1330 and there was a

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.880
 bellister, a big projectile device, which was called Lady Gunhilder, so Gunhilder meant war or battle,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.000
 so that's where, so even though they weren't really around at the time. Were they? Guns? No, no.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.120
 Vikings. I've just, I've had a moment of crisis of confidence about when they... When did you say?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.360
 13th century? Yeah, you're fine. You're safe, safe ground. Something else invented by the Vikings

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.600
 or from that area, this is one few Anna, sarcasm. Well, thanks, cheers.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.280
 Yeah, great. I'd be like that. I'm really good for that. The words of the concept.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.560
 No, the concept, according to Clans Gruber, the Danish ambassador, whose name also sounds made up,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.160
 he says that the Danish and the British have a similar sense of humour with our sarcasm and the

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.600
 way that we make jokes, and so he reasons that it must have come over with the Vikings. Do you say

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.560
 Clans Gruber? No. Clouse Gruber. Oh, Clouse Gruber, sorry. I thought it sounded like

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:14.880
 Hans Gruber, the baddie in Diehard. I'm wrong with the Diehard fans. Does his name have a good meaning

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.760
 in English, do we know? Like, makes up questionable theories. We get quite a lot of a surprising

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.880
 number of words from the Vikings, don't we? And they're all quite negative, which might be

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:35.440
 like Village and Hell, I think, and weak skulls, slaughter, anger, dirt, skulls, might be that I've

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.080
 gone through them and chosen the most negative ones. It's my point. Muggy. Muggy? Is that negative? I guess so.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.280
 It's not a good thing, is it? No. Berserk. You've got to come outside. It's so muggy.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.920
 Feeling too dry? So what about Berserk? That's something to do with Bers, is it?

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.160
 So Berserk, the Berserkers were the Viking warriors who were just insane, weren't they? And they think

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.800
 that either they worked themselves up into some kind of meditative trance, because they were so,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.120
 like, forced themselves to be so angry that they became vicious warriors, or they were just on

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.560
 drugs. Anyway, they were called Berserkers, which is where we get the word Berserk. Yeah.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.000
 There's one theory that actually Vikings weren't worse than anyone else, but the only reason that

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.240
 we have only bad stories about them is because they attacked monks who are much more literate

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.520
 than them. And so the monks were the people who were writing things down, and they wouldn't

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.280
 write anything down. That's a proper theory, yeah. Oh, that's great.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.360
 It's like writing something really about Muggy Zuckerberg a few hundred years from now.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:42.640
 Your name will be mud. That's very cool. So what I love about this, obviously, is we're talking about

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:48.080
 silly names. And I had a fact, just tell you guys, I had a fact that I tried to use on a previous

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:55.280
 podcast, which got rejected in the office, which was that 40% of all penises are in America.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.520
 And it's the surname. It's the surname Penises. You can go on a website, and it tells you where

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.480
 they all are. 40% in America, Fiverr and Britain. And the most popular name, shot.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.400
 That must be, that must be someone whose name is Shorty Penis.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.360
 Well, there was one guy called Penis Penis. No, actually, that was a popular name, because it was

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.640
 in... No, it wasn't a popular name. That's a computer error. That cannot be. No one.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.960
 Was it hyphenazine? No, no, it was just pure just penis. So you think two penises married each other?

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:37.120
 Penis Penis was also a very popular name. Next to Penis Penis Penis. So it's a double

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.680
 barocer name, obviously. So this shorty must be people filling in online forms with root words,

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.360
 shot must be... I don't know. The most popular is Bob Penis. So I don't know.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:53.280
 That's an actual name. They didn't let me do it on the show. So not going to get in this wiki, that...

00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.040
 Did you guys get speaking of stupid names? And kind of Vikings, there's a Swedish couple

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.840
 who are being fined because they failed to register a legally approved name for their child.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:13.040
 And they've, they've presently called their child. I didn't know how to pronounce this is...

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:24.800
 Apparently it's pronounced Albin, but it's a series of consonants. And so they were told that they

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.480
 weren't allowed to register that as a name for their child. And so they said they were willing to

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.560
 change a child's name to A, the letter A, which also wasn't accepted. And so they've been fine.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.680
 But yeah, their explanation was that the naming of their child, as such, was a pregnant

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.920
 expressionistic development that we see as an artistic creation. That's not really going to cut

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.320
 it when he's been bullied and scarred. Do you see today? There was a article on the paper today,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.400
 and I can't... So maybe someone here will remember it. The number one hacker, internet hacker in the

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.160
 world, they managed to crack his code and get into all the places he's been hacking because his

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:12.960
 personal password was his cat's name with one, two, three. I was just in the news. The worst thing was his cat

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:25.760
 was called password. Wayne Rooney had his, his computer hacked, and his password was Stella Atoa.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.080
 You know what, helping yourself when you're him with the stereotypes, are you? No, doing that.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:42.240
 Other beers are available. Interesting naming traditions. So the Amazonian Amondarward tribe,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.000
 when you say you get your name at birth, and then when your younger sibling is born, you have to give

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.360
 your name to that sibling and take on another name, and you have to constantly change your name

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.720
 throughout your life. And that's the tribe that doesn't have a concept of time, so they're really

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.200
 interesting because they don't have any words for like day, week, month. And so the only way they

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.000
 distinguish time is by like the stage of life that you're at. So you get a new name for whatever stage

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.600
 of life you're at. So if you graduate, you're called like history degree. I don't know how many history

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.200
 degrees they're getting, but wait, do you have to change your name until your parents have their last

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.400
 child? I understand that right. So yes, you do. As soon as one of the family changes the name,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.360
 often the rest of the family also has to change their name. So even if you were 30 and your parents

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:31.760
 had another child, all right, that's not likely. Wait. So you could change your name sort of 10, 20 years

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:38.160
 later. I guess sharpiness must have been really hoping that his parents had a big child. Come on, guys.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.280
 We're not going to do it, Son. You inherited your father's traits. I'm not going there again.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:53.040
 My favorite pop star name change. I've done a few in the podcast, so I can't say that loud now,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.320
 but what I discovered recently, Michael Bolton, that's not his real name, Michael Bolton's. What?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:06.080
 Real name is not Michael Bolton. What is it? It is Michael Bolton. He lost an O from it, a single O,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.440
 and he lost it. And there's another singer called Michael Bolton, who's a country singer in America,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.040
 who they keep asking him like, obviously, you're trying to make a career in music and you're

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.240
 called Michael Bolton. Why have you not changed your name? And his answer was, why should I change it?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:28.800
 He's only socks. Very strong principles. It's not going to work in the sales, but I found a thing

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:38.880
 about Viking mice. Right, or bear with me. There is such a thing as Viking mice. So all the mice in

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:46.960
 Scotland and Ireland and bits of Wales are Viking ones because they're directly descended from Norwegian

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:54.400
 house mice and they came over with the Vikings and they were much more effective than the weedy Anglo-Saxon

00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:02.560
 mice. That's how they think they know that the Vikings lived in Scotland and Ireland first in

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.040
 enough density to support house mice because the house mice only live somewhere where either you get

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.200
 quite a dense concentration of people. So that's how they know that the Vikings were hardy enough

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.040
 to live there. It's because their mice went there with them and they lived there in enough numbers

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:21.440
 to support them. Viking mice is amazing, yeah. Vikings are quite cool. So they have a god of skiing,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.560
 don't they like? They have a god and a goddess of skiing. They have the god of skiing who is

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:34.400
 Ulur, U-D-L-L-R, always pictured with skis and a bone arrow and then the proper skiing equipment.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.280
 Hey, are you going out on the slopes? Don't forget your bow and arrow.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.040
 Yeah, goddess Skade, not they weren't in a relationship or anything but yeah, she was the same,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.960
 always on skis, always bone arrow and she married another god called Njord and they split up because

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.920
 they had a bit of fight about the fact that he loved the coast and she loved the mountains and skiing.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.240
 So that's in Norse mythology and Skade is where the word Scandinavia comes from.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.160
 That's my very name. Goddess of skiing. That's cool. So the Vikings had quite a cool way of making

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:20.240
 fire, fire that could last a long time where they collected fungus called touchwood from trees

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.400
 and then they would like bash it down and then they lit it, only then they boiled it in water for a few days

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.680
 and then they lit it and instead of catching fire properly it just kind of, what's it called,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.840
 kind of smoldered and then it would last a few days and it would be a useful fire they could take on

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:44.160
 ships and stuff. I was reading today that fire is a problem on Antarctica, apparently, because you

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:50.720
 want to think it would you because it's cold. Is that melting? No, because it's so dry and like a lot of

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.880
 wind which can blow the fire somewhere. So if you, yeah, it's one of the things I'm most worried about

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:01.680
 on Antarctica is fire. They have a fire department. Is it fire brigade? Really? Yeah, yeah.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.240
 Antarctic fire department. Because they're a bit, because the dryest place in the world is in Antarctica

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.560
 isn't it? It is. So are these valleys, which drive valleys. Never get any, haven't had any rain for

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:18.400
 two million years and even then it wasn't much. Yeah, muggy, yeah. So we need to move on, guys.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.360
 Oh, really? Do you think about any last things you want to get in? I just have one more thing about

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.560
 a different type of Vikings. It's a bit sad. The Minnesota Vikings, I'm an American football fan

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:35.520
 and there was a Minnesota Vikings fan who vowed to let his beard grow until his team won the Superbowl

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:45.680
 and he died in 2013 with a 38 year old beard. So sad. We salute him. Yeah, what a dude. It's amazing.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:51.520
 I found one last fact that I want to add, which is from, we're at the book festival. It's from

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:58.800
 our new QI book. This is the fact and it's to do just with names. Johnny Cash is a state once

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.760
 refused permission for his hit Ring of Fire to be used in a commercial for hemorrhoid cream.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:12.080
 That's wonderful. Good decision. Should we move on to fact? Yeah, let's go. Okay, time for fact number

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:18.240
 two. That's my fact. And as we saw at the top, all of our facts come from this new book that we've

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:26.720
 done. There's 1,411 facts in this book. I, after much, much work, only managed to get one fact

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:39.120
 into this book. I wait till you hear it. And this is my fact. And it concerns the model Jordan.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:47.680
 Otherwise, it was Katie Price. Why, why did you only get one end? They were all about Jordan,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:57.440
 all 900 dance submitter were about. So by fact, this week is, you only live once, is Katie Price's

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:10.160
 fourth autobiography. And that's on page 334. Should be on page three, shouldn't they, really?

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:17.600
 Is there any sign in it that she's aware of the irony of it? Like, is it a humorous ironic

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.360
 comment on modern-day celebrity autobiographies that she's making? Of course there is. It's Katie Price.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:30.320
 Yeah. Have you read it? No, I don't see. In fact, I'm pretty sure she hasn't because she was

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.080
 promoting her new autobiography, her fifth autobiography. And they asked her, where does it pick up

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.040
 from? And she said, it picks up from the amazing ending of my last book, which I think was about

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.040
 when I broke up. No, I stopped reading it there. I was like, you cannot say where I think about

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.280
 your own life in a book. Like, that's unacceptable. But that's, yeah, I just love it. You didn't get

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:57.600
 a hit or a man tell going, I think it was Cromwell. I was he dead yet? I'm not sure it happened to

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.880
 you Winston Smith. Anyway, ask me when we opened the box. Katie Price has written more books than

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.520
 Shakespeare wrote plays. Well Shakespeare didn't write any plays, really. And I know if you're right,

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:13.040
 Katie Price hasn't written any books. They should meet. They should meet. They would get along like a

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.360
 house on fire. She admitted it. She has admitted it. She had a quote when she was talking about a book.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.000
 She said, I'm not going to lie. I don't sit there with a typewriter and write it. So this is someone

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.560
 who still thinks you write a book with a typewriter. I don't want to knock her, by the way. We don't

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.360
 do that on this show. I don't want to knock her. But apparently it's full of good facts. They did.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:45.520
 Yeah, everyone's laughing because she said knock her. So this is another thing that she, so Katie Price,

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.560
 I mean, there was an interesting thing. It actually has gone out on the latest QI book. Sorry, no,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.160
 it's on the latest QI episode about Katie Price, which is actually outsold all of the booker list,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.840
 didn't she, at one point? Yeah. I mean, so she sells massive, which is insane. But all of them are

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.480
 ghostridden. She's admitted that they're ghostridden and ghostriding is just ginormous. Now ghostriding

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.280
 is so big at the moment. This is insane. They've started outsourcing it to other countries. So they

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.240
 go to the Philippines for ghostriding now. Celebrity order biographies get sent to the Philippines and

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.640
 they have people that just cannot be true. Are they good at writing ghostriding on the Philippines?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.680
 Yeah, quite a lot of people do admit to not reading their autobiographies, don't they?

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:31.280
 New and mechanicals as well. What does he say? Oh, he had a great book. He said, I know that many of you

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.680
 are looking forward to reading this book. So am I. So am I. Oh, here is very good. I can't

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.160
 make it to read it. Yeah. Noomi Campbell. Models obviously don't like to read there in autobiographies.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.760
 No. And Barry Madelow didn't write the song. I write the songs.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.720
 Oh, yeah. That's true. That's true. That's true. That's an actual fact.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:56.720
 The first ever autobiography was ghostridden. Well, the first ever autobiography was the Bible.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:25.760
 The first ever autobiography was written by someone called Marjorie Kemp, and it was written in the 1400s,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.240
 and she was an illiterate woman who wrote the whole thing in the third person, and so she said it.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.680
 Have you? Have you? Yeah. What? I didn't English degree, and they make you read a lot of

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:43.120
 yeah, it's not very good. Oh, it's really not. There's no, I'm not. I had to not Marjorie Kemp. We

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:50.000
 don't do that on this podcast. She spends maybe three or four hundred pages crying and weeping.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:57.600
 All the words are smiling. Yeah, it's very hard going. It's really with her because she imagines

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.600
 herself married to Jesus and lying in bed there with him, and it's a very strange text in lots of

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.720
 different ways. Yeah, that's not funny. It's just, it's just true. She was from Lancashire,

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.040
 wasn't she? I think she was. I think the words. Yeah. She like a wise woman or something. Yeah,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.280
 she was like a prophetess or yeah, who had a religious awakening. It's very interesting,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:23.280
 but at the same time, it's also quite boring. A surprising amount of people used to do ghost writing,

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.680
 so Mozart used to do ghost writing. Really? Yeah, yeah. He'd write, he would be commissioned by

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.560
 other people. They'd put their names to it. Mozart would then provide the music for it. Yeah, Charles

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:39.680
 Dickens' very first book. It was a book that he ghost wrote for a clown called Gromaldi. Just going

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.800
 back to Mozart, when he first played in Europe, he was very young, like nine years old or something,

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.840
 and everyone thought he was a dwarf in disguise. Yeah, it was written that they thought he was.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:22:04.080
 If you're going to disguise a dwarf, you don't make him the same height. Yeah, that is a good point.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.640
 Yeah, that's true. That is true. How do you make him tall? You can't stretch a person as part

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:18.800
 of a disguise. Stilts. Oh, put him far away on a hill, so no one can tell. With a small piano, right?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:29.840
 Gary Brown started as a stilt walker. Gary Brown. He just stretched him on the rack for 20 years.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:35.680
 Someone who doesn't stretch his body is Superman. Remember that? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, so as part of

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.440
 Superman's disguise, he puts on his glasses, but he can also make his spine two inches smaller,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.680
 so he kind of goes smaller. When he becomes Clark Kent, he's shorter as Clark Kent, so people

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:56.320
 for extra realism don't tell. I mean, he's not real. That was going to be my fact next week.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:07.840
 Damn it. I have a few good titles of autobiographies, which I just really like. Colonel Sanders wrote one

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:21.200
 called Life as I Know It has been finger-licking good. Leonard Nimoy wrote one called I Am Not Spock,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:29.360
 and then a follow-up called I Am Spock. I've read them both. It's really good. Highly recommend them,

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.160
 book festival, free them. I sit next to each other reading I Am Spock and Marjorie Kemper.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:42.880
 And Judge Judy, anyone know Judge Judy? American two sort of weary ascent. Judge Judy wrote one

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:50.320
 called Don't Peel My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining, which is apparently an American idiom,

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.120
 and don't lie to me. Have you? Don't piss up my back and tell me it's Raining.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:02.720
 Might be a Bolton thing. In Bolton, it's necessary to say that.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:15.200
 In 2010, a man was caught masturbating to Alan Sugar's autobiography in Crawley Library.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:24.800
 The man was cautioned and banned from returning to the library. Was the book cleaned afterwards?

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:35.200
 He was no more information. In 1979, Gerald Ford released his autobiography and Betty Ford,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.760
 his wife was releasing hers at the same time, and his was called A Time To Heal the autobiography

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.120
 of Gerald Ford, and hers was called The Times Of My Life, which obviously sounds much more fun,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:50.320
 and for that year, for Gerald Ford's 64th birthday, Betty gave him a t-shirt that read,

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:56.640
 "I bet my book will outsell yours." That's just quite sweet. And it did. It stood out by a long way.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.840
 Wow. Yeah, so good prediction. Yeah. And then next year, the t-shirt said,

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.040
 "Told you?" Yeah. And then they divorced. And then they didn't.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.320
 Alec Baldwin wrote one which sold 12 copies in its first month, which is amazing. And it has an

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.640
 amazingly bad title. It's called A Promise to Ourselves, colon a journey through fatherhood.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:24.960
 Yeah, that's the nice idea. It's not true that the Bruntay sisters, their first book of poetry,

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.160
 there were three of them wrote it, and they only sold two copies. So they didn't even buy one each.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.200
 In the first year, it took a year to sell two copies. Unbelievable.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.200
 Well, they lived together. You can share. Yeah, you're right. I like the fact that autobiographies used

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.320
 to be called Apologia, didn't they? When so, when you look back to antiquity, then it was always

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.960
 Apologia, which was sort of apologising for what you've done wrong, which seems like much more people

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.440
 should do rather than, you know... It was kind of false modesty. Yeah, it was. It was usually a

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.800
 justification of what all their critics are named at them, and explaining that it was, yeah.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.920
 But Augustine as well, who a lot of people say is the first autobiography of kind of a non-classical

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.600
 age. His was just cool confessions, and that was his explaining, all the stuff he'd done wrong,

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.000
 and not even stuff that he remembered. So chapter one of Augustine's autobiography was him saying,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.360
 "When I was a child, I don't really remember it very well, but I know I will look into

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.880
 committed loads of sins, and for that I'm really sorry. I feel terrible about it. Don't know what

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:29.440
 they were, but I'm sure I did. I'm really, really bad. Sorry guys." Wow. Yeah, no.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.080
 John Henry Newman, who's an eminent Victorian wrote one in 1864, which is called Apologia,

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:40.480
 Pro Suavita, or Apology for His Life, which sounds very sarcastic. Sorry about my life, guys.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:49.520
 We should move on. Yeah, we're going way over here. Anything else, Andy? One more? No.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.560
 I got a couple of interesting things, which I didn't know, which is... So there's a number of things

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.800
 that are happening. You have Ghost Riding, which is obviously just Ghost Riding, someone's

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.200
 autobiography. There's a term in the music world, which is called a Hummer, and Hummer is someone

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.960
 who takes claim of having written a tune on a movie. So, like, back when Charlie Chaplin used to make

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.000
 his movies, he always said, "Ridden, directed, music by." He would go around, say, he'd walk up to a musician

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.040
 who he'd hide and go, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm." Good luck. And then he would take claim for having

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.680
 written that song, and that's called a Hummer. A Hummer who takes someone who takes claim for a song,

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.760
 "Oh, what a humm that they'd done to say..." Hang on, because they hummed near somebody who wrote

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:33.040
 something. Yeah, exactly. No, no, they would hum an initial tune and say, "Build on it," and then

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:40.160
 they would do it. So, it's Ghost Riding, it's fake. And also, I was really surprised by this. There's

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.720
 script-doctoring, which is done as well for Hollywood movies, and obviously that is done a lot of the time,

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.120
 but I didn't know these famous people were involved with it. So, Tom Stopbard, we own a Tom Stopbard.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.960
 Tom Stopbard was a Ghost Rider in the movie sense. So, script-doctor for Indiana Jones and the

00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:02.480
 last crusade, for the Bourne Ultimatum, and for Star Wars 3, Revenge of the Sith. Oh, isn't that amazing?

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.760
 Yeah. It's amazing in the way that I don't believe it. No, it's true. Yeah, it's absolutely true. And

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:13.440
 also, Carrie Fisher, speaking of Tom Stopbard and Star Wars, Carrie Fisher, Princess Leia of Star Wars,

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:21.120
 actually Ghost Riding, most of Tom Stopbard's plays. She did script-doctoring for Sister Act,

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:27.360
 lethal weapon 3, last action hero, the wedding singer, and she wrote all of Tinkerbell's dialogue

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.760
 in hook. Well, Carrie Fisher's on the Christmas episode of QI this year, isn't she? Yeah.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.720
 Well, if I'd have known that, I'd have got her to write the scripts instead of spending all that time.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:43.920
 Okay, we should move on. Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Jonsinski.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:52.080
 Yeah, my fact from the book is that William Morton, father of Anesthesia, first experimented on himself,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.400
 but kept falling asleep before he could describe the results.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:09.200
 Day 9, very optimistic a purchasing. That's amazing. Yeah, he loved experimenting on himself and

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:16.240
 various things. So this was in the late 1830s, 1840s, and he was experimenting with Ether, and he

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:22.080
 also experimented on his wife's chicken. He cut off its crest to see if it would be in pain,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.080
 which she said that it wasn't. It's psychopathic. What do you even know this one? I'm just cutting

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.560
 bits off and it was painful. How does he know? It's right. He's like, yeah, did that hurt?

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.280
 No, okay. I'll keep going. He spoke chicken because it's one of his gifts. Yeah, experimented on a

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:46.000
 goldfish, on the pet dog, on various pets, on his students. We're not still cutting things off,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.120
 are we? Yeah, just decapitated. No. Because people tended not to want to volunteer themselves,

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.560
 but eventually he had to get a volunteer because he did keep falling asleep. So once his wife walked

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.960
 into the room and found him unconscious on the floor and had to rouse him and he'd been asleep for

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.960
 about 12 minutes, and he said he thought he probably would have died, had she not interrupted.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.480
 His wife went through a lot. So his wife said, he was obviously quite a strange character, loved

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.640
 these kind of grotesque experiments on himself and things around him. His wife said,

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.680
 "Never shall I forget my sensation as a young bride at sleeping in a room where a tall,

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.400
 gaunt skeleton stood in a big box in the head of the bed, which I dislike as the image of

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:34.400
 coming home on your wedding night." And he goes, "What's that? It's like a mistake. Just a human skeleton

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:41.200
 that he kept by his bed." Amazing. Yeah, deal breaker, I would say, but whatever. Well, what you're already

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:50.400
 married, it's too late. Picky, picky, picky. But yeah, so it says in the book Father of Anesthesia,

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.440
 and he's quite controversial, so for any like Horace Wells lovers out there, I understand that

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.120
 Horace Wells was the guy who experimented with nitrous oxide, which turned out to be more

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.080
 effective in a lot of ways, as an anesthetic, but he was unfortunate because it seemed to be working,

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.120
 so he decided to do a public demonstration of how effective an anesthetic this was in 1845,

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.280
 and he slightly misjudged the amounts he had to give him the length of time he had to give it for,

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.920
 and this public demonstration ended in like the screening hysterical, agonized fit of the person in

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.720
 question, so everyone went home and said, "Well, this is rubbish, isn't it? That's not. There's not

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:29.440
 tried this." There was a lot of surgeons didn't really like an anesthetic at the start. Not sure how

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.840
 I said this before, but there was a Russian surgeon called Nikolai Pregov, and he didn't like using

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.960
 laughing gas because he was accustomed to the screams and reactions to pain of his patients,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:45.280
 and found it much more difficult to operate on an unresponsive body. Yeah, but apparently he

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.680
 wasn't alone, like a lot of surgeons like to know that if you prod this bit someone scream and say,

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.920
 "No, it's not the right thing." They said, "It guided the scalpel." A lot of people don't go there, okay?

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:02.400
 Yeah, there was a French surgeon called Magendy who thought it was ridiculous all this

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.120
 experimenting with anesthetics because he said the pain was essentially irrelevant and it was

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.320
 barely worth noting the pain of actual surgery, and I've looked into him and he was never operated on,

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:18.800
 so I... But then a lot of religious, a lot of Christians thought that it was what got intended

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:24.560
 for us and that it was kind of anti-Christian to... Suffering and bearing children. Exactly. Yeah.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:31.680
 Very controversial. Before they had, before, Maulton got involved, and kind of

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.080
 before Wells got involved as well, they just had laughing gas shows, which just traveled to the

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:41.360
 country across America, so supposed professors would travel from town to town, giving lectures,

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.520
 and then just put people under laughing gas, and then people would laugh and then stagger about,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.200
 and then fall over and talk rubbish, and yeah, and they just happened on the pavement, and it was

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.000
 at one of these that Horace Wells noticed that someone had a painful accident and didn't flinch,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.960
 and so he thought, "Oh, well, I'm going to go and try this. I'll try this out on people."

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.440
 And the next day he had one of his own wisdom teeth taken out under the influence of nitrous oxide,

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.600
 and that's what set him off on the whole... Wow. It took a long time, didn't it, because when was

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.800
 what's called nitrous oxide, Humphrey Davy? That was the 1790s, wasn't it, when he was dealing with

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.560
 laughing gas, and it wasn't until the 1840s, though. So for ages, they've just laughed for 50 years,

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.440
 just going, "There must be a use to this." At the moment, I ran a really good, so James has

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.240
 got us a subscription to the British newspaper archive, which if anyone wants to, I would highly

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.760
 recommend, because it's so fun, so I looked up, "Well, you're going to offer everyone your log in these

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:45.600
 times." James Argon... No. His cat's name, 123. So there was a letter written to the Liverpool

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.160
 Mercury in 1824, and this was in the era when a lot of people were going to shows and having

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.240
 nitrous oxide tried on them, and it was by someone who'd been to one of these shows, and he tried

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.720
 nitrous oxide, and he wrote a letter to the paper, saying, describing it, saying,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.720
 "The sensation somewhat resembled those I've experienced when coming in for a share of

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:08.640
 super fine wine, which wine at most resembles, I cannot determine, but if you or any of your friends

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:13.200
 are anxious to have the point settled, you have only to send me a few specimens of superior champagne

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:24.960
 or burgundy." I'm really obsessed with people who do self-experimentation, because it feels like

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.720
 it was a long-gone era where they were doing it, and now you look at the news almost virtually

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.880
 every day, and it just seems to be going on more and more, people just going into their own world,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:40.400
 not asking for permission. The guy, Barry Marshall won the Nobel Prize. What are your countrymen?

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:47.120
 Yeah, an Australian, fellow Australian, won the Nobel Prize for trying to explain that you all

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.000
 know this better, so why don't you just say this? Yeah, a lot of people know it. I guess it's, so he won

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.640
 the Nobel Prize because he proved that stomach ulcers were caused by a bacteria called Hylio-Baptor

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:05.200
 Pylori, I think it's called, and he found that out by testing himself, by giving himself this bacteria,

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.680
 he and then he turned out that he did get these stomach ulcers, and then he took some antibiotics,

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.040
 and it got rid of them, and it's not all stomach ulcers, but it's a lot of them.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.960
 Yeah, but he effectively, he should have died off the back of what the medical community thought

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.280
 would happen to him, so he just went, "Screw, I'm going to drink a petri dish for bacteria myself,

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.520
 and I'm going to do it to myself." I really admired that, but it has been going forever, and my

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.520
 favorite, ever self-experiment story is back from 2000 BC, it's from the Ming Dynasty, and it's a guy

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:38.960
 called Juan Hu from China who decided to become the first-ever astronaut. The announcement is

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:45.680
 like going to be the first-ever astronaut, isn't it? It was Ming Dynasty. Good grief. Yeah, so he

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.640
 decided he was going to be the first-ever astronaut. They have rockets, and did they? What they did have was

00:35:51.600 --> 00:36:01.520
 fireworks, so they had some rockets. So he sat on a chair and attached to the chair, 47 rockets.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:12.720
 He had 47 attendants candle ignite, the 47 rockets. There was a massive explosion, and neither one who

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:19.760
 or the chair were ever seen again. So they might be in space. It could have worked.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.880
 It could have worked. I thought they did that in the movie, but that would have been pretty good.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:32.240
 The press announcement from Pixar. Sorry, we really cocked up this time. I tried to send a character

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:38.640
 into space. He's dead. The chair's gone as well. No, no, no one really agrees that this definitely

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:44.560
 happened. It's definitely apocryphal. But at the same time, there is a crater on the moon named

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:51.840
 one who was created by his impact. As a crater, yeah, spoken to my friends.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.640
 Okay, some more self-experimenters. Herbert Woolard and Edwin Carmichael did some experiments in 1933,

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.680
 and they wanted to know how it felt to put certain pressures on the human testes.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:13.680
 And so they placed weights on the testes, and they explained how it felt. So I'll give you some of

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:19.760
 the things they said. Three hundred grams, slight discomfort in the right groin area.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.560
 Five hundred and fifty grams, definite discomfort in testes in the region,

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.560
 followed by a dull ache in the right lumbar region dorsally. Sure, we stop now. No, let's keep going.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.240
 I don't know. I'd like to stop. No, we're going on.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:40.560
 And then when they got up to eight hundred and fifty grams, there's a quote of what he said,

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.360
 and he exclaims at once, that is quite different from the left side.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:56.080
 Wow, good understanding. So speaking of crushing testicles, do you guys

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:07.520
 do you guys know Auguste Beer? No. So he's someone who pioneered the cocaineisation of the spinal

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:13.040
 cord in like 1898, which is where you inject cocaine into your spinal fluids, and it has a numbing

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:18.000
 effect, and it was quite successful. So he and his assistant, Auguste Hildebrand, decided to try it out.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.200
 First of all, his assistant was supposed to try it out on him and use the wrong size syringe

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.080
 for the needle, which meant that he injected Auguste spinal cord, and his spinal fluid just

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.240
 spouted out all over the room, because it didn't fit the, well, this is useless, and then he was

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.400
 drained of all this spinal fluid. So they couldn't try that again. So they switched places, and the

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:42.000
 assistant agreed to have him inject his spinal cord. I would not switch places with someone who's

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.520
 spinal fluid, I'd just wasted. I would feel very bad about that. So they did it, and it was quite

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:56.560
 successful. I was very successful. He lost all the feeling in his legs, and so he did it worked.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:02.800
 Auguste kicked stabbed, bludgeoned, and burned his shins, plucked out his pubic hairs,

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.240
 stabbed out cigars on his leg, and then crushed and tugged his testicles. Right, yeah, that's what

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:16.400
 happened. This is for my spinal fluid. So he felt nothing, so he thought this has been great,

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:22.480
 and they celebrated by getting really pissed and smoking loads of cigars. They woke up the next day,

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:28.880
 and apparently it was awful, and they felt like hell for five minutes. Apparently that's a

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.680
 common side effect of loss of a cerebral spinal fluid, I guess, combined with quite a bad hangover.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.880
 You guys, we shouldn't have had that seven of the line of cocaine into our spines.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:47.280
 He was a seventh that did it. Wow. We need to move on, quick and tell you about one.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.040
 Of course, another self-experimenter. This guy is unbelievable. In 1804, he was an American

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.920
 student called Stubbins Firth, what a name. And he wanted to show that yellow fever was not

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:05.680
 contagious. And so he did so by, okay, brace yourselves, inhaling the vapor of sufferers simmering black

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:12.560
 vomit. He then injected the vomit into his own veins and into cuts on his arms, despite the fact

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:19.280
 that a dog he had injected had died within minutes. And then he smeared his body with patient's

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:26.720
 blood, sweat and urine, and drank patient saliva, blood and vomit. He didn't catch it because the

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:38.000
 samples came from late-stage patients who were no longer contagious. All the guy. All right, okay,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.760
 let's move on to our final fact. Time for a final fact. And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:51.120
 Okay, my fact is that Chessington World of Adventures banned animal onesies to stop the animals they're

00:40:51.120 --> 00:41:02.320
 getting confused. So did they genuinely get confused? I'm all confused by animal onesies.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:08.160
 So they weren't confused that it was another animal that was similar to it. It was just a

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.720
 way you were. They just thought, yeah, that's a poor fashion choice. I don't know why you've gone for that.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.360
 It was a temporary one to stop the, they had a new giraffe and a new rhino and they

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.200
 hired bouncers. And if you went in an animal onesie, apparently you were going to be given a gray boiler suit

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.120
 to put over it. So it was just, which one may you look more like a rhino?

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.760
 And a big pointy hat.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:38.000
 Why? We don't know. I don't know. She's exact says.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.400
 But there's an article in New Scientist about this. They asked an animal expert and she said some

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:47.600
 colorations do give warning signs to other animals and also that movement is the trigger. So big cats

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.760
 get interested if someone limps past their enclosure because they look weak. And then she said,

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.920
 possibly the worst thing you could do is limp past the lion enclosure in a zebra print out this.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.840
 What about climbing into it?

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.280
 Also bad, also. Yeah, sorry. Second worst thing, limp past.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.720
 Since 2012, the company Kigoo, who make onesies, have sold twice as many panda onesies as

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:20.560
 that are pandas. It's easier to make a panda onesie to be fair. So I'm just saying you don't have to

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.480
 put two panda onesies together and leave them for five years or how long it's going to take.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.560
 A panda onesie is more keen to shag each other. It's not what you're saying, than pandas.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:35.280
 Much easier. What they did, if we talked about the zoo in China that tried to disguise really crap

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:41.600
 animals. This is a really great animal. In the Henan province, I feel like we might have a zoo.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:49.360
 They tried to dress up a Tibetan mastiff as an African lion. Rats posed as snakes, dogs dressed

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:56.480
 up as leopards. In an effort to save face, the zoo's animal department chief claimed the real lion

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.560
 had been temporarily sent to a breeding facility. Well, they didn't explain why there was a mastiff

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.640
 dressed up as a lion in the lion's enclosure. By the way, we've got Mozart playing today. You should

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:15.760
 come and see him. They do, but they do. When you start to Google zoos and people dressing up as

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:21.440
 animals, most of the articles that come down are from the idea that it's the zoo people who are

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:27.440
 dressing up. So there were pandas, talking pandas. They had a small baby panda that was born and

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:33.680
 they wanted to put it into the wild. So all of the zookeepers dressed up as pandas. So they didn't

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.640
 think that there was human contact going on. So maybe it does actually confuse the animal. I don't know.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:43.600
 We're not giving them much credit. Animals are very good at recognizing each other. They're a lot

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.000
 of animals. I think we talked about wasps last week that they can recognize each other's faces. So if

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.480
 you put wasps in a maze and you show them a photograph of one wasps face that leads to something

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.840
 bad and one wasps face that leads to something good, then they learn the wasps face and learn to

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.800
 like go that direction rather than the bad wasps face. I don't know what happens when they meet those

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:10.000
 wasps in real life and have you hurt all you can lead me down a bad way. But yeah, sheep are really

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.920
 good at recognizing each other, which is weird because they all famously look the same.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:22.960
 Now you're being a sheep racist. I'm a sheep. Yeah, if you show sheep, so I think they

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:28.480
 experimented on 50 sheep and if you show them a picture of one sheep like two, a couple of sheep faces,

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:33.120
 then they can always identify the one that's associated with something good or 85% of the time I

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.920
 think they identify the one that's associated with something good. So yeah, I don't think animals are

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:43.520
 being confused by humans dressed in furry suits. All right, well then in a different case at a zoo

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.680
 in Tenerife, they have a thing, they do this in zoos now where they dress up

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:54.880
 certain members of the team as an animal and get them to try and escape the zoo. And the costume bit.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.560
 The costume bit is just just to add effect and fun for them to do.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.440
 Well, what's the, what's the, what's the purpose of this? Well, in case in case it's a test if a gorilla

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.440
 escaped from an enclosure and it started running out how they could have an emergency,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.000
 yeah, they have an emergency routine if something escapes and they have to make sure that they know what

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.480
 they're doing so. Yeah, but a go into gorilla suit can't rip someone's arm off. So they add extra realism

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:25.040
 by ripping someone's arm. Yeah, they do. Well, what happened in this case is one of the zookeepers

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.520
 wasn't told this was happening. So they're really escaping and shot a tranquilizer dart into the

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:36.000
 person. Genuinely, this was this year. They had to, they had to bring them to hospital and

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.400
 bring them back to. That's amazing. So evidently, animals are better at noticing

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:47.680
 humans dressed up as animals than humans are. Yeah. In 2008, if you rang up Dublin Zoo,

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:53.200
 you would get an answerful message saying, if you are calling to speak to Mr. Rory Lyon,

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.280
 C Lyon, G Raff, or anyone similar, please be aware that you have picked him of a hoax message.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.840
 Yeah, or perpetrating one. That's true. That's exactly what I would do if I had thought of it.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:18.480
 So I really like history of zoos as well. So when London Zoo was first opened, it was obviously

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:25.040
 much more wild westy than modern zoos. So they just had, they thought they would use zebra's to pull

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.800
 people around in passenger carts and carriages and things. You could play with the bears sometimes.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.000
 I just let you play with the bears and they didn't have proper vets, you know, they just,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.120
 and also, sorry, they were the bears. Yeah, that's never going to end well.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:48.400
 And they died in their hundreds. A female seal disappeared two weeks before the ground opening

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.840
 and they only found it two days before the public first arrived. I don't know whether that- How does

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:57.840
 a seal escape? The sketchy on detail here. I don't know if it escaped the zoo or just was in the zoo,

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:05.120
 but not- But in the lion enclosure. The very first animal at London Zoo was a griffin

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.600
 voucher called Dr. Brooks, who was named after the anatomy teacher who had donated him,

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.680
 and his job used to be to eat the corpses when they were finished with. But then he had retired,

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.160
 so he didn't have a fresh supply of food. The corpses of the children who've been

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.440
 sent to play with the bears? No, sorry. We're in a different place. Dr. Brooks, anatomy school,

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.000
 he would dissect bodies and then afterwards he would- The voucher could have the rest, but after

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.480
 he retired, no more bodies, so he said, "We'll have to find a home for the voucher." Wow. Yeah.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:38.960
 One in eight British adults owns a onesie, don't they? That's in one of our five books.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:47.200
 So Dan, from us, Dan owns half of one. Yeah. Is that true? Yeah, just anyone here who wants to see?

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:54.800
 Sure, fans. Oh, that looks about right. Wow. Wow. One in eight. That's about 10. Yeah, 10 of a hundred people here. Yeah, that's like 30%. That wasn't 10.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.000
 Wasn't that? No, it wasn't. Was it more? Yeah. Any animal ones?

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.320
 Which animal? Wait, someone in the front row is wobbling his hand because he's not sure if it-

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.360
 He's Godzilla. Godzilla, a- An animal. It's a good question. Well, yeah. Yeah.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:15.280
 He's not an age to belong. Yeah. This is interesting.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:22.240
 This is one'sie hour on the- Yeah. You know, when you find yourself looking up really, really hopeful stuff

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.840
 for a QI research, so today I found myself looking up at one point. Animals dressed in human onesies.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:37.920
 Oh, please tell me that you found something. I didn't find anything. My God, if someone finds one, that would be good.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.720
 There's a sloth onesie you get. If slothes get minced, then you have to shave them from head to toe,

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:49.040
 but they need to remain warm, and so they've designed sloth onesies. There you go, actual onesies full sloth.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.440
 Yeah, that's cool. You're not a slowy, the worst human ones here, like in the sloth.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:59.280
 Well, also the worst for if you're trying to show a sloth escaping a zoo, because you could literally go

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.560
 home, come back the next day, and they've moved a meter. Like that's not the animal escaping. Sloths have

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.440
 lots of beetles living in their fur, so the onesies would have to be thick enough for all these beetles

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.800
 to live in, and lots and all sorts. You must be the worst onesie buyer. You're returning it to

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:20.160
 the store. I'm sorry, but this is not an accurate description of how slow. Where are the beetles?

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:25.520
 For the hell's going on here? It's a fucking joke. I might several attempts to lure beetles into my

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:33.360
 account, a few of them found it enticing prospect. Churchill had a onesie, Winston Churchill.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:40.480
 Yes, he called it his siren suit, because air raid sirens, he spent a lot of the second-mile

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:46.640
 wall working underground in the cabinet, wall rooms, and he had it especially designed. People

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.720
 have dressed this up, so they say he invented the onesie, which he did not, that's not fair,

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.240
 because it's like an adapted boiler suit, but it was auctioned recently for thousands and thousands

00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:00.880
 of pounds. Really? Yeah. It wasn't an animal. It wasn't an animal. Can you imagine?

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:07.280
 Churchill had a dog onesie, was he? When Churchill talks about his branched dog, he seems depression.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:15.040
 Oh, my black dog's back again. I imagine that in the dog onesie going, oh yes.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:22.080
 Okay, Chessington. Chessington wants a bunch of adventures.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:29.600
 They imply a lady who looks very nice called Lisa Briton, and her job is a bird's and the

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:38.960
 bee's consultant. Good because I have questions for her. Well, she's there to help children

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:44.080
 or immature adults. Thank you. And to tell them what's happening when they're walking past

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:51.360
 and the animals are having sex? Do she know when the animals are having sex in Russia?

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:57.840
 I can see it with a bank of CCTV screens. Wait, the two lions are at it, I must go.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:08.320
 She says she's most in demand around three species. The monkeys who have no shame and wave their

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:14.000
 monkey hood around as part of their courtship. The lions, because it's a noisy affair,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.840
 and the tortoises, because it's a very slow process, and they are not discrete at all.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:31.040
 That's amazing. I printed out the page for the history of Chessington Zoo, because they have

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:35.120
 a little timeline on their website, and I just want to share three entries with you from three

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.840
 different areas. It was a very interesting site. It was a civil war place, then it was an

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:43.440
 AL house, lots of stuff. Anyway, 1991. Following the development in 1990, there weren't any new

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:56.800
 attractions for 1991. 1992, 1992 was another year of little investment. 1993. Fifth dimension

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:10.720
 closed at the end of 1993. I've never been, is it fun? Is that a fun place?

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:16.400
 It is fun. It's great fun. There's a theme park I discovered. Dollyland. Do you guys heard of Dollyland?

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:27.280
 Is it Dolly Parton? Dolly Parton has a theme park, which I didn't know. I'm sorry Dollywood. Dollyland

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:39.440
 is a very different place. Dollywood, I'm so sorry. That's so awesome that you knew that. Dollywood,

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:50.480
 anyone want to have a guess of the opening hours of? It's 10 to 7. It genuinely is. Missed opportunity,

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:57.360
 I don't know what they were thinking. Listen, we need to wrap up really soon. Do we have any more

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.840
 final facts we want to throw into this? I quite like if we're talking about theme parks. I didn't know

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:07.040
 what the first ever roller coaster was, or the original roller coaster. See, are you thinking

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:19.360
 Russia? No, Russia, 1700s. Yeah, 1700s. They had Russian ice slides, and it was this

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.280
 fad in Russia. All the 1700s, Catherine, the great loved them. She had loads of them installed

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:27.760
 on her own property, and what they were were. They were structures that were up to 100 feet tall,

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.840
 and they were what they sound like. So you climb up a ladder, 100 feet, there's an ice slide,

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.440
 and you just slide all the way down it. People would have them installed in the halls of their

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.640
 stately homes, so you'd go into a stately home. There's a huge ice slide in the middle. That's great,

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.400
 so cool. Yeah, and then the French during the Napoleonic Wars saw these and thought that's really

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:50.160
 and tried them and said that's super fun, and then they... Yeah, that was the predominant

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:56.640
 emotion in Moscow in 1812. It was interesting. Well, they found a city and we're starving,

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:03.760
 these ice slides. So the French brought them back and then built the world's first roller coaster,

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:11.280
 and called it Russian Mountain in, yeah, homage. Good fact. Good fact. All right, that's it. That's our

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:20.000
 facts. Thanks so much for listening to that. That was... We went on way too long, but yeah, for those

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 listening to this and not in the room, if anyone in the room wants to ask us anything afterwards,

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.680
 we're going to be selling books downstairs, we're going to be hanging out downstairs, so join us,

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.280
 that'll be awesome. If anyone listening wants to ask us any questions about the things we've

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.240
 talked about, we're on Twitter. My hashtag... No, not my hashtag. I do have a hashtag, though, is... I don't.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:41.760
 That'd be the label saying, "Hey, my hashtag is... That would be terrible." My hashtag is Dolly Land.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:53.840
 Yes, my... Oh, yeah, it is a land, yeah. My Twitter name is @Sriberland, James @Xshaped, Andy.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:55:03.520
 @AndriHondaM. Anna, podcast@QI.com. Yes, or you can get us all together at @QIPodcast. That's our

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.480
 Twitter handle for the whole of us. We're going to be back again next week with another batch of facts.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.000
 Thanks for listening, and we'll see you again. Good night. Good night.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 [Applause]

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:34.000
