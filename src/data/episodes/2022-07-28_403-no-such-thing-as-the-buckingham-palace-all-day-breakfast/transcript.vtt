00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.320
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.720
 of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.880
 this week coming to you live from Oxford!

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 (audience cheering)

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.040
 (audience cheering)

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.680
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.160
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.200
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.920
 we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.440
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.840
 my fact this week is that the longest

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.440
 professional baseball match on record only lasted so long

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.880
 because the umpire's rule book was missing the bit

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.800
 that explained when a match should be stopped.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.560
 (audience laughing)

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.920
 - That's amazing.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.600
 I kind of think that an umpire should already know the rules

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.200
 by the time he's starting to umpire the game.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.040
 - Yeah, you would think.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 - Halfway through, he shouldn't be going,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.480
 "No, I'm just gonna check."

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.320
 - Well, this was unprecedented times in the baseball world.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.160
 So this was a match that was in April 18th, 1981.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.320
 It was the poor Tuckett Red Sox,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.120
 and they were playing the Rochester Red Wings,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.720
 and so these are smaller teams

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.760
 and a different league professional baseball players though.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.240
 And poor Tuckett, it was played there,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.360
 which is in Rhode Island.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.160
 Big deal for poor Tuckett, because the newspaper,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.800
 the next day, said not since the time

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.040
 that they had to shoot the drunken camel at the City Zoo,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.120
 (audience laughing)

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.240
 has there been this much excitement in poor Tuckett.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.480
 (audience laughing)

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.680
 - Yeah, but it was in 1981.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.240
 - 1981, so it sounds like a weird match from ages ago,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.720
 but quite recently really.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.600
 At the start of the match, there were 1700 fans watching.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840
 By the time the game eventually ended,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.120
 which was 4.07 in the morning,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.680
 there were 20 people left watching,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080
 still watching the match, 20,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.200
 which I feel is quite a lot.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 - I read that some of them were asleep.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.040
 - Oh, okay.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.320
 - They all got given a season ticket,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.160
 so it paid off for them.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.960
 - I think some of them got lifetime passes.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.480
 - Yeah, they did, that's true.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.840
 So it was the longest baseball match on the world,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.840
 which is eight hours and 25 minutes.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840
 It really isn't that long.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.520
 I think what makes it long.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.360
 - It's quite long.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.240
 - Well, come on, we're from a nation of cricket.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.320
 That was bullshit.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.560
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.520
 'Cause all the writing up,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.280
 like there was a player called Wade Bogues,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280
 who was 22 years old when the match started,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.700
 and by the time it ended, he was 23.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.120
 (audience laughing)

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.480
 - Wade Bogues is quite famous.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.280
 He became quite a famous player later.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.120
 - Did he?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.640
 But this didn't happen to land on the,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.600
 when it went past midnight, he turned 23.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.800
 The thing about this match was it was eventually stopped,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.640
 and they then resumed the match a few months later.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.560
 - Oh, you're kidding.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.880
 Oh, I thought it was just a midnight thing the birthday.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.720
 - No, no.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.880
 - But when they've carried on afterwards,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.240
 it took like about 18 minutes or something.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.980
 - Yeah, didn't they just have a school once, basically?

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.240
 And they did, and then that's over.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.000
 And there's sort of thousands of people flocked,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.440
 'cause by then it was almost as big news

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.640
 as the drunken camel thing.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.600
 So the entirety of the nation, practically,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.480
 was there for 18 minutes.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.880
 But Dan, what's the deal with the missing page?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.680
 Who's ripped out the crucial page?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.720
 - Yeah, we don't know if it was missing,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.220
 we don't know if they couldn't find it,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.720
 and just no one knew what to do.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.240
 And so there was actually someone

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.360
 that they were trying to call on a landline

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.080
 who was higher up, who just wasn't near their phone.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.720
 Also, it was 12 a.m. heading into 4 a.m. eventually.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.560
 So they eventually got through to him,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.600
 and they were like, "What do we do?"

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.560
 And he was like, "Stop the fucking match!

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.000
 "What are you doing?"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.880
 Why did they, why was it lasting so long?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.720
 Do we know? - So what happens

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.880
 in baseball is you have an innings and an innings.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.080
 You keep going with inningses until someone scores more

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.680
 than that innings than the other team.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.440
 You do a certain number that you're supposed to do.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.200
 And then if it's a tie, you just keep going

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.520
 until one team gets like sudden death.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.640
 And they just kept going,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.760
 nil nil, nil nil, nil nil, nil nil, nil nil.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.520
 And then there was a one,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.840
 and then the other team got a one.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.440
 And that was, it was Wade Boggs.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.720
 He kind of got a home run to tie that game.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.880
 And he said, "I didn't know if the guys on my team

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.840
 "wanted to hug me or slug me."

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.680
 - That's a great thing to say.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.000
 - Boggs, by the way, I just want to say,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.440
 because he is famous,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.440
 but the most thing I know about him

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.200
 is he once consumed 107 beers in one day.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.880
 - Whoa, for like charity or?

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.480
 - He was just thirsty.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.160
 - Sometimes people don't need an incentive, Dan,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.480
 to drink the 100 beers.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.120
 - He's famous as big drinker,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.480
 but then this is the record that his friend said

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.440
 and he's confirmed.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.280
 - Wow.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.080
 - But so the match itself, again,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.160
 I wish we hadn't told you it was just eight hours,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.200
 because when you hear the details of the match,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.840
 it does sound like it just went on for like a week.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.000
 So the accounts of the baseball players,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.440
 a very cold night,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.040
 the baseball players getting so cold

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.160
 that they were ripping up furniture from the dugout

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.000
 and burning it,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.120
 snapping used baseball bats in half

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.000
 and putting it in this bin of fire to stay warm,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.840
 to keep them going.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.360
 - If you can snap a baseball bat in half,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.120
 I don't think you'd need a fire.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.200
 I think you're fine.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.240
 - A jump rod.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.560
 These people are pathetic.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.400
 - I know.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.240
 - It was cold.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.200
 It was really cold.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.840
 And that was one of the problems.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.640
 It was a really windy day as well.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.000
 And so the problem was it kept being nil, nil, nil, nil

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.120
 because no one could get any home runs.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.720
 And the reason was they kept whacking it for miles and miles

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.800
 and the wind would just blow it back into the stadium.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.640
 - Oh.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.840
 - Were they playing with a boomerang?

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.680
 It turned out.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.320
 - Yeah, extraordinary game.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.400
 - It is quite pathetic.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.960
 If you look at sports matches of your,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.360
 where they basically,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.840
 before all these rules were codified for all the sports

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.320
 in sort of mid to late 19th century,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.720
 they just went on for days and days and days, didn't they?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.720
 You get football matches and rugby matches

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.520
 with hundreds of participants.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.680
 You'd have one village playing another village

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.720
 and they play from dawn until dusk

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.480
 for like four days straight.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.320
 It was great.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.400
 I think the first recorded football match ever

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.360
 in Sheffield in 1794, that was three days long.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.400
 And the match report said three days long,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.120
 a very good match and it felt necessary to note

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.080
 that although there were quite a lot of injuries,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.160
 no one was killed.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.240
 - But that's amazing 'cause that team,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.240
 before that game, they were called Sheffield Monday,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.080
 weren't they?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.600
 (laughing)

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.440
 - Very strong.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.640
 - But on the flip side,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.640
 you do get short baseball games as well.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.280
 And there is a record for shortest baseball game ever,

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.280
 which was in 1916 and the match lasted for 31 minutes.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.480
 And yeah, and that's really quick for baseball.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.480
 And the reason is both teams beforehand spoke to each other

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.400
 and realized they both had them trained to catch,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.960
 which was going quite early.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.800
 - No way.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.720
 - So, but the problem was for the fans who came to the match

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.680
 is that the game started 30 minutes early.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.920
 So the game ended before it was meant to start.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.320
 So fans rocked up and they're like,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.160
 "This is gonna be great."

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.320
 And then they saw like the final batter or whatever.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.800
 And then they all went off.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.640
 - That's bullshit.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.780
 I'm outraged for these people 105 years ago.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.080
 - Do you know the first ever baseball rule

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.160
 that was written down was that all players must be punctual?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.000
 - Really?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.920
 This is the oldest set of rules we have.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.560
 They're called the Nicarbaca rules.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.840
 They were written in New York.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.760
 But the thing was the teams were from New York,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.040
 but there wasn't much room to play in New York.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.040
 So they always played in New Jersey.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.440
 And so if you have to schlep all the way over the river

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.800
 to New Jersey, obviously you don't want people

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.200
 turning up half an hour later or an hour later or whatever.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.840
 So that's why that was the first rule.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.680
 - It was good, wasn't it?

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.280
 - Interestingly, a New Jersey is what these poor cold guys

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.560
 in the match we previously referred to need it.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.880
 - And also in those set of rules,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.800
 hitting the ball out of the stadium was a foul.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.360
 So you know in baseball now,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.780
 really what you're trying to do is whack it all the way out.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.800
 In those days, if you did that, you would be out.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.640
 And that's because the stadium was right next

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.960
 to the Hudson River and they couldn't afford

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.800
 to lose all the balls.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.400
 - So did the phrase, you knocked it out of the park,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.800
 have a negative connotation of those things?

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.720
 Idiot, you knocked it out of the park.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.880
 Now we've got to go and get it in the boat.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.360
 - There was one controversial rule book incident

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.200
 which I read about.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.840
 And this was a guy called Earl Weaver

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.340
 who was manager of the Baltimore Orioles.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.120
 And he had a real issue with umpires.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.800
 So I think he was managing in the 1970s.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.640
 He hated umpires.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.960
 He thought none of them knew the rules.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.280
 They didn't know what they were doing.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.440
 He got told off loads of times for once he pulled up third base

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.200
 and just walked off the pitch with it.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.000
 He wants, the description was he was told off

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.720
 for pecking at an umpire's chin

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.560
 with the beak of his baseball cap.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.060
 So they had a tense relationship.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.960
 Anyway, in 1979, he got in such a big fight

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.800
 with one of the umpires who basically hadn't called out

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.920
 what this guy thought was an illegal move of the oppositions

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.160
 that he went to the dugout, he got the rule book,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
 he marched back onto the field

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.440
 and he opened the rule book and started reading from it,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.200
 saying, look, you obviously don't know the rules, you idiot.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.520
 And the umpire got annoyed, understandably.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.720
 And so then he started tearing the rule book to shreds

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.640
 and throwing it all over the field in front of them.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.120
 - One of the other things, early baseball,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.440
 they never, so baseball players all have that cool glove

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.560
 that we get as kids when we're playing.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.400
 - The baseball glove.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.240
 - Yeah, that's what it's called.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.320
 - You don't mean the giant gladiator phone thing,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.520
 but you mean the phone thing. - No, I don't mean the audio thing.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.120
 - No, so those gloves, but in the early days of baseball,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.920
 that was seen as a very wimpy thing

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.120
 to have any kind of handwear.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.240
 So you would just have to use your hands.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.280
 But that was really damaging all the players

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.280
 because those balls, as we know, very hard

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.560
 and they're being walloped.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.200
 So that was a real risk when you were a baseball player.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.480
 And so it was a player, as far as one historian

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.200
 was looking and find this player called Charles C. Waite,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.160
 who was the first person who wore a glove.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.560
 But because he was so scared of being made fun for it,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.240
 he wore his skin tone color as the glove.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.320
 So he thought at that distance,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.040
 they might just think in the crowd,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.800
 "Oh, he's got slightly big hands."

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.000
 (audience laughing)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.160
 - But just one big hand.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.800
 - Just on the gloves and the catching and throwing.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.640
 - Yeah.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.960
 - So the world record for throwing and catching eggs

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.400
 was set by a couple of baseball players from New Zealand.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.240
 - What was it?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.600
 - I guess they're very practised at it.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.120
 Called Nick Hornstein and Ricky Pyeway in 2018.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.040
 - So is that like I throw an egg to you

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.480
 and you have to catch it and you have to be

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.560
 as far away from me as possible?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.400
 - Exactly.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.040
 - Does it matter how the egg is cooked?

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.560
 - It does, come on.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.160
 That would be very--

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.960
 - Frisbeer fried egg, come on, that's a challenge.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.960
 - It's 93.6 meters.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.800
 - Sounds boiled.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.200
 - Which is pretty, it was not, it was a raw egg.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.600
 And it was very impressive.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.800
 And this is at the World Egg Throwing Federation,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.240
 which is based in Swatton in England.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.480
 - We know where it's based.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.840
 - Sorry.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.360
 Anyway, it sounds like an incredible party,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.240
 the World Egg Throwing Championship.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.640
 So I was reading an account of it

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.760
 and I'm just gonna read you what happened on the day.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.400
 Former champ Norm Fowler of Peterborough

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.080
 won the Russian egg roulette.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.680
 No explanation in this article of what that is.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.960
 Then the Target Accuracy Contest,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.400
 throwing at male model Joel Hicks,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.640
 was won by Tina from Cambridge with two shots to the groin.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.640
 (audience laughing)

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.040
 - Listen, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.600
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.240
 - My fact this week is that when acorn woodpeckers

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.400
 fight each other, the rumour spreads through the community

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.320
 and other acorn woodpeckers turn up to watch.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.080
 (audience laughing)

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.440
 This is so cool.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.920
 So they're really social, they're the most social woodpeckers,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.320
 'cause a lot of woodpeckers are solitary, I'm sure you know.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.920
 And they love this spectator sport

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.640
 and they have these amazing battles over their territory,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.560
 their trees, their granary trees,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.920
 which are where they stockpile all their acorns.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.400
 And basically the trees are guarded by a group of males

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.600
 who are all brothers and then a group of females

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.840
 who are all sisters and they're all chagging each other

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.040
 as well as guarding the tree.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.560
 But they're not brothers and sisters with each other,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.000
 so there's no incest going on.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.240
 Anyway, when one gender dies out, when one sex dies out,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.080
 then there's a vacancy and so a bunch of female acorn woodpeckers

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.320
 will want to swoop in to claim that tree

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.240
 and these massive fights break out

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.240
 between the different claimants to the tree.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.560
 And yeah, people come from miles around,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.360
 not when I say people, I mean woodpeckers.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.200
 (audience laughing)

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.480
 - You've identified too closely

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.800
 with your research area this week, Anna, yeah.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.640
 - That's amazing.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.760
 - And they'll travel for a couple of miles

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.440
 and they'll spend like an hour a day

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.960
 just watching this big fight and they'll go back home.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.520
 And I think it's useful, they think,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.200
 'cause you can pick up social information,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.680
 spy out potential mates.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.520
 - But they leave their bit of tree

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.760
 that they're protecting in order to see this fight.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.920
 And it feels like that's the next little trick of evolution

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.680
 that you need to fake a fight

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.680
 and then send in your troops around the back.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.160
 - Or just like one acorn woodpecker

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.600
 who kind of goes around when everyone else is at the fight,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.800
 just stealing their acorns.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.240
 - Exactly, or claiming the trees, you know?

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.240
 - Oh yeah, you've broken the system.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.760
 - The fights, they last for a long time,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.360
 they last for about a day sometimes.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.720
 I know the woodpecker, the audience has come for an hour.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.960
 - Very much, it's last for five days, so.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.080
 - That's true, pathetic.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.960
 Yeah, this family strategy they have

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.960
 is pretty interesting,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.040
 the sort of incest avoidance thing they have

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.000
 because you get a breeding pair

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.200
 and then you get a load of babysitter,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.200
 let's say a load of babysitter males, okay,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.840
 who are the offspring of the breeding pair.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.680
 - Got it.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.840
 - Then the breeding female will die, okay?

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.280
 But that means that there has to be a new female.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.960
 However, the previous, the helper males,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.280
 the babysitter males, previously couldn't breed

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.560
 because the breeding female was their mother, okay?

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.000
 So, but now they're on equal terms with their dad

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.320
 because there's gonna be a new breeding female.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.560
 So now there is just a parity,

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.480
 so they're all gonna breed with the new female.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.360
 So finally, and this is good for obviously,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.680
 for the babysitter males who now can breed,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.840
 but it's also very interesting

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.000
 'cause it means these birds have an awareness

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.360
 of the relations of other birds to each other.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.280
 It's called triadic awareness.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.240
 And it's not a Woody Woodpecker though, is it?

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.360
 (audience laughing)

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.280
 - Does it make, do we know if it makes it

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.600
 an awkward father-son dynamic?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.360
 It's like if your parents divorce

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.080
 and then your dad marries a step-mom,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.960
 then you also shag the step-mom.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.800
 - Is it?

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.240
 - And that often creates tension.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.080
 - I think it does.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.320
 (audience laughing)

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.440
 - That's just why I wonder if it's the same.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.480
 - Yeah?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.400
 But it's so, yeah, like that family dynamic is so weird.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.960
 It's also the case that a few mums will also live

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.640
 in the same nest, right?

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.120
 And when that happens, and they're having eggs,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.320
 they try and synchronize eggs

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.480
 so that they don't have one child arriving before the other.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.680
 And what they'll do is if one of the mothers has an egg,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.520
 they'll knock the egg out just to make sure

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.360
 that that's no longer--

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.440
 - I think they might eat it.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they'll get the young instance.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.720
 - So if there are two breeding females--

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.560
 - Exactly.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.400
 - And they haven't synchronized

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.360
 when they're having their eggs,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.920
 the other one will push out or eat the egg of the first one

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.040
 until they get it right, until they get it all the time.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.960
 - Or, sadistically, feed it to the mother often, you know?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.760
 You've laid an egg and then your rival female pushes it out

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.400
 and then comes and feeds it back to you.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.040
 But it's all 'cause of this bizarre setup

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.040
 where they have up to seven males

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.760
 and up to three females in every crew, isn't it?

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.920
 So you've got these three rival females at all times,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.560
 constantly laying and killing each other's kids

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.920
 and laying and killing each other's kids.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.080
 - And it can be weeks, cannibalism for weeks

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.920
 and then you time it right and then happy families again.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.040
 - Yeah, it's like when your periods are synchronizing

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.880
 when women live together.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.480
 It takes a few months to get in sync.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.320
 - Yes.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.480
 - And you kill each other's periods

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.160
 until they all arrive at the same time.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.180
 - Yes. - Apart from, of course,

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.320
 that's a myth. - Ah.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.160
 - It's a myth women's periods don't synchronize.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.000
 - Is it?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.240
 Oh, yeah, you keep claiming it's a myth, but I,

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.880
 what am I, let's move on.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.200
 No, Dan, please don't. - Come on, Dan, please don't.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.160
 Well, my research has shown in the houses that I live in

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.800
 that there's something to it.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.800
 - Hundreds of thousands of houses, I'm sure.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.440
 - I had to move a lot of times to different houses,

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.640
 particularly when they found out

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.360
 of my period experiment I was conducting.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.880
 - The fights are pretty violent, though,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.760
 because I read one place that said the birds

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.080
 basically have spears for mouths.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.720
 And you'll see after the fights

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.600
 that the birds will have eyes gouged out,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.960
 blood all over them.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.080
 They'll fall to the floor holding each other's legs

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.920
 so they can't fly and they'll kind of crash to the ground.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.280
 So they're pretty violent.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.120
 - Wow.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.680
 - You can see why people go to watch.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.520
 - Yes.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.360
 - Yeah. - And by people, again.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.480
 (laughing)

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.760
 - They make a sound that goes like, "Waka, waka."

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.760
 - Oh, like Fosy Bear.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.280
 - Fosy Bear or Shakira were the only two I could pick up.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.400
 (laughing)

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.600
 - When will they duet?

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.280
 - What did Woody Woodpecker?

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.360
 - Yeah, exactly. - Is that in any way--?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.800
 - That was quite good, actually.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.640
 Not bad.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.680
 So the voice of Woody Woodpecker was a woman called Grace Lance.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.200
 She's also known by her stage name, Grace Stafford.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.760
 And what happened was they had another person

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.560
 who did the voice, I think it might be Mel Blanc,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.240
 but it was someone famous like-- - Yeah, he was the original,

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.400
 I think, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.480
 And then he decided he didn't want to do it anymore.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.520
 And she said, "Well, I'll do it.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.680
 "I do a really good impression.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.400
 "Not as good as Dan Shriver, but it's quite good."

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.120
 And her husband, who was producing it, said,

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.920
 "Nah, I don't think so.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.680
 "I think we're gonna tender for it."

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.240
 And so she then did an anonymous audition tape

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.320
 and sent it in with all the other audition tapes,

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.680
 and he still chose Woody Woodpecker.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.440
 - Wow, cool. - Impression.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.000
 And for the first something like 10 years or so,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.920
 eight years in fact, that she did it,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.120
 she didn't have her name on the credits.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.360
 And that was because she thought people would be disillusioned

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.360
 if they knew Woody was voiced by a woman.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.240
 - Right. - Wow.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.840
 - As opposed to a Woodpecker.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.280
 (laughing)

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.240
 Because I would be devastated as a child.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.640
 The trees are incredible, aren't they?

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.960
 You've got to look up the granary trees of Acorn Woodpeckers,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.000
 which they mostly keep in the California, Oregon area,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.080
 basically look like a tree that's surface

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.320
 is covered in crumpets.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.160
 - They look incredible.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.200
 They look like, you know, people who are scared

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.920
 of like little holes?

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.440
 Is it called trypophobia or something like that?

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.280
 They would hate these

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.360
 because it's just loads of little holes

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.880
 and each one is shoved an acorn into it.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.040
 - And they test them, they'll shove an acorn in

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.200
 and then they'll practice trying to get it out.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.960
 And if it's too easy to extract the acorn

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.200
 from the little hole they've made,

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.280
 they abandon the hole.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.080
 That's gonna be too easy to steal.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.120
 - But it keeps changing because the holes

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.520
 always change size, 'cause trees change size.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.400
 Trees are always growing and shifting a bit

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.880
 and acorns dry out, so they will change size when they do.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.000
 So it's a nightmare.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.920
 So they spend all of their bloody time moving.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.680
 It's not funny, there are up to 50,000 holes in a tree, guys.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.760
 Guys, please take it seriously.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.560
 50,000 acorns in a tree, it's just you

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.120
 and your brothers and your three weird wives.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.920
 And you have to, it takes 20 minutes to make one hole.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.320
 There are 50,000 holes in the tree

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.360
 and you're constantly moving the acorns

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.000
 to a better fitting hole.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.360
 It's awful.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.960
 I would want to die in a fight.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:52.080
 - Okay, look, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.120
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.560
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the world's largest

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.000
 carpet museum is shaped like a giant roll of carpet.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 (audience laughing)

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.560
 For people at home, we've just put a picture of it

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.600
 on the screen, and I think that undeniably looks

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.920
 like a giant roll of carpet.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.760
 - Yeah, it's awesome.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.840
 It's really amazing.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.280
 - Yeah, so this is in Baku in Azerbaijan,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.680
 and this is something that I noticed

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.040
 when I was reading about a carpet war,

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.480
 between Azerbaijan and Armenia,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.680
 on top of the actual war they're having.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.000
 - But the carpet war...

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.360
 - They're not the most lethal weapons, are they?

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.320
 - But you can carpet bomb somewhere, I suppose.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.280
 - Yeah, I think you got confused.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.800
 - So these are carpets that come from an area

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.640
 called Nagano Karabakh,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.440
 which is a disputed territory between the two places.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.480
 Armenian weavers are claiming that the Azerbaijan

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.400
 government is appropriating their culture,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.160
 because basically most people, most historians,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.640
 not all of them, but most historians,

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.920
 think that these are Armenian-based carpets,

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.160
 but Azerbaijan has built a massive museum,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.600
 and most of it says no, they're ours.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.200
 - Oh. - Yeah.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.000
 - I didn't know that this was so political museum.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 - It's quite political. - I just thought

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.520
 it was a farm museum, yeah.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.800
 - Apparently there's some Azerbaijan-y officials

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.840
 who say there is no such thing as Armenian carpets.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.240
 - No such thing, that's pretty ballsy,

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.800
 to say Armenia doesn't even make carpets.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.280
 - I know, well they claim that the Armenians

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.000
 stole the Azeri tactics and stuff like that.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.360
 And the UNESCO has said that Azerbaijani carpets

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.680
 are a masterpiece of intangible heritage,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.120
 but a lot of people pointed to the large donation

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.680
 that the government made to UNESCO just before they made that.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.160
 So this is very controversial,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.280
 and I know from me saying that it sounds like

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.400
 I'm on the Armenian side, you know,

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.880
 you can make your own decision.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.920
 - But don't decide wrong, James,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.600
 you've just absolutely torched our Azerbaijan tour next year,

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.880
 so thanks a lot for that.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.720
 Wow.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.520
 - And this museum, yeah, it's quite new.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.080
 If you look in Baku, I think a few of you will know this,

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.920
 'cause they've had football tournaments and stuff there,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.120
 but they built a whole load of new stuff

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.880
 in Baku quite recently.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.600
 But one thing about, I noticed when looking

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.280
 in the interior of this, is that all the floors

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.400
 are paved with marble.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.320
 It doesn't seem to be a single carpet

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.760
 that's not behind the perspex, so.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.600
 - So funny.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.440
 - You don't want to ruin them.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.480
 That's a sign that you're treasuring your carpets.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.320
 - Yeah, I guess.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.160
 - 'Cause they're really, I mean,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.200
 there is much wall hangings as for floors,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.320
 until pretty recently, aren't they?

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.240
 I've always thought we should bring back the wall carpet.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.800
 - Yes, I like it, yeah.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.680
 - It's gone out of fashion a long time ago,

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.520
 like probably turned in the 20th century, maybe before.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.920
 - I've got a carpet on a wall.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.560
 - So it went out of fashion maybe 200 years ago,

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.400
 actually.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.960
 - Have you really, only?

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.880
 - Yeah, why?

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.440
 - It's actually sound proofing, yeah.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.040
 - Oh, maybe that's what they were doing,

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.880
 recording all their podcasts back in the day.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.720
 - Maybe.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.560
 (laughing)

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.800
 - I like, I was reading, there's Turkish carpets,

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.200
 rather than having a new Turkish carpet

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.360
 that feels like it's just really bold in its colors

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.760
 and really bright, getting a more antiquey feel to one

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.000
 is something that people chase more.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.840
 And the way to make that happen that they do in Turkey

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.760
 is that they actually take the carpets out

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.080
 for months at a time and just lay them out in fields.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.800
 So if you go on Google Earth and you zoom in on Turkey,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.640
 there is whole fields, yeah, of thousands of carpets

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.920
 that are just laid out in the open because it's very dry.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.520
 And they just sit there and it's these carpet layers

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.200
 who understand fading so well that someone can say,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200
 I want it faded to like this kind of degree

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.560
 and they're like, leave it to me.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.520
 And they go and get the carpet when they know

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.040
 the time is right, when it's faded.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.200
 Yeah, and it looks really antiquey and they dust it off

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.640
 and that's when you get your carpet.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.760
 - Wow, that's really cool.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.000
 - Is it fake? - No, I do believe you.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.400
 It's just that when you say weird shit like that,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.560
 it's off and on. - I know.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.880
 - The way you looked at me, it was like, is that true, James?

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.720
 Is it true? - Prove me wrong.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.520
 So did you hear that in 2012,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.160
 scientists at the University of Manchester

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.360
 made a magic carpet, which is very exciting.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.880
 Yeah, not a classic MagCarp.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.120
 They made one which basically it can tell you

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.240
 when you're gonna fall over, which is very useful.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.440
 - Oh, yeah. - So it doesn't fly high, though.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.160
 - It's not flying. - It doesn't fly, no, no, no.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.360
 They're working on that, but this is very useful for the--

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.880
 - They're working on that? - They're not working on that.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.880
 - No, obviously they're not fucking working on that.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.480
 - It's the next obvious step, isn't it?

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.640
 - Yeah. - No, but it's--

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.480
 - How does it do that?

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.840
 Does it just have those horrible rolls in it

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.240
 that trip you up and then a sign on the other side

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.800
 that goes, ha ha, told you'd fall over?

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.960
 - Quite the reverse.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.800
 No, quite the reverse.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.040
 It's stuffed with clever fiber optic cable

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.880
 and that kind of thing.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.880
 And basically it builds up a profile of your movement

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.160
 as you're walking around.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.160
 So it's not like-- - Can you get amazing internet

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.280
 if you're on that carpet?

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.440
 - It basically monitors you

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.960
 and if your movement deteriorates even slightly,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.720
 it's for people who are elderly.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.560
 - It can tell your gait, I guess, right?

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.880
 - Yeah, it can tell your gait.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.080
 So it can't tell you you're about to fall over now,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.920
 but it can say you're about to fall over soon.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.960
 So look out for that.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.600
 - You can imagine an alarm that went off

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.440
 when you're about to fall over,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.080
 it would actually make you more likely to fall over.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.640
 - 100%. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.640
 - Do you know that there's people at the Harvard University

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.320
 that are working on a magic carpet?

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.200
 - Same question, a flying one.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.600
 - This is an actual flying one and they have made it,

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.120
 but it's the size of a banknote

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.000
 and it's only not 0.1 millimeters thick.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.840
 - Okay.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.880
 - But who's flying on it?

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.720
 Is it about aunt?

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.640
 - Like a cool, yeah, that'd be so exciting.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.960
 - That would be awesome, right?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.960
 They think that they could possibly make it bigger

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.800
 in the future, but you'd need so much energy

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.160
 and you'd need to make it ripple.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.000
 So what it is, it's like a really tiny bit of,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.120
 almost like paper, it ripples and ripples and ripples

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.520
 and then the force that these ripples cause

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.760
 can make it kind of just go up off the ground,

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.480
 but they can also make it go forward.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.840
 So it's quite cool,

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.400
 but I suppose we're a few years away from it.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.080
 - That's fair enough.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.040
 - It's a long way to go.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:52.880
 - That's very cool.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.000
 - Can we go back to the countries

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.560
 that lead the world in carpet making?

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.720
 'Cause I don't think we've covered them all there a lot.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.560
 - Okay.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.160
 - So Turkmenistan is a big one,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.120
 has the Guinness World Record

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.480
 for the biggest carpet in the world,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.520
 which by the way, it's really beatable.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.520
 If anyone wants to, it's 14 meters wide

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.680
 and 21.5 meters long, which feels shit.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.000
 And it wasn't even made by that many people.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.880
 Daily Sabah, which is a Turkish news site,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.120
 said it was made by a total of 40 people,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.800
 including one man.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.160
 - It is like, historically,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.080
 it's like a women's role to make these carpets, isn't it?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.240
 - Yeah, pretty much everywhere.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.480
 That seems to be the unifying thing

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.960
 across all of these carpet countries.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.800
 It's always the women who do it.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.760
 - He smashed through the carpet floor.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.000
 (laughing)

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.680
 - It's great, well done, him.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.320
 - But Turkmenistan's national flag has carpet on it.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.160
 - Doesn't it?

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.480
 - Which I don't think any of the others do,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.760
 so I think that's winning.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.880
 But yeah, in 1992,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.480
 when I think they became independent from the Soviets,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.840
 they started designing their national flag.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.280
 And if you look at it, it's a really nice flag.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.840
 It's green with a red stripe

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.520
 and it has five carpet motifs on it.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.320
 They're called gulls,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.400
 and they're just little carpet patterns.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.120
 - Oh, the flag's not made of carpet material.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.720
 - Does it have tassels?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.920
 'Cause if not, I'm not interested.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.040
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040
 It doesn't have tassels,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040
 and if it was made of carpet,

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.080
 it would need a fucking strong wind to fly it.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.120
 (laughing)

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.880
 - Oh yeah, good point.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.320
 - Can we talk about weather spoons, carpets, please, briefly?

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.160
 - Okay, sure.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.960
 - Okay, every weather spoon,

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.720
 so about 900 in the UK has its own special carpet.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.880
 And this wasn't known about until about 2015?

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.800
 Known about in public.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.880
 - Must have been known about.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.400
 - Tim Marson, the boss, he probably knew.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.320
 He probably was laughing up his sleeve at all of us.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.600
 - Everyone's always so pissed when they leave.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.120
 They never remember the carpets.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:35.960
 That's the trick.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.800
 - There was a guy called Kit Kales,

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.780
 who started a blog about the floor coverings

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.960
 of every single weather spoon in the country.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.040
 And he assumed they'd be identical when he started.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.520
 So I'm not sure why he was blogging about it.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.720
 But, all right, he found out,

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.560
 and then he started the blog.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.600
 It doesn't matter.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.840
 Each one has their own,

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.440
 and they're often themed to the local area.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.480
 It's really exciting.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.640
 So there's a Britannia pub in Plymouth,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.840
 which is slightly cruise-chip based, you know.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.360
 He wrote, Kit Kales, he wrote an entire book

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.440
 about weather spoons, pub carpets,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.520
 and the sun covered it with the headline,

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.600
 "The Rug Pratt".

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.000
 Is this Britain's saddest hobby?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.640
 - Is that a pun on the Rugrats?

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.960
 - It's a pun on the Rugrat, yeah, yeah.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.640
 - I know.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.480
 - Well, he was the person,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.560
 the original people that made those carpets

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.400
 were the people that had--

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.240
 - Axe Minster.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.160
 - Yes, yeah.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.440
 - Yeah, I've gone a bit deep on this one, yeah.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.680
 - Yeah, yeah, so they're the ones

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.440
 who have the royal decree.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.280
 - Warrant.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.920
 - Warrant in order to make carpets for the royal family.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.520
 So, yeah, weather spoons and them,

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.000
 and then they stopped making it because people started coughing.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.920
 - But Buckingham Palace, if you've ever been inside,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.600
 it's all weather spoons.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.960
 - Yeah, that's what's taking up all the space.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.760
 The ground floor is just a really big weather spoon, yeah.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.600
 - I'll tell you what,

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.000
 the Buckingham Palace all day breakfast is off.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.240
 - You know, one very famous red carpet

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.640
 that we all are aware of is the Hollywood red carpet

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.160
 that we see at the Oscars every single year.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.720
 And I didn't realize that there's so much mystery

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.560
 around the red carpet at Hollywood.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.720
 So, when they make it,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.920
 they make it in a mill in Dalton, in America,

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.160
 and they don't tell you which mill it's being made in.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.480
 That's all we know.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.520
 We don't know.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.640
 It's got its own special color, Academy Red.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.320
 They bring it there in a truck.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.280
 It's very mysterious.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.360
 They lay it down.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.400
 They have people in tuxedos with little portable vacuums,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.840
 just a vacuum at every spot,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.080
 and make sure that the carpet's doing fine.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.920
 And then when the ceremony's done,

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.960
 they pick it up and they burn it.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.560
 And it's only ever used once.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.800
 It's just a big mystery,

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.480
 and they make a whole new carpet the next time.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.800
 - Why do they burn it?

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.600
 - Because they don't want the material.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.600
 So, a few people have stolen bits of material from it,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.120
 and they've gone on eBay,

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.760
 and they're really worried that it's kind of like

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.800
 the Coca-Cola recipe.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.840
 They're gonna discover the recipe for the

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.680
 Hollywood red carpet. - It's a red carpet.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.520
 - No. - What do you want?

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.840
 - It's a magic carpet.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.400
 - It's kind of slightly off-red.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.920
 It's more like purple. - Yeah, it's burgundy.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.760
 - Yeah, it's burgundy.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.760
 - If you let people film the ceremony,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.200
 you can see what color it is.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.040
 - You can see the color,

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.560
 but you can't see what it's made of.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.400
 - It's made of carpet. - I think--

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.080
 - It doesn't matter. - Oh.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.640
 - I think, although I like the conspiracy theory reasoning,

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.960
 I think it's more likely that you can't reuse it,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.400
 'cause the next Hollywood year,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.520
 it's gonna look like crap.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.400
 And it's 152 meters long,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.600
 so there's very little other use you can put it to.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.760
 There's hardly anyone who's got used

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.640
 for 152 meters long carpet.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.480
 - I think it might be.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.360
 Maybe it's just made of something really awesome,

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.960
 like Bill Murray's back hair or something.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.200
 - Yeah, exactly, yes.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.600
 - You know, people used to cover their carpets

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.360
 with other carpets to protect them?

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.600
 Called "druggets."

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.000
 - Oh, yeah, I've got one on my wall.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.840
 Yeah.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.960
 - Your wall is seven carpets thick.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.640
 Yeah, until the 19th century,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.080
 druggets which are just cheaper carpets

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.000
 that you put on top of your carpet for everyday use.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.840
 And then if a guest came, you whipped the carpet off,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.040
 and then you had the proper one underneath.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.840
 - That's the sad thing, Andy has a drugget dealer,

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.680
 don't you?

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.520
 - Hey!

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.280
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.000
 and that is Andy.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.040
 - My fact is that the world's first ever

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.120
 hot-air balloon wedding was meant to happen in 1865,

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.640
 but the officiating priest refused to go up.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.280
 So the couple had the first ever

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.320
 hot-air balloon honeymoon instead.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.400
 - Very nice.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.120
 - It's just a nice story about a couple

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.800
 called Mary West Jenkins and John F. Boynton.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.440
 They wanted to marry in a balloon.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.760
 They thought it'd be fun.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.680
 And the reverend said, "No."

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.240
 He said it was too unholy, not appropriate enough.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.720
 So they just went up after the wedding instead.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.240
 But it was a very exciting ceremony this wedding.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.440
 There were 6,000 people there.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.040
 - They were mostly there for the balloon.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.160
 - They were there for the balloon, yeah.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.200
 They were in Central Park.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.440
 So they did get married in the end,

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.640
 but they got married on the ground.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.760
 - And how much do you suspect that the reverend

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.360
 was just too much of a pussy to go up in the balloon?

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.600
 - It's possible, isn't it?

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.000
 - There was the Baltimore Daily Commercial

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.080
 of the 10th of November, 1865.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.760
 This was a couple of days later.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.600
 They said that the official story

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.120
 was that the priest had to get the last train to Philadelphia.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.640
 Okay, but then they did say the actual reason, probably,

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.000
 was that the reverend gentleman,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.640
 accustomed to operate soloing in mundane matrimony,

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.640
 had backed out at the 11th hour.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.920
 - Right.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.040
 I wonder how much a history,

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.320
 like speaking of the shortest baseball match before,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.320
 has been influenced by people needing to get trains.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.760
 (audience laughing)

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.600
 Quite a lot.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.440
 - What time is it now?

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.880
 (laughing)

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.080
 - And the reverend, by the way,

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.360
 was a guy called Thomas DeWitt Talmadge.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.800
 And one reason why I'm not sure

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.080
 whether he was scared of going up

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.040
 is he was a massive publicity stunt guy.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.160
 And they said that he was the most famous clergyman

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.160
 in the world, including, hopefully, over 30.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.440
 He was really, really famous.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.280
 - That's famous.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.960
 - He thought that no one should be able to read novels.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.800
 - Sorry.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.800
 - When was this?

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.400
 - This was in the 1860s.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.160
 - People frowned on novels back then, didn't they?

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.640
 You were supposed to be reading Greek.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.040
 - He said that anyone who read novels

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.240
 shouldn't be allowed to work in an office, a store,

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.080
 a home, a shop, or a factory.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.640
 And he also thought that--

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.720
 - Where are you gonna work?

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.560
 In a field?

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.400
 - In a field.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.920
 - Yeah, did you get one of Dan's magic jobs

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.400
 drying carpets out for a living?

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.760
 - It's not, it's not, it's real.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.840
 - Yes, yes.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.200
 - But this guy, there are two people who got married.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.160
 It was, like you say, Mary West Jenkins

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.200
 and Dr. John F. Boynton.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.240
 And his doctorate was in geology.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.720
 And he decided that as well as doing his wedding

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.760
 up in the Hot Air Balloon,

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.700
 he also was gonna make several electrical experiments

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.720
 while he was up there.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.560
 - Cool.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.720
 - So he was like mixing business with pleasure.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.640
 - Yeah, she must have been slightly annoyed

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.520
 as he set up the cathode.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.320
 The balloon was an interesting one.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.960
 Well, the owner of the balloon was an interesting man.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.600
 He was called Thaddeus Lowe.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.400
 And he had been a spy in the Civil War,

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.640
 but a balloon spy.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.480
 - Right.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.320
 - Yeah.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.160
 - It's so hard to spy on a balloon.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.000
 You'd think it was quite conspicuous.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.840
 - It's very hard, yeah.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.800
 But yeah, you're right.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.320
 He had proposed balloons for use in the Civil War,

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.800
 which they actually were in the American Civil War.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.640
 And he--

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.280
 - So what would he do as a spy, though, with the--

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.080
 - You would, you know, look around.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.080
 - Oh, he'd be up there.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.920
 - He'd be up there.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.760
 - So he'd come back and be like,

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.080
 "They've got carpets everywhere."

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.120
 (laughing)

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.040
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.680
 He demonstrated it for George Washington,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.080
 who had died about 40 years earlier.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.560
 Sorry, for the White House.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.120
 He'd gone up in Washington with a telegraph key

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.480
 which linked him to the White House.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.440
 So he was able to radio down to the White House.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.760
 - You mentioned George Washington, by mistake.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.600
 - For no reason.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.440
 - For no reason.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.360
 - Oh, thank you for picking me up on that.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.760
 - The first actual marriage that did happen,

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.760
 eventually, in a balloon was in 1874.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.800
 It was Mary Elizabeth Walsh and Charles M. Colton.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.760
 And it was on top of the P.T. Barnum Manhattan hypnodrome

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.600
 that they had.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.040
 There was always a balloon on the top of there,

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.400
 and it used to go up all the time.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.040
 And so they got married on there.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.440
 And one of the people who was on there,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.040
 who was basically Barnum's balloon guy,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.680
 was called Washington Harrison Donaldson.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.480
 And he was named Washington after George Washington,

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.120
 hence the connection.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.200
 And he was a daredevil and he was amazing.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.760
 So he used to do high wire acts and so on.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.400
 And then when balloons became a thing,

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.280
 he did a thing whereby he would go up in a balloon,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.640
 but he got rid of the basket and he would have a bar,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.400
 just a bar where he would put his legs over and go up.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.440
 And he would start doing basically trapeze style acts

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.560
 where he was flipping around and so on.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.080
 And when he got very high,

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.640
 he would let the gas go down of the fire

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.000
 and he would come back down.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.800
 And as he was coming back down,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.880
 he would drop a human dummy from it,

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.720
 which everyone would see suddenly a plummeting human

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.120
 and it would land on the ground

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:30.520
 and inside were business cards and flyers for his act.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.120
 - That's amazing. - And so yeah.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.080
 And so he used to go around doing this act

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.600
 and eventually P.T. Barnum saw him and employed him.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.400
 And what he used to do in the middle of Manhattan

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.720
 would go up in this balloon before shows

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.680
 and when he was up there,

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.600
 he would just throw Barnum business cards and so on.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.800
 So New York constantly littered with advertising.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.600
 - I think the balloon was called P.T. Barnum as well.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.800
 - Yeah, it was, yeah.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.760
 - Well, I thought these guys are pretty brave actually

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.080
 because the wedding was postponed by one day

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.520
 because the balloon burst the day before.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.760
 - It's a good way to get your wedding paid for.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.200
 It was the idea of the couple, the first wedding.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.240
 And it was basically a way to get P.T. Barnum

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.480
 to fund their whole wedding and pay their dowry

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.320
 'cause it was such good publicity.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.680
 And also, 'cause these became really popular,

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.720
 if you look through new searches of the late 19th century,

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.960
 balloon weddings were the thing.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.400
 And it was such a good way to get guests to your wedding

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.680
 if you didn't have mates.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.840
 'Cause thousands of people would come

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.600
 and sure they're there for the balloon,

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.600
 but the photos just say, "I'm a seriously popular dude."

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.200
 And there was one, actually I read about one in 1884.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.640
 This was in Pennsylvania where the couple failed to arrive.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.560
 They freaked out and realized they were too scared to do it.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.920
 And all the promoters were gonna have to refund the crowd

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.160
 'cause you'd be a paying customer as well as a guest.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.520
 And they decided they weren't gonna do this.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.960
 So instead, the balloon's owner and his assistant

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.240
 like staged a marriage.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.560
 They posed as the couple.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.000
 They got married to each other in this balloon,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.280
 went up in the air, under assumed names,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.800
 but they only found out four years later.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.520
 It was actually legally binding.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.760
 - Did they stay, did they fall in love?

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.600
 - I really don't wanna tell you the answer to that

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.920
 because I think it'll ruin your night.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.760
 - Okay, don't tell me, don't say anything.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.640
 - Okay, we'll leave it there.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.040
 - There was one in 1888.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.840
 This was a wedding between Margaret Buckley

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.520
 and Edward T. Davis.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.880
 40,000 people came to that wedding

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.600
 to see them go up on the hot air balloon.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.800
 Unfortunately, the balloon then landed in a swamp,

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.160
 but it kept kind of moving along the swamp.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.400
 So they were dragged for two miles,

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.000
 clinging to the ropes of the balloon,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.480
 and they finished the rest of the trip by train.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.360
 - So good.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.000
 I have a favorite hot air balloon love story.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.920
 This is an account from someone online.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.040
 My husband proposed to me

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.640
 on a private hot air balloon ride.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.920
 That's not the story.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.400
 The pilot told us that one time he had five couples

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.480
 on a larger ride,

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.920
 and one of the guys decided to propose to his girlfriend

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.000
 by having a big sign on the ground

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.920
 where they're landing saying, "Will you marry me?"

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.960
 - But he didn't put a name on the sign.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.640
 All five couples were dating,

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.600
 and all five of the women thought,

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.880
 "This is the best proposal I've ever received in my life."

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.720
 And four of them were disappointed.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.520
 - Would you, I mean, I think you'd roll with it, wouldn't you?

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.320
 - If it's a third date, it's too, you know.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.320
 - You can't roll with it.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.160
 It's got to be someone's.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.520
 You can't say, "Oh yeah, that's mine,"

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.600
 and have the other bloke next.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.240
 You go, "No, it's not. It's mine."

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.720
 - Anyway, I love it. - There is actually,

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.280
 there was a service that offers, it's called D&D Ballooning.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.920
 I think sadly the company's shut down now,

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.560
 but it existed last year. - Down to the Dragon's Ballooning?

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.040
 - You look too excited about that, but no.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.120
 I think D&D is just the people who run the company.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.320
 It's in California, and it offers mile-high balloon trips,

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.760
 and basically what it promises is comfort and discretion

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.960
 for a couple.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.040
 It says, "You've got in your basket the privacy

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.520
 of an enclosed dome tent with your own private view

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.400
 as our discreet pilot ascends to one mile.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.200
 We provide a CD player.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.640
 You provide the music blankets, pillows, and imagination,

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.400
 and it lasts an hour."

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.440
 - An hour. - An hour.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.640
 - Five minutes in. - Yeah.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.280
 - Seconds like that. - Oh, come on, Bringson.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.040
 - Sorry, we haven't actually taken off yet.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.040
 (audience laughing)

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.160
 - Oh my God.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.680
 - We're gonna have to wrap up very shortly.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.320
 - Can I tell you about One Balloon Hero?

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.160
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.680
 - Willie Coppins, heard of him?

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.080
 - Willie Owenty, go on.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.000
 - He will, he will, and he did.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.960
 He was a fighter pilot in the First World War,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.920
 Belgian man, very brilliant at shooting down

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.640
 observation balloons, right?

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.000
 Which were major features of the First World War.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.400
 - Three simply large target, long shot.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.120
 - Look, they were very well defended, all right.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.720
 He was so good at it, they were called balloon busters,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.560
 the pilots who did it.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.560
 He shot down nearly 40 balloons during the war,

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.400
 which is really big potatoes, okay?

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.560
 The German army was so angry about Willie Coppins,

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.040
 they specifically tried to kill him

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.800
 with a booby-trapped balloon.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.400
 They put up a balloon with explosives.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.880
 But get this, once, he was being shot at

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.560
 from a German balloon in his plane,

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.400
 and he cool-ly just flew up and around

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.200
 and parked on top of the balloon,

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.480
 went till it landed,

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.160
 and then just gently slid his plane off and flew away.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.880
 - Listen, if you're gonna give me shit

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.840
 about carpets being laid out in Turkey.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.080
 (audience laughing)

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080
 No way, buster.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.680
 - I'm a bit skeptical, I have to say.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.320
 Never thought I'd say this, but I'm with Dan here.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.520
 That's an abrupt break.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.120
 That's an emergency break for a plane to land on a balloon.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.960
 - No, it's a very soft landing, surely?

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.920
 - No, it's the softest landing you could possibly have.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.760
 - If you think about it,

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.240
 you'd need a vertical takeoff and landing plane, right?

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.800
 Like most planes kind of come into a runway, so it's--

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.320
 - It might have been a very long balloon that he was like,

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.360
 they had those long balloons that he was landing on.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.440
 That's the wrong way.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.400
 - A Zeppelin.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.240
 - A Zeppelin.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.400
 - It was a Zeppelin.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.000
 - Yeah, any further questions?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.840
 Please, no.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.720
 (laughing)

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.520
 - Look, I hate to cut this off,

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.960
 but we got a train to catch.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.400
 (audience laughing)

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.920
 So that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.480

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.720
 Oxford, thank you so much.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.760
 That was so much fun.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.880
 Thank you for coming out, being with us here tonight.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.480

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.720
 We'll see you then, goodbye.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.300
 (upbeat music)

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.060
 (crowd cheering)

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.400
 (upbeat music)

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.980
 (upbeat music)
