00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,320
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,720
 of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,880
 this week coming to you live from Oxford!

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,880
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,040
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,680
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,160
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,200
 and James Harkin, and once again,

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,920
 we have gathered round the microphones

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,120
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,440
 and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,840
 my fact this week is that the longest

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,440
 professional baseball match on record only lasted so long

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,880
 because the umpire's rule book was missing the bit

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,800
 that explained when a match should be stopped.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,560
 (audience laughing)

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920
 - That's amazing.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,600
 I kind of think that an umpire should already know the rules

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,200
 by the time he's starting to umpire the game.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,040
 - Yeah, you would think.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,880
 - Halfway through, he shouldn't be going,

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,480
 "No, I'm just gonna check."

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,320
 - Well, this was unprecedented times in the baseball world.

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,160
 So this was a match that was in April 18th, 1981.

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,320
 It was the poor Tuckett Red Sox,

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,120
 and they were playing the Rochester Red Wings,

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,720
 and so these are smaller teams

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,760
 and a different league professional baseball players though.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,240
 And poor Tuckett, it was played there,

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,360
 which is in Rhode Island.

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,160
 Big deal for poor Tuckett, because the newspaper,

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,800
 the next day, said not since the time

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,040
 that they had to shoot the drunken camel at the City Zoo,

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,120
 (audience laughing)

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,240
 has there been this much excitement in poor Tuckett.

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,480
 (audience laughing)

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,680
 - Yeah, but it was in 1981.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,240
 - 1981, so it sounds like a weird match from ages ago,

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,720
 but quite recently really.

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,600
 At the start of the match, there were 1700 fans watching.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,840
 By the time the game eventually ended,

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,120
 which was 4.07 in the morning,

45
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,680
 there were 20 people left watching,

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,080
 still watching the match, 20,

47
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,200
 which I feel is quite a lot.

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
 - I read that some of them were asleep.

49
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,040
 - Oh, okay.

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,320
 - They all got given a season ticket,

51
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,160
 so it paid off for them.

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,960
 - I think some of them got lifetime passes.

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,480
 - Yeah, they did, that's true.

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,840
 So it was the longest baseball match on the world,

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
 which is eight hours and 25 minutes.

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
 It really isn't that long.

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
 I think what makes it long.

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
 - It's quite long.

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,240
 - Well, come on, we're from a nation of cricket.

60
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
 That was bullshit.

61
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,560
 - Exactly, exactly.

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,520
 'Cause all the writing up,

63
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,280
 like there was a player called Wade Bogues,

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,280
 who was 22 years old when the match started,

65
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,700
 and by the time it ended, he was 23.

66
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,120
 (audience laughing)

67
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,480
 - Wade Bogues is quite famous.

68
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,280
 He became quite a famous player later.

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,120
 - Did he?

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,640
 But this didn't happen to land on the,

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,600
 when it went past midnight, he turned 23.

72
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,800
 The thing about this match was it was eventually stopped,

73
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,640
 and they then resumed the match a few months later.

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,560
 - Oh, you're kidding.

75
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,880
 Oh, I thought it was just a midnight thing the birthday.

76
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
 - No, no.

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,560
 - Oh, okay.

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,880
 - But when they've carried on afterwards,

79
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,240
 it took like about 18 minutes or something.

80
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,980
 - Yeah, didn't they just have a school once, basically?

81
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,240
 And they did, and then that's over.

82
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,000
 And there's sort of thousands of people flocked,

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,440
 'cause by then it was almost as big news

84
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,640
 as the drunken camel thing.

85
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,600
 So the entirety of the nation, practically,

86
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,480
 was there for 18 minutes.

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,880
 But Dan, what's the deal with the missing page?

88
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,680
 Who's ripped out the crucial page?

89
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,720
 - Yeah, we don't know if it was missing,

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,220
 we don't know if they couldn't find it,

91
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,720
 and just no one knew what to do.

92
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,240
 And so there was actually someone

93
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,360
 that they were trying to call on a landline

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
 who was higher up, who just wasn't near their phone.

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,720
 Also, it was 12 a.m. heading into 4 a.m. eventually.

96
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,560
 So they eventually got through to him,

97
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,600
 and they were like, "What do we do?"

98
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,560
 And he was like, "Stop the fucking match!

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
 "What are you doing?"

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,880
 Why did they, why was it lasting so long?

101
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,720
 Do we know? - So what happens

102
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,880
 in baseball is you have an innings and an innings.

103
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,080
 You keep going with inningses until someone scores more

104
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
 than that innings than the other team.

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,440
 You do a certain number that you're supposed to do.

106
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,200
 And then if it's a tie, you just keep going

107
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,520
 until one team gets like sudden death.

108
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,640
 And they just kept going,

109
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,760
 nil nil, nil nil, nil nil, nil nil, nil nil.

110
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,520
 And then there was a one,

111
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,840
 and then the other team got a one.

112
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,440
 And that was, it was Wade Boggs.

113
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,720
 He kind of got a home run to tie that game.

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,880
 And he said, "I didn't know if the guys on my team

115
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,840
 "wanted to hug me or slug me."

116
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,680
 - That's a great thing to say.

117
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,000
 - Boggs, by the way, I just want to say,

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,440
 because he is famous,

119
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
 but the most thing I know about him

120
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,200
 is he once consumed 107 beers in one day.

121
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,880
 - Whoa, for like charity or?

122
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,480
 - He was just thirsty.

123
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,160
 - Sometimes people don't need an incentive, Dan,

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,480
 to drink the 100 beers.

125
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,120
 - He's famous as big drinker,

126
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,480
 but then this is the record that his friend said

127
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
 and he's confirmed.

128
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,280
 - Wow.

129
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
 - But so the match itself, again,

130
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
 I wish we hadn't told you it was just eight hours,

131
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,200
 because when you hear the details of the match,

132
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,840
 it does sound like it just went on for like a week.

133
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,000
 So the accounts of the baseball players,

134
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,440
 a very cold night,

135
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,040
 the baseball players getting so cold

136
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,160
 that they were ripping up furniture from the dugout

137
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
 and burning it,

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,120
 snapping used baseball bats in half

139
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,000
 and putting it in this bin of fire to stay warm,

140
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,840
 to keep them going.

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,360
 - If you can snap a baseball bat in half,

142
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
 I don't think you'd need a fire.

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,200
 I think you're fine.

144
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,240
 - A jump rod.

145
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
 These people are pathetic.

146
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,400
 - I know.

147
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
 - It was cold.

148
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,200
 It was really cold.

149
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,840
 And that was one of the problems.

150
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,640
 It was a really windy day as well.

151
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,000
 And so the problem was it kept being nil, nil, nil, nil

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,120
 because no one could get any home runs.

153
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,720
 And the reason was they kept whacking it for miles and miles

154
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,800
 and the wind would just blow it back into the stadium.

155
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
 - Oh.

156
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,840
 - Were they playing with a boomerang?

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,680
 It turned out.

158
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,320
 - Yeah, extraordinary game.

159
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,400
 - It is quite pathetic.

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,960
 If you look at sports matches of your,

161
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,360
 where they basically,

162
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,840
 before all these rules were codified for all the sports

163
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,320
 in sort of mid to late 19th century,

164
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,720
 they just went on for days and days and days, didn't they?

165
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
 You get football matches and rugby matches

166
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,520
 with hundreds of participants.

167
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,680
 You'd have one village playing another village

168
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,720
 and they play from dawn until dusk

169
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,480
 for like four days straight.

170
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,320
 It was great.

171
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,400
 I think the first recorded football match ever

172
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,360
 in Sheffield in 1794, that was three days long.

173
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,400
 And the match report said three days long,

174
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,120
 a very good match and it felt necessary to note

175
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,080
 that although there were quite a lot of injuries,

176
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,160
 no one was killed.

177
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,240
 - But that's amazing 'cause that team,

178
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
 before that game, they were called Sheffield Monday,

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080
 weren't they?

180
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,600
 (laughing)

181
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
 - Very strong.

182
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
 - But on the flip side,

183
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
 you do get short baseball games as well.

184
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,280
 And there is a record for shortest baseball game ever,

185
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,280
 which was in 1916 and the match lasted for 31 minutes.

186
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,480
 And yeah, and that's really quick for baseball.

187
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,480
 And the reason is both teams beforehand spoke to each other

188
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,400
 and realized they both had them trained to catch,

189
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,960
 which was going quite early.

190
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,800
 - No way.

191
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,720
 - So, but the problem was for the fans who came to the match

192
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,680
 is that the game started 30 minutes early.

193
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,920
 So the game ended before it was meant to start.

194
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,320
 So fans rocked up and they're like,

195
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,160
 "This is gonna be great."

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,320
 And then they saw like the final batter or whatever.

197
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,800
 And then they all went off.

198
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,640
 - That's bullshit.

199
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,780
 I'm outraged for these people 105 years ago.

200
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,080
 - Do you know the first ever baseball rule

201
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,160
 that was written down was that all players must be punctual?

202
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
 - Really?

203
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,920
 This is the oldest set of rules we have.

204
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,560
 They're called the Nicarbaca rules.

205
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,840
 They were written in New York.

206
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,760
 But the thing was the teams were from New York,

207
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,040
 but there wasn't much room to play in New York.

208
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
 So they always played in New Jersey.

209
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,440
 And so if you have to schlep all the way over the river

210
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,800
 to New Jersey, obviously you don't want people

211
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,200
 turning up half an hour later or an hour later or whatever.

212
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,840
 So that's why that was the first rule.

213
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,680
 - It was good, wasn't it?

214
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,280
 - Interestingly, a New Jersey is what these poor cold guys

215
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,560
 in the match we previously referred to need it.

216
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,880
 - And also in those set of rules,

217
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,800
 hitting the ball out of the stadium was a foul.

218
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,360
 So you know in baseball now,

219
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,780
 really what you're trying to do is whack it all the way out.

220
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,800
 In those days, if you did that, you would be out.

221
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,640
 And that's because the stadium was right next

222
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,960
 to the Hudson River and they couldn't afford

223
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,800
 to lose all the balls.

224
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
 - So did the phrase, you knocked it out of the park,

225
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
 have a negative connotation of those things?

226
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
 Idiot, you knocked it out of the park.

227
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,880
 Now we've got to go and get it in the boat.

228
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,360
 - There was one controversial rule book incident

229
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
 which I read about.

230
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,840
 And this was a guy called Earl Weaver

231
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,340
 who was manager of the Baltimore Orioles.

232
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,120
 And he had a real issue with umpires.

233
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
 So I think he was managing in the 1970s.

234
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
 He hated umpires.

235
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,960
 He thought none of them knew the rules.

236
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,280
 They didn't know what they were doing.

237
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,440
 He got told off loads of times for once he pulled up third base

238
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,200
 and just walked off the pitch with it.

239
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,000
 He wants, the description was he was told off

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,720
 for pecking at an umpire's chin

241
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,560
 with the beak of his baseball cap.

242
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,060
 So they had a tense relationship.

243
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,960
 Anyway, in 1979, he got in such a big fight

244
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,800
 with one of the umpires who basically hadn't called out

245
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,920
 what this guy thought was an illegal move of the oppositions

246
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,160
 that he went to the dugout, he got the rule book,

247
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
 he marched back onto the field

248
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,440
 and he opened the rule book and started reading from it,

249
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,200
 saying, look, you obviously don't know the rules, you idiot.

250
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,520
 And the umpire got annoyed, understandably.

251
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,720
 And so then he started tearing the rule book to shreds

252
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,640
 and throwing it all over the field in front of them.

253
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,120
 - One of the other things, early baseball,

254
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,440
 they never, so baseball players all have that cool glove

255
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,560
 that we get as kids when we're playing.

256
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,400
 - The baseball glove.

257
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,240
 - Yeah, that's what it's called.

258
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
 - You don't mean the giant gladiator phone thing,

259
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,520
 but you mean the phone thing. - No, I don't mean the audio thing.

260
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,120
 - No, so those gloves, but in the early days of baseball,

261
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
 that was seen as a very wimpy thing

262
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,120
 to have any kind of handwear.

263
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,240
 So you would just have to use your hands.

264
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,280
 But that was really damaging all the players

265
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
 because those balls, as we know, very hard

266
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,560
 and they're being walloped.

267
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,200
 So that was a real risk when you were a baseball player.

268
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,480
 And so it was a player, as far as one historian

269
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,200
 was looking and find this player called Charles C. Waite,

270
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,160
 who was the first person who wore a glove.

271
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,560
 But because he was so scared of being made fun for it,

272
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,240
 he wore his skin tone color as the glove.

273
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,320
 So he thought at that distance,

274
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,040
 they might just think in the crowd,

275
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
 "Oh, he's got slightly big hands."

276
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
 (audience laughing)

277
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,160
 - But just one big hand.

278
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,840
 - Yeah, yeah.

279
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,800
 - Just on the gloves and the catching and throwing.

280
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,640
 - Yeah.

281
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,960
 - So the world record for throwing and catching eggs

282
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,400
 was set by a couple of baseball players from New Zealand.

283
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,240
 - What was it?

284
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
 - I guess they're very practised at it.

285
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,120
 Called Nick Hornstein and Ricky Pyeway in 2018.

286
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,040
 - So is that like I throw an egg to you

287
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,480
 and you have to catch it and you have to be

288
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,560
 as far away from me as possible?

289
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
 - Exactly.

290
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,040
 - Does it matter how the egg is cooked?

291
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
 - It does, come on.

292
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,160
 That would be very--

293
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,960
 - Frisbeer fried egg, come on, that's a challenge.

294
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
 - It's 93.6 meters.

295
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
 - Sounds boiled.

296
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,200
 - Which is pretty, it was not, it was a raw egg.

297
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,600
 And it was very impressive.

298
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
 And this is at the World Egg Throwing Federation,

299
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,240
 which is based in Swatton in England.

300
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,480
 - We know where it's based.

301
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,840
 - Sorry.

302
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,360
 Anyway, it sounds like an incredible party,

303
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,240
 the World Egg Throwing Championship.

304
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,640
 So I was reading an account of it

305
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,760
 and I'm just gonna read you what happened on the day.

306
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,400
 Former champ Norm Fowler of Peterborough

307
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,080
 won the Russian egg roulette.

308
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,680
 No explanation in this article of what that is.

309
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,960
 Then the Target Accuracy Contest,

310
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,400
 throwing at male model Joel Hicks,

311
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,640
 was won by Tina from Cambridge with two shots to the groin.

312
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,640
 (audience laughing)

313
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,040
 - Listen, we need to move on to our next fact.

314
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,600
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

315
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,240
 - My fact this week is that when acorn woodpeckers

316
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,400
 fight each other, the rumour spreads through the community

317
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,320
 and other acorn woodpeckers turn up to watch.

318
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,080
 (audience laughing)

319
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
 This is so cool.

320
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,920
 So they're really social, they're the most social woodpeckers,

321
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,320
 'cause a lot of woodpeckers are solitary, I'm sure you know.

322
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,920
 And they love this spectator sport

323
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,640
 and they have these amazing battles over their territory,

324
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,560
 their trees, their granary trees,

325
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,920
 which are where they stockpile all their acorns.

326
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,400
 And basically the trees are guarded by a group of males

327
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,600
 who are all brothers and then a group of females

328
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,840
 who are all sisters and they're all chagging each other

329
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,040
 as well as guarding the tree.

330
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
 But they're not brothers and sisters with each other,

331
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,000
 so there's no incest going on.

332
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,240
 Anyway, when one gender dies out, when one sex dies out,

333
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,080
 then there's a vacancy and so a bunch of female acorn woodpeckers

334
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,320
 will want to swoop in to claim that tree

335
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
 and these massive fights break out

336
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
 between the different claimants to the tree.

337
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,560
 And yeah, people come from miles around,

338
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,360
 not when I say people, I mean woodpeckers.

339
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,200
 (audience laughing)

340
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
 - You've identified too closely

341
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
 with your research area this week, Anna, yeah.

342
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,640
 - That's amazing.

343
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,760
 - And they'll travel for a couple of miles

344
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
 and they'll spend like an hour a day

345
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,960
 just watching this big fight and they'll go back home.

346
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,520
 And I think it's useful, they think,

347
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,200
 'cause you can pick up social information,

348
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,680
 spy out potential mates.

349
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,520
 - But they leave their bit of tree

350
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,760
 that they're protecting in order to see this fight.

351
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,920
 And it feels like that's the next little trick of evolution

352
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
 that you need to fake a fight

353
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
 and then send in your troops around the back.

354
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
 - Or just like one acorn woodpecker

355
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,600
 who kind of goes around when everyone else is at the fight,

356
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
 just stealing their acorns.

357
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,240
 - Exactly, or claiming the trees, you know?

358
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
 - Oh yeah, you've broken the system.

359
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,760
 - The fights, they last for a long time,

360
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,360
 they last for about a day sometimes.

361
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,720
 I know the woodpecker, the audience has come for an hour.

362
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,960
 - Very much, it's last for five days, so.

363
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,080
 - That's true, pathetic.

364
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,960
 Yeah, this family strategy they have

365
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
 is pretty interesting,

366
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,040
 the sort of incest avoidance thing they have

367
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,000
 because you get a breeding pair

368
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,200
 and then you get a load of babysitter,

369
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
 let's say a load of babysitter males, okay,

370
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,840
 who are the offspring of the breeding pair.

371
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
 - Got it.

372
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,840
 - Then the breeding female will die, okay?

373
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,280
 But that means that there has to be a new female.

374
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,960
 However, the previous, the helper males,

375
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,280
 the babysitter males, previously couldn't breed

376
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,560
 because the breeding female was their mother, okay?

377
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,000
 So, but now they're on equal terms with their dad

378
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,320
 because there's gonna be a new breeding female.

379
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,560
 So now there is just a parity,

380
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,480
 so they're all gonna breed with the new female.

381
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,360
 So finally, and this is good for obviously,

382
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,680
 for the babysitter males who now can breed,

383
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,840
 but it's also very interesting

384
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,000
 'cause it means these birds have an awareness

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,360
 of the relations of other birds to each other.

386
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,280
 It's called triadic awareness.

387
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,240
 And it's not a Woody Woodpecker though, is it?

388
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,360
 (audience laughing)

389
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,280
 - Does it make, do we know if it makes it

390
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,600
 an awkward father-son dynamic?

391
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
 It's like if your parents divorce

392
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,080
 and then your dad marries a step-mom,

393
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,960
 then you also shag the step-mom.

394
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
 - Is it?

395
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,240
 - And that often creates tension.

396
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,080
 - I think it does.

397
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,320
 (audience laughing)

398
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,440
 - That's just why I wonder if it's the same.

399
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,480
 - Yeah?

400
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,400
 But it's so, yeah, like that family dynamic is so weird.

401
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,960
 It's also the case that a few mums will also live

402
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,640
 in the same nest, right?

403
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,120
 And when that happens, and they're having eggs,

404
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,320
 they try and synchronize eggs

405
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,480
 so that they don't have one child arriving before the other.

406
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,680
 And what they'll do is if one of the mothers has an egg,

407
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,520
 they'll knock the egg out just to make sure

408
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,360
 that that's no longer--

409
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
 - I think they might eat it.

410
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they'll get the young instance.

411
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,720
 - So if there are two breeding females--

412
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,560
 - Exactly.

413
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,400
 - And they haven't synchronized

414
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,360
 when they're having their eggs,

415
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,920
 the other one will push out or eat the egg of the first one

416
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,040
 until they get it right, until they get it all the time.

417
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,960
 - Or, sadistically, feed it to the mother often, you know?

418
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,760
 You've laid an egg and then your rival female pushes it out

419
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,400
 and then comes and feeds it back to you.

420
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,040
 But it's all 'cause of this bizarre setup

421
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
 where they have up to seven males

422
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,760
 and up to three females in every crew, isn't it?

423
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,920
 So you've got these three rival females at all times,

424
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,560
 constantly laying and killing each other's kids

425
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
 and laying and killing each other's kids.

426
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,080
 - And it can be weeks, cannibalism for weeks

427
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,920
 and then you time it right and then happy families again.

428
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,040
 - Yeah, it's like when your periods are synchronizing

429
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,880
 when women live together.

430
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,480
 It takes a few months to get in sync.

431
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,320
 - Yes.

432
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,480
 - And you kill each other's periods

433
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,160
 until they all arrive at the same time.

434
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,180
 - Yes. - Apart from, of course,

435
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,320
 that's a myth. - Ah.

436
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,160
 - It's a myth women's periods don't synchronize.

437
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,000
 - Is it?

438
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
 Oh, yeah, you keep claiming it's a myth, but I,

439
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,880
 what am I, let's move on.

440
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,200
 No, Dan, please don't. - Come on, Dan, please don't.

441
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,160
 Well, my research has shown in the houses that I live in

442
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,800
 that there's something to it.

443
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 - Hundreds of thousands of houses, I'm sure.

444
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,440
 - I had to move a lot of times to different houses,

445
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,640
 particularly when they found out

446
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,360
 of my period experiment I was conducting.

447
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,880
 - The fights are pretty violent, though,

448
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,760
 because I read one place that said the birds

449
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,080
 basically have spears for mouths.

450
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,720
 And you'll see after the fights

451
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,600
 that the birds will have eyes gouged out,

452
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,960
 blood all over them.

453
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,080
 They'll fall to the floor holding each other's legs

454
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,920
 so they can't fly and they'll kind of crash to the ground.

455
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,280
 So they're pretty violent.

456
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,120
 - Wow.

457
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,680
 - You can see why people go to watch.

458
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,520
 - Yes.

459
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,360
 - Yeah. - And by people, again.

460
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,480
 (laughing)

461
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,760
 - They make a sound that goes like, "Waka, waka."

462
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
 - Oh, like Fosy Bear.

463
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,280
 - Fosy Bear or Shakira were the only two I could pick up.

464
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,400
 (laughing)

465
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,600
 - When will they duet?

466
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,280
 - What did Woody Woodpecker?

467
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,360
 - Yeah, exactly. - Is that in any way--?

468
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,800
 - That was quite good, actually.

469
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,640
 Not bad.

470
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,680
 So the voice of Woody Woodpecker was a woman called Grace Lance.

471
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,200
 She's also known by her stage name, Grace Stafford.

472
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,760
 And what happened was they had another person

473
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,560
 who did the voice, I think it might be Mel Blanc,

474
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,240
 but it was someone famous like-- - Yeah, he was the original,

475
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,400
 I think, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

476
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,480
 And then he decided he didn't want to do it anymore.

477
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
 And she said, "Well, I'll do it.

478
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,680
 "I do a really good impression.

479
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,400
 "Not as good as Dan Shriver, but it's quite good."

480
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,120
 And her husband, who was producing it, said,

481
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,920
 "Nah, I don't think so.

482
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,680
 "I think we're gonna tender for it."

483
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,240
 And so she then did an anonymous audition tape

484
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,320
 and sent it in with all the other audition tapes,

485
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,680
 and he still chose Woody Woodpecker.

486
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,440
 - Wow, cool. - Impression.

487
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,000
 And for the first something like 10 years or so,

488
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,920
 eight years in fact, that she did it,

489
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,120
 she didn't have her name on the credits.

490
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,360
 And that was because she thought people would be disillusioned

491
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
 if they knew Woody was voiced by a woman.

492
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,240
 - Right. - Wow.

493
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,840
 - As opposed to a Woodpecker.

494
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,280
 (laughing)

495
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,240
 Because I would be devastated as a child.

496
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
 The trees are incredible, aren't they?

497
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,960
 You've got to look up the granary trees of Acorn Woodpeckers,

498
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,000
 which they mostly keep in the California, Oregon area,

499
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,080
 basically look like a tree that's surface

500
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,320
 is covered in crumpets.

501
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,160
 - They look incredible.

502
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,200
 They look like, you know, people who are scared

503
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,920
 of like little holes?

504
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,440
 Is it called trypophobia or something like that?

505
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,280
 They would hate these

506
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,360
 because it's just loads of little holes

507
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,880
 and each one is shoved an acorn into it.

508
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,040
 - And they test them, they'll shove an acorn in

509
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,200
 and then they'll practice trying to get it out.

510
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
 And if it's too easy to extract the acorn

511
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,200
 from the little hole they've made,

512
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,280
 they abandon the hole.

513
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,080
 That's gonna be too easy to steal.

514
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,120
 - But it keeps changing because the holes

515
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,520
 always change size, 'cause trees change size.

516
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,400
 Trees are always growing and shifting a bit

517
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,880
 and acorns dry out, so they will change size when they do.

518
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,000
 So it's a nightmare.

519
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,920
 So they spend all of their bloody time moving.

520
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,680
 It's not funny, there are up to 50,000 holes in a tree, guys.

521
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,760
 Guys, please take it seriously.

522
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,560
 50,000 acorns in a tree, it's just you

523
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,120
 and your brothers and your three weird wives.

524
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,920
 And you have to, it takes 20 minutes to make one hole.

525
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,320
 There are 50,000 holes in the tree

526
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,360
 and you're constantly moving the acorns

527
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,000
 to a better fitting hole.

528
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,360
 It's awful.

529
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,960
 I would want to die in a fight.

530
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,080
 - Okay, look, we need to move on to our next fact.

531
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,120
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

532
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,560
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the world's largest

533
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,000
 carpet museum is shaped like a giant roll of carpet.

534
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 (audience laughing)

535
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,560
 For people at home, we've just put a picture of it

536
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,600
 on the screen, and I think that undeniably looks

537
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,920
 like a giant roll of carpet.

538
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,760
 - Yeah, it's awesome.

539
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,840
 It's really amazing.

540
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,280
 - Yeah, so this is in Baku in Azerbaijan,

541
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,680
 and this is something that I noticed

542
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,040
 when I was reading about a carpet war,

543
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,480
 between Azerbaijan and Armenia,

544
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,680
 on top of the actual war they're having.

545
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,000
 - But the carpet war...

546
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,360
 - They're not the most lethal weapons, are they?

547
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,320
 - But you can carpet bomb somewhere, I suppose.

548
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,280
 - Yeah, I think you got confused.

549
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,800
 - So these are carpets that come from an area

550
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,640
 called Nagano Karabakh,

551
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,440
 which is a disputed territory between the two places.

552
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,480
 Armenian weavers are claiming that the Azerbaijan

553
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,400
 government is appropriating their culture,

554
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,160
 because basically most people, most historians,

555
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,640
 not all of them, but most historians,

556
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,920
 think that these are Armenian-based carpets,

557
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,160
 but Azerbaijan has built a massive museum,

558
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,600
 and most of it says no, they're ours.

559
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
 - Oh. - Yeah.

560
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,000
 - I didn't know that this was so political museum.

561
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 - It's quite political. - I just thought

562
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,520
 it was a farm museum, yeah.

563
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,800
 - Apparently there's some Azerbaijan-y officials

564
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,840
 who say there is no such thing as Armenian carpets.

565
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
 - No such thing, that's pretty ballsy,

566
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,800
 to say Armenia doesn't even make carpets.

567
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,280
 - I know, well they claim that the Armenians

568
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,000
 stole the Azeri tactics and stuff like that.

569
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,360
 And the UNESCO has said that Azerbaijani carpets

570
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,680
 are a masterpiece of intangible heritage,

571
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,120
 but a lot of people pointed to the large donation

572
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,680
 that the government made to UNESCO just before they made that.

573
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,160
 So this is very controversial,

574
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,280
 and I know from me saying that it sounds like

575
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,400
 I'm on the Armenian side, you know,

576
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,880
 you can make your own decision.

577
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,920
 - But don't decide wrong, James,

578
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,600
 you've just absolutely torched our Azerbaijan tour next year,

579
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,880
 so thanks a lot for that.

580
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,720
 Wow.

581
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,520
 - And this museum, yeah, it's quite new.

582
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,080
 If you look in Baku, I think a few of you will know this,

583
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,920
 'cause they've had football tournaments and stuff there,

584
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,120
 but they built a whole load of new stuff

585
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,880
 in Baku quite recently.

586
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,600
 But one thing about, I noticed when looking

587
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,280
 in the interior of this, is that all the floors

588
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,400
 are paved with marble.

589
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,320
 It doesn't seem to be a single carpet

590
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,760
 that's not behind the perspex, so.

591
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,600
 - So funny.

592
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,440
 - You don't want to ruin them.

593
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,480
 That's a sign that you're treasuring your carpets.

594
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,320
 - Yeah, I guess.

595
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,160
 - 'Cause they're really, I mean,

596
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,200
 there is much wall hangings as for floors,

597
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,320
 until pretty recently, aren't they?

598
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,240
 I've always thought we should bring back the wall carpet.

599
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,800
 - Yes, I like it, yeah.

600
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,680
 - It's gone out of fashion a long time ago,

601
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,520
 like probably turned in the 20th century, maybe before.

602
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,920
 - I've got a carpet on a wall.

603
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,560
 - So it went out of fashion maybe 200 years ago,

604
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,400
 actually.

605
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
 - Have you really, only?

606
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,880
 - Yeah, why?

607
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,440
 - It's actually sound proofing, yeah.

608
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,040
 - Oh, maybe that's what they were doing,

609
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,880
 recording all their podcasts back in the day.

610
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,720
 - Maybe.

611
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,560
 (laughing)

612
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,800
 - I like, I was reading, there's Turkish carpets,

613
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,200
 rather than having a new Turkish carpet

614
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,360
 that feels like it's just really bold in its colors

615
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,760
 and really bright, getting a more antiquey feel to one

616
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
 is something that people chase more.

617
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,840
 And the way to make that happen that they do in Turkey

618
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
 is that they actually take the carpets out

619
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,080
 for months at a time and just lay them out in fields.

620
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,800
 So if you go on Google Earth and you zoom in on Turkey,

621
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,640
 there is whole fields, yeah, of thousands of carpets

622
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,920
 that are just laid out in the open because it's very dry.

623
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,520
 And they just sit there and it's these carpet layers

624
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,200
 who understand fading so well that someone can say,

625
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
 I want it faded to like this kind of degree

626
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,560
 and they're like, leave it to me.

627
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,520
 And they go and get the carpet when they know

628
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,040
 the time is right, when it's faded.

629
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,200
 Yeah, and it looks really antiquey and they dust it off

630
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,640
 and that's when you get your carpet.

631
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,760
 - Wow, that's really cool.

632
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,000
 - Is it fake? - No, I do believe you.

633
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,400
 It's just that when you say weird shit like that,

634
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,560
 it's off and on. - I know.

635
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,880
 - The way you looked at me, it was like, is that true, James?

636
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,720
 Is it true? - Prove me wrong.

637
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,520
 So did you hear that in 2012,

638
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,160
 scientists at the University of Manchester

639
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,360
 made a magic carpet, which is very exciting.

640
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,880
 Yeah, not a classic MagCarp.

641
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,120
 They made one which basically it can tell you

642
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,240
 when you're gonna fall over, which is very useful.

643
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,440
 - Oh, yeah. - So it doesn't fly high, though.

644
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,160
 - It's not flying. - It doesn't fly, no, no, no.

645
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,360
 They're working on that, but this is very useful for the--

646
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
 - They're working on that? - They're not working on that.

647
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
 - No, obviously they're not fucking working on that.

648
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
 - It's the next obvious step, isn't it?

649
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,640
 - Yeah. - No, but it's--

650
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,480
 - How does it do that?

651
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,840
 Does it just have those horrible rolls in it

652
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,240
 that trip you up and then a sign on the other side

653
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,800
 that goes, ha ha, told you'd fall over?

654
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,960
 - Quite the reverse.

655
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,800
 No, quite the reverse.

656
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,040
 It's stuffed with clever fiber optic cable

657
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,880
 and that kind of thing.

658
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
 And basically it builds up a profile of your movement

659
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,160
 as you're walking around.

660
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
 So it's not like-- - Can you get amazing internet

661
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,280
 if you're on that carpet?

662
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,440
 - It basically monitors you

663
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,960
 and if your movement deteriorates even slightly,

664
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,720
 it's for people who are elderly.

665
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,560
 - It can tell your gait, I guess, right?

666
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,880
 - Yeah, it can tell your gait.

667
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,080
 So it can't tell you you're about to fall over now,

668
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,920
 but it can say you're about to fall over soon.

669
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,960
 So look out for that.

670
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,600
 - You can imagine an alarm that went off

671
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,440
 when you're about to fall over,

672
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,080
 it would actually make you more likely to fall over.

673
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,640
 - 100%. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,640
 - Do you know that there's people at the Harvard University

675
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,320
 that are working on a magic carpet?

676
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,200
 - Same question, a flying one.

677
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,600
 - This is an actual flying one and they have made it,

678
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,120
 but it's the size of a banknote

679
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
 and it's only not 0.1 millimeters thick.

680
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,840
 - Okay.

681
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,880
 - But who's flying on it?

682
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,720
 Is it about aunt?

683
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,640
 - Like a cool, yeah, that'd be so exciting.

684
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,960
 - That would be awesome, right?

685
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
 They think that they could possibly make it bigger

686
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,800
 in the future, but you'd need so much energy

687
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,160
 and you'd need to make it ripple.

688
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,000
 So what it is, it's like a really tiny bit of,

689
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,120
 almost like paper, it ripples and ripples and ripples

690
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,520
 and then the force that these ripples cause

691
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,760
 can make it kind of just go up off the ground,

692
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,480
 but they can also make it go forward.

693
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,840
 So it's quite cool,

694
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,400
 but I suppose we're a few years away from it.

695
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

696
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,080
 - That's fair enough.

697
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,040
 - It's a long way to go.

698
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,880
 - That's very cool.

699
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,000
 - Can we go back to the countries

700
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,560
 that lead the world in carpet making?

701
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,720
 'Cause I don't think we've covered them all there a lot.

702
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,560
 - Okay.

703
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,160
 - So Turkmenistan is a big one,

704
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,120
 has the Guinness World Record

705
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,480
 for the biggest carpet in the world,

706
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,520
 which by the way, it's really beatable.

707
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
 If anyone wants to, it's 14 meters wide

708
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,680
 and 21.5 meters long, which feels shit.

709
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,000
 And it wasn't even made by that many people.

710
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,880
 Daily Sabah, which is a Turkish news site,

711
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
 said it was made by a total of 40 people,

712
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,800
 including one man.

713
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,160
 - It is like, historically,

714
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,080
 it's like a women's role to make these carpets, isn't it?

715
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,240
 - Yeah, pretty much everywhere.

716
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,480
 That seems to be the unifying thing

717
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,960
 across all of these carpet countries.

718
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,800
 It's always the women who do it.

719
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,760
 - He smashed through the carpet floor.

720
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,000
 (laughing)

721
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,680
 - It's great, well done, him.

722
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,320
 - But Turkmenistan's national flag has carpet on it.

723
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,160
 - Doesn't it?

724
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,480
 - Which I don't think any of the others do,

725
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,760
 so I think that's winning.

726
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,880
 But yeah, in 1992,

727
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,480
 when I think they became independent from the Soviets,

728
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,840
 they started designing their national flag.

729
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,280
 And if you look at it, it's a really nice flag.

730
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,840
 It's green with a red stripe

731
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,520
 and it has five carpet motifs on it.

732
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,320
 They're called gulls,

733
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
 and they're just little carpet patterns.

734
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,120
 - Oh, the flag's not made of carpet material.

735
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,720
 - Does it have tassels?

736
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,920
 'Cause if not, I'm not interested.

737
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,040
 - Yeah, exactly.

738
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
 It doesn't have tassels,

739
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
 and if it was made of carpet,

740
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,080
 it would need a fucking strong wind to fly it.

741
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,120
 (laughing)

742
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
 - Oh yeah, good point.

743
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,320
 - Can we talk about weather spoons, carpets, please, briefly?

744
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,160
 - Okay, sure.

745
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,960
 - Okay, every weather spoon,

746
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,720
 so about 900 in the UK has its own special carpet.

747
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,880
 And this wasn't known about until about 2015?

748
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,800
 Known about in public.

749
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,880
 - Must have been known about.

750
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,400
 - Tim Marson, the boss, he probably knew.

751
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
 He probably was laughing up his sleeve at all of us.

752
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
 - Everyone's always so pissed when they leave.

753
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,120
 They never remember the carpets.

754
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,960
 That's the trick.

755
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,800
 - There was a guy called Kit Kales,

756
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,780
 who started a blog about the floor coverings

757
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,960
 of every single weather spoon in the country.

758
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,040
 And he assumed they'd be identical when he started.

759
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,520
 So I'm not sure why he was blogging about it.

760
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,720
 But, all right, he found out,

761
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,560
 and then he started the blog.

762
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,600
 It doesn't matter.

763
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,840
 Each one has their own,

764
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,440
 and they're often themed to the local area.

765
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,480
 It's really exciting.

766
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,640
 So there's a Britannia pub in Plymouth,

767
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,840
 which is slightly cruise-chip based, you know.

768
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,360
 He wrote, Kit Kales, he wrote an entire book

769
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
 about weather spoons, pub carpets,

770
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,520
 and the sun covered it with the headline,

771
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,600
 "The Rug Pratt".

772
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,000
 Is this Britain's saddest hobby?

773
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,640
 - Is that a pun on the Rugrats?

774
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,960
 - It's a pun on the Rugrat, yeah, yeah.

775
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

776
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,640
 - I know.

777
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,480
 - Well, he was the person,

778
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,560
 the original people that made those carpets

779
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,400
 were the people that had--

780
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,240
 - Axe Minster.

781
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,160
 - Yes, yeah.

782
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,440
 - Yeah, I've gone a bit deep on this one, yeah.

783
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,680
 - Yeah, yeah, so they're the ones

784
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,440
 who have the royal decree.

785
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,280
 - Warrant.

786
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,920
 - Warrant in order to make carpets for the royal family.

787
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,520
 So, yeah, weather spoons and them,

788
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,000
 and then they stopped making it because people started coughing.

789
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,920
 - But Buckingham Palace, if you've ever been inside,

790
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,600
 it's all weather spoons.

791
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,960
 - Yeah, that's what's taking up all the space.

792
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,760
 The ground floor is just a really big weather spoon, yeah.

793
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,600
 - I'll tell you what,

794
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,000
 the Buckingham Palace all day breakfast is off.

795
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,240
 - You know, one very famous red carpet

796
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,640
 that we all are aware of is the Hollywood red carpet

797
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
 that we see at the Oscars every single year.

798
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,720
 And I didn't realize that there's so much mystery

799
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,560
 around the red carpet at Hollywood.

800
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,720
 So, when they make it,

801
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,920
 they make it in a mill in Dalton, in America,

802
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,160
 and they don't tell you which mill it's being made in.

803
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,480
 That's all we know.

804
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,520
 We don't know.

805
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,640
 It's got its own special color, Academy Red.

806
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,320
 They bring it there in a truck.

807
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,280
 It's very mysterious.

808
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,360
 They lay it down.

809
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,400
 They have people in tuxedos with little portable vacuums,

810
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,840
 just a vacuum at every spot,

811
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
 and make sure that the carpet's doing fine.

812
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,920
 And then when the ceremony's done,

813
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,960
 they pick it up and they burn it.

814
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,560
 And it's only ever used once.

815
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,800
 It's just a big mystery,

816
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,480
 and they make a whole new carpet the next time.

817
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,800
 - Why do they burn it?

818
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
 - Because they don't want the material.

819
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 So, a few people have stolen bits of material from it,

820
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,120
 and they've gone on eBay,

821
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,760
 and they're really worried that it's kind of like

822
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,800
 the Coca-Cola recipe.

823
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,840
 They're gonna discover the recipe for the

824
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,680
 Hollywood red carpet. - It's a red carpet.

825
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,520
 - No. - What do you want?

826
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,840
 - It's a magic carpet.

827
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,400
 - It's kind of slightly off-red.

828
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
 It's more like purple. - Yeah, it's burgundy.

829
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,760
 - Yeah, it's burgundy.

830
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
 - If you let people film the ceremony,

831
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,200
 you can see what color it is.

832
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,040
 - You can see the color,

833
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,560
 but you can't see what it's made of.

834
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,400
 - It's made of carpet. - I think--

835
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,080
 - It doesn't matter. - Oh.

836
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,640
 - I think, although I like the conspiracy theory reasoning,

837
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,960
 I think it's more likely that you can't reuse it,

838
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,400
 'cause the next Hollywood year,

839
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,520
 it's gonna look like crap.

840
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,400
 And it's 152 meters long,

841
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,600
 so there's very little other use you can put it to.

842
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,760
 There's hardly anyone who's got used

843
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,640
 for 152 meters long carpet.

844
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,480
 - I think it might be.

845
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,360
 Maybe it's just made of something really awesome,

846
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,960
 like Bill Murray's back hair or something.

847
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,200
 - Yeah, exactly, yes.

848
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
 - You know, people used to cover their carpets

849
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,360
 with other carpets to protect them?

850
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,600
 Called "druggets."

851
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,000
 - Oh, yeah, I've got one on my wall.

852
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,840
 Yeah.

853
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,960
 - Your wall is seven carpets thick.

854
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,640
 Yeah, until the 19th century,

855
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,080
 druggets which are just cheaper carpets

856
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,000
 that you put on top of your carpet for everyday use.

857
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,840
 And then if a guest came, you whipped the carpet off,

858
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,040
 and then you had the proper one underneath.

859
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,840
 - That's the sad thing, Andy has a drugget dealer,

860
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,680
 don't you?

861
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,520
 - Hey!

862
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,280
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

863
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,000
 and that is Andy.

864
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,040
 - My fact is that the world's first ever

865
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,120
 hot-air balloon wedding was meant to happen in 1865,

866
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,640
 but the officiating priest refused to go up.

867
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,280
 So the couple had the first ever

868
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,320
 hot-air balloon honeymoon instead.

869
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,400
 - Very nice.

870
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,120
 - It's just a nice story about a couple

871
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,800
 called Mary West Jenkins and John F. Boynton.

872
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,440
 They wanted to marry in a balloon.

873
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,760
 They thought it'd be fun.

874
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,680
 And the reverend said, "No."

875
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,240
 He said it was too unholy, not appropriate enough.

876
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,720
 So they just went up after the wedding instead.

877
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,240
 But it was a very exciting ceremony this wedding.

878
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,440
 There were 6,000 people there.

879
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,040
 - They were mostly there for the balloon.

880
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,160
 - They were there for the balloon, yeah.

881
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,200
 They were in Central Park.

882
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,440
 So they did get married in the end,

883
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,640
 but they got married on the ground.

884
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,760
 - And how much do you suspect that the reverend

885
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,360
 was just too much of a pussy to go up in the balloon?

886
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,600
 - It's possible, isn't it?

887
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
 - There was the Baltimore Daily Commercial

888
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,080
 of the 10th of November, 1865.

889
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,760
 This was a couple of days later.

890
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,600
 They said that the official story

891
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,120
 was that the priest had to get the last train to Philadelphia.

892
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,640
 Okay, but then they did say the actual reason, probably,

893
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,000
 was that the reverend gentleman,

894
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,640
 accustomed to operate soloing in mundane matrimony,

895
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
 had backed out at the 11th hour.

896
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
 - Right.

897
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,040
 I wonder how much a history,

898
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,320
 like speaking of the shortest baseball match before,

899
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,320
 has been influenced by people needing to get trains.

900
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,760
 (audience laughing)

901
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,600
 Quite a lot.

902
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,440
 - What time is it now?

903
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,880
 (laughing)

904
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,080
 - And the reverend, by the way,

905
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,360
 was a guy called Thomas DeWitt Talmadge.

906
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,800
 And one reason why I'm not sure

907
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,080
 whether he was scared of going up

908
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,040
 is he was a massive publicity stunt guy.

909
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,160
 And they said that he was the most famous clergyman

910
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,160
 in the world, including, hopefully, over 30.

911
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,440
 He was really, really famous.

912
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,280
 - That's famous.

913
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,960
 - He thought that no one should be able to read novels.

914
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,800
 - Sorry.

915
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
 - When was this?

916
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,400
 - This was in the 1860s.

917
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,160
 - People frowned on novels back then, didn't they?

918
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,640
 You were supposed to be reading Greek.

919
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,040
 - He said that anyone who read novels

920
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,240
 shouldn't be allowed to work in an office, a store,

921
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,080
 a home, a shop, or a factory.

922
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,640
 And he also thought that--

923
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,720
 - Where are you gonna work?

924
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,560
 In a field?

925
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
 - In a field.

926
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,920
 - Yeah, did you get one of Dan's magic jobs

927
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,400
 drying carpets out for a living?

928
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,760
 - It's not, it's not, it's real.

929
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,840
 - Yes, yes.

930
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,200
 - But this guy, there are two people who got married.

931
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,160
 It was, like you say, Mary West Jenkins

932
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,200
 and Dr. John F. Boynton.

933
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,240
 And his doctorate was in geology.

934
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,720
 And he decided that as well as doing his wedding

935
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,760
 up in the Hot Air Balloon,

936
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,700
 he also was gonna make several electrical experiments

937
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,720
 while he was up there.

938
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,560
 - Cool.

939
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,720
 - So he was like mixing business with pleasure.

940
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,640
 - Yeah, she must have been slightly annoyed

941
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,520
 as he set up the cathode.

942
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,320
 The balloon was an interesting one.

943
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,960
 Well, the owner of the balloon was an interesting man.

944
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,600
 He was called Thaddeus Lowe.

945
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
 And he had been a spy in the Civil War,

946
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,640
 but a balloon spy.

947
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,480
 - Right.

948
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,320
 - Yeah.

949
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,160
 - It's so hard to spy on a balloon.

950
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,000
 You'd think it was quite conspicuous.

951
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,840
 - It's very hard, yeah.

952
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,800
 But yeah, you're right.

953
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,320
 He had proposed balloons for use in the Civil War,

954
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,800
 which they actually were in the American Civil War.

955
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,640
 And he--

956
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,280
 - So what would he do as a spy, though, with the--

957
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,080
 - You would, you know, look around.

958
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
 - Oh, he'd be up there.

959
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,920
 - He'd be up there.

960
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,760
 - So he'd come back and be like,

961
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,080
 "They've got carpets everywhere."

962
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,120
 (laughing)

963
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,040
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

964
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,680
 He demonstrated it for George Washington,

965
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,080
 who had died about 40 years earlier.

966
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,560
 Sorry, for the White House.

967
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,120
 He'd gone up in Washington with a telegraph key

968
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,480
 which linked him to the White House.

969
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,440
 So he was able to radio down to the White House.

970
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,760
 - You mentioned George Washington, by mistake.

971
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,600
 - For no reason.

972
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,440
 - For no reason.

973
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,360
 - Oh, thank you for picking me up on that.

974
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
 - The first actual marriage that did happen,

975
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,760
 eventually, in a balloon was in 1874.

976
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,800
 It was Mary Elizabeth Walsh and Charles M. Colton.

977
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,760
 And it was on top of the P.T. Barnum Manhattan hypnodrome

978
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
 that they had.

979
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,040
 There was always a balloon on the top of there,

980
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,400
 and it used to go up all the time.

981
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,040
 And so they got married on there.

982
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,440
 And one of the people who was on there,

983
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,040
 who was basically Barnum's balloon guy,

984
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,680
 was called Washington Harrison Donaldson.

985
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,480
 And he was named Washington after George Washington,

986
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,120
 hence the connection.

987
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,200
 And he was a daredevil and he was amazing.

988
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,760
 So he used to do high wire acts and so on.

989
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,400
 And then when balloons became a thing,

990
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,280
 he did a thing whereby he would go up in a balloon,

991
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,640
 but he got rid of the basket and he would have a bar,

992
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,400
 just a bar where he would put his legs over and go up.

993
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,440
 And he would start doing basically trapeze style acts

994
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,560
 where he was flipping around and so on.

995
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,080
 And when he got very high,

996
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,640
 he would let the gas go down of the fire

997
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,000
 and he would come back down.

998
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,800
 And as he was coming back down,

999
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,880
 he would drop a human dummy from it,

1000
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,720
 which everyone would see suddenly a plummeting human

1001
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,120
 and it would land on the ground

1002
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,520
 and inside were business cards and flyers for his act.

1003
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,120
 - That's amazing. - And so yeah.

1004
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,080
 And so he used to go around doing this act

1005
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,600
 and eventually P.T. Barnum saw him and employed him.

1006
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,400
 And what he used to do in the middle of Manhattan

1007
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,720
 would go up in this balloon before shows

1008
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,680
 and when he was up there,

1009
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,600
 he would just throw Barnum business cards and so on.

1010
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,800
 So New York constantly littered with advertising.

1011
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,600
 - I think the balloon was called P.T. Barnum as well.

1012
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,800
 - Yeah, it was, yeah.

1013
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,760
 - Well, I thought these guys are pretty brave actually

1014
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,080
 because the wedding was postponed by one day

1015
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,520
 because the balloon burst the day before.

1016
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,760
 - It's a good way to get your wedding paid for.

1017
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,200
 It was the idea of the couple, the first wedding.

1018
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,240
 And it was basically a way to get P.T. Barnum

1019
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,480
 to fund their whole wedding and pay their dowry

1020
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,320
 'cause it was such good publicity.

1021
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,680
 And also, 'cause these became really popular,

1022
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
 if you look through new searches of the late 19th century,

1023
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,960
 balloon weddings were the thing.

1024
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,400
 And it was such a good way to get guests to your wedding

1025
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,680
 if you didn't have mates.

1026
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,840
 'Cause thousands of people would come

1027
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,600
 and sure they're there for the balloon,

1028
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,600
 but the photos just say, "I'm a seriously popular dude."

1029
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,200
 And there was one, actually I read about one in 1884.

1030
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,640
 This was in Pennsylvania where the couple failed to arrive.

1031
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,560
 They freaked out and realized they were too scared to do it.

1032
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,920
 And all the promoters were gonna have to refund the crowd

1033
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,160
 'cause you'd be a paying customer as well as a guest.

1034
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,520
 And they decided they weren't gonna do this.

1035
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,960
 So instead, the balloon's owner and his assistant

1036
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,240
 like staged a marriage.

1037
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,560
 They posed as the couple.

1038
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,000
 They got married to each other in this balloon,

1039
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,280
 went up in the air, under assumed names,

1040
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,800
 but they only found out four years later.

1041
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,520
 It was actually legally binding.

1042
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,760
 - Did they stay, did they fall in love?

1043
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,600
 - I really don't wanna tell you the answer to that

1044
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,920
 because I think it'll ruin your night.

1045
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,760
 - Okay, don't tell me, don't say anything.

1046
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,640
 - Okay, we'll leave it there.

1047
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,040
 - There was one in 1888.

1048
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,840
 This was a wedding between Margaret Buckley

1049
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,520
 and Edward T. Davis.

1050
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,880
 40,000 people came to that wedding

1051
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,600
 to see them go up on the hot air balloon.

1052
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,800
 Unfortunately, the balloon then landed in a swamp,

1053
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,160
 but it kept kind of moving along the swamp.

1054
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,400
 So they were dragged for two miles,

1055
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,000
 clinging to the ropes of the balloon,

1056
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,480
 and they finished the rest of the trip by train.

1057
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,360
 - So good.

1058
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,000
 I have a favorite hot air balloon love story.

1059
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,920
 This is an account from someone online.

1060
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
 My husband proposed to me

1061
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,640
 on a private hot air balloon ride.

1062
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,920
 That's not the story.

1063
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,400
 The pilot told us that one time he had five couples

1064
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,480
 on a larger ride,

1065
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,920
 and one of the guys decided to propose to his girlfriend

1066
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
 by having a big sign on the ground

1067
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,920
 where they're landing saying, "Will you marry me?"

1068
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,960
 - But he didn't put a name on the sign.

1069
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,640
 All five couples were dating,

1070
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,600
 and all five of the women thought,

1071
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,880
 "This is the best proposal I've ever received in my life."

1072
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,720
 And four of them were disappointed.

1073
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,520
 - Would you, I mean, I think you'd roll with it, wouldn't you?

1074
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,320
 - If it's a third date, it's too, you know.

1075
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
 - You can't roll with it.

1076
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
 It's got to be someone's.

1077
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,520
 You can't say, "Oh yeah, that's mine,"

1078
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,600
 and have the other bloke next.

1079
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,240
 You go, "No, it's not. It's mine."

1080
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,720
 - Anyway, I love it. - There is actually,

1081
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,280
 there was a service that offers, it's called D&D Ballooning.

1082
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,920
 I think sadly the company's shut down now,

1083
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,560
 but it existed last year. - Down to the Dragon's Ballooning?

1084
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,040
 - You look too excited about that, but no.

1085
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,120
 I think D&D is just the people who run the company.

1086
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,320
 It's in California, and it offers mile-high balloon trips,

1087
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,760
 and basically what it promises is comfort and discretion

1088
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,960
 for a couple.

1089
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,040
 It says, "You've got in your basket the privacy

1090
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,520
 of an enclosed dome tent with your own private view

1091
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,400
 as our discreet pilot ascends to one mile.

1092
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,200
 We provide a CD player.

1093
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,640
 You provide the music blankets, pillows, and imagination,

1094
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,400
 and it lasts an hour."

1095
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,440
 - An hour. - An hour.

1096
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,640
 - Five minutes in. - Yeah.

1097
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,280
 - Seconds like that. - Oh, come on, Bringson.

1098
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,040
 - Sorry, we haven't actually taken off yet.

1099
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,040
 (audience laughing)

1100
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,160
 - Oh my God.

1101
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,680
 - We're gonna have to wrap up very shortly.

1102
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,320
 - Can I tell you about One Balloon Hero?

1103
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,160
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1104
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,680
 - Willie Coppins, heard of him?

1105
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,080
 - Willie Owenty, go on.

1106
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,000
 - He will, he will, and he did.

1107
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,960
 He was a fighter pilot in the First World War,

1108
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,920
 Belgian man, very brilliant at shooting down

1109
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,640
 observation balloons, right?

1110
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,000
 Which were major features of the First World War.

1111
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
 - Three simply large target, long shot.

1112
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,120
 - Look, they were very well defended, all right.

1113
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,720
 He was so good at it, they were called balloon busters,

1114
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,560
 the pilots who did it.

1115
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,560
 He shot down nearly 40 balloons during the war,

1116
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,400
 which is really big potatoes, okay?

1117
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,560
 The German army was so angry about Willie Coppins,

1118
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,040
 they specifically tried to kill him

1119
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,800
 with a booby-trapped balloon.

1120
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,400
 They put up a balloon with explosives.

1121
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,880
 But get this, once, he was being shot at

1122
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,560
 from a German balloon in his plane,

1123
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,400
 and he cool-ly just flew up and around

1124
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,200
 and parked on top of the balloon,

1125
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
 went till it landed,

1126
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,160
 and then just gently slid his plane off and flew away.

1127
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,880
 - Listen, if you're gonna give me shit

1128
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,840
 about carpets being laid out in Turkey.

1129
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,080
 (audience laughing)

1130
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
 No way, buster.

1131
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,680
 - I'm a bit skeptical, I have to say.

1132
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,320
 Never thought I'd say this, but I'm with Dan here.

1133
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,520
 That's an abrupt break.

1134
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,120
 That's an emergency break for a plane to land on a balloon.

1135
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,960
 - No, it's a very soft landing, surely?

1136
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,920
 - No, it's the softest landing you could possibly have.

1137
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,760
 - If you think about it,

1138
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,240
 you'd need a vertical takeoff and landing plane, right?

1139
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,800
 Like most planes kind of come into a runway, so it's--

1140
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,320
 - It might have been a very long balloon that he was like,

1141
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,360
 they had those long balloons that he was landing on.

1142
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,440
 That's the wrong way.

1143
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,400
 - A Zeppelin.

1144
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,240
 - A Zeppelin.

1145
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,400
 - It was a Zeppelin.

1146
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,000
 - Yeah, any further questions?

1147
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,840
 Please, no.

1148
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,720
 (laughing)

1149
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,520
 - Look, I hate to cut this off,

1150
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,960
 but we got a train to catch.

1151
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,400
 (audience laughing)

1152
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,920
 So that's it, that is all of our facts.

1153
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,480
