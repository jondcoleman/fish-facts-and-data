00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:20,00:00:23,this week coming to you live from Oxford!
00:00:23,00:00:26,(audience cheering)
00:00:27,00:00:30,(audience cheering)
00:00:30,00:00:32,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:00:32,00:00:35,"with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:35,00:00:37,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:37,00:00:38,we have gathered round the microphones
00:00:38,00:00:42,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:42,00:00:45,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,my fact this week is that the longest
00:00:50,00:00:55,professional baseball match on record only lasted so long
00:00:55,00:00:57,because the umpire's rule book was missing the bit
00:00:57,00:01:00,that explained when a match should be stopped.
00:01:00,00:01:02,(audience laughing)
00:01:02,00:01:03,- That's amazing.
00:01:03,00:01:07,I kind of think that an umpire should already know the rules
00:01:07,00:01:10,by the time he's starting to umpire the game.
00:01:10,00:01:11,"- Yeah, you would think."
00:01:11,00:01:11,"- Halfway through, he shouldn't be going,"
00:01:11,00:01:13,"""No, I'm just gonna check."""
00:01:13,00:01:17,"- Well, this was unprecedented times in the baseball world."
00:01:17,00:01:21,"So this was a match that was in April 18th, 1981."
00:01:21,00:01:23,"It was the poor Tuckett Red Sox,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,"and they were playing the Rochester Red Wings,"
00:01:26,00:01:27,and so these are smaller teams
00:01:27,00:01:30,and a different league professional baseball players though.
00:01:30,00:01:33,"And poor Tuckett, it was played there,"
00:01:33,00:01:34,which is in Rhode Island.
00:01:34,00:01:37,"Big deal for poor Tuckett, because the newspaper,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,"the next day, said not since the time"
00:01:39,00:01:43,"that they had to shoot the drunken camel at the City Zoo,"
00:01:43,00:01:44,(audience laughing)
00:01:44,00:01:47,has there been this much excitement in poor Tuckett.
00:01:47,00:01:48,(audience laughing)
00:01:48,00:01:50,"- Yeah, but it was in 1981."
00:01:50,00:01:53,"- 1981, so it sounds like a weird match from ages ago,"
00:01:53,00:01:54,but quite recently really.
00:01:54,00:01:57,"At the start of the match, there were 1700 fans watching."
00:01:57,00:01:59,"By the time the game eventually ended,"
00:01:59,00:02:02,"which was 4.07 in the morning,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,"there were 20 people left watching,"
00:02:04,00:02:06,"still watching the match, 20,"
00:02:06,00:02:07,which I feel is quite a lot.
00:02:07,00:02:09,- I read that some of them were asleep.
00:02:09,00:02:10,"- Oh, okay."
00:02:10,00:02:11,"- They all got given a season ticket,"
00:02:11,00:02:12,so it paid off for them.
00:02:12,00:02:13,- I think some of them got lifetime passes.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"- Yeah, they did, that's true."
00:02:15,00:02:17,"So it was the longest baseball match on the world,"
00:02:17,00:02:19,which is eight hours and 25 minutes.
00:02:19,00:02:21,It really isn't that long.
00:02:21,00:02:23,I think what makes it long.
00:02:23,00:02:24,- It's quite long.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"- Well, come on, we're from a nation of cricket."
00:02:26,00:02:27,That was bullshit.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"- Exactly, exactly."
00:02:29,00:02:30,"'Cause all the writing up,"
00:02:30,00:02:32,"like there was a player called Wade Bogues,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"who was 22 years old when the match started,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,"and by the time it ended, he was 23."
00:02:36,00:02:38,(audience laughing)
00:02:38,00:02:39,- Wade Bogues is quite famous.
00:02:39,00:02:41,He became quite a famous player later.
00:02:41,00:02:42,- Did he?
00:02:42,00:02:44,"But this didn't happen to land on the,"
00:02:44,00:02:46,"when it went past midnight, he turned 23."
00:02:46,00:02:49,"The thing about this match was it was eventually stopped,"
00:02:49,00:02:52,and they then resumed the match a few months later.
00:02:52,00:02:53,"- Oh, you're kidding."
00:02:53,00:02:55,"Oh, I thought it was just a midnight thing the birthday."
00:02:55,00:02:56,"- No, no."
00:02:56,00:02:57,"- Oh, okay."
00:02:57,00:02:58,"- But when they've carried on afterwards,"
00:02:58,00:03:01,it took like about 18 minutes or something.
00:03:01,00:03:03,"- Yeah, didn't they just have a school once, basically?"
00:03:03,00:03:05,"And they did, and then that's over."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"And there's sort of thousands of people flocked,"
00:03:07,00:03:08,'cause by then it was almost as big news
00:03:08,00:03:09,as the drunken camel thing.
00:03:09,00:03:12,"So the entirety of the nation, practically,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,was there for 18 minutes.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"But Dan, what's the deal with the missing page?"
00:03:16,00:03:18,Who's ripped out the crucial page?
00:03:18,00:03:20,"- Yeah, we don't know if it was missing,"
00:03:20,00:03:22,"we don't know if they couldn't find it,"
00:03:22,00:03:23,and just no one knew what to do.
00:03:23,00:03:25,And so there was actually someone
00:03:25,00:03:27,that they were trying to call on a landline
00:03:27,00:03:30,"who was higher up, who just wasn't near their phone."
00:03:30,00:03:33,"Also, it was 12 a.m. heading into 4 a.m. eventually."
00:03:33,00:03:35,"So they eventually got through to him,"
00:03:35,00:03:36,"and they were like, ""What do we do?"""
00:03:36,00:03:38,"And he was like, ""Stop the fucking match!"
00:03:38,00:03:40,"""What are you doing?"""
00:03:40,00:03:41,"Why did they, why was it lasting so long?"
00:03:41,00:03:42,Do we know? - So what happens
00:03:42,00:03:44,in baseball is you have an innings and an innings.
00:03:44,00:03:48,You keep going with inningses until someone scores more
00:03:48,00:03:49,than that innings than the other team.
00:03:49,00:03:52,You do a certain number that you're supposed to do.
00:03:52,00:03:54,"And then if it's a tie, you just keep going"
00:03:54,00:03:56,until one team gets like sudden death.
00:03:56,00:03:57,"And they just kept going,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,"nil nil, nil nil, nil nil, nil nil, nil nil."
00:04:00,00:04:02,"And then there was a one,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,and then the other team got a one.
00:04:04,00:04:07,"And that was, it was Wade Boggs."
00:04:07,00:04:10,He kind of got a home run to tie that game.
00:04:10,00:04:12,"And he said, ""I didn't know if the guys on my team"
00:04:12,00:04:14,"""wanted to hug me or slug me."""
00:04:14,00:04:17,- That's a great thing to say.
00:04:17,00:04:19,"- Boggs, by the way, I just want to say,"
00:04:19,00:04:20,"because he is famous,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,but the most thing I know about him
00:04:22,00:04:26,is he once consumed 107 beers in one day.
00:04:26,00:04:29,"- Whoa, for like charity or?"
00:04:29,00:04:32,- He was just thirsty.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"- Sometimes people don't need an incentive, Dan,"
00:04:34,00:04:35,to drink the 100 beers.
00:04:35,00:04:37,"- He's famous as big drinker,"
00:04:37,00:04:39,but then this is the record that his friend said
00:04:39,00:04:40,and he's confirmed.
00:04:40,00:04:41,- Wow.
00:04:41,00:04:44,"- But so the match itself, again,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"I wish we hadn't told you it was just eight hours,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,"because when you hear the details of the match,"
00:04:48,00:04:50,it does sound like it just went on for like a week.
00:04:50,00:04:53,"So the accounts of the baseball players,"
00:04:53,00:04:54,"a very cold night,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,the baseball players getting so cold
00:04:56,00:04:58,that they were ripping up furniture from the dugout
00:04:58,00:04:59,"and burning it,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,snapping used baseball bats in half
00:05:01,00:05:05,"and putting it in this bin of fire to stay warm,"
00:05:05,00:05:05,to keep them going.
00:05:05,00:05:07,"- If you can snap a baseball bat in half,"
00:05:07,00:05:09,I don't think you'd need a fire.
00:05:09,00:05:10,I think you're fine.
00:05:10,00:05:13,- A jump rod.
00:05:13,00:05:14,These people are pathetic.
00:05:14,00:05:15,- I know.
00:05:15,00:05:16,- It was cold.
00:05:16,00:05:17,It was really cold.
00:05:17,00:05:18,And that was one of the problems.
00:05:18,00:05:20,It was a really windy day as well.
00:05:20,00:05:23,"And so the problem was it kept being nil, nil, nil, nil"
00:05:23,00:05:25,because no one could get any home runs.
00:05:25,00:05:27,And the reason was they kept whacking it for miles and miles
00:05:27,00:05:29,and the wind would just blow it back into the stadium.
00:05:29,00:05:30,- Oh.
00:05:30,00:05:31,- Were they playing with a boomerang?
00:05:31,00:05:32,It turned out.
00:05:32,00:05:35,"- Yeah, extraordinary game."
00:05:35,00:05:36,- It is quite pathetic.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"If you look at sports matches of your,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,"where they basically,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,before all these rules were codified for all the sports
00:05:42,00:05:44,"in sort of mid to late 19th century,"
00:05:44,00:05:46,"they just went on for days and days and days, didn't they?"
00:05:46,00:05:48,You get football matches and rugby matches
00:05:48,00:05:50,with hundreds of participants.
00:05:50,00:05:52,You'd have one village playing another village
00:05:52,00:05:54,and they play from dawn until dusk
00:05:54,00:05:56,for like four days straight.
00:05:56,00:05:57,It was great.
00:05:57,00:05:59,I think the first recorded football match ever
00:05:59,00:06:03,"in Sheffield in 1794, that was three days long."
00:06:03,00:06:05,"And the match report said three days long,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,a very good match and it felt necessary to note
00:06:08,00:06:10,"that although there were quite a lot of injuries,"
00:06:10,00:06:11,no one was killed.
00:06:12,00:06:14,"- But that's amazing 'cause that team,"
00:06:14,00:06:16,"before that game, they were called Sheffield Monday,"
00:06:16,00:06:17,weren't they?
00:06:17,00:06:18,(laughing)
00:06:18,00:06:19,- Very strong.
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- But on the flip side,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,you do get short baseball games as well.
00:06:23,00:06:26,"And there is a record for shortest baseball game ever,"
00:06:26,00:06:31,which was in 1916 and the match lasted for 31 minutes.
00:06:31,00:06:34,"And yeah, and that's really quick for baseball."
00:06:34,00:06:37,And the reason is both teams beforehand spoke to each other
00:06:37,00:06:39,"and realized they both had them trained to catch,"
00:06:39,00:06:40,which was going quite early.
00:06:40,00:06:41,- No way.
00:06:41,00:06:44,"- So, but the problem was for the fans who came to the match"
00:06:44,00:06:47,is that the game started 30 minutes early.
00:06:47,00:06:51,So the game ended before it was meant to start.
00:06:51,00:06:53,"So fans rocked up and they're like,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,"""This is gonna be great."""
00:06:54,00:06:56,And then they saw like the final batter or whatever.
00:06:56,00:06:57,And then they all went off.
00:06:57,00:06:58,- That's bullshit.
00:06:58,00:07:01,I'm outraged for these people 105 years ago.
00:07:01,00:07:05,- Do you know the first ever baseball rule
00:07:05,00:07:09,that was written down was that all players must be punctual?
00:07:09,00:07:10,- Really?
00:07:11,00:07:12,This is the oldest set of rules we have.
00:07:12,00:07:14,They're called the Nicarbaca rules.
00:07:14,00:07:16,They were written in New York.
00:07:16,00:07:18,"But the thing was the teams were from New York,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,but there wasn't much room to play in New York.
00:07:21,00:07:23,So they always played in New Jersey.
00:07:23,00:07:25,And so if you have to schlep all the way over the river
00:07:25,00:07:27,"to New Jersey, obviously you don't want people"
00:07:27,00:07:30,turning up half an hour later or an hour later or whatever.
00:07:30,00:07:32,So that's why that was the first rule.
00:07:32,00:07:33,"- It was good, wasn't it?"
00:07:33,00:07:36,"- Interestingly, a New Jersey is what these poor cold guys"
00:07:36,00:07:38,in the match we previously referred to need it.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"- And also in those set of rules,"
00:07:42,00:07:45,hitting the ball out of the stadium was a foul.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"So you know in baseball now,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,really what you're trying to do is whack it all the way out.
00:07:49,00:07:51,"In those days, if you did that, you would be out."
00:07:51,00:07:53,And that's because the stadium was right next
00:07:53,00:07:55,to the Hudson River and they couldn't afford
00:07:55,00:07:56,to lose all the balls.
00:07:56,00:07:58,"- So did the phrase, you knocked it out of the park,"
00:07:58,00:08:00,have a negative connotation of those things?
00:08:00,00:08:02,"Idiot, you knocked it out of the park."
00:08:02,00:08:04,Now we've got to go and get it in the boat.
00:08:04,00:08:08,- There was one controversial rule book incident
00:08:08,00:08:09,which I read about.
00:08:09,00:08:10,And this was a guy called Earl Weaver
00:08:10,00:08:13,who was manager of the Baltimore Orioles.
00:08:13,00:08:15,And he had a real issue with umpires.
00:08:15,00:08:16,So I think he was managing in the 1970s.
00:08:16,00:08:17,He hated umpires.
00:08:17,00:08:18,He thought none of them knew the rules.
00:08:18,00:08:20,They didn't know what they were doing.
00:08:20,00:08:23,He got told off loads of times for once he pulled up third base
00:08:23,00:08:25,and just walked off the pitch with it.
00:08:25,00:08:30,"He wants, the description was he was told off"
00:08:30,00:08:31,for pecking at an umpire's chin
00:08:31,00:08:33,with the beak of his baseball cap.
00:08:33,00:08:36,So they had a tense relationship.
00:08:36,00:08:37,"Anyway, in 1979, he got in such a big fight"
00:08:37,00:08:40,with one of the umpires who basically hadn't called out
00:08:40,00:08:43,what this guy thought was an illegal move of the oppositions
00:08:43,00:08:46,"that he went to the dugout, he got the rule book,"
00:08:46,00:08:48,he marched back onto the field
00:08:48,00:08:50,"and he opened the rule book and started reading from it,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,"saying, look, you obviously don't know the rules, you idiot."
00:08:53,00:08:55,"And the umpire got annoyed, understandably."
00:08:55,00:08:57,And so then he started tearing the rule book to shreds
00:08:57,00:09:00,and throwing it all over the field in front of them.
00:09:00,00:09:03,"- One of the other things, early baseball,"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"they never, so baseball players all have that cool glove"
00:09:06,00:09:08,that we get as kids when we're playing.
00:09:08,00:09:09,- The baseball glove.
00:09:09,00:09:10,"- Yeah, that's what it's called."
00:09:10,00:09:12,"- You don't mean the giant gladiator phone thing,"
00:09:12,00:09:15,"but you mean the phone thing. - No, I don't mean the audio thing."
00:09:15,00:09:18,"- No, so those gloves, but in the early days of baseball,"
00:09:18,00:09:19,that was seen as a very wimpy thing
00:09:19,00:09:22,to have any kind of handwear.
00:09:22,00:09:24,So you would just have to use your hands.
00:09:24,00:09:26,But that was really damaging all the players
00:09:26,00:09:28,"because those balls, as we know, very hard"
00:09:28,00:09:29,and they're being walloped.
00:09:29,00:09:32,So that was a real risk when you were a baseball player.
00:09:32,00:09:35,"And so it was a player, as far as one historian"
00:09:35,00:09:38,"was looking and find this player called Charles C. Waite,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,who was the first person who wore a glove.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"But because he was so scared of being made fun for it,"
00:09:43,00:09:47,he wore his skin tone color as the glove.
00:09:47,00:09:49,"So he thought at that distance,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,"they might just think in the crowd,"
00:09:51,00:09:52,"""Oh, he's got slightly big hands."""
00:09:52,00:09:54,(audience laughing)
00:09:54,00:09:55,- But just one big hand.
00:09:55,00:09:56,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:09:56,00:09:58,- Just on the gloves and the catching and throwing.
00:09:58,00:09:59,- Yeah.
00:09:59,00:10:02,- So the world record for throwing and catching eggs
00:10:02,00:10:05,was set by a couple of baseball players from New Zealand.
00:10:05,00:10:06,- What was it?
00:10:06,00:10:07,- I guess they're very practised at it.
00:10:07,00:10:10,Called Nick Hornstein and Ricky Pyeway in 2018.
00:10:10,00:10:12,- So is that like I throw an egg to you
00:10:12,00:10:13,and you have to catch it and you have to be
00:10:13,00:10:14,as far away from me as possible?
00:10:14,00:10:15,- Exactly.
00:10:15,00:10:17,- Does it matter how the egg is cooked?
00:10:17,00:10:18,"- It does, come on."
00:10:18,00:10:20,That would be very--
00:10:20,00:10:22,"- Frisbeer fried egg, come on, that's a challenge."
00:10:22,00:10:24,- It's 93.6 meters.
00:10:24,00:10:25,- Sounds boiled.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"- Which is pretty, it was not, it was a raw egg."
00:10:28,00:10:29,And it was very impressive.
00:10:29,00:10:32,"And this is at the World Egg Throwing Federation,"
00:10:32,00:10:35,which is based in Swatton in England.
00:10:35,00:10:36,- We know where it's based.
00:10:36,00:10:37,- Sorry.
00:10:37,00:10:40,"Anyway, it sounds like an incredible party,"
00:10:40,00:10:42,the World Egg Throwing Championship.
00:10:42,00:10:43,So I was reading an account of it
00:10:43,00:10:46,and I'm just gonna read you what happened on the day.
00:10:46,00:10:49,Former champ Norm Fowler of Peterborough
00:10:49,00:10:51,won the Russian egg roulette.
00:10:51,00:10:53,No explanation in this article of what that is.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"Then the Target Accuracy Contest,"
00:10:55,00:10:58,"throwing at male model Joel Hicks,"
00:10:58,00:11:01,was won by Tina from Cambridge with two shots to the groin.
00:11:01,00:11:04,(audience laughing)
00:11:04,00:11:09,"- Listen, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:11:09,00:11:12,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:11:12,00:11:15,- My fact this week is that when acorn woodpeckers
00:11:15,00:11:18,"fight each other, the rumour spreads through the community"
00:11:18,00:11:21,and other acorn woodpeckers turn up to watch.
00:11:21,00:11:23,(audience laughing)
00:11:23,00:11:24,This is so cool.
00:11:24,00:11:26,"So they're really social, they're the most social woodpeckers,"
00:11:26,00:11:29,"'cause a lot of woodpeckers are solitary, I'm sure you know."
00:11:29,00:11:31,And they love this spectator sport
00:11:31,00:11:35,"and they have these amazing battles over their territory,"
00:11:35,00:11:37,"their trees, their granary trees,"
00:11:37,00:11:39,which are where they stockpile all their acorns.
00:11:39,00:11:43,And basically the trees are guarded by a group of males
00:11:43,00:11:45,who are all brothers and then a group of females
00:11:45,00:11:47,who are all sisters and they're all chagging each other
00:11:47,00:11:49,as well as guarding the tree.
00:11:49,00:11:50,"But they're not brothers and sisters with each other,"
00:11:50,00:11:52,so there's no incest going on.
00:11:52,00:11:56,"Anyway, when one gender dies out, when one sex dies out,"
00:11:56,00:12:00,then there's a vacancy and so a bunch of female acorn woodpeckers
00:12:00,00:12:02,will want to swoop in to claim that tree
00:12:02,00:12:04,and these massive fights break out
00:12:04,00:12:06,between the different claimants to the tree.
00:12:06,00:12:08,"And yeah, people come from miles around,"
00:12:08,00:12:10,"not when I say people, I mean woodpeckers."
00:12:10,00:12:11,(audience laughing)
00:12:11,00:12:12,- You've identified too closely
00:12:12,00:12:14,"with your research area this week, Anna, yeah."
00:12:14,00:12:15,- That's amazing.
00:12:15,00:12:17,- And they'll travel for a couple of miles
00:12:17,00:12:19,and they'll spend like an hour a day
00:12:19,00:12:22,just watching this big fight and they'll go back home.
00:12:22,00:12:24,"And I think it's useful, they think,"
00:12:24,00:12:27,"'cause you can pick up social information,"
00:12:27,00:12:28,spy out potential mates.
00:12:28,00:12:30,- But they leave their bit of tree
00:12:30,00:12:32,that they're protecting in order to see this fight.
00:12:32,00:12:35,And it feels like that's the next little trick of evolution
00:12:35,00:12:37,that you need to fake a fight
00:12:37,00:12:39,and then send in your troops around the back.
00:12:39,00:12:41,- Or just like one acorn woodpecker
00:12:41,00:12:43,"who kind of goes around when everyone else is at the fight,"
00:12:43,00:12:44,just stealing their acorns.
00:12:44,00:12:47,"- Exactly, or claiming the trees, you know?"
00:12:47,00:12:49,"- Oh yeah, you've broken the system."
00:12:49,00:12:50,"- The fights, they last for a long time,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,they last for about a day sometimes.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"I know the woodpecker, the audience has come for an hour."
00:12:53,00:12:55,"- Very much, it's last for five days, so."
00:12:55,00:12:58,"- That's true, pathetic."
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Yeah, this family strategy they have"
00:12:59,00:13:01,"is pretty interesting,"
00:13:01,00:13:04,the sort of incest avoidance thing they have
00:13:04,00:13:06,because you get a breeding pair
00:13:06,00:13:08,"and then you get a load of babysitter,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,"let's say a load of babysitter males, okay,"
00:13:10,00:13:11,who are the offspring of the breeding pair.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Got it.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"- Then the breeding female will die, okay?"
00:13:15,00:13:18,But that means that there has to be a new female.
00:13:18,00:13:20,"However, the previous, the helper males,"
00:13:20,00:13:23,"the babysitter males, previously couldn't breed"
00:13:23,00:13:26,"because the breeding female was their mother, okay?"
00:13:26,00:13:29,"So, but now they're on equal terms with their dad"
00:13:29,00:13:31,because there's gonna be a new breeding female.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"So now there is just a parity,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,so they're all gonna breed with the new female.
00:13:36,00:13:39,"So finally, and this is good for obviously,"
00:13:39,00:13:42,"for the babysitter males who now can breed,"
00:13:42,00:13:43,but it's also very interesting
00:13:43,00:13:46,'cause it means these birds have an awareness
00:13:46,00:13:48,of the relations of other birds to each other.
00:13:48,00:13:50,It's called triadic awareness.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"And it's not a Woody Woodpecker though, is it?"
00:13:53,00:13:55,(audience laughing)
00:13:55,00:13:57,"- Does it make, do we know if it makes it"
00:13:57,00:13:59,an awkward father-son dynamic?
00:13:59,00:14:01,It's like if your parents divorce
00:14:01,00:14:03,"and then your dad marries a step-mom,"
00:14:03,00:14:04,then you also shag the step-mom.
00:14:04,00:14:05,- Is it?
00:14:05,00:14:07,- And that often creates tension.
00:14:07,00:14:08,- I think it does.
00:14:08,00:14:10,(audience laughing)
00:14:10,00:14:12,- That's just why I wonder if it's the same.
00:14:12,00:14:13,- Yeah?
00:14:13,00:14:16,"But it's so, yeah, like that family dynamic is so weird."
00:14:16,00:14:18,It's also the case that a few mums will also live
00:14:18,00:14:20,"in the same nest, right?"
00:14:20,00:14:24,"And when that happens, and they're having eggs,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,they try and synchronize eggs
00:14:26,00:14:29,so that they don't have one child arriving before the other.
00:14:29,00:14:32,"And what they'll do is if one of the mothers has an egg,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,they'll knock the egg out just to make sure
00:14:35,00:14:36,that that's no longer--
00:14:36,00:14:37,- I think they might eat it.
00:14:37,00:14:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they'll get the young instance."
00:14:40,00:14:41,- So if there are two breeding females--
00:14:41,00:14:42,- Exactly.
00:14:42,00:14:43,- And they haven't synchronized
00:14:43,00:14:44,"when they're having their eggs,"
00:14:44,00:14:47,the other one will push out or eat the egg of the first one
00:14:47,00:14:50,"until they get it right, until they get it all the time."
00:14:50,00:14:53,"- Or, sadistically, feed it to the mother often, you know?"
00:14:53,00:14:56,You've laid an egg and then your rival female pushes it out
00:14:56,00:14:58,and then comes and feeds it back to you.
00:14:58,00:15:00,But it's all 'cause of this bizarre setup
00:15:00,00:15:02,where they have up to seven males
00:15:02,00:15:04,"and up to three females in every crew, isn't it?"
00:15:04,00:15:06,"So you've got these three rival females at all times,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,constantly laying and killing each other's kids
00:15:08,00:15:09,and laying and killing each other's kids.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"- And it can be weeks, cannibalism for weeks"
00:15:12,00:15:14,and then you time it right and then happy families again.
00:15:14,00:15:17,"- Yeah, it's like when your periods are synchronizing"
00:15:17,00:15:17,when women live together.
00:15:17,00:15:19,It takes a few months to get in sync.
00:15:19,00:15:20,- Yes.
00:15:20,00:15:21,- And you kill each other's periods
00:15:21,00:15:23,until they all arrive at the same time.
00:15:23,00:15:24,"- Yes. - Apart from, of course,"
00:15:24,00:15:25,that's a myth. - Ah.
00:15:25,00:15:27,- It's a myth women's periods don't synchronize.
00:15:27,00:15:28,- Is it?
00:15:28,00:15:30,"Oh, yeah, you keep claiming it's a myth, but I,"
00:15:30,00:15:31,"what am I, let's move on."
00:15:31,00:15:34,"No, Dan, please don't. - Come on, Dan, please don't."
00:15:34,00:15:38,"Well, my research has shown in the houses that I live in"
00:15:38,00:15:39,that there's something to it.
00:15:39,00:15:41,"- Hundreds of thousands of houses, I'm sure."
00:15:41,00:15:44,"- I had to move a lot of times to different houses,"
00:15:44,00:15:45,particularly when they found out
00:15:45,00:15:48,of my period experiment I was conducting.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"- The fights are pretty violent, though,"
00:15:50,00:15:53,because I read one place that said the birds
00:15:53,00:15:56,basically have spears for mouths.
00:15:56,00:15:57,And you'll see after the fights
00:15:57,00:16:00,"that the birds will have eyes gouged out,"
00:16:00,00:16:01,blood all over them.
00:16:01,00:16:04,They'll fall to the floor holding each other's legs
00:16:04,00:16:06,so they can't fly and they'll kind of crash to the ground.
00:16:06,00:16:08,So they're pretty violent.
00:16:08,00:16:09,- Wow.
00:16:09,00:16:10,- You can see why people go to watch.
00:16:10,00:16:11,- Yes.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"- Yeah. - And by people, again."
00:16:13,00:16:15,(laughing)
00:16:15,00:16:18,"- They make a sound that goes like, ""Waka, waka."""
00:16:18,00:16:19,"- Oh, like Fosy Bear."
00:16:19,00:16:22,- Fosy Bear or Shakira were the only two I could pick up.
00:16:22,00:16:24,(laughing)
00:16:24,00:16:25,- When will they duet?
00:16:25,00:16:29,- What did Woody Woodpecker?
00:16:29,00:16:34,"- Yeah, exactly. - Is that in any way--?"
00:16:34,00:16:35,"- That was quite good, actually."
00:16:35,00:16:36,Not bad.
00:16:36,00:16:40,So the voice of Woody Woodpecker was a woman called Grace Lance.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"She's also known by her stage name, Grace Stafford."
00:16:43,00:16:45,And what happened was they had another person
00:16:45,00:16:47,"who did the voice, I think it might be Mel Blanc,"
00:16:47,00:16:49,"but it was someone famous like-- - Yeah, he was the original,"
00:16:49,00:16:50,"I think, yeah. - Yeah, yeah."
00:16:50,00:16:52,And then he decided he didn't want to do it anymore.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"And she said, ""Well, I'll do it."
00:16:53,00:16:54,"""I do a really good impression."
00:16:54,00:16:57,"""Not as good as Dan Shriver, but it's quite good."""
00:16:57,00:17:00,"And her husband, who was producing it, said,"
00:17:00,00:17:01,"""Nah, I don't think so."
00:17:01,00:17:04,"""I think we're gonna tender for it."""
00:17:04,00:17:08,And so she then did an anonymous audition tape
00:17:08,00:17:10,"and sent it in with all the other audition tapes,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,and he still chose Woody Woodpecker.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"- Wow, cool. - Impression."
00:17:14,00:17:18,"And for the first something like 10 years or so,"
00:17:18,00:17:19,"eight years in fact, that she did it,"
00:17:19,00:17:23,she didn't have her name on the credits.
00:17:23,00:17:25,And that was because she thought people would be disillusioned
00:17:25,00:17:27,if they knew Woody was voiced by a woman.
00:17:27,00:17:28,- Right. - Wow.
00:17:28,00:17:29,- As opposed to a Woodpecker.
00:17:29,00:17:32,(laughing)
00:17:32,00:17:35,Because I would be devastated as a child.
00:17:35,00:17:36,"The trees are incredible, aren't they?"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"You've got to look up the granary trees of Acorn Woodpeckers,"
00:17:38,00:17:42,"which they mostly keep in the California, Oregon area,"
00:17:42,00:17:45,basically look like a tree that's surface
00:17:45,00:17:46,is covered in crumpets.
00:17:46,00:17:47,- They look incredible.
00:17:47,00:17:49,"They look like, you know, people who are scared"
00:17:49,00:17:50,of like little holes?
00:17:50,00:17:53,Is it called trypophobia or something like that?
00:17:53,00:17:54,They would hate these
00:17:54,00:17:56,because it's just loads of little holes
00:17:56,00:17:58,and each one is shoved an acorn into it.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"- And they test them, they'll shove an acorn in"
00:18:01,00:18:03,and then they'll practice trying to get it out.
00:18:03,00:18:04,And if it's too easy to extract the acorn
00:18:04,00:18:06,"from the little hole they've made,"
00:18:06,00:18:07,they abandon the hole.
00:18:07,00:18:09,That's gonna be too easy to steal.
00:18:09,00:18:11,- But it keeps changing because the holes
00:18:11,00:18:13,"always change size, 'cause trees change size."
00:18:13,00:18:15,Trees are always growing and shifting a bit
00:18:15,00:18:17,"and acorns dry out, so they will change size when they do."
00:18:17,00:18:19,So it's a nightmare.
00:18:19,00:18:22,So they spend all of their bloody time moving.
00:18:22,00:18:26,"It's not funny, there are up to 50,000 holes in a tree, guys."
00:18:26,00:18:28,"Guys, please take it seriously."
00:18:28,00:18:31,"50,000 acorns in a tree, it's just you"
00:18:31,00:18:34,and your brothers and your three weird wives.
00:18:34,00:18:37,"And you have to, it takes 20 minutes to make one hole."
00:18:37,00:18:39,"There are 50,000 holes in the tree"
00:18:39,00:18:41,and you're constantly moving the acorns
00:18:41,00:18:43,to a better fitting hole.
00:18:43,00:18:44,It's awful.
00:18:44,00:18:45,I would want to die in a fight.
00:18:45,00:18:52,"- Okay, look, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:18:52,00:18:56,"It is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:18:56,00:18:58,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the world's largest"
00:18:58,00:19:02,carpet museum is shaped like a giant roll of carpet.
00:19:02,00:19:05,(audience laughing)
00:19:05,00:19:08,"For people at home, we've just put a picture of it"
00:19:08,00:19:11,"on the screen, and I think that undeniably looks"
00:19:11,00:19:12,like a giant roll of carpet.
00:19:12,00:19:13,"- Yeah, it's awesome."
00:19:13,00:19:14,It's really amazing.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"- Yeah, so this is in Baku in Azerbaijan,"
00:19:18,00:19:19,and this is something that I noticed
00:19:19,00:19:22,"when I was reading about a carpet war,"
00:19:22,00:19:24,"between Azerbaijan and Armenia,"
00:19:24,00:19:26,on top of the actual war they're having.
00:19:26,00:19:28,- But the carpet war...
00:19:28,00:19:30,"- They're not the most lethal weapons, are they?"
00:19:30,00:19:32,"- But you can carpet bomb somewhere, I suppose."
00:19:32,00:19:34,"- Yeah, I think you got confused."
00:19:34,00:19:37,- So these are carpets that come from an area
00:19:37,00:19:39,"called Nagano Karabakh,"
00:19:39,00:19:42,which is a disputed territory between the two places.
00:19:42,00:19:45,Armenian weavers are claiming that the Azerbaijan
00:19:45,00:19:48,"government is appropriating their culture,"
00:19:48,00:19:51,"because basically most people, most historians,"
00:19:51,00:19:52,"not all of them, but most historians,"
00:19:52,00:19:55,"think that these are Armenian-based carpets,"
00:19:55,00:19:59,"but Azerbaijan has built a massive museum,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,"and most of it says no, they're ours."
00:20:01,00:20:03,- Oh. - Yeah.
00:20:03,00:20:06,- I didn't know that this was so political museum.
00:20:06,00:20:07,- It's quite political. - I just thought
00:20:07,00:20:08,"it was a farm museum, yeah."
00:20:08,00:20:10,- Apparently there's some Azerbaijan-y officials
00:20:10,00:20:13,who say there is no such thing as Armenian carpets.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"- No such thing, that's pretty ballsy,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,to say Armenia doesn't even make carpets.
00:20:18,00:20:21,"- I know, well they claim that the Armenians"
00:20:21,00:20:25,stole the Azeri tactics and stuff like that.
00:20:25,00:20:29,And the UNESCO has said that Azerbaijani carpets
00:20:29,00:20:32,"are a masterpiece of intangible heritage,"
00:20:32,00:20:35,but a lot of people pointed to the large donation
00:20:35,00:20:38,that the government made to UNESCO just before they made that.
00:20:38,00:20:40,"So this is very controversial,"
00:20:40,00:20:42,and I know from me saying that it sounds like
00:20:42,00:20:44,"I'm on the Armenian side, you know,"
00:20:44,00:20:46,you can make your own decision.
00:20:46,00:20:49,"- But don't decide wrong, James,"
00:20:49,00:20:52,"you've just absolutely torched our Azerbaijan tour next year,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,so thanks a lot for that.
00:20:54,00:20:55,Wow.
00:20:55,00:20:57,"- And this museum, yeah, it's quite new."
00:20:57,00:21:00,"If you look in Baku, I think a few of you will know this,"
00:21:00,00:21:01,"'cause they've had football tournaments and stuff there,"
00:21:01,00:21:04,but they built a whole load of new stuff
00:21:04,00:21:05,in Baku quite recently.
00:21:05,00:21:07,"But one thing about, I noticed when looking"
00:21:07,00:21:10,"in the interior of this, is that all the floors"
00:21:10,00:21:12,are paved with marble.
00:21:12,00:21:15,It doesn't seem to be a single carpet
00:21:15,00:21:17,"that's not behind the perspex, so."
00:21:17,00:21:18,- So funny.
00:21:18,00:21:19,- You don't want to ruin them.
00:21:19,00:21:20,That's a sign that you're treasuring your carpets.
00:21:20,00:21:21,"- Yeah, I guess."
00:21:21,00:21:22,"- 'Cause they're really, I mean,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,"there is much wall hangings as for floors,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"until pretty recently, aren't they?"
00:21:26,00:21:28,I've always thought we should bring back the wall carpet.
00:21:28,00:21:29,"- Yes, I like it, yeah."
00:21:29,00:21:31,"- It's gone out of fashion a long time ago,"
00:21:31,00:21:34,"like probably turned in the 20th century, maybe before."
00:21:34,00:21:35,- I've got a carpet on a wall.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"- So it went out of fashion maybe 200 years ago,"
00:21:37,00:21:38,actually.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"- Have you really, only?"
00:21:40,00:21:41,"- Yeah, why?"
00:21:41,00:21:44,"- It's actually sound proofing, yeah."
00:21:44,00:21:46,"- Oh, maybe that's what they were doing,"
00:21:46,00:21:47,recording all their podcasts back in the day.
00:21:47,00:21:48,- Maybe.
00:21:48,00:21:49,(laughing)
00:21:49,00:21:52,"- I like, I was reading, there's Turkish carpets,"
00:21:52,00:21:55,rather than having a new Turkish carpet
00:21:55,00:21:58,that feels like it's just really bold in its colors
00:21:58,00:22:01,"and really bright, getting a more antiquey feel to one"
00:22:01,00:22:04,is something that people chase more.
00:22:04,00:22:07,And the way to make that happen that they do in Turkey
00:22:07,00:22:09,is that they actually take the carpets out
00:22:09,00:22:13,for months at a time and just lay them out in fields.
00:22:13,00:22:16,"So if you go on Google Earth and you zoom in on Turkey,"
00:22:16,00:22:20,"there is whole fields, yeah, of thousands of carpets"
00:22:20,00:22:24,that are just laid out in the open because it's very dry.
00:22:24,00:22:27,And they just sit there and it's these carpet layers
00:22:27,00:22:31,"who understand fading so well that someone can say,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,I want it faded to like this kind of degree
00:22:33,00:22:34,"and they're like, leave it to me."
00:22:34,00:22:36,And they go and get the carpet when they know
00:22:36,00:22:39,"the time is right, when it's faded."
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Yeah, and it looks really antiquey and they dust it off"
00:22:41,00:22:42,and that's when you get your carpet.
00:22:42,00:22:44,"- Wow, that's really cool."
00:22:44,00:22:47,"- Is it fake? - No, I do believe you."
00:22:47,00:22:49,"It's just that when you say weird shit like that,"
00:22:49,00:22:51,it's off and on. - I know.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"- The way you looked at me, it was like, is that true, James?"
00:22:53,00:22:55,Is it true? - Prove me wrong.
00:22:55,00:22:59,"So did you hear that in 2012,"
00:22:59,00:23:01,scientists at the University of Manchester
00:23:01,00:23:03,"made a magic carpet, which is very exciting."
00:23:03,00:23:05,"Yeah, not a classic MagCarp."
00:23:05,00:23:09,They made one which basically it can tell you
00:23:09,00:23:11,"when you're gonna fall over, which is very useful."
00:23:11,00:23:13,"- Oh, yeah. - So it doesn't fly high, though."
00:23:13,00:23:15,"- It's not flying. - It doesn't fly, no, no, no."
00:23:15,00:23:17,"They're working on that, but this is very useful for the--"
00:23:17,00:23:18,- They're working on that? - They're not working on that.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"- No, obviously they're not fucking working on that."
00:23:20,00:23:22,"- It's the next obvious step, isn't it?"
00:23:22,00:23:23,"- Yeah. - No, but it's--"
00:23:23,00:23:24,- How does it do that?
00:23:24,00:23:25,Does it just have those horrible rolls in it
00:23:25,00:23:28,that trip you up and then a sign on the other side
00:23:28,00:23:29,"that goes, ha ha, told you'd fall over?"
00:23:29,00:23:30,- Quite the reverse.
00:23:30,00:23:31,"No, quite the reverse."
00:23:31,00:23:34,It's stuffed with clever fiber optic cable
00:23:34,00:23:34,and that kind of thing.
00:23:34,00:23:36,And basically it builds up a profile of your movement
00:23:36,00:23:38,as you're walking around.
00:23:38,00:23:40,So it's not like-- - Can you get amazing internet
00:23:40,00:23:42,if you're on that carpet?
00:23:42,00:23:43,- It basically monitors you
00:23:43,00:23:45,"and if your movement deteriorates even slightly,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,it's for people who are elderly.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- It can tell your gait, I guess, right?"
00:23:48,00:23:49,"- Yeah, it can tell your gait."
00:23:49,00:23:52,"So it can't tell you you're about to fall over now,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,but it can say you're about to fall over soon.
00:23:54,00:23:57,So look out for that.
00:23:57,00:23:59,- You can imagine an alarm that went off
00:23:59,00:24:00,"when you're about to fall over,"
00:24:00,00:24:02,it would actually make you more likely to fall over.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"- 100%. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:04,00:24:07,- Do you know that there's people at the Harvard University
00:24:07,00:24:09,that are working on a magic carpet?
00:24:09,00:24:12,"- Same question, a flying one."
00:24:12,00:24:15,"- This is an actual flying one and they have made it,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,but it's the size of a banknote
00:24:17,00:24:20,and it's only not 0.1 millimeters thick.
00:24:20,00:24:20,- Okay.
00:24:20,00:24:21,- But who's flying on it?
00:24:21,00:24:22,Is it about aunt?
00:24:22,00:24:24,"- Like a cool, yeah, that'd be so exciting."
00:24:24,00:24:25,"- That would be awesome, right?"
00:24:25,00:24:27,They think that they could possibly make it bigger
00:24:27,00:24:30,"in the future, but you'd need so much energy"
00:24:30,00:24:32,and you'd need to make it ripple.
00:24:32,00:24:35,"So what it is, it's like a really tiny bit of,"
00:24:35,00:24:38,"almost like paper, it ripples and ripples and ripples"
00:24:38,00:24:40,and then the force that these ripples cause
00:24:40,00:24:43,"can make it kind of just go up off the ground,"
00:24:43,00:24:45,but they can also make it go forward.
00:24:45,00:24:46,"So it's quite cool,"
00:24:46,00:24:49,but I suppose we're a few years away from it.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:50,00:24:51,- That's fair enough.
00:24:51,00:24:52,- It's a long way to go.
00:24:52,00:24:52,- That's very cool.
00:24:52,00:24:55,- Can we go back to the countries
00:24:55,00:24:56,that lead the world in carpet making?
00:24:56,00:24:58,'Cause I don't think we've covered them all there a lot.
00:24:58,00:24:59,- Okay.
00:24:59,00:25:01,"- So Turkmenistan is a big one,"
00:25:01,00:25:02,has the Guinness World Record
00:25:02,00:25:03,"for the biggest carpet in the world,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"which by the way, it's really beatable."
00:25:05,00:25:07,"If anyone wants to, it's 14 meters wide"
00:25:07,00:25:10,"and 21.5 meters long, which feels shit."
00:25:10,00:25:13,And it wasn't even made by that many people.
00:25:13,00:25:14,"Daily Sabah, which is a Turkish news site,"
00:25:14,00:25:17,"said it was made by a total of 40 people,"
00:25:17,00:25:18,including one man.
00:25:18,00:25:22,"- It is like, historically,"
00:25:22,00:25:25,"it's like a women's role to make these carpets, isn't it?"
00:25:25,00:25:26,"- Yeah, pretty much everywhere."
00:25:26,00:25:27,That seems to be the unifying thing
00:25:27,00:25:29,across all of these carpet countries.
00:25:29,00:25:30,It's always the women who do it.
00:25:30,00:25:32,- He smashed through the carpet floor.
00:25:32,00:25:35,(laughing)
00:25:35,00:25:37,"- It's great, well done, him."
00:25:37,00:25:40,- But Turkmenistan's national flag has carpet on it.
00:25:40,00:25:41,- Doesn't it?
00:25:41,00:25:42,"- Which I don't think any of the others do,"
00:25:42,00:25:43,so I think that's winning.
00:25:43,00:25:44,"But yeah, in 1992,"
00:25:44,00:25:47,"when I think they became independent from the Soviets,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,they started designing their national flag.
00:25:49,00:25:52,"And if you look at it, it's a really nice flag."
00:25:52,00:25:53,It's green with a red stripe
00:25:53,00:25:56,and it has five carpet motifs on it.
00:25:56,00:25:58,"They're called gulls,"
00:25:58,00:26:00,and they're just little carpet patterns.
00:26:00,00:26:04,"- Oh, the flag's not made of carpet material."
00:26:04,00:26:05,- Does it have tassels?
00:26:05,00:26:06,"'Cause if not, I'm not interested."
00:26:06,00:26:08,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:26:08,00:26:09,"It doesn't have tassels,"
00:26:09,00:26:10,"and if it was made of carpet,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,it would need a fucking strong wind to fly it.
00:26:12,00:26:13,(laughing)
00:26:13,00:26:14,"- Oh yeah, good point."
00:26:14,00:26:17,"- Can we talk about weather spoons, carpets, please, briefly?"
00:26:17,00:26:18,"- Okay, sure."
00:26:18,00:26:19,"- Okay, every weather spoon,"
00:26:19,00:26:23,so about 900 in the UK has its own special carpet.
00:26:23,00:26:26,And this wasn't known about until about 2015?
00:26:26,00:26:27,Known about in public.
00:26:27,00:26:28,- Must have been known about.
00:26:28,00:26:30,"- Tim Marson, the boss, he probably knew."
00:26:30,00:26:32,He probably was laughing up his sleeve at all of us.
00:26:32,00:26:33,- Everyone's always so pissed when they leave.
00:26:33,00:26:35,They never remember the carpets.
00:26:35,00:26:35,That's the trick.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"- There was a guy called Kit Kales,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,who started a blog about the floor coverings
00:26:39,00:26:41,of every single weather spoon in the country.
00:26:41,00:26:44,And he assumed they'd be identical when he started.
00:26:44,00:26:45,So I'm not sure why he was blogging about it.
00:26:45,00:26:47,"But, all right, he found out,"
00:26:47,00:26:48,and then he started the blog.
00:26:48,00:26:49,It doesn't matter.
00:26:49,00:26:50,"Each one has their own,"
00:26:50,00:26:52,and they're often themed to the local area.
00:26:52,00:26:53,It's really exciting.
00:26:53,00:26:55,"So there's a Britannia pub in Plymouth,"
00:26:55,00:26:58,"which is slightly cruise-chip based, you know."
00:26:58,00:27:01,"He wrote, Kit Kales, he wrote an entire book"
00:27:01,00:27:03,"about weather spoons, pub carpets,"
00:27:03,00:27:05,"and the sun covered it with the headline,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,"""The Rug Pratt""."
00:27:07,00:27:10,Is this Britain's saddest hobby?
00:27:10,00:27:12,- Is that a pun on the Rugrats?
00:27:12,00:27:13,"- It's a pun on the Rugrat, yeah, yeah."
00:27:13,00:27:14,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:27:14,00:27:15,- I know.
00:27:15,00:27:16,"- Well, he was the person,"
00:27:16,00:27:18,the original people that made those carpets
00:27:18,00:27:19,were the people that had--
00:27:19,00:27:20,- Axe Minster.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"- Yes, yeah."
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- Yeah, I've gone a bit deep on this one, yeah."
00:27:22,00:27:24,"- Yeah, yeah, so they're the ones"
00:27:24,00:27:26,who have the royal decree.
00:27:26,00:27:27,- Warrant.
00:27:27,00:27:29,- Warrant in order to make carpets for the royal family.
00:27:29,00:27:31,"So, yeah, weather spoons and them,"
00:27:31,00:27:34,and then they stopped making it because people started coughing.
00:27:34,00:27:35,"- But Buckingham Palace, if you've ever been inside,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,it's all weather spoons.
00:27:37,00:27:39,"- Yeah, that's what's taking up all the space."
00:27:39,00:27:41,"The ground floor is just a really big weather spoon, yeah."
00:27:41,00:27:42,"- I'll tell you what,"
00:27:42,00:27:45,the Buckingham Palace all day breakfast is off.
00:27:45,00:27:49,"- You know, one very famous red carpet"
00:27:49,00:27:52,that we all are aware of is the Hollywood red carpet
00:27:52,00:27:55,that we see at the Oscars every single year.
00:27:55,00:27:57,And I didn't realize that there's so much mystery
00:27:57,00:27:59,around the red carpet at Hollywood.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"So, when they make it,"
00:28:01,00:28:04,"they make it in a mill in Dalton, in America,"
00:28:04,00:28:08,and they don't tell you which mill it's being made in.
00:28:08,00:28:09,That's all we know.
00:28:09,00:28:10,We don't know.
00:28:10,00:28:13,"It's got its own special color, Academy Red."
00:28:13,00:28:15,They bring it there in a truck.
00:28:15,00:28:16,It's very mysterious.
00:28:16,00:28:17,They lay it down.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"They have people in tuxedos with little portable vacuums,"
00:28:20,00:28:21,"just a vacuum at every spot,"
00:28:21,00:28:24,and make sure that the carpet's doing fine.
00:28:24,00:28:25,"And then when the ceremony's done,"
00:28:25,00:28:27,they pick it up and they burn it.
00:28:27,00:28:29,And it's only ever used once.
00:28:29,00:28:30,"It's just a big mystery,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,and they make a whole new carpet the next time.
00:28:32,00:28:33,- Why do they burn it?
00:28:33,00:28:35,- Because they don't want the material.
00:28:35,00:28:38,"So, a few people have stolen bits of material from it,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,"and they've gone on eBay,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,and they're really worried that it's kind of like
00:28:41,00:28:42,the Coca-Cola recipe.
00:28:42,00:28:44,They're gonna discover the recipe for the
00:28:44,00:28:46,Hollywood red carpet. - It's a red carpet.
00:28:46,00:28:47,- No. - What do you want?
00:28:47,00:28:48,- It's a magic carpet.
00:28:48,00:28:50,- It's kind of slightly off-red.
00:28:50,00:28:51,"It's more like purple. - Yeah, it's burgundy."
00:28:51,00:28:52,"- Yeah, it's burgundy."
00:28:52,00:28:54,"- If you let people film the ceremony,"
00:28:54,00:28:56,you can see what color it is.
00:28:56,00:28:57,"- You can see the color,"
00:28:57,00:28:58,but you can't see what it's made of.
00:28:58,00:28:59,- It's made of carpet. - I think--
00:28:59,00:29:01,- It doesn't matter. - Oh.
00:29:01,00:29:03,"- I think, although I like the conspiracy theory reasoning,"
00:29:03,00:29:05,"I think it's more likely that you can't reuse it,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,"'cause the next Hollywood year,"
00:29:07,00:29:08,it's gonna look like crap.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"And it's 152 meters long,"
00:29:10,00:29:12,so there's very little other use you can put it to.
00:29:12,00:29:13,There's hardly anyone who's got used
00:29:13,00:29:15,for 152 meters long carpet.
00:29:15,00:29:16,- I think it might be.
00:29:16,00:29:18,"Maybe it's just made of something really awesome,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,like Bill Murray's back hair or something.
00:29:20,00:29:23,"- Yeah, exactly, yes."
00:29:23,00:29:24,"- You know, people used to cover their carpets"
00:29:24,00:29:26,with other carpets to protect them?
00:29:26,00:29:27,"Called ""druggets."""
00:29:27,00:29:29,"- Oh, yeah, I've got one on my wall."
00:29:29,00:29:29,Yeah.
00:29:29,00:29:32,- Your wall is seven carpets thick.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"Yeah, until the 19th century,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,druggets which are just cheaper carpets
00:29:37,00:29:39,that you put on top of your carpet for everyday use.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"And then if a guest came, you whipped the carpet off,"
00:29:41,00:29:44,and then you had the proper one underneath.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"- That's the sad thing, Andy has a drugget dealer,"
00:29:45,00:29:46,don't you?
00:29:46,00:29:47,- Hey!
00:29:50,00:29:53,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:29:53,00:29:55,and that is Andy.
00:29:55,00:29:57,- My fact is that the world's first ever
00:29:57,00:30:01,"hot-air balloon wedding was meant to happen in 1865,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,but the officiating priest refused to go up.
00:30:03,00:30:05,So the couple had the first ever
00:30:05,00:30:07,hot-air balloon honeymoon instead.
00:30:07,00:30:09,- Very nice.
00:30:09,00:30:12,- It's just a nice story about a couple
00:30:12,00:30:14,called Mary West Jenkins and John F. Boynton.
00:30:14,00:30:16,They wanted to marry in a balloon.
00:30:16,00:30:17,They thought it'd be fun.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"And the reverend said, ""No."""
00:30:19,00:30:23,"He said it was too unholy, not appropriate enough."
00:30:23,00:30:26,So they just went up after the wedding instead.
00:30:26,00:30:29,But it was a very exciting ceremony this wedding.
00:30:29,00:30:31,"There were 6,000 people there."
00:30:31,00:30:33,- They were mostly there for the balloon.
00:30:33,00:30:34,"- They were there for the balloon, yeah."
00:30:34,00:30:35,They were in Central Park.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"So they did get married in the end,"
00:30:36,00:30:37,but they got married on the ground.
00:30:37,00:30:39,- And how much do you suspect that the reverend
00:30:39,00:30:42,was just too much of a pussy to go up in the balloon?
00:30:42,00:30:43,"- It's possible, isn't it?"
00:30:43,00:30:46,- There was the Baltimore Daily Commercial
00:30:46,00:30:48,"of the 10th of November, 1865."
00:30:48,00:30:49,This was a couple of days later.
00:30:49,00:30:51,They said that the official story
00:30:51,00:30:55,was that the priest had to get the last train to Philadelphia.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"Okay, but then they did say the actual reason, probably,"
00:30:57,00:30:59,"was that the reverend gentleman,"
00:30:59,00:31:02,"accustomed to operate soloing in mundane matrimony,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,had backed out at the 11th hour.
00:31:04,00:31:05,- Right.
00:31:05,00:31:07,"I wonder how much a history,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,"like speaking of the shortest baseball match before,"
00:31:09,00:31:12,has been influenced by people needing to get trains.
00:31:12,00:31:13,(audience laughing)
00:31:13,00:31:14,Quite a lot.
00:31:14,00:31:15,- What time is it now?
00:31:15,00:31:16,(laughing)
00:31:16,00:31:18,"- And the reverend, by the way,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,was a guy called Thomas DeWitt Talmadge.
00:31:20,00:31:21,And one reason why I'm not sure
00:31:21,00:31:23,whether he was scared of going up
00:31:23,00:31:26,is he was a massive publicity stunt guy.
00:31:26,00:31:28,And they said that he was the most famous clergyman
00:31:28,00:31:31,"in the world, including, hopefully, over 30."
00:31:31,00:31:32,"He was really, really famous."
00:31:32,00:31:33,- That's famous.
00:31:33,00:31:35,- He thought that no one should be able to read novels.
00:31:35,00:31:37,- Sorry.
00:31:37,00:31:38,- When was this?
00:31:38,00:31:41,- This was in the 1860s.
00:31:41,00:31:43,"- People frowned on novels back then, didn't they?"
00:31:43,00:31:44,You were supposed to be reading Greek.
00:31:44,00:31:46,- He said that anyone who read novels
00:31:46,00:31:48,"shouldn't be allowed to work in an office, a store,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,"a home, a shop, or a factory."
00:31:50,00:31:51,And he also thought that--
00:31:51,00:31:53,- Where are you gonna work?
00:31:53,00:31:54,In a field?
00:31:54,00:31:55,- In a field.
00:31:55,00:31:56,"- Yeah, did you get one of Dan's magic jobs"
00:31:56,00:31:58,drying carpets out for a living?
00:31:58,00:32:00,"- It's not, it's not, it's real."
00:32:00,00:32:01,"- Yes, yes."
00:32:01,00:32:04,"- But this guy, there are two people who got married."
00:32:04,00:32:06,"It was, like you say, Mary West Jenkins"
00:32:06,00:32:08,and Dr. John F. Boynton.
00:32:08,00:32:10,And his doctorate was in geology.
00:32:10,00:32:13,And he decided that as well as doing his wedding
00:32:13,00:32:14,"up in the Hot Air Balloon,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,he also was gonna make several electrical experiments
00:32:17,00:32:18,while he was up there.
00:32:18,00:32:19,- Cool.
00:32:19,00:32:21,- So he was like mixing business with pleasure.
00:32:21,00:32:23,"- Yeah, she must have been slightly annoyed"
00:32:23,00:32:26,as he set up the cathode.
00:32:26,00:32:28,The balloon was an interesting one.
00:32:28,00:32:29,"Well, the owner of the balloon was an interesting man."
00:32:29,00:32:31,He was called Thaddeus Lowe.
00:32:31,00:32:33,"And he had been a spy in the Civil War,"
00:32:33,00:32:34,but a balloon spy.
00:32:34,00:32:35,- Right.
00:32:35,00:32:36,- Yeah.
00:32:36,00:32:37,- It's so hard to spy on a balloon.
00:32:37,00:32:38,You'd think it was quite conspicuous.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"- It's very hard, yeah."
00:32:39,00:32:40,"But yeah, you're right."
00:32:40,00:32:43,"He had proposed balloons for use in the Civil War,"
00:32:43,00:32:45,which they actually were in the American Civil War.
00:32:45,00:32:46,And he--
00:32:46,00:32:49,"- So what would he do as a spy, though, with the--"
00:32:49,00:32:51,"- You would, you know, look around."
00:32:51,00:32:52,"- Oh, he'd be up there."
00:32:52,00:32:52,- He'd be up there.
00:32:52,00:32:53,"- So he'd come back and be like,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"""They've got carpets everywhere."""
00:32:55,00:32:56,(laughing)
00:32:56,00:32:58,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:58,00:33:00,"He demonstrated it for George Washington,"
00:33:00,00:33:03,who had died about 40 years earlier.
00:33:03,00:33:04,"Sorry, for the White House."
00:33:04,00:33:07,He'd gone up in Washington with a telegraph key
00:33:07,00:33:08,which linked him to the White House.
00:33:08,00:33:11,So he was able to radio down to the White House.
00:33:11,00:33:13,"- You mentioned George Washington, by mistake."
00:33:13,00:33:14,- For no reason.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- For no reason.
00:33:15,00:33:17,"- Oh, thank you for picking me up on that."
00:33:17,00:33:19,"- The first actual marriage that did happen,"
00:33:19,00:33:22,"eventually, in a balloon was in 1874."
00:33:22,00:33:25,It was Mary Elizabeth Walsh and Charles M. Colton.
00:33:25,00:33:30,And it was on top of the P.T. Barnum Manhattan hypnodrome
00:33:30,00:33:31,that they had.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"There was always a balloon on the top of there,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,and it used to go up all the time.
00:33:34,00:33:36,And so they got married on there.
00:33:36,00:33:37,"And one of the people who was on there,"
00:33:37,00:33:40,"who was basically Barnum's balloon guy,"
00:33:40,00:33:42,was called Washington Harrison Donaldson.
00:33:42,00:33:46,"And he was named Washington after George Washington,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,hence the connection.
00:33:48,00:33:50,And he was a daredevil and he was amazing.
00:33:50,00:33:52,So he used to do high wire acts and so on.
00:33:52,00:33:54,"And then when balloons became a thing,"
00:33:54,00:33:57,"he did a thing whereby he would go up in a balloon,"
00:33:57,00:34:00,"but he got rid of the basket and he would have a bar,"
00:34:00,00:34:04,just a bar where he would put his legs over and go up.
00:34:04,00:34:07,And he would start doing basically trapeze style acts
00:34:07,00:34:09,where he was flipping around and so on.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"And when he got very high,"
00:34:11,00:34:13,he would let the gas go down of the fire
00:34:13,00:34:15,and he would come back down.
00:34:15,00:34:16,"And as he was coming back down,"
00:34:16,00:34:20,"he would drop a human dummy from it,"
00:34:20,00:34:23,which everyone would see suddenly a plummeting human
00:34:23,00:34:25,and it would land on the ground
00:34:25,00:34:30,and inside were business cards and flyers for his act.
00:34:30,00:34:32,- That's amazing. - And so yeah.
00:34:32,00:34:34,And so he used to go around doing this act
00:34:34,00:34:36,and eventually P.T. Barnum saw him and employed him.
00:34:36,00:34:39,And what he used to do in the middle of Manhattan
00:34:39,00:34:41,would go up in this balloon before shows
00:34:41,00:34:42,"and when he was up there,"
00:34:42,00:34:45,he would just throw Barnum business cards and so on.
00:34:45,00:34:48,So New York constantly littered with advertising.
00:34:48,00:34:50,- I think the balloon was called P.T. Barnum as well.
00:34:50,00:34:51,"- Yeah, it was, yeah."
00:34:51,00:34:53,"- Well, I thought these guys are pretty brave actually"
00:34:53,00:34:57,because the wedding was postponed by one day
00:34:57,00:35:00,because the balloon burst the day before.
00:35:00,00:35:02,- It's a good way to get your wedding paid for.
00:35:02,00:35:05,"It was the idea of the couple, the first wedding."
00:35:05,00:35:07,And it was basically a way to get P.T. Barnum
00:35:07,00:35:09,to fund their whole wedding and pay their dowry
00:35:09,00:35:11,'cause it was such good publicity.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"And also, 'cause these became really popular,"
00:35:13,00:35:16,"if you look through new searches of the late 19th century,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,balloon weddings were the thing.
00:35:18,00:35:21,And it was such a good way to get guests to your wedding
00:35:21,00:35:22,if you didn't have mates.
00:35:22,00:35:24,'Cause thousands of people would come
00:35:24,00:35:26,"and sure they're there for the balloon,"
00:35:26,00:35:30,"but the photos just say, ""I'm a seriously popular dude."""
00:35:30,00:35:33,"And there was one, actually I read about one in 1884."
00:35:33,00:35:36,This was in Pennsylvania where the couple failed to arrive.
00:35:36,00:35:39,They freaked out and realized they were too scared to do it.
00:35:39,00:35:41,And all the promoters were gonna have to refund the crowd
00:35:41,00:35:45,'cause you'd be a paying customer as well as a guest.
00:35:45,00:35:47,And they decided they weren't gonna do this.
00:35:47,00:35:50,"So instead, the balloon's owner and his assistant"
00:35:50,00:35:52,like staged a marriage.
00:35:52,00:35:53,They posed as the couple.
00:35:53,00:35:56,"They got married to each other in this balloon,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,"went up in the air, under assumed names,"
00:35:58,00:35:59,but they only found out four years later.
00:35:59,00:36:01,It was actually legally binding.
00:36:01,00:36:04,"- Did they stay, did they fall in love?"
00:36:04,00:36:06,- I really don't wanna tell you the answer to that
00:36:06,00:36:08,because I think it'll ruin your night.
00:36:08,00:36:10,"- Okay, don't tell me, don't say anything."
00:36:10,00:36:12,"- Okay, we'll leave it there."
00:36:12,00:36:14,- There was one in 1888.
00:36:14,00:36:15,This was a wedding between Margaret Buckley
00:36:15,00:36:17,and Edward T. Davis.
00:36:17,00:36:19,"40,000 people came to that wedding"
00:36:19,00:36:22,to see them go up on the hot air balloon.
00:36:22,00:36:25,"Unfortunately, the balloon then landed in a swamp,"
00:36:25,00:36:29,but it kept kind of moving along the swamp.
00:36:29,00:36:31,"So they were dragged for two miles,"
00:36:32,00:36:35,"clinging to the ropes of the balloon,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,and they finished the rest of the trip by train.
00:36:37,00:36:40,- So good.
00:36:40,00:36:44,I have a favorite hot air balloon love story.
00:36:44,00:36:45,This is an account from someone online.
00:36:45,00:36:47,My husband proposed to me
00:36:47,00:36:48,on a private hot air balloon ride.
00:36:48,00:36:49,That's not the story.
00:36:49,00:36:52,The pilot told us that one time he had five couples
00:36:52,00:36:53,"on a larger ride,"
00:36:53,00:36:55,and one of the guys decided to propose to his girlfriend
00:36:55,00:36:58,by having a big sign on the ground
00:36:58,00:37:00,"where they're landing saying, ""Will you marry me?"""
00:37:00,00:37:03,- But he didn't put a name on the sign.
00:37:03,00:37:06,"All five couples were dating,"
00:37:06,00:37:09,"and all five of the women thought,"
00:37:09,00:37:11,"""This is the best proposal I've ever received in my life."""
00:37:11,00:37:13,And four of them were disappointed.
00:37:13,00:37:17,"- Would you, I mean, I think you'd roll with it, wouldn't you?"
00:37:17,00:37:21,"- If it's a third date, it's too, you know."
00:37:21,00:37:22,- You can't roll with it.
00:37:22,00:37:23,It's got to be someone's.
00:37:23,00:37:24,"You can't say, ""Oh yeah, that's mine,"""
00:37:24,00:37:25,and have the other bloke next.
00:37:25,00:37:27,"You go, ""No, it's not. It's mine."""
00:37:28,00:37:29,"- Anyway, I love it. - There is actually,"
00:37:29,00:37:33,"there was a service that offers, it's called D&D Ballooning."
00:37:33,00:37:34,"I think sadly the company's shut down now,"
00:37:34,00:37:37,but it existed last year. - Down to the Dragon's Ballooning?
00:37:37,00:37:40,"- You look too excited about that, but no."
00:37:40,00:37:42,I think D&D is just the people who run the company.
00:37:42,00:37:45,"It's in California, and it offers mile-high balloon trips,"
00:37:45,00:37:48,and basically what it promises is comfort and discretion
00:37:48,00:37:49,for a couple.
00:37:49,00:37:52,"It says, ""You've got in your basket the privacy"
00:37:52,00:37:55,of an enclosed dome tent with your own private view
00:37:55,00:37:59,as our discreet pilot ascends to one mile.
00:37:59,00:38:01,We provide a CD player.
00:38:01,00:38:04,"You provide the music blankets, pillows, and imagination,"
00:38:04,00:38:06,"and it lasts an hour."""
00:38:06,00:38:08,- An hour. - An hour.
00:38:08,00:38:09,- Five minutes in. - Yeah.
00:38:09,00:38:12,"- Seconds like that. - Oh, come on, Bringson."
00:38:12,00:38:14,"- Sorry, we haven't actually taken off yet."
00:38:14,00:38:17,(audience laughing)
00:38:17,00:38:20,- Oh my God.
00:38:20,00:38:21,- We're gonna have to wrap up very shortly.
00:38:21,00:38:23,- Can I tell you about One Balloon Hero?
00:38:23,00:38:24,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:38:24,00:38:25,"- Willie Coppins, heard of him?"
00:38:25,00:38:27,"- Willie Owenty, go on."
00:38:27,00:38:29,"- He will, he will, and he did."
00:38:29,00:38:31,"He was a fighter pilot in the First World War,"
00:38:31,00:38:34,"Belgian man, very brilliant at shooting down"
00:38:34,00:38:36,"observation balloons, right?"
00:38:36,00:38:38,Which were major features of the First World War.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"- Three simply large target, long shot."
00:38:40,00:38:42,"- Look, they were very well defended, all right."
00:38:42,00:38:44,"He was so good at it, they were called balloon busters,"
00:38:44,00:38:45,the pilots who did it.
00:38:45,00:38:47,"He shot down nearly 40 balloons during the war,"
00:38:47,00:38:50,"which is really big potatoes, okay?"
00:38:50,00:38:53,"The German army was so angry about Willie Coppins,"
00:38:53,00:38:55,they specifically tried to kill him
00:38:55,00:38:56,with a booby-trapped balloon.
00:38:56,00:38:58,They put up a balloon with explosives.
00:38:58,00:39:00,"But get this, once, he was being shot at"
00:39:00,00:39:03,"from a German balloon in his plane,"
00:39:03,00:39:06,and he cool-ly just flew up and around
00:39:06,00:39:09,"and parked on top of the balloon,"
00:39:09,00:39:10,"went till it landed,"
00:39:10,00:39:14,and then just gently slid his plane off and flew away.
00:39:14,00:39:15,"- Listen, if you're gonna give me shit"
00:39:15,00:39:17,about carpets being laid out in Turkey.
00:39:17,00:39:21,(audience laughing)
00:39:21,00:39:22,"No way, buster."
00:39:23,00:39:24,"- I'm a bit skeptical, I have to say."
00:39:24,00:39:26,"Never thought I'd say this, but I'm with Dan here."
00:39:26,00:39:27,That's an abrupt break.
00:39:27,00:39:30,That's an emergency break for a plane to land on a balloon.
00:39:30,00:39:31,"- No, it's a very soft landing, surely?"
00:39:31,00:39:33,"- No, it's the softest landing you could possibly have."
00:39:33,00:39:34,"- If you think about it,"
00:39:34,00:39:37,"you'd need a vertical takeoff and landing plane, right?"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"Like most planes kind of come into a runway, so it's--"
00:39:39,00:39:41,"- It might have been a very long balloon that he was like,"
00:39:41,00:39:43,they had those long balloons that he was landing on.
00:39:43,00:39:44,That's the wrong way.
00:39:44,00:39:45,- A Zeppelin.
00:39:45,00:39:46,- A Zeppelin.
00:39:46,00:39:47,- It was a Zeppelin.
00:39:47,00:39:50,"- Yeah, any further questions?"
00:39:50,00:39:50,"Please, no."
00:39:50,00:39:53,(laughing)
00:39:53,00:39:55,"- Look, I hate to cut this off,"
00:39:55,00:39:56,but we got a train to catch.
00:39:56,00:39:58,(audience laughing)
00:39:58,00:40:00,"So that's it, that is all of our facts."
