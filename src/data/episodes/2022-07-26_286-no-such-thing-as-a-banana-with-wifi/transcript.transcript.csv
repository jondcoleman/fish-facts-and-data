00:00:00,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:21,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:26,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski and"
00:00:26,00:00:30,James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:30,00:00:35,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:35,00:00:37,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:37,00:00:43,My fact is that the first ever ball pit was inspired by a jar of pickled onions.
00:00:43,00:00:48,It was a guy who had a massive jar of pickled onions and his son fell into it one day and
00:00:48,00:00:52,"while they were fishing him out they noticed, ""Oh he's having a great time"" so that's"
00:00:52,00:00:53,not that.
00:00:53,00:00:58,"A guy called Eric McMillan who invented it, it was called a ball crawl back in the good"
00:00:58,00:01:04,"old days and he was the subject of a Guardian Longread recently, you know they did these"
00:01:04,00:01:08,great long essays and it's all about playgrounds and how playgrounds were developed and you
00:01:08,00:01:12,know the original playgrounds and who first thought of doing all this weird stuff for
00:01:12,00:01:17,children to play in because you know had to be invented and he was this kind of visionary
00:01:17,00:01:22,who invented all these different methods of playing and one of the things he was working
00:01:22,00:01:28,"on was a place called SeaWorlds, Captain Kids in San Diego in 1976 and he and his colleague"
00:01:28,00:01:32,were looking at a jar of pickled onions and they thought I think that could work.
00:01:32,00:01:37,So he's seen as the father of soft play because this wasn't the only thing that he created.
00:01:37,00:01:43,"Soft play, I go to a lot these days with my son and they're amazing gymnasiums of balls"
00:01:43,00:01:55,and we are lots of those gymnasiums.
00:01:55,00:01:59,So you know if you go into if you see kids playing in a sort of big soft play but there's
00:01:59,00:02:04,the hanging boxing bags and they're things that you punch like a punch bag.
00:02:04,00:02:05,Exactly.
00:02:05,00:02:07,You're taking your son to a gym.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Sounds like it.
00:02:08,00:02:14,"You're a boxing ring, he looks like a mutant now it's so buff, it's so weird."
00:02:14,00:02:19,"Mike for his birthday, didn't you but he can't get anywhere on it."
00:02:19,00:02:22,"Yeah, so you spend a lot of time in soft play."
00:02:22,00:02:26,"So soft players have punching bags for children, no they're hanging and you've got to go"
00:02:26,00:02:27,through them.
00:02:27,00:02:28,You navigate through them.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Like a forest of punching bags.
00:02:29,00:02:30,"Exactly, a forest of punching bags."
00:02:30,00:02:31,Yeah.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"They recreate the natural world, don't you?"
00:02:33,00:02:37,On the ends on the floor and punching bags in the air.
00:02:37,00:02:41,"Apparently the balls were originally used for trapping pollutants inside smokestacks,"
00:02:41,00:02:46,which I can't quite picture but I guess if you had a layer of balls in a chimney so they
00:02:46,00:02:50,"would, you know, the smoke would kind of filter through and cling to the balls on its"
00:02:50,00:02:52,way upwards and so it would take some of the pollutants out.
00:02:52,00:02:57,"What, the balls that they use in kids' ball pits now, originally?"
00:02:57,00:03:01,"They originally sourced, yeah, those are the people making those plastic balls at the"
00:03:01,00:03:02,time.
00:03:02,00:03:03,I don't think they invented the plastic ball.
00:03:03,00:03:04,That's amazing.
00:03:04,00:03:05,That's interesting.
00:03:05,00:03:10,"This guy, he came up with the idea of having soft play because he grew up without the soft"
00:03:10,00:03:11,play.
00:03:11,00:03:12,Right.
00:03:12,00:03:17,He grew up in North Manchester in the shadow of Strange Way's prison and used to play in
00:03:17,00:03:22,bombed out buildings and over like burnt out cars and stuff like that.
00:03:22,00:03:23,Right.
00:03:23,00:03:27,Although bombed out buildings were the inspiration for the best playgrounds in the world.
00:03:27,00:03:32,"So the adventure playground, the origin was the bombed out buildings of World War II"
00:03:32,00:03:36,in London and kids used to play on them a lot and people they were hanging about all over
00:03:36,00:03:40,"the place and people were always your turn, these into something a bit less depressing."
00:03:40,00:03:42,And so then they turned them into adventure playgrounds.
00:03:42,00:03:47,"And then the adventure playgrounds today are more like places where they're like scrap yards,"
00:03:47,00:03:48,right?
00:03:48,00:03:49,Is that right?
00:03:49,00:03:50,"Well, you can kind of build things."
00:03:50,00:03:53,There's running machines there.
00:03:53,00:03:57,"So there's a difference between like the soft play version and a more hard play version,"
00:03:57,00:04:01,especially in America and you get these adventure playgrounds that have got like loose
00:04:01,00:04:04,"tires, blocks of wood, ropes, hammers, nails."
00:04:04,00:04:05,Right.
00:04:05,00:04:09,"I read one place that they can even set fire to things, the kids."
00:04:09,00:04:10,Wow.
00:04:10,00:04:11,I've never seen one of these.
00:04:11,00:04:12,I've never seen them either.
00:04:12,00:04:14,But apparently they're more safe than the soft play things.
00:04:14,00:04:15,Yeah.
00:04:15,00:04:19,And the reason being that as soon as you enter a soft play thing you go straight for the
00:04:19,00:04:24,highest tallest thing and climb up it because like obviously you think everything's safe.
00:04:24,00:04:29,"But in these more dodgy ones with lots of like rusty nails and stuff like that, the children"
00:04:29,00:04:33,kind of build their own play area and they start small and they kind of build up to it.
00:04:33,00:04:36,Or they're just quivering in fear in the corner.
00:04:36,00:04:40,"Yeah, I think that's a bit of an innovative thing they're doing in America specifically."
00:04:40,00:04:41,"It's in New York, isn't it?"
00:04:41,00:04:45,It's called the yard and it's the idea that they want to encourage kids to play with what's
00:04:45,00:04:46,around them.
00:04:46,00:04:49,Can we just briefly go back to ball pits?
00:04:49,00:04:50,"Yes, please."
00:04:50,00:04:51,I mostly research ball pits.
00:04:51,00:04:52,Yeah.
00:04:52,00:04:58,So there have been studies done about the hygiene in ball pits because some people are
00:04:58,00:04:59,worried.
00:04:59,00:05:02,And there was a spate of stories quite recently.
00:05:02,00:05:06,One guy who worked for a phone called STEM Protect which is a STEM cell bank.
00:05:06,00:05:10,So I don't know why he's sticking his aura into this field of human endeavor.
00:05:10,00:05:11,Anyway.
00:05:11,00:05:12,"Everyone's going to have a hobby, mate."
00:05:12,00:05:13,Yeah.
00:05:13,00:05:19,So he was saying that 99.9% of ball pits contain levels of vomit and feces was how it was reported
00:05:19,00:05:22,"because obviously, yeah, it's absolutely believable."
00:05:22,00:05:23,Yeah.
00:05:23,00:05:26,"But I mean, the way he put it sounded really distressing."
00:05:26,00:05:30,"He said, he's a parent and he said, I've watched some of these places with my professional"
00:05:30,00:05:31,hat on.
00:05:31,00:05:33,And what I've learned has truly disturbed me.
00:05:33,00:05:37,"You take your kids to these ball pit play warehouses to have fun, but I've seen kids emerge"
00:05:37,00:05:39,with their legs covered in poo.
00:05:39,00:05:44,"And the worst thing was, it wasn't even their own poo."
00:05:44,00:05:45,How could he tell?
00:05:45,00:05:50,He had his professional hat on this.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Everyone knows.
00:05:51,00:05:54,"As soon as you put your professional hat on, it's poo spotting out."
00:05:54,00:05:56,Swobbing the feces.
00:05:56,00:06:00,"There haven't actually been many studies done of this, but there has been a study in Georgia"
00:06:00,00:06:07,where they swabbed balls from six different ball pits and they found out what was in there.
00:06:07,00:06:10,"And obviously, they found loads of bacteria because as they're a bacteria everywhere, you"
00:06:10,00:06:11,"know, that's the whole point."
00:06:11,00:06:15,So there are various ones like meningitis and pneumonia and septicemia and various skin
00:06:15,00:06:16,infections.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:18,So some of the bad ones were there.
00:06:18,00:06:19,"Oh, so I'm not a bad one."
00:06:19,00:06:20,Sure.
00:06:20,00:06:21,"Some of the ones that you might find in feces, for instance."
00:06:21,00:06:22,Yeah.
00:06:22,00:06:26,"So fecal bacteria, we've said, they're not necessarily bad."
00:06:26,00:06:30,"No, it probably lots of good guy bacteria in there as well."
00:06:30,00:06:33,But even fecal bacteria are not automatically going to kill you.
00:06:33,00:06:38,"If you can't afford some yakult, just lick a ball."
00:06:38,00:06:45,"There was one of the dirtiest ball pits that these guys found had an average of 170,818"
00:06:45,00:06:47,different bacteria on each ball.
00:06:47,00:06:48,What?
00:06:48,00:06:49,No idea if that's a lot.
00:06:49,00:06:50,"I know, because it sounds like a lot."
00:06:50,00:06:51,"It does sound like a lot, isn't it?"
00:06:51,00:06:56,"But then if you would have to lick the whole ball to get it in like, I don't know about you,"
00:06:56,00:07:00,but I never licked any of the balls when I was in my ball pit years.
00:07:00,00:07:01,Yeah.
00:07:01,00:07:02,But you never lived.
00:07:02,00:07:03,Would you make your ball pit?
00:07:03,00:07:04,Yeah.
00:07:04,00:07:05,"They still have, they have adult ball pits."
00:07:05,00:07:06,That's true.
00:07:06,00:07:07,But I've never gone to one.
00:07:07,00:07:09,"There's one in London, the ball pit bar in London."
00:07:09,00:07:10,Is it?
00:07:10,00:07:14,It started off as a one month-only pop-up in Dullston in 2016 when it was so popular that
00:07:14,00:07:16,they opened it full-time.
00:07:16,00:07:18,It's called Bolly Bollison.
00:07:18,00:07:23,And every single ball in this place is cleaned by a mechanical ball cleaner that can clean
00:07:23,00:07:25,"18,000 balls per hour."
00:07:25,00:07:26,Wow.
00:07:26,00:07:28,And that machine is called the Gobble Muffin.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Nice.
00:07:29,00:07:30,Okay.
00:07:30,00:07:32,So they've made it up.
00:07:32,00:07:36,They've made the branding very mature and adult.
00:07:36,00:07:37,It isn't.
00:07:37,00:07:38,Have you seen how the machines work?
00:07:38,00:07:39,No.
00:07:39,00:07:42,So I watched a video of a professional ball cleaning machine.
00:07:42,00:07:43,And was it the Gobble Muffin or?
00:07:43,00:07:44,It wasn't.
00:07:44,00:07:48,"This was a slower one, and I believe, but it's basically a great big vacuum tube and"
00:07:48,00:07:53,you suck up all the balls and then they get pushed into the sanitizing bath and then they
00:07:53,00:07:56,get shoved into a drying machine and then they get blasted back out when they're all dry
00:07:56,00:07:57,and nice again.
00:07:57,00:07:59,It's as you would expect.
00:07:59,00:08:04,"But it feels like it would be fun to get sucked into that machine, doesn't it?"
00:08:04,00:08:05,Right.
00:08:05,00:08:06,It does.
00:08:06,00:08:07,It feels like quite a fun ride.
00:08:07,00:08:10,If there was a giant ball pit somewhere where you have to go in one of the balls.
00:08:10,00:08:11,Like a hamster.
00:08:11,00:08:12,Exactly.
00:08:12,00:08:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:13,00:08:14,That's very cool.
00:08:14,00:08:17,Why didn't they just put a sign up saying don't shit in the ball pit?
00:08:17,00:08:19,"Well, not everyone can read."
00:08:19,00:08:20,We'll cut read.
00:08:20,00:08:25,"If this is the adult ball pit, I understand the cleaning for kids who wants your grown-up."
00:08:25,00:08:30,I don't think that the adults who go to Bolly Bollison are shitting in the ball pit.
00:08:30,00:08:32,It's why you don't need to clean the balls.
00:08:32,00:08:35,What's up with this new Fandall Ball machine?
00:08:35,00:08:38,"Well, don't try and put the Gobble Muffin out of a job."
00:08:38,00:08:39,Sorry.
00:08:39,00:08:44,So I was looking at the history of playgrounds generally and actually there was this really
00:08:44,00:08:48,cool story a few years ago where the older swing in the world was found.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Cool.
00:08:49,00:08:52,And it was just in the bottom of someone's garden.
00:08:52,00:08:54,So this was a wicksteed swing.
00:08:54,00:08:58,So the guy who invented the swing was a guy called Charles Wicksteed.
00:08:58,00:09:03,It was in Kettering in Northamptonshire and he made this playground and came up with
00:09:03,00:09:04,a swing.
00:09:04,00:09:09,And then they were looking for Wicksteed's old playground equipment and a random family
00:09:09,00:09:11,"who lived nearby said, well, we've got this kind of old looking swing at the bottom"
00:09:11,00:09:12,of our garden.
00:09:12,00:09:13,Come and take a look.
00:09:13,00:09:16,This is pro-so type for all of that and the kids were still using it.
00:09:16,00:09:18,That's not the original kids.
00:09:18,00:09:22,"They were very old by that point, but they were still swinging."
00:09:22,00:09:23,Too old.
00:09:23,00:09:28,They were shitting again by that same.
00:09:28,00:09:29,How cool is that?
00:09:29,00:09:34,"The creator of the swing and of the ball pit grew up when we were born, I guess, two hours"
00:09:34,00:09:37,"drive from each other, Kettering and Sheffield."
00:09:37,00:09:38,Yeah.
00:09:38,00:09:40,It's just quite amazing that that bit of the world is.
00:09:40,00:09:41,What?
00:09:41,00:09:42,It's about two.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Maybe less than two hours.
00:09:43,00:09:44,I've looked at it on Google.
00:09:44,00:09:45,"Oh, did it?"
00:09:45,00:09:46,It's an hour-40 train ride.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Straight one again.
00:09:47,00:09:48,I'll be on one.
00:09:48,00:09:49,OK.
00:09:49,00:09:50,I find that astonishing.
00:09:50,00:09:51,We know who invented the swing.
00:09:51,00:09:52,I don't think we do.
00:09:52,00:09:55,Because I would have thought cavemen were on swings and probably dinosaurs.
00:09:55,00:09:58,I think he definitely invented the hang on.
00:09:58,00:10:01,I'm not even going to get into that.
00:10:01,00:10:03,He invented the modern swing.
00:10:03,00:10:04,He did.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"So it was a cop out, like the modern Olympics, you know?"
00:10:06,00:10:07,Yeah.
00:10:07,00:10:12,"And also, I'm always, you know, to put on my professional hat, no, my work hat."
00:10:12,00:10:15,"So when we say it's surprising, they're two hours apart from each other, it's not."
00:10:15,00:10:19,Because I always think these things are so western bias and so English-speaking country
00:10:19,00:10:20,bias.
00:10:20,00:10:21,They probably had swings in the Netherlands or swit.
00:10:21,00:10:24,"They definitely had swings in China probably 7,000 years ago."
00:10:24,00:10:25,Yes.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"No one made a swing, for instance."
00:10:26,00:10:27,Did he?
00:10:27,00:10:28,Do you have a ball pit?
00:10:28,00:10:29,He did.
00:10:29,00:10:30,"He didn't make the ball pit, but he did."
00:10:30,00:10:31,Another Englishman.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Of course.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Another Englishman.
00:10:33,00:10:34,He did it right to swing for his kids.
00:10:34,00:10:37,"And it sounds like the coolest house ever, so he was a super fun dad."
00:10:37,00:10:40,And he built himself with the help of a local carpenter.
00:10:40,00:10:41,He recruited for the purpose.
00:10:41,00:10:43,And he had a slide instead of stairs.
00:10:43,00:10:45,"So in Darwin's house, he went down a slide instead of the stairs."
00:10:45,00:10:46,And then he had to throw it up.
00:10:46,00:10:47,Yeah.
00:10:47,00:10:48,On the hook.
00:10:48,00:10:49,You never could.
00:10:49,00:10:50,So he started upstairs.
00:10:50,00:10:52,And then you never saw the upstairs again.
00:10:52,00:10:53,Okay.
00:10:53,00:10:56,Which is the same because the swing he erected was actually upstairs on the upstairs corridor.
00:10:56,00:10:57,Was it?
00:10:57,00:10:58,Yeah.
00:10:58,00:10:59,This is just to go back to Wixsteed.
00:10:59,00:11:04,"But there is a celebrity link to Wixsteed as a modern, quite famous person."
00:11:04,00:11:05,"Oh, you mean a descendant?"
00:11:05,00:11:06,No.
00:11:06,00:11:07,"No, no, no, no."
00:11:07,00:11:09,"I mean, a modern famous person got their break at gathering."
00:11:09,00:11:10,Is it James A. Custer?
00:11:10,00:11:11,Is it?
00:11:11,00:11:12,Yeah.
00:11:12,00:11:13,He was the only person from Casper and Gecker.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Think of him.
00:11:14,00:11:15,Yeah.
00:11:15,00:11:16,He makes a big thing out of being from catering.
00:11:16,00:11:17,And his very first job was at Wixsteed Park.
00:11:17,00:11:18,Was it?
00:11:18,00:11:22,And he's mentioned it because I think he did a TV show sort of like spoof documentary about
00:11:22,00:11:23,his early life.
00:11:23,00:11:26,"And the manager of the park said, ""We are proud that he worked it and what he has gone"
00:11:26,00:11:27,on to achieve.
00:11:27,00:11:31,"But if he ever wants to come back and help out serving at one of our outlets, he is more"
00:11:31,00:11:32,"than welcome."""
00:11:32,00:11:33,"Luck, showbiz."
00:11:33,00:11:34,It's a difficult industry.
00:11:34,00:11:35,You never know.
00:11:35,00:11:36,It's true.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Don't burn your bridges.
00:11:37,00:11:45,"I was reading that in Germany, Hitler's bunker right next to it where his body was cremated"
00:11:45,00:11:47,now sits a slide for children.
00:11:47,00:11:49,"There is a children's play area there, isn't it?"
00:11:49,00:11:50,Right over the spot.
00:11:50,00:11:53,I think they were thinking of getting rid of it because they thought it was kind of inappropriate.
00:11:53,00:11:54,It feels a bit weird.
00:11:54,00:11:55,Yeah.
00:11:55,00:11:56,It's all the picture of it.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"I mean, they don't have a sign up or a plaque."
00:11:57,00:11:58,Do they?
00:11:58,00:11:59,No.
00:11:59,00:12:00,They have the slide.
00:12:00,00:12:01,"I think that's fine, Dan."
00:12:01,00:12:02,What's fine?
00:12:02,00:12:03,I think it's fine that there's a children's play area.
00:12:03,00:12:05,It just looks a bit eerie when you know what happened on that spot.
00:12:05,00:12:09,"I mean, don't tell the kids."
00:12:09,00:12:10,Like what?
00:12:10,00:12:13,"Dan, campaigning with a big board, a sandwich board, bubbling information."
00:12:13,00:12:17,This is a Nazi playground.
00:12:17,00:12:24,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Chazinski."
00:12:24,00:12:29,My fact this week is that bananas are considered such bad luck on fishing boats that many captains
00:12:29,00:12:35,ban anyone on board from wearing banana boats sunscreen or clothes made by the company
00:12:35,00:12:41,Fruit of the loom because their logo used to feature a banana.
00:12:41,00:12:45,You can't have anything that's been near a banana anywhere near a fishing boat.
00:12:45,00:12:46,That is so strange.
00:12:46,00:12:47,It's so weird.
00:12:47,00:12:52,"And if you go on sort of fisherman's blogs and chat forums, that's what you'll do."
00:12:52,00:12:53,Yeah.
00:12:53,00:12:57,"Dan, they all say they all sort of exchange their tips and so a lot of them say."
00:12:57,00:12:58,I'll sort of avoid bananas.
00:12:58,00:12:59,Have avoid bananas.
00:12:59,00:13:03,"A lot of them say, you know, if you see someone with Fruit of the loom underwear or Fruit"
00:13:03,00:13:05,"of the loom clothes, I think it's a makeup clothes isn't it?"
00:13:05,00:13:06,How are you seeing their underwear?
00:13:06,00:13:08,"Well, I reckon you would have to check everyone's underwear, wouldn't you?"
00:13:08,00:13:09,You do.
00:13:09,00:13:13,"And then you cut the labels out of the very least, but maybe just rip all the clothes off."
00:13:13,00:13:16,If it's a sexy mode.
00:13:16,00:13:17,Do we know?
00:13:17,00:13:20,"Anna, why do you think they weren't the lab bananas on?"
00:13:20,00:13:25,There are probably more serious about that than anything.
00:13:25,00:13:26,Strong claim.
00:13:26,00:13:31,So it could be that I think probably the most likely is that bananas go rotten so far.
00:13:31,00:13:36,"So it dates back to like 1700s, they were considered bad luck and that was a time when the Caribbean"
00:13:36,00:13:40,was exporting a lot of bananas to continental America.
00:13:40,00:13:43,"And if you stop to go fishing, then the bananas spoiled."
00:13:43,00:13:46,And we should say that the bad luck doesn't mean someone will die usually.
00:13:46,00:13:49,It just means that you're not going to catch many fish that day.
00:13:49,00:13:50,And so it's like banana spoiled.
00:13:50,00:13:54,They also let off a really horrible smell when they're rotted and they make other fruit
00:13:54,00:13:55,rot around them.
00:13:55,00:14:01,But also there's a theory that they float when bodies don't.
00:14:01,00:14:02,So if a ship sinks.
00:14:02,00:14:07,They think all the sailors have turned into bananas.
00:14:07,00:14:08,Yeah.
00:14:08,00:14:10,It was a mystery for centuries.
00:14:10,00:14:11,"Anna, can I just pick you up?"
00:14:11,00:14:13,Bodies do float.
00:14:13,00:14:14,Bodies do float.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"No, the bodies think of first, don't they?"
00:14:16,00:14:17,Mmm.
00:14:17,00:14:19,I'm picturing Titanic.
00:14:19,00:14:20,Yeah.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:22,Right.
00:14:22,00:14:23,The movie or the movie?
00:14:23,00:14:24,The movie.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Do you remember at the end with all the bananas floating?
00:14:25,00:14:26,Yeah.
00:14:26,00:14:31,"The door is covered in bananas, it's like, no, I'm sorry Jack, there's no room for you on"
00:14:31,00:14:32,the door.
00:14:32,00:14:36,"But he does sink, sorry, to use that as a--"
00:14:36,00:14:37,He does sink.
00:14:37,00:14:38,Yeah.
00:14:38,00:14:40,But it could be that he resurfaces later.
00:14:40,00:14:41,"Anyway, it's back up."
00:14:41,00:14:42,Yeah.
00:14:42,00:14:45,"The point is it used to be that when people, when boats sank at sea, they were carrying"
00:14:45,00:14:49,"lots of bananas because they were going to export them, then people would row out and"
00:14:49,00:14:52,"try and save everyone, and they'd just be load of floating bananas."
00:14:52,00:14:53,Mmm.
00:14:53,00:14:57,"And so they attributed the cause of the sinking to them for enough, some more theories."
00:14:57,00:15:02,"It could be that you get lots of spiders or snakes or something in your banana shipment,"
00:15:02,00:15:07,"or it could be that crew members were slipping on the banana peels, and so obviously that"
00:15:07,00:15:08,was really bad luck.
00:15:08,00:15:09,Yeah.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Oh wow.
00:15:10,00:15:11,It's definitely that.
00:15:11,00:15:15,So do we have any more unlucky things?
00:15:15,00:15:16,Yeah.
00:15:16,00:15:20,"You see, redheads are supposed to be unlucky, that is people with ginger hair."
00:15:20,00:15:21,Yes.
00:15:21,00:15:27,"And some people say, according to One Maritime Museum, if you meet one before boarding"
00:15:27,00:15:31,"your ship, the only way to mitigate the bad luck is to speak to them before they can speak"
00:15:31,00:15:32,to you.
00:15:32,00:15:33,Wow.
00:15:33,00:15:39,This sounds like a plot by redheads to get people talking to you.
00:15:39,00:15:43,"I read that whistling is bad luck, and then in the very same list, I read that whistling"
00:15:43,00:15:44,is good luck.
00:15:44,00:15:46,So I'm not sure which one to believe.
00:15:46,00:15:47,Hmm.
00:15:47,00:15:50,I would say perhaps don't believe anything in that list.
00:15:50,00:15:53,"That's a good thought, yeah."
00:15:53,00:15:57,But the reason for it being bad luck supposedly is that they use whistles as commands to each
00:15:57,00:16:00,"other, if you couldn't kind of shout, you couldn't really tell them what to do, you might"
00:16:00,00:16:03,"do one whistle for this, two whistles for no."
00:16:03,00:16:07,"And so if you were just whistling a jaunty, sea shanty, then it might confuse people who"
00:16:07,00:16:11,didn't know whether to put their sails up or sails down.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"Albatrosses, famously bad luck for sailors."
00:16:13,00:16:14,Yes.
00:16:14,00:16:22,"So not for Captain Cook, because he was around in the mid 18th century, and they only became"
00:16:22,00:16:26,bad luck in the end of the 18th century when the rhyme with the ancient mariner came out.
00:16:26,00:16:31,"So they weren't bad luck at all before that came out, and it was all because of that."
00:16:31,00:16:32,And actually they could be good luck.
00:16:32,00:16:39,"So in 1881, there was a man who fell overboard from his boat, and there was an albatross in"
00:16:39,00:16:43,"the water, a dead albatross, and he held onto it, and it kind of floated like a banana."
00:16:43,00:16:48,"If you can imagine that, and it kept him upright for all that time until someone came and"
00:16:48,00:16:49,collected him.
00:16:49,00:16:51,So albatrosses can be good luck.
00:16:51,00:16:52,That's amazing.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Wow.
00:16:53,00:16:54,Any banana stuff?
00:16:54,00:16:55,Oh yeah.
00:16:55,00:16:58,"Well, I've been looking at banana shipping."
00:16:58,00:16:59,Okay.
00:16:59,00:17:03,"So I didn't know this, but they have a kind of policy, because obviously they have to"
00:17:03,00:17:07,"be shipped when they're green, they're cut off the tree when they're green, and then"
00:17:07,00:17:11,"when they get to the port they're going to, they're sent into these special pressurised"
00:17:11,00:17:14,isolation rooms.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"Isolation rooms suggest there's only one in each room, but that can't be true."
00:17:17,00:17:18,It's very expensive.
00:17:18,00:17:19,It's amazing.
00:17:19,00:17:20,That's so cheap.
00:17:20,00:17:21,What do you think about it?
00:17:21,00:17:22,Sorry.
00:17:22,00:17:23,Yeah.
00:17:23,00:17:24,They're going to these kind of forced ripening centers.
00:17:24,00:17:29,And the air is pumped into the boxes of bananas so that they ripen at a consistent rate.
00:17:29,00:17:31,"And also ethylene, which is that chemical they give off."
00:17:31,00:17:33,They get fake ethylene too.
00:17:33,00:17:35,So they get them way more ripe.
00:17:35,00:17:38,But it all happens once they've arrived.
00:17:38,00:17:44,"And they're a special banana scientist who control these rooms, and I read a great article"
00:17:44,00:17:48,"on packer.com, which is all about packaging and packing and shipping."
00:17:48,00:17:53,"And apparently these specialists, they monitor the fruit like a mother hen waiting for it"
00:17:53,00:17:54,to turn.
00:17:54,00:17:57,"And then when it's ready, they say, right, it's ready for asda, and they're basically trying"
00:17:57,00:18:00,to trick the bananas into thinking that they're back in Ecuador or whatever they've come
00:18:00,00:18:01,from.
00:18:01,00:18:02,That's amazing.
00:18:02,00:18:03,Yeah.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"And the rooms are even pressurised to have the same, like, I guess, air pressure as in"
00:18:06,00:18:07,Ecuador.
00:18:07,00:18:09,"And Mr. Detail, is this all happening on the boat, or is this once it lands?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,Once they've arrived.
00:18:10,00:18:11,Right.
00:18:11,00:18:12,Special rooms once they've arrived.
00:18:12,00:18:13,Yeah.
00:18:13,00:18:14,Cool.
00:18:14,00:18:15,And how do they test the inside part?
00:18:15,00:18:16,"When I've eaten a banana, has it been unpeeled?"
00:18:16,00:18:18,And it makes you covered 100 times.
00:18:18,00:18:20,It's a syringes that's gone in.
00:18:20,00:18:23,You know sometimes you get a hole in your banana.
00:18:23,00:18:24,Of course.
00:18:24,00:18:25,It's a little air.
00:18:25,00:18:26,And air pocket.
00:18:26,00:18:27,"Yeah, that's what it is."
00:18:27,00:18:28,And that's what it is.
00:18:28,00:18:29,"You can squeeze a banana to feel the ripeness, can't you?"
00:18:29,00:18:30,Yeah.
00:18:30,00:18:31,That's what I do.
00:18:31,00:18:34,"I imagine what happens is they take one banana, test the inside of it, throw that"
00:18:34,00:18:36,away and sell all the other ones.
00:18:36,00:18:39,"You should be in charge of banana in portals, because that's much cleverer."
00:18:39,00:18:41,I just had my banana scientists hat on that.
00:18:41,00:18:42,Yeah.
00:18:42,00:18:45,That's so cool.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"Do you know mesc, the shipping firm?"
00:18:47,00:18:48,Yeah.
00:18:48,00:18:49,Biggest shipping firm in the world.
00:18:49,00:18:50,Sure.
00:18:50,00:18:52,"Biggest firm most people have never heard of, you know."
00:18:52,00:18:57,"But they have 270,000 refrigerated shipping containers, which is I think the largest fleet"
00:18:57,00:18:58,"in the world, perhaps."
00:18:58,00:18:59,"By a long way, mesc."
00:18:59,00:19:00,It's huge.
00:19:00,00:19:01,It's a vast majority.
00:19:01,00:19:02,So these are refrigerated.
00:19:02,00:19:03,These are refrigerated.
00:19:03,00:19:04,They get called reefers.
00:19:04,00:19:11,"And the bananas in there effectively have Wi-Fi, because there is data being taken all"
00:19:11,00:19:14,"the time, remote technology in each of these refrigerated containers."
00:19:14,00:19:18,"And the company is tracking the power status, in case one of them stops being refrigerated."
00:19:18,00:19:19,Uh-huh.
00:19:19,00:19:23,"And their temperature and their humidity, and it beams it up to a satellite."
00:19:23,00:19:24,Yeah.
00:19:24,00:19:27,So if there is a malfunction in a shipping container full of bananas in the middle of
00:19:27,00:19:32,"the ocean, mesc can find out about it and fix it before it arrives, and they've done"
00:19:32,00:19:33,that hundreds of times.
00:19:33,00:19:37,"I mean, I wouldn't say that that's a banana having Wi-Fi."
00:19:37,00:19:42,"They're not surfing the web, are they?"
00:19:42,00:19:48,"Well, I'm sorry for trying to make it seem a little more interesting, but it won't."
00:19:48,00:19:49,Cool.
00:19:49,00:19:56,So there's a room with a bit of basic technology that most things have there.
00:19:56,00:19:57,Okay.
00:19:57,00:19:59,It is time for fact number three.
00:19:59,00:20:04,And that is my fact. My fact this week is that Tim Berners-Lee originally wanted to call
00:20:04,00:20:09,"the World Wide Web the Information Mine, Tim, for short."
00:20:09,00:20:10,Mmm.
00:20:10,00:20:11,Yeah.
00:20:11,00:20:12,So I learnt this fact.
00:20:12,00:20:16,"In fact, we all learnt this fact when we were in Geneva earlier this year, being taken"
00:20:16,00:20:22,"on a tour of Surn by a really great guy called James Gillies, who's a scientist who writes"
00:20:22,00:20:25,"a lot about Surn, who works out there."
00:20:25,00:20:28,And that was one of the things he told us while we were out there looking.
00:20:28,00:20:32,He said there were a bunch of names that Tim Berners-Lee was actually thinking he should call
00:20:32,00:20:33,it.
00:20:33,00:20:34,One was mine of information.
00:20:34,00:20:35,The information mine was another one.
00:20:35,00:20:37,The mesh was another one.
00:20:37,00:20:39,"Mine of information would have been, ""Wah."""
00:20:39,00:20:41,"I said, ""So that's also about himself."""
00:20:41,00:20:42,"Yes, exactly."
00:20:42,00:20:43,Yeah.
00:20:43,00:20:47,And so the reason he didn't go for the information mine is because he thought it would be
00:20:47,00:20:50,"immodest, or he just found a better name."
00:20:50,00:20:51,Yeah.
00:20:51,00:20:54,Most sites I've read say that it's because it seemed too egotistical.
00:20:54,00:20:58,"But I can't really see any source that says, ""I thought he said that he did a Reddit."""
00:20:58,00:21:00,"Yeah, I didn't see it on Reddit when I read the answer to that."
00:21:00,00:21:01,Oh.
00:21:01,00:21:06,"Yeah, I sort of read that as someone below commenting on why he said he didn't go for it."
00:21:06,00:21:08,But maybe I missed his proper comment on that.
00:21:08,00:21:11,"So did he, do we know why, why he did it?"
00:21:11,00:21:14,"No, I personally, I couldn't get to the bottom of it."
00:21:14,00:21:17,Do we know why he did go with worldwide web?
00:21:17,00:21:19,"I guess it's close to mesh, isn't it?"
00:21:19,00:21:21,I read that mesh would have been too similar to mess.
00:21:21,00:21:22,Yeah.
00:21:22,00:21:24,I thought it sounded a bit messy.
00:21:24,00:21:28,"Which would be quite fitting, not necessarily in derogatory way, but it is a huge mess, isn't"
00:21:28,00:21:29,it?
00:21:29,00:21:30,Yeah.
00:21:30,00:21:31,It's a huge mess of crap worldwide web.
00:21:31,00:21:33,I think it was a start with that.
00:21:33,00:21:36,"But he did do this AMA, which was a very revealing of a lot of things."
00:21:36,00:21:41,So there's been rumors for years and years that Era 4 of 4 came as a result of there being
00:21:41,00:21:44,a room called Room 4 of 4 in the office that he was working at.
00:21:44,00:21:48,"And he said, ""No, that's absolute nonsense, not true at all."""
00:21:48,00:21:51,"He was asked, ""Is there one thing you never thought the internet would be used for,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,"but has become one of the main reasons that people do use it."""
00:21:53,00:21:55,And his one word answer was kittens.
00:21:55,00:22:00,So he did give some quite fun answers in this thing.
00:22:00,00:22:05,"The kittens thing is weird, because the internet, which is different to the worldwide web, was"
00:22:05,00:22:06,almost called the catanet.
00:22:06,00:22:07,Was it really?
00:22:07,00:22:08,It was.
00:22:08,00:22:10,"Again, how perfect would that have been?"
00:22:10,00:22:11,It was awesome.
00:22:11,00:22:16,"So the catanet was, this is in 1974, and an internet pioneer, Louis Pousart wrote this"
00:22:16,00:22:20,"paper where he coined the term catanet, and he said it's going to be a network of"
00:22:20,00:22:21,networks.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"And he said, ""I bet the world will adopt this."""
00:22:23,00:22:27,"And he essentially described the internet, said it should be called the catanet, and people"
00:22:27,00:22:30,used that for the internet until the 80s.
00:22:30,00:22:33,"And then they changed it to the internet, and we should probably go back to the catanet"
00:22:33,00:22:38,"given how it's evolved, or the pornanet, but it's harder to say."
00:22:38,00:22:42,"So the web, originally, was not meant to be read only."
00:22:42,00:22:44,"So Tim Berners-Lee, when he first built it, it made it."
00:22:44,00:22:49,"He wanted it to be an interactive thing, so everyone can edit it."
00:22:49,00:22:52,"And the only reason is read only, so you're going to a website, you can't just make changes"
00:22:52,00:22:53,to the website.
00:22:53,00:22:56,"He wanted it to be Wikipedia, basically, is what you mean."
00:22:56,00:22:59,He wanted it to be every site to be Wikipedia.
00:22:59,00:23:03,"But more so than that, you know, might go into a Word document, like everyone's Wikipedia,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"there's a process to go through, I guess."
00:23:05,00:23:06,"Oh, I see."
00:23:06,00:23:09,"So like a Google Doc, basically, a shared Google Doc."
00:23:09,00:23:14,"So you might go on to BBC News, and you could just change Boris Johnson's name to Trevor"
00:23:14,00:23:15,"McDonald, if you wanted to."
00:23:15,00:23:16,Yeah.
00:23:16,00:23:20,I don't know why that's the first thing that came into my head.
00:23:20,00:23:21,So weird.
00:23:21,00:23:23,So many insults you could have come up with.
00:23:23,00:23:25,You were lost to the protest on the street.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"I was thinking, what's you going to go with?"
00:23:27,00:23:28,I bet it's going to be really rude.
00:23:28,00:23:29,"I'm really, really going to get him."
00:23:29,00:23:33,I was thinking of what's the most confusing thing you've got out there.
00:23:33,00:23:34,I know.
00:23:34,00:23:35,I know.
00:23:35,00:23:37,Why is Trevor McDonald private as well in a sudden?
00:23:37,00:23:38,That's like Eddie says.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"I'm now just thinking, I wonder what Trevor McDonald's up to."
00:23:40,00:23:41,I haven't heard from him in years.
00:23:41,00:23:42,"Well, he's retired."
00:23:42,00:23:43,He's pretty elderly now.
00:23:43,00:23:44,"Yeah, but what's he doing?"
00:23:44,00:23:45,Where is he?
00:23:45,00:23:48,He's out negotiating with Europe.
00:23:48,00:23:56,"So why didn't, why didn't that obviously insane idea come to fruition?"
00:23:56,00:23:59,It wasn't for any reasons like it being obviously insane.
00:23:59,00:24:04,"It was just that logistically, practically, it was too difficult to get it done, the coding"
00:24:04,00:24:05,and the organisation of it.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"So it was like, oh, so it is easier to make it a redone."
00:24:08,00:24:11,"And actually, you could argue that's why the internet's gotten to all the trouble that"
00:24:11,00:24:17,"it has because it means that all these big companies have power over it, whereas we can't"
00:24:17,00:24:18,all interact actively.
00:24:18,00:24:19,It could have been such a different thing.
00:24:19,00:24:20,Yeah.
00:24:20,00:24:22,The worldwide Google doc.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Yeah.
00:24:23,00:24:24,It's so cool.
00:24:24,00:24:26,And it's so weird that we're calling it worldwide Google doc.
00:24:26,00:24:30,Given that Google is obviously one of the things that's benefited from this huge monopoly
00:24:30,00:24:31,the companies have.
00:24:31,00:24:32,Anyway.
00:24:32,00:24:36,"I was looking into the earliest transaction, digital transaction."
00:24:36,00:24:38,So digital money for a product.
00:24:38,00:24:42,"There's quite a few competing theories about what it was, no one's quite tracked it down,"
00:24:42,00:24:48,"but one of the leading ones is that in 1971 and 1972, the first transaction, so between"
00:24:48,00:24:53,"that time, a first transaction was made and it was between students at Stanford University"
00:24:53,00:24:56,and MIT and they were selling weed to each other.
00:24:56,00:24:57,Cool.
00:24:57,00:24:59,So the first transaction potentially was a drug deal.
00:24:59,00:25:00,Yeah.
00:25:00,00:25:01,"Sorry, I just said cool."
00:25:01,00:25:03,"Like, wanting to be cool."
00:25:03,00:25:04,Brilliant.
00:25:04,00:25:05,"Cool, dude."
00:25:05,00:25:06,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:06,00:25:07,I know.
00:25:07,00:25:08,Yeah.
00:25:08,00:25:10,Got one in my bag right now.
00:25:10,00:25:11,Okay.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"Because there was a lady earlier who dordered something by telephone, but that didn't count"
00:25:13,00:25:16,because she paid in cash when it was delivered to her door.
00:25:16,00:25:20,"She predates that, but this is the first digital money transaction."
00:25:20,00:25:21,Very cool.
00:25:21,00:25:22,I don't think it is cool.
00:25:22,00:25:23,It's not cool.
00:25:23,00:25:24,It's not cool.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"As a cop, I can confirm it's not cool."
00:25:25,00:25:27,I'm just going to put my cop's hat on it.
00:25:27,00:25:28,Haha.
00:25:28,00:25:32,Two of you are wearing hats right now.
00:25:32,00:25:34,To have a James of wearing their hats right now.
00:25:34,00:25:35,Yeah.
00:25:35,00:25:36,It's a new thing.
00:25:36,00:25:37,We're in different kinds of hats.
00:25:37,00:25:38,Yeah.
00:25:38,00:25:42,You're from different eras by judging by the hat.
00:25:42,00:25:44,We're not even going to say what the hat's on.
00:25:44,00:25:49,"We're just going to let you, if you send a drawing in of the hats, you think Dan and James"
00:25:49,00:25:50,are wearing at the moment.
00:25:50,00:25:53,Whoever gets closest will win a small prize.
00:25:53,00:25:55,Seven and two.
00:25:55,00:25:56,Andrew Hansen-Murray.
00:25:56,00:25:57,Two.
00:25:57,00:25:58,Oh.
00:25:58,00:26:03,I don't even get a try-corn.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Do you like that?
00:26:04,00:26:07,I don't really think that Ku Klux Klan hat is very appropriate.
00:26:07,00:26:08,"Oh, dear."
00:26:08,00:26:11,I hope you take that off before you go to the soft play area.
00:26:11,00:26:12,Haha.
00:26:12,00:26:18,"I found sort of a precursor to the World Wide Web, or in fact Wikipedia, which was the"
00:26:18,00:26:22,"Mondanium, which I can't believe I've never read about."
00:26:22,00:26:25,But this was a thing that was created in 1910.
00:26:25,00:26:32,And it was after this initiative from 1895 of two Belgian lawyers called Paul Octlet and
00:26:32,00:26:34,Henry Lafontaine.
00:26:34,00:26:38,"And they wanted to create what they were called a world palace, basically all the world's"
00:26:38,00:26:39,knowledge and information.
00:26:39,00:26:41,They wanted to catalog it.
00:26:41,00:26:42,And so they started doing this.
00:26:42,00:26:46,"And it was in the Palais Mondiales, so the palace of the world, they think in Brussels."
00:26:46,00:26:48,And they got up to 12 million index cards.
00:26:48,00:26:52,"So as a sort of side effect of this, he also invented the index."
00:26:52,00:26:53,No.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Yeah.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"And 12 million index cards, 12 of information."
00:26:56,00:26:59,And it was sitting there in Brussels for decades.
00:26:59,00:27:00,And then of course.
00:27:00,00:27:02,So it's just in a big room.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"And there's loads of filing cabinets with index cards, which has all the information in"
00:27:05,00:27:06,the world.
00:27:06,00:27:07,Yeah.
00:27:07,00:27:08,Wow.
00:27:08,00:27:09,"It's impressive, isn't it?"
00:27:09,00:27:10,Just two of them probably had a few secretaries.
00:27:10,00:27:11,That's amazing.
00:27:11,00:27:12,That's incredible.
00:27:12,00:27:13,Is it still around?
00:27:13,00:27:14,Is it still accessible?
00:27:14,00:27:15,Irritatingly.
00:27:15,00:27:16,And I know they always ruin everything.
00:27:16,00:27:21,"But in 1940, the Nazis rocked up, and the Third Reich replaced it with a bunch of Third"
00:27:21,00:27:23,Reich art.
00:27:23,00:27:27,"And some of it was left over, most of it we don't know where it's gone."
00:27:27,00:27:28,Oh.
00:27:28,00:27:29,Yeah.
00:27:29,00:27:30,I know that was bastards.
00:27:30,00:27:34,It's always a response to the Nazis doing something.
00:27:34,00:27:35,"Oh, God."
00:27:35,00:27:36,That's sick.
00:27:36,00:27:40,I'm going to stop going to that child's play area in Berlin.
00:27:40,00:27:44,All his birthday.
00:27:44,00:27:45,Yeah.
00:27:45,00:27:46,The outfit.
00:27:46,00:27:53,"Look, Dan's the one in the hood."
00:27:53,00:28:03,"OK, it is time for a final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:28:03,00:28:08,"OK, my fact this week is that the first non-use of the word ""beland"" to refer to a person"
00:28:08,00:28:13,was for the entire 1992 West Bromwich LVN football team.
00:28:13,00:28:14,Amazing.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"I mean, what a fact."
00:28:16,00:28:17,Yeah.
00:28:17,00:28:19,"What a bunch of ""beland""."
00:28:19,00:28:26,"So the word ""beland"", one of the first uses was the flaired end of a trumpet or other wind"
00:28:26,00:28:34,"instrument opposite to the mouthpiece, and that's from 1826, and then in 1819 it meant the enclosed"
00:28:34,00:28:39,"extension from the main living space of a tent, especially one with a rounded shape."
00:28:39,00:28:40,That was in 1819.
00:28:40,00:28:48,"That was in 1919, sorry if I said 18, and then 1961 it became referring to the penis."
00:28:48,00:28:54,"And then in 1992, someone was on a use net news group on the 28th of September, and said,"
00:28:54,00:29:03,"""Perhaps you are referring to that infamous collection of ""beland"" known as WBA win-bug-a-all."""
00:29:03,00:29:07,"They were insulting West Brom, but it was a bit harsh because they looked at their results"
00:29:07,00:29:12,"around this time, and there had been nine games that season, and they'd won seven, drawn"
00:29:12,00:29:15,"one, and lost one, and they got promoted at the end of the season."
00:29:15,00:29:16,"Oh, wow."
00:29:16,00:29:18,A bunch of bad luck.
00:29:18,00:29:22,"Interesting fact, the man who wrote that comment was Tim Berners-Lee, who was the whole reason"
00:29:22,00:29:24,he had invented the WBA win-bug.
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Oh, there you go."
00:29:26,00:29:30,"It's a very British insult, isn't it?"
00:29:30,00:29:31,I don't think it gets used in America.
00:29:31,00:29:32,"No, no."
00:29:32,00:29:33,"No, it shouldn't think so."
00:29:33,00:29:34,No.
00:29:34,00:29:41,"It had synonyms, so when it became used for the end of the penis in 1961, as you said, in"
00:29:41,00:29:46,"the dictionary of slang and unconventional English, then it was synonymous with a blond"
00:29:46,00:29:49,"end and red end, which have fallen out of use, but we could bring back."
00:29:49,00:29:50,Bluntend.
00:29:50,00:29:52,"Well, a bunch of blond ends."
00:29:52,00:29:55,But you don't have a sharp end at the other end of the penis?
00:29:55,00:29:58,"Well, maybe you should see someone around that."
00:29:58,00:30:00,I don't have two ends.
00:30:00,00:30:03,"Oh, you really should see someone around that."
00:30:03,00:30:09,"There's only one other word in the Oxford English Dictionary, whose first citation references"
00:30:09,00:30:13,"West Bromwich, L.D., and football club, and that is the word ""maximum"", referring to"
00:30:13,00:30:16,someone who scores lots of goals in a football team.
00:30:16,00:30:22,"It says West Bromwich, L.D., and are largely relying on James Cuxen, the marksman of Chesterfield."
00:30:22,00:30:23,There you go.
00:30:23,00:30:24,That is great.
00:30:24,00:30:29,"Who knew they were such a hotbed of neologisms in West Bromwich, L.D., and I looked at Birmingham"
00:30:29,00:30:35,"City Football Club and asked a villa football club who were both similar local teams, and"
00:30:35,00:30:36,they don't have a single one.
00:30:36,00:30:37,Wow.
00:30:37,00:30:42,"So West Bromwich, there's Shakespeare at our time over there."
00:30:42,00:30:49,One insult that is in the Oxford English Dictionary that has a fantastic reference or citation
00:30:49,00:30:52,"of, quote, is ""dickweed""."
00:30:52,00:30:58,"And ""dickweed"" is a word that got popularised in Bill and Ted's excellent adventure."
00:30:58,00:31:02,"So they use a quote from that movie in the Oxford English Dictionary, and it's a word"
00:31:02,00:31:06,"that I grew up with because I love that movie and used to be, used to call people a ""dickweed"","
00:31:06,00:31:08,"but I didn't know what ""dickweed"" actually meant, and it's pubic hair."
00:31:08,00:31:11,"I just had, I'd not put, like, connection together."
00:31:11,00:31:14,"Do you think it's play on the word ""duckweed""?"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"Which is, like, a type of plant you get in a pond."
00:31:16,00:31:17,Is it?
00:31:17,00:31:18,Okay.
00:31:18,00:31:19,"No, do you think it is?"
00:31:19,00:31:22,"I don't think he was stating that it was, and I doubt that they'd thought about it to"
00:31:22,00:31:23,that extent.
00:31:23,00:31:26,"Oh, I reckon it might be, though, because it's not a common word, but it's reasonably"
00:31:26,00:31:27,common.
00:31:27,00:31:28,"Are you ""duckweed""?"
00:31:28,00:31:29,"Are you ""dickweed""?"
00:31:29,00:31:30,No.
00:31:30,00:31:31,I think that's plausible.
00:31:31,00:31:32,I'm not saying it's totally impossible.
00:31:32,00:31:33,"I just think it's one of those ""unknowables""."
00:31:33,00:31:39,There will never be a smoking gun on this.
00:31:39,00:31:44,"And ""bellend"" is also a village, and that is, coincidentally, only 10 miles from West"
00:31:44,00:31:46,Bromwich Albion's football ground.
00:31:46,00:31:51,"And I think, as far as I can tell, that West Bromwich Albion is the closest English football"
00:31:51,00:31:53,"team to the village of ""bellend""."
00:31:53,00:31:54,No way.
00:31:54,00:31:55,I believe so.
00:31:55,00:31:56,That is insane.
00:31:56,00:31:58,"It's close, but I think it is."
00:31:58,00:32:04,"Oh, that's much better than my two-hour journey from Kettering to Shaffield."
00:32:04,00:32:08,"I wonder if the person who knows, I wonder if the person who wrote that comment online,"
00:32:08,00:32:14,"in 1992, knows that they have other first use of a word recorded in language."
00:32:14,00:32:18,"No, and of course, it's hard to imagine that he made it up, right?"
00:32:18,00:32:19,Right.
00:32:19,00:32:22,"I think it feels like lots of people are saying it, but it's just the first written"
00:32:22,00:32:23,out.
00:32:23,00:32:24,"Yeah, because there weren't many."
00:32:24,00:32:25,It wasn't mentioned in newspapers much.
00:32:25,00:32:26,No.
00:32:26,00:32:30,"I've been in private correspondence, maybe in Churchill's letters, you're right, to someone"
00:32:30,00:32:31,else.
00:32:31,00:32:32,Heller is such a bellend.
00:32:32,00:32:38,"Well, even though they did the ""Mondanium"", Michael flatly fits into the bellend's story"
00:32:38,00:32:39,as well.
00:32:39,00:32:42,I think we might have mentioned this in the book of the first-ever book of the year.
00:32:42,00:32:43,Okay.
00:32:43,00:32:44,Can you explain who he is for?
00:32:44,00:32:45,"Oh, of course."
00:32:45,00:32:49,"So, sorry, Michael flatly, the father of ""revidance"", Irish dance, not the father, one"
00:32:49,00:32:52,"of his descendants, but he's an Irish dancer and performer."
00:32:52,00:32:55,"And you know, the big thing with a line-up and they all dance."
00:32:55,00:32:56,He's very famous for that.
00:32:56,00:32:57,"He's called him ""Lord of the Dance""."
00:32:57,00:33:04,"And he said in late 2016 that he would perform at Donald Trump's inauguration, and as a result"
00:33:04,00:33:10,"of that, someone redirected the website colossalbellend.com so that when you type that in, it went to"
00:33:10,00:33:11,Michael flatly's website.
00:33:11,00:33:12,Yeah.
00:33:12,00:33:13,That's very good.
00:33:13,00:33:14,But it's amazing.
00:33:14,00:33:17,Bell was used to mean penis in 1593.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Yes.
00:33:18,00:33:22,"That's the first use of bell to mean penis, and that's from Jonathan Green's Dictionary"
00:33:22,00:33:27,"of Flang, and it refers to a young man wagging his bobble and bringing his bell, and it's clearly"
00:33:27,00:33:29,a knob gag.
00:33:29,00:33:32,And yet it took so long for us to really embrace it.
00:33:32,00:33:36,"Well, just for bell to become bell-end, and then for that to become a personal thing."
00:33:36,00:33:37,Yeah.
00:33:37,00:33:44,"That was in a, what sounds like a great book called ""The Passion of Maurice""."
00:33:44,00:33:45,What?
00:33:45,00:33:47,That's like someone's penpal.
00:33:47,00:33:55,"I love ""The Passion of Maurice"". I'm waggling my bobble as I think."
00:33:55,00:33:58,"You've got a martial art sort of penpal, so you've had a child."
00:33:58,00:34:02,Why were considerably table stuff?
00:34:02,00:34:06,"But he got pickpocketed in the story as he was doing that, so let this be a lesson to all"
00:34:06,00:34:07,men.
00:34:07,00:34:08,What?
00:34:08,00:34:09,He fancied this woman in the story.
00:34:09,00:34:14,"I assumed the character ""The Passion of Maurice"", and he said he was very pleased by her,"
00:34:14,00:34:18,and he showed this with wagging his bobble and bringing his bell while she picked his pocket
00:34:18,00:34:20,and cut his purse.
00:34:20,00:34:25,"So if you will get your willy out and start publicly wanking, you will be pickpocketed."
00:34:25,00:34:26,Why?
00:34:26,00:34:27,Is the moral of that story?
00:34:27,00:34:30,What a bold time to pickpocket someone.
00:34:30,00:34:34,"You'd be catered to the pickpocket, is."
00:34:34,00:34:37,"I suppose if you're taking your trousers off to waggle it, then actually it is easier to"
00:34:37,00:34:38,"pickpocket someone, isn't it?"
00:34:38,00:34:43,"I don't think you'd fully, I think it's a weird, I think it's a weird fashion, who fully"
00:34:43,00:34:48,"takes off the trousers, folds them up and puts them on in there, but I see, it's on the train."
00:34:48,00:34:50,"Flashes are a weird, barn-shielding element."
00:34:50,00:34:55,"I'm not saying they're not, but they're saying that would require a very organised, flashing"
00:34:55,00:34:56,mentality.
00:34:56,00:34:58,And we're going to have to wrap up shortly.
00:34:58,00:35:01,"Yep, just a couple of older bits of insult."
00:35:01,00:35:06,"This is from a classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue, which was published in 1785,"
00:35:06,00:35:10,"and you can get it online, and some really good ones, I like in there, are, what to be"
00:35:10,00:35:14,"dicked in the knob, is."
00:35:14,00:35:16,I don't think you need to tell us about that.
00:35:16,00:35:18,"That could mean anything, couldn't it?"
00:35:18,00:35:23,"It just means silly, guys, it just means you're a silly, silly dicked in the knob, dicked"
00:35:23,00:35:24,in the knob.
00:35:24,00:35:25,It's a knob-meaning head.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"Yes, believe so."
00:35:26,00:35:28,"So, Dickey has in something's gone wrong."
00:35:28,00:35:34,"You could also say that somebody is Captain Queer Nabs, and that's if they are an ill-dressed"
00:35:34,00:35:35,or shabby fellow.
00:35:35,00:35:36,"Oh, okay."
00:35:36,00:35:40,"Or, if you're, this isn't really an insult, it's just, if you're surprised or confounded,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,you are betwattled.
00:35:42,00:35:47,"That's great, we should bring that back."
00:35:47,00:35:48,Yeah.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Definitely so.
00:35:49,00:35:53,"Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts."
