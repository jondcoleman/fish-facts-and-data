00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.040
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.440
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.280
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.120
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.120
 My fact is that the first ever ball pit was inspired by a jar of pickled onions.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.280
 It was a guy who had a massive jar of pickled onions and his son fell into it one day and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.520
 while they were fishing him out they noticed, "Oh he's having a great time" so that's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.520
 not that.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.480
 A guy called Eric McMillan who invented it, it was called a ball crawl back in the good

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.680
 old days and he was the subject of a Guardian Longread recently, you know they did these

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.920
 great long essays and it's all about playgrounds and how playgrounds were developed and you

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.960
 know the original playgrounds and who first thought of doing all this weird stuff for

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.800
 children to play in because you know had to be invented and he was this kind of visionary

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.000
 who invented all these different methods of playing and one of the things he was working

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.680
 on was a place called SeaWorlds, Captain Kids in San Diego in 1976 and he and his colleague

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.520
 were looking at a jar of pickled onions and they thought I think that could work.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.920
 So he's seen as the father of soft play because this wasn't the only thing that he created.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.360
 Soft play, I go to a lot these days with my son and they're amazing gymnasiums of balls

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:55.160
 and we are lots of those gymnasiums.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.800
 So you know if you go into if you see kids playing in a sort of big soft play but there's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.280
 the hanging boxing bags and they're things that you punch like a punch bag.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 Exactly.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.120
 You're taking your son to a gym.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120
 Sounds like it.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:14.600
 You're a boxing ring, he looks like a mutant now it's so buff, it's so weird.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.000
 Mike for his birthday, didn't you but he can't get anywhere on it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.800
 Yeah, so you spend a lot of time in soft play.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.200
 So soft players have punching bags for children, no they're hanging and you've got to go

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
 through them.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 You navigate through them.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.600
 Like a forest of punching bags.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.800
 Exactly, a forest of punching bags.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 Yeah.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.800
 They recreate the natural world, don't you?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.120
 On the ends on the floor and punching bags in the air.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.760
 Apparently the balls were originally used for trapping pollutants inside smokestacks,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.960
 which I can't quite picture but I guess if you had a layer of balls in a chimney so they

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.640
 would, you know, the smoke would kind of filter through and cling to the balls on its

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.920
 way upwards and so it would take some of the pollutants out.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.160
 What, the balls that they use in kids' ball pits now, originally?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.080
 They originally sourced, yeah, those are the people making those plastic balls at the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080
 time.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080
 I don't think they invented the plastic ball.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080
 That's amazing.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080
 That's interesting.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.440
 This guy, he came up with the idea of having soft play because he grew up without the soft

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440
 play.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440
 Right.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.320
 He grew up in North Manchester in the shadow of Strange Way's prison and used to play in

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.200
 bombed out buildings and over like burnt out cars and stuff like that.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200
 Right.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.480
 Although bombed out buildings were the inspiration for the best playgrounds in the world.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.080
 So the adventure playground, the origin was the bombed out buildings of World War II

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.920
 in London and kids used to play on them a lot and people they were hanging about all over

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.440
 the place and people were always your turn, these into something a bit less depressing.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.520
 And so then they turned them into adventure playgrounds.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.240
 And then the adventure playgrounds today are more like places where they're like scrap yards,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240
 right?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240
 Is that right?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.240
 Well, you can kind of build things.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.040
 There's running machines there.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.240
 So there's a difference between like the soft play version and a more hard play version,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.200
 especially in America and you get these adventure playgrounds that have got like loose

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.880
 tires, blocks of wood, ropes, hammers, nails.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.880
 Right.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.280
 I read one place that they can even set fire to things, the kids.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280
 Wow.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280
 I've never seen one of these.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280
 I've never seen them either.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.800
 But apparently they're more safe than the soft play things.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800
 Yeah.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.320
 And the reason being that as soon as you enter a soft play thing you go straight for the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.640
 highest tallest thing and climb up it because like obviously you think everything's safe.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.040
 But in these more dodgy ones with lots of like rusty nails and stuff like that, the children

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.520
 kind of build their own play area and they start small and they kind of build up to it.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.240
 Or they're just quivering in fear in the corner.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.120
 Yeah, I think that's a bit of an innovative thing they're doing in America specifically.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120
 It's in New York, isn't it?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.920
 It's called the yard and it's the idea that they want to encourage kids to play with what's

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920
 around them.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.360
 Can we just briefly go back to ball pits?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360
 Yes, please.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360
 I mostly research ball pits.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360
 Yeah.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.720
 So there have been studies done about the hygiene in ball pits because some people are

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720
 worried.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.320
 And there was a spate of stories quite recently.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.280
 One guy who worked for a phone called STEM Protect which is a STEM cell bank.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.480
 So I don't know why he's sticking his aura into this field of human endeavor.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480
 Anyway.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.480
 Everyone's going to have a hobby, mate.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.480
 Yeah.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.720
 So he was saying that 99.9% of ball pits contain levels of vomit and feces was how it was reported

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.200
 because obviously, yeah, it's absolutely believable.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200
 Yeah.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.320
 But I mean, the way he put it sounded really distressing.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.280
 He said, he's a parent and he said, I've watched some of these places with my professional

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280
 hat on.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.640
 And what I've learned has truly disturbed me.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.720
 You take your kids to these ball pit play warehouses to have fun, but I've seen kids emerge

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.240
 with their legs covered in poo.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.280
 And the worst thing was, it wasn't even their own poo.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.560
 How could he tell?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.640
 He had his professional hat on this.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.640
 Everyone knows.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.480
 As soon as you put your professional hat on, it's poo spotting out.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.440
 Swobbing the feces.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.880
 There haven't actually been many studies done of this, but there has been a study in Georgia

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.000
 where they swabbed balls from six different ball pits and they found out what was in there.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.240
 And obviously, they found loads of bacteria because as they're a bacteria everywhere, you

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.320
 know, that's the whole point.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.520
 So there are various ones like meningitis and pneumonia and septicemia and various skin

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 infections.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.520
 Yeah.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.520
 So some of the bad ones were there.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.520
 Oh, so I'm not a bad one.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520
 Sure.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520
 Some of the ones that you might find in feces, for instance.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.520
 Yeah.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.640
 So fecal bacteria, we've said, they're not necessarily bad.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.600
 No, it probably lots of good guy bacteria in there as well.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.560
 But even fecal bacteria are not automatically going to kill you.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.440
 If you can't afford some yakult, just lick a ball.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:45.120
 There was one of the dirtiest ball pits that these guys found had an average of 170,818

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.480
 different bacteria on each ball.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480
 What?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480
 No idea if that's a lot.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.480
 I know, because it sounds like a lot.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.480
 It does sound like a lot, isn't it?

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.440
 But then if you would have to lick the whole ball to get it in like, I don't know about you,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.280
 but I never licked any of the balls when I was in my ball pit years.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.280
 Yeah.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.280
 But you never lived.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.280
 Would you make your ball pit?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.280
 Yeah.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280
 They still have, they have adult ball pits.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280
 That's true.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.280
 But I've never gone to one.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.280
 There's one in London, the ball pit bar in London.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.280
 Is it?

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.760
 It started off as a one month-only pop-up in Dullston in 2016 when it was so popular that

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.360
 they opened it full-time.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.840
 It's called Bolly Bollison.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.480
 And every single ball in this place is cleaned by a mechanical ball cleaner that can clean

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.800
 18,000 balls per hour.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800
 Wow.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.640
 And that machine is called the Gobble Muffin.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.640
 Nice.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640
 Okay.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.240
 So they've made it up.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.480
 They've made the branding very mature and adult.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480
 It isn't.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480
 Have you seen how the machines work?

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.480
 No.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.160
 So I watched a video of a professional ball cleaning machine.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.560
 And was it the Gobble Muffin or?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.560
 It wasn't.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.720
 This was a slower one, and I believe, but it's basically a great big vacuum tube and

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.040
 you suck up all the balls and then they get pushed into the sanitizing bath and then they

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.960
 get shoved into a drying machine and then they get blasted back out when they're all dry

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960
 and nice again.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.960
 It's as you would expect.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.360
 But it feels like it would be fun to get sucked into that machine, doesn't it?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360
 Right.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.360
 It does.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360
 It feels like quite a fun ride.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.560
 If there was a giant ball pit somewhere where you have to go in one of the balls.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.560
 Like a hamster.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.560
 Exactly.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.560
 That's very cool.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.400
 Why didn't they just put a sign up saying don't shit in the ball pit?

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.320
 Well, not everyone can read.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.320
 We'll cut read.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.320
 If this is the adult ball pit, I understand the cleaning for kids who wants your grown-up.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.240
 I don't think that the adults who go to Bolly Bollison are shitting in the ball pit.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.280
 It's why you don't need to clean the balls.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.640
 What's up with this new Fandall Ball machine?

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.480
 Well, don't try and put the Gobble Muffin out of a job.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480
 Sorry.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.640
 So I was looking at the history of playgrounds generally and actually there was this really

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.880
 cool story a few years ago where the older swing in the world was found.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.880
 Cool.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.280
 And it was just in the bottom of someone's garden.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.960
 So this was a wicksteed swing.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.200
 So the guy who invented the swing was a guy called Charles Wicksteed.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.600
 It was in Kettering in Northamptonshire and he made this playground and came up with

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.600
 a swing.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.000
 And then they were looking for Wicksteed's old playground equipment and a random family

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.880
 who lived nearby said, well, we've got this kind of old looking swing at the bottom

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.880
 of our garden.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.880
 Come and take a look.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.760
 This is pro-so type for all of that and the kids were still using it.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.520
 That's not the original kids.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.760
 They were very old by that point, but they were still swinging.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760
 Too old.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.520
 They were shitting again by that same.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520
 How cool is that?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.080
 The creator of the swing and of the ball pit grew up when we were born, I guess, two hours

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.680
 drive from each other, Kettering and Sheffield.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.680
 Yeah.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.520
 It's just quite amazing that that bit of the world is.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520
 What?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.520
 It's about two.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.520
 Maybe less than two hours.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.520
 I've looked at it on Google.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.520
 Oh, did it?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.520
 It's an hour-40 train ride.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.520
 Straight one again.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.520
 I'll be on one.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.520
 OK.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.520
 I find that astonishing.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.520
 We know who invented the swing.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520
 I don't think we do.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.960
 Because I would have thought cavemen were on swings and probably dinosaurs.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.960
 I think he definitely invented the hang on.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.520
 I'm not even going to get into that.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.040
 He invented the modern swing.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040
 He did.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.080
 So it was a cop out, like the modern Olympics, you know?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.080
 Yeah.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.800
 And also, I'm always, you know, to put on my professional hat, no, my work hat.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.720
 So when we say it's surprising, they're two hours apart from each other, it's not.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.040
 Because I always think these things are so western bias and so English-speaking country

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040
 bias.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.280
 They probably had swings in the Netherlands or swit.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.040
 They definitely had swings in China probably 7,000 years ago.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040
 Yes.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040
 No one made a swing, for instance.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040
 Did he?

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040
 Do you have a ball pit?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040
 He did.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.040
 He didn't make the ball pit, but he did.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.040
 Another Englishman.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.040
 Of course.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.040
 Another Englishman.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.040
 He did it right to swing for his kids.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.520
 And it sounds like the coolest house ever, so he was a super fun dad.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.200
 And he built himself with the help of a local carpenter.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200
 He recruited for the purpose.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.280
 And he had a slide instead of stairs.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.800
 So in Darwin's house, he went down a slide instead of the stairs.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.800
 And then he had to throw it up.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.800
 Yeah.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.800
 On the hook.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.800
 You never could.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800
 So he started upstairs.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.800
 And then you never saw the upstairs again.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800
 Okay.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.800
 Which is the same because the swing he erected was actually upstairs on the upstairs corridor.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.800
 Was it?

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800
 Yeah.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800
 This is just to go back to Wixsteed.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.280
 But there is a celebrity link to Wixsteed as a modern, quite famous person.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.280
 Oh, you mean a descendant?

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280
 No.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.280
 No, no, no, no.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.880
 I mean, a modern famous person got their break at gathering.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880
 Is it James A. Custer?

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880
 Is it?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880
 Yeah.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880
 He was the only person from Casper and Gecker.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880
 Think of him.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880
 Yeah.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880
 He makes a big thing out of being from catering.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880
 And his very first job was at Wixsteed Park.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.880
 Was it?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.600
 And he's mentioned it because I think he did a TV show sort of like spoof documentary about

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600
 his early life.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.840
 And the manager of the park said, "We are proud that he worked it and what he has gone

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.840
 on to achieve.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.120
 But if he ever wants to come back and help out serving at one of our outlets, he is more

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120
 than welcome."

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.120
 Luck, showbiz.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120
 It's a difficult industry.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.120
 You never know.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.120
 It's true.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120
 Don't burn your bridges.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:45.400
 I was reading that in Germany, Hitler's bunker right next to it where his body was cremated

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.720
 now sits a slide for children.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.480
 There is a children's play area there, isn't it?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480
 Right over the spot.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.480
 I think they were thinking of getting rid of it because they thought it was kind of inappropriate.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480
 It feels a bit weird.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480
 Yeah.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480
 It's all the picture of it.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 I mean, they don't have a sign up or a plaque.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480
 Do they?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480
 No.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.480
 They have the slide.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480
 I think that's fine, Dan.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480
 What's fine?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.480
 I think it's fine that there's a children's play area.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.840
 It just looks a bit eerie when you know what happened on that spot.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.040
 I mean, don't tell the kids.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.040
 Like what?

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.960
 Dan, campaigning with a big board, a sandwich board, bubbling information.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.040
 This is a Nazi playground.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:24.040
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Chazinski.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.840
 My fact this week is that bananas are considered such bad luck on fishing boats that many captains

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.400
 ban anyone on board from wearing banana boats sunscreen or clothes made by the company

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.160
 Fruit of the loom because their logo used to feature a banana.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.960
 You can't have anything that's been near a banana anywhere near a fishing boat.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
 That is so strange.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960
 It's so weird.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.840
 And if you go on sort of fisherman's blogs and chat forums, that's what you'll do.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.840
 Yeah.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.040
 Dan, they all say they all sort of exchange their tips and so a lot of them say.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040
 I'll sort of avoid bananas.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.040
 Have avoid bananas.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.160
 A lot of them say, you know, if you see someone with Fruit of the loom underwear or Fruit

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.280
 of the loom clothes, I think it's a makeup clothes isn't it?

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280
 How are you seeing their underwear?

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.880
 Well, I reckon you would have to check everyone's underwear, wouldn't you?

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.880
 You do.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.360
 And then you cut the labels out of the very least, but maybe just rip all the clothes off.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.200
 If it's a sexy mode.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.200
 Do we know?

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.040
 Anna, why do you think they weren't the lab bananas on?

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.040
 There are probably more serious about that than anything.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.040
 Strong claim.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.120
 So it could be that I think probably the most likely is that bananas go rotten so far.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.360
 So it dates back to like 1700s, they were considered bad luck and that was a time when the Caribbean

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.920
 was exporting a lot of bananas to continental America.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.920
 And if you stop to go fishing, then the bananas spoiled.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.720
 And we should say that the bad luck doesn't mean someone will die usually.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.800
 It just means that you're not going to catch many fish that day.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.880
 And so it's like banana spoiled.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.440
 They also let off a really horrible smell when they're rotted and they make other fruit

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.720
 rot around them.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.280
 But also there's a theory that they float when bodies don't.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.760
 So if a ship sinks.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.040
 They think all the sailors have turned into bananas.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040
 Yeah.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.040
 It was a mystery for centuries.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.720
 Anna, can I just pick you up?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.520
 Bodies do float.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.520
 Bodies do float.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.840
 No, the bodies think of first, don't they?

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.840
 Mmm.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.320
 I'm picturing Titanic.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.320
 Yeah.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.320
 Yeah.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.320
 Right.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.320
 The movie or the movie?

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.320
 The movie.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.320
 Do you remember at the end with all the bananas floating?

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320
 Yeah.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.120
 The door is covered in bananas, it's like, no, I'm sorry Jack, there's no room for you on

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.120
 the door.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.640
 But he does sink, sorry, to use that as a--

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.640
 He does sink.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640
 Yeah.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.640
 But it could be that he resurfaces later.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640
 Anyway, it's back up.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640
 Yeah.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.800
 The point is it used to be that when people, when boats sank at sea, they were carrying

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.000
 lots of bananas because they were going to export them, then people would row out and

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.640
 try and save everyone, and they'd just be load of floating bananas.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.640
 Mmm.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.800
 And so they attributed the cause of the sinking to them for enough, some more theories.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.720
 It could be that you get lots of spiders or snakes or something in your banana shipment,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.680
 or it could be that crew members were slipping on the banana peels, and so obviously that

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.680
 was really bad luck.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.680
 Yeah.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680
 Oh wow.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.680
 It's definitely that.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.120
 So do we have any more unlucky things?

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.120
 Yeah.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.960
 You see, redheads are supposed to be unlucky, that is people with ginger hair.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960
 Yes.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.200
 And some people say, according to One Maritime Museum, if you meet one before boarding

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.840
 your ship, the only way to mitigate the bad luck is to speak to them before they can speak

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840
 to you.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840
 Wow.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.400
 This sounds like a plot by redheads to get people talking to you.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.440
 I read that whistling is bad luck, and then in the very same list, I read that whistling

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440
 is good luck.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.840
 So I'm not sure which one to believe.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.840
 Hmm.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.480
 I would say perhaps don't believe anything in that list.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.160
 That's a good thought, yeah.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.320
 But the reason for it being bad luck supposedly is that they use whistles as commands to each

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.920
 other, if you couldn't kind of shout, you couldn't really tell them what to do, you might

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.200
 do one whistle for this, two whistles for no.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.520
 And so if you were just whistling a jaunty, sea shanty, then it might confuse people who

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.040
 didn't know whether to put their sails up or sails down.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.760
 Albatrosses, famously bad luck for sailors.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.760
 Yes.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:22.240
 So not for Captain Cook, because he was around in the mid 18th century, and they only became

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.960
 bad luck in the end of the 18th century when the rhyme with the ancient mariner came out.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.400
 So they weren't bad luck at all before that came out, and it was all because of that.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.920
 And actually they could be good luck.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:39.000
 So in 1881, there was a man who fell overboard from his boat, and there was an albatross in

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.840
 the water, a dead albatross, and he held onto it, and it kind of floated like a banana.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.480
 If you can imagine that, and it kept him upright for all that time until someone came and

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.480
 collected him.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.280
 So albatrosses can be good luck.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280
 That's amazing.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.280
 Wow.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.280
 Any banana stuff?

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.280
 Oh yeah.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.240
 Well, I've been looking at banana shipping.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.240
 Okay.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.560
 So I didn't know this, but they have a kind of policy, because obviously they have to

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.400
 be shipped when they're green, they're cut off the tree when they're green, and then

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.160
 when they get to the port they're going to, they're sent into these special pressurised

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.280
 isolation rooms.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.480
 Isolation rooms suggest there's only one in each room, but that can't be true.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.480
 It's very expensive.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.480
 It's amazing.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.480
 That's so cheap.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480
 What do you think about it?

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480
 Sorry.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.480
 Yeah.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.680
 They're going to these kind of forced ripening centers.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.400
 And the air is pumped into the boxes of bananas so that they ripen at a consistent rate.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.760
 And also ethylene, which is that chemical they give off.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.840
 They get fake ethylene too.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.920
 So they get them way more ripe.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.160
 But it all happens once they've arrived.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.040
 And they're a special banana scientist who control these rooms, and I read a great article

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.480
 on packer.com, which is all about packaging and packing and shipping.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.160
 And apparently these specialists, they monitor the fruit like a mother hen waiting for it

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.160
 to turn.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.480
 And then when it's ready, they say, right, it's ready for asda, and they're basically trying

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.640
 to trick the bananas into thinking that they're back in Ecuador or whatever they've come

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.640
 from.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.640
 That's amazing.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640
 Yeah.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.280
 And the rooms are even pressurised to have the same, like, I guess, air pressure as in

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.280
 Ecuador.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.880
 And Mr. Detail, is this all happening on the boat, or is this once it lands?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880
 Once they've arrived.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.880
 Right.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.880
 Special rooms once they've arrived.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.880
 Yeah.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880
 Cool.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.880
 And how do they test the inside part?

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.880
 When I've eaten a banana, has it been unpeeled?

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.880
 And it makes you covered 100 times.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.880
 It's a syringes that's gone in.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.120
 You know sometimes you get a hole in your banana.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120
 Of course.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.120
 It's a little air.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.120
 And air pocket.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.120
 Yeah, that's what it is.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120
 And that's what it is.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120
 You can squeeze a banana to feel the ripeness, can't you?

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120
 Yeah.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120
 That's what I do.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.480
 I imagine what happens is they take one banana, test the inside of it, throw that

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.760
 away and sell all the other ones.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.360
 You should be in charge of banana in portals, because that's much cleverer.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.720
 I just had my banana scientists hat on that.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720
 Yeah.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.720
 That's so cool.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.520
 Do you know mesc, the shipping firm?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.520
 Yeah.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.520
 Biggest shipping firm in the world.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.520
 Sure.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.080
 Biggest firm most people have never heard of, you know.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.160
 But they have 270,000 refrigerated shipping containers, which is I think the largest fleet

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.160
 in the world, perhaps.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160
 By a long way, mesc.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160
 It's huge.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.160
 It's a vast majority.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.160
 So these are refrigerated.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160
 These are refrigerated.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.240
 They get called reefers.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:11.280
 And the bananas in there effectively have Wi-Fi, because there is data being taken all

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.840
 the time, remote technology in each of these refrigerated containers.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.920
 And the company is tracking the power status, in case one of them stops being refrigerated.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.920
 Uh-huh.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.160
 And their temperature and their humidity, and it beams it up to a satellite.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160
 Yeah.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.280
 So if there is a malfunction in a shipping container full of bananas in the middle of

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.160
 the ocean, mesc can find out about it and fix it before it arrives, and they've done

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.160
 that hundreds of times.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.240
 I mean, I wouldn't say that that's a banana having Wi-Fi.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.000
 They're not surfing the web, are they?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.280
 Well, I'm sorry for trying to make it seem a little more interesting, but it won't.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.280
 Cool.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:56.320
 So there's a room with a bit of basic technology that most things have there.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.320
 Okay.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.560
 It is time for fact number three.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.640
 And that is my fact. My fact this week is that Tim Berners-Lee originally wanted to call

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.760
 the World Wide Web the Information Mine, Tim, for short.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760
 Mmm.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.760
 Yeah.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.760
 So I learnt this fact.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.560
 In fact, we all learnt this fact when we were in Geneva earlier this year, being taken

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.280
 on a tour of Surn by a really great guy called James Gillies, who's a scientist who writes

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.160
 a lot about Surn, who works out there.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.360
 And that was one of the things he told us while we were out there looking.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.000
 He said there were a bunch of names that Tim Berners-Lee was actually thinking he should call

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 it.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 One was mine of information.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.720
 The information mine was another one.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.320
 The mesh was another one.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.320
 Mine of information would have been, "Wah."

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.560
 I said, "So that's also about himself."

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.560
 Yes, exactly.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.560
 Yeah.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.080
 And so the reason he didn't go for the information mine is because he thought it would be

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.400
 immodest, or he just found a better name.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.400
 Yeah.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.600
 Most sites I've read say that it's because it seemed too egotistical.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.440
 But I can't really see any source that says, "I thought he said that he did a Reddit."

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.920
 Yeah, I didn't see it on Reddit when I read the answer to that.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.920
 Oh.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.720
 Yeah, I sort of read that as someone below commenting on why he said he didn't go for it.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.800
 But maybe I missed his proper comment on that.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.720
 So did he, do we know why, why he did it?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.800
 No, I personally, I couldn't get to the bottom of it.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.040
 Do we know why he did go with worldwide web?

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.080
 I guess it's close to mesh, isn't it?

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.440
 I read that mesh would have been too similar to mess.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.440
 Yeah.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.120
 I thought it sounded a bit messy.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.080
 Which would be quite fitting, not necessarily in derogatory way, but it is a huge mess, isn't

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080
 it?

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.080
 Yeah.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.400
 It's a huge mess of crap worldwide web.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.480
 I think it was a start with that.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.960
 But he did do this AMA, which was a very revealing of a lot of things.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.320
 So there's been rumors for years and years that Era 4 of 4 came as a result of there being

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.640
 a room called Room 4 of 4 in the office that he was working at.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.200
 And he said, "No, that's absolute nonsense, not true at all."

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.080
 He was asked, "Is there one thing you never thought the internet would be used for,

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.560
 but has become one of the main reasons that people do use it."

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.840
 And his one word answer was kittens.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.560
 So he did give some quite fun answers in this thing.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.360
 The kittens thing is weird, because the internet, which is different to the worldwide web, was

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.360
 almost called the catanet.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.360
 Was it really?

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.360
 It was.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.120
 Again, how perfect would that have been?

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.120
 It was awesome.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.640
 So the catanet was, this is in 1974, and an internet pioneer, Louis Pousart wrote this

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.560
 paper where he coined the term catanet, and he said it's going to be a network of

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560
 networks.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.440
 And he said, "I bet the world will adopt this."

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.040
 And he essentially described the internet, said it should be called the catanet, and people

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.120
 used that for the internet until the 80s.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.560
 And then they changed it to the internet, and we should probably go back to the catanet

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.800
 given how it's evolved, or the pornanet, but it's harder to say.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.400
 So the web, originally, was not meant to be read only.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.880
 So Tim Berners-Lee, when he first built it, it made it.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.600
 He wanted it to be an interactive thing, so everyone can edit it.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.720
 And the only reason is read only, so you're going to a website, you can't just make changes

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720
 to the website.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.760
 He wanted it to be Wikipedia, basically, is what you mean.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.240
 He wanted it to be every site to be Wikipedia.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.680
 But more so than that, you know, might go into a Word document, like everyone's Wikipedia,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.040
 there's a process to go through, I guess.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040
 Oh, I see.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.080
 So like a Google Doc, basically, a shared Google Doc.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.080
 So you might go on to BBC News, and you could just change Boris Johnson's name to Trevor

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.080
 McDonald, if you wanted to.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.080
 Yeah.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.960
 I don't know why that's the first thing that came into my head.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.960
 So weird.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.360
 So many insults you could have come up with.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.000
 You were lost to the protest on the street.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.080
 I was thinking, what's you going to go with?

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.080
 I bet it's going to be really rude.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.280
 I'm really, really going to get him.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.160
 I was thinking of what's the most confusing thing you've got out there.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160
 I know.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.160
 I know.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.160
 Why is Trevor McDonald private as well in a sudden?

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.160
 That's like Eddie says.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.960
 I'm now just thinking, I wonder what Trevor McDonald's up to.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.960
 I haven't heard from him in years.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960
 Well, he's retired.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.960
 He's pretty elderly now.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.960
 Yeah, but what's he doing?

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.960
 Where is he?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.240
 He's out negotiating with Europe.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:56.840
 So why didn't, why didn't that obviously insane idea come to fruition?

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.520
 It wasn't for any reasons like it being obviously insane.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.520
 It was just that logistically, practically, it was too difficult to get it done, the coding

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.960
 and the organisation of it.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.760
 So it was like, oh, so it is easier to make it a redone.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.800
 And actually, you could argue that's why the internet's gotten to all the trouble that

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:17.320
 it has because it means that all these big companies have power over it, whereas we can't

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.320
 all interact actively.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.760
 It could have been such a different thing.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760
 Yeah.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.000
 The worldwide Google doc.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Yeah.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 It's so cool.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.760
 And it's so weird that we're calling it worldwide Google doc.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.800
 Given that Google is obviously one of the things that's benefited from this huge monopoly

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800
 the companies have.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 Anyway.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.240
 I was looking into the earliest transaction, digital transaction.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.920
 So digital money for a product.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.600
 There's quite a few competing theories about what it was, no one's quite tracked it down,

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.240
 but one of the leading ones is that in 1971 and 1972, the first transaction, so between

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.280
 that time, a first transaction was made and it was between students at Stanford University

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.320
 and MIT and they were selling weed to each other.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.320
 Cool.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.400
 So the first transaction potentially was a drug deal.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400
 Yeah.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.400
 Sorry, I just said cool.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.200
 Like, wanting to be cool.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.200
 Brilliant.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.200
 Cool, dude.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200
 I know.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200
 Yeah.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.360
 Got one in my bag right now.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.360
 Okay.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.960
 Because there was a lady earlier who dordered something by telephone, but that didn't count

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.840
 because she paid in cash when it was delivered to her door.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.000
 She predates that, but this is the first digital money transaction.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Very cool.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 I don't think it is cool.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 It's not cool.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 It's not cool.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 As a cop, I can confirm it's not cool.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.440
 I'm just going to put my cop's hat on it.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440
 Haha.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.200
 Two of you are wearing hats right now.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.640
 To have a James of wearing their hats right now.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640
 Yeah.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640
 It's a new thing.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640
 We're in different kinds of hats.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.640
 Yeah.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.560
 You're from different eras by judging by the hat.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.760
 We're not even going to say what the hat's on.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.080
 We're just going to let you, if you send a drawing in of the hats, you think Dan and James

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.080
 are wearing at the moment.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.360
 Whoever gets closest will win a small prize.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.160
 Seven and two.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160
 Andrew Hansen-Murray.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160
 Two.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.160
 Oh.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.160
 I don't even get a try-corn.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160
 Do you like that?

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.320
 I don't really think that Ku Klux Klan hat is very appropriate.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320
 Oh, dear.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.800
 I hope you take that off before you go to the soft play area.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800
 Haha.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:18.480
 I found sort of a precursor to the World Wide Web, or in fact Wikipedia, which was the

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.200
 Mondanium, which I can't believe I've never read about.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.440
 But this was a thing that was created in 1910.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:32.280
 And it was after this initiative from 1895 of two Belgian lawyers called Paul Octlet and

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.480
 Henry Lafontaine.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.120
 And they wanted to create what they were called a world palace, basically all the world's

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.360
 knowledge and information.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.000
 They wanted to catalog it.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 And so they started doing this.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.320
 And it was in the Palais Mondiales, so the palace of the world, they think in Brussels.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.920
 And they got up to 12 million index cards.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.160
 So as a sort of side effect of this, he also invented the index.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.160
 No.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.160
 Yeah.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.760
 And 12 million index cards, 12 of information.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.800
 And it was sitting there in Brussels for decades.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.800
 And then of course.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.440
 So it's just in a big room.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.680
 And there's loads of filing cabinets with index cards, which has all the information in

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680
 the world.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680
 Yeah.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.680
 Wow.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680
 It's impressive, isn't it?

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.680
 Just two of them probably had a few secretaries.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.680
 That's amazing.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.680
 That's incredible.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680
 Is it still around?

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.680
 Is it still accessible?

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680
 Irritatingly.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680
 And I know they always ruin everything.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.880
 But in 1940, the Nazis rocked up, and the Third Reich replaced it with a bunch of Third

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.480
 Reich art.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.120
 And some of it was left over, most of it we don't know where it's gone.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.120
 Oh.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.120
 Yeah.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.120
 I know that was bastards.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.080
 It's always a response to the Nazis doing something.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080
 Oh, God.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080
 That's sick.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.120
 I'm going to stop going to that child's play area in Berlin.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.120
 All his birthday.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120
 Yeah.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120
 The outfit.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:53.600
 Look, Dan's the one in the hood.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:28:03.320
 OK, it is time for a final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.520
 OK, my fact this week is that the first non-use of the word "beland" to refer to a person

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.080
 was for the entire 1992 West Bromwich LVN football team.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.080
 Amazing.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.080
 I mean, what a fact.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.080
 Yeah.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.880
 What a bunch of "beland".

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:26.880
 So the word "beland", one of the first uses was the flaired end of a trumpet or other wind

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:34.280
 instrument opposite to the mouthpiece, and that's from 1826, and then in 1819 it meant the enclosed

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.640
 extension from the main living space of a tent, especially one with a rounded shape.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.640
 That was in 1819.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:48.120
 That was in 1919, sorry if I said 18, and then 1961 it became referring to the penis.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:54.960
 And then in 1992, someone was on a use net news group on the 28th of September, and said,

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:03.040
 "Perhaps you are referring to that infamous collection of "beland" known as WBA win-bug-a-all."

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.920
 They were insulting West Brom, but it was a bit harsh because they looked at their results

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.440
 around this time, and there had been nine games that season, and they'd won seven, drawn

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.560
 one, and lost one, and they got promoted at the end of the season.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560
 Oh, wow.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.680
 A bunch of bad luck.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.320
 Interesting fact, the man who wrote that comment was Tim Berners-Lee, who was the whole reason

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.280
 he had invented the WBA win-bug.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.640
 Oh, there you go.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.040
 It's a very British insult, isn't it?

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.720
 I don't think it gets used in America.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.720
 No, no.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720
 No, it shouldn't think so.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.720
 No.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.960
 It had synonyms, so when it became used for the end of the penis in 1961, as you said, in

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.000
 the dictionary of slang and unconventional English, then it was synonymous with a blond

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.720
 end and red end, which have fallen out of use, but we could bring back.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.720
 Bluntend.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.720
 Well, a bunch of blond ends.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.720
 But you don't have a sharp end at the other end of the penis?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.760
 Well, maybe you should see someone around that.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.360
 I don't have two ends.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.800
 Oh, you really should see someone around that.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:09.160
 There's only one other word in the Oxford English Dictionary, whose first citation references

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.800
 West Bromwich, L.D., and football club, and that is the word "maximum", referring to

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.980
 someone who scores lots of goals in a football team.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:22.640
 It says West Bromwich, L.D., and are largely relying on James Cuxen, the marksman of Chesterfield.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.960
 There you go.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960
 That is great.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.840
 Who knew they were such a hotbed of neologisms in West Bromwich, L.D., and I looked at Birmingham

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.480
 City Football Club and asked a villa football club who were both similar local teams, and

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.480
 they don't have a single one.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.480
 Wow.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.000
 So West Bromwich, there's Shakespeare at our time over there.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.680
 One insult that is in the Oxford English Dictionary that has a fantastic reference or citation

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.760
 of, quote, is "dickweed".

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:58.520
 And "dickweed" is a word that got popularised in Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.320
 So they use a quote from that movie in the Oxford English Dictionary, and it's a word

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.480
 that I grew up with because I love that movie and used to be, used to call people a "dickweed",

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.960
 but I didn't know what "dickweed" actually meant, and it's pubic hair.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.760
 I just had, I'd not put, like, connection together.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.440
 Do you think it's play on the word "duckweed"?

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.360
 Which is, like, a type of plant you get in a pond.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360
 Is it?

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.360
 Okay.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.360
 No, do you think it is?

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.200
 I don't think he was stating that it was, and I doubt that they'd thought about it to

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 that extent.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.880
 Oh, I reckon it might be, though, because it's not a common word, but it's reasonably

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.880
 common.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.880
 Are you "duckweed"?

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.880
 Are you "dickweed"?

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.880
 No.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.880
 I think that's plausible.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880
 I'm not saying it's totally impossible.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880
 I just think it's one of those "unknowables".

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:39.600
 There will never be a smoking gun on this.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.520
 And "bellend" is also a village, and that is, coincidentally, only 10 miles from West

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.520
 Bromwich Albion's football ground.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.960
 And I think, as far as I can tell, that West Bromwich Albion is the closest English football

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.880
 team to the village of "bellend".

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.880
 No way.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.880
 I believe so.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.880
 That is insane.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.720
 It's close, but I think it is.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.160
 Oh, that's much better than my two-hour journey from Kettering to Shaffield.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.560
 I wonder if the person who knows, I wonder if the person who wrote that comment online,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:14.720
 in 1992, knows that they have other first use of a word recorded in language.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.920
 No, and of course, it's hard to imagine that he made it up, right?

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920
 Right.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.200
 I think it feels like lots of people are saying it, but it's just the first written

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.200
 out.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200
 Yeah, because there weren't many.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.800
 It wasn't mentioned in newspapers much.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800
 No.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.080
 I've been in private correspondence, maybe in Churchill's letters, you're right, to someone

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.080
 else.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.080
 Heller is such a bellend.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:38.400
 Well, even though they did the "Mondanium", Michael flatly fits into the bellend's story

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.400
 as well.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.280
 I think we might have mentioned this in the book of the first-ever book of the year.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280
 Okay.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280
 Can you explain who he is for?

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280
 Oh, of course.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.160
 So, sorry, Michael flatly, the father of "revidance", Irish dance, not the father, one

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.880
 of his descendants, but he's an Irish dancer and performer.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.080
 And you know, the big thing with a line-up and they all dance.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.080
 He's very famous for that.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.960
 He's called him "Lord of the Dance".

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:04.600
 And he said in late 2016 that he would perform at Donald Trump's inauguration, and as a result

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:10.240
 of that, someone redirected the website colossalbellend.com so that when you type that in, it went to

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.560
 Michael flatly's website.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.560
 Yeah.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.560
 That's very good.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.560
 But it's amazing.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.720
 Bell was used to mean penis in 1593.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.720
 Yes.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.160
 That's the first use of bell to mean penis, and that's from Jonathan Green's Dictionary

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.000
 of Flang, and it refers to a young man wagging his bobble and bringing his bell, and it's clearly

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 a knob gag.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.280
 And yet it took so long for us to really embrace it.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.120
 Well, just for bell to become bell-end, and then for that to become a personal thing.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120
 Yeah.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:44.360
 That was in a, what sounds like a great book called "The Passion of Maurice".

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360
 What?

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.600
 That's like someone's penpal.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:55.640
 I love "The Passion of Maurice". I'm waggling my bobble as I think.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.240
 You've got a martial art sort of penpal, so you've had a child.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.720
 Why were considerably table stuff?

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.240
 But he got pickpocketed in the story as he was doing that, so let this be a lesson to all

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.240
 men.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.240
 What?

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.240
 He fancied this woman in the story.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:14.720
 I assumed the character "The Passion of Maurice", and he said he was very pleased by her,

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.600
 and he showed this with wagging his bobble and bringing his bell while she picked his pocket

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.240
 and cut his purse.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.440
 So if you will get your willy out and start publicly wanking, you will be pickpocketed.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.440
 Why?

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440
 Is the moral of that story?

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.560
 What a bold time to pickpocket someone.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.320
 You'd be catered to the pickpocket, is.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.320
 I suppose if you're taking your trousers off to waggle it, then actually it is easier to

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.920
 pickpocket someone, isn't it?

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.600
 I don't think you'd fully, I think it's a weird, I think it's a weird fashion, who fully

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.320
 takes off the trousers, folds them up and puts them on in there, but I see, it's on the train.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.760
 Flashes are a weird, barn-shielding element.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.080
 I'm not saying they're not, but they're saying that would require a very organised, flashing

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.080
 mentality.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.440
 And we're going to have to wrap up shortly.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.320
 Yep, just a couple of older bits of insult.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:06.600
 This is from a classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue, which was published in 1785,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.960
 and you can get it online, and some really good ones, I like in there, are, what to be

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.320
 dicked in the knob, is.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.640
 I don't think you need to tell us about that.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.640
 That could mean anything, couldn't it?

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.200
 It just means silly, guys, it just means you're a silly, silly dicked in the knob, dicked

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.200
 in the knob.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.200
 It's a knob-meaning head.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200
 Yes, believe so.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.400
 So, Dickey has in something's gone wrong.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.040
 You could also say that somebody is Captain Queer Nabs, and that's if they are an ill-dressed

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040
 or shabby fellow.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040
 Oh, okay.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.280
 Or, if you're, this isn't really an insult, it's just, if you're surprised or confounded,

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.560
 you are betwattled.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.000
 That's great, we should bring that back.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 Yeah.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Definitely so.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.460
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.800
