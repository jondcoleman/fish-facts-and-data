00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,040
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski and

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,440
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,280
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,120
 Starting with you, Andy.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,120
 My fact is that the first ever ball pit was inspired by a jar of pickled onions.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,280
 It was a guy who had a massive jar of pickled onions and his son fell into it one day and

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,520
 while they were fishing him out they noticed, "Oh he's having a great time" so that's

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
 not that.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,480
 A guy called Eric McMillan who invented it, it was called a ball crawl back in the good

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,680
 old days and he was the subject of a Guardian Longread recently, you know they did these

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,920
 great long essays and it's all about playgrounds and how playgrounds were developed and you

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,960
 know the original playgrounds and who first thought of doing all this weird stuff for

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,800
 children to play in because you know had to be invented and he was this kind of visionary

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,000
 who invented all these different methods of playing and one of the things he was working

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,680
 on was a place called SeaWorlds, Captain Kids in San Diego in 1976 and he and his colleague

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,520
 were looking at a jar of pickled onions and they thought I think that could work.

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,920
 So he's seen as the father of soft play because this wasn't the only thing that he created.

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,360
 Soft play, I go to a lot these days with my son and they're amazing gymnasiums of balls

21
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:55,160
 and we are lots of those gymnasiums.

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,800
 So you know if you go into if you see kids playing in a sort of big soft play but there's

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,280
 the hanging boxing bags and they're things that you punch like a punch bag.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
 Exactly.

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,120
 You're taking your son to a gym.

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
 Sounds like it.

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:14,600
 You're a boxing ring, he looks like a mutant now it's so buff, it's so weird.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,000
 Mike for his birthday, didn't you but he can't get anywhere on it.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,800
 Yeah, so you spend a lot of time in soft play.

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,200
 So soft players have punching bags for children, no they're hanging and you've got to go

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
 through them.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
 You navigate through them.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
 Like a forest of punching bags.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,800
 Exactly, a forest of punching bags.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
 Yeah.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
 They recreate the natural world, don't you?

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,120
 On the ends on the floor and punching bags in the air.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,760
 Apparently the balls were originally used for trapping pollutants inside smokestacks,

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,960
 which I can't quite picture but I guess if you had a layer of balls in a chimney so they

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,640
 would, you know, the smoke would kind of filter through and cling to the balls on its

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,920
 way upwards and so it would take some of the pollutants out.

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,160
 What, the balls that they use in kids' ball pits now, originally?

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,080
 They originally sourced, yeah, those are the people making those plastic balls at the

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
 time.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
 I don't think they invented the plastic ball.

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
 That's amazing.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
 That's interesting.

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,440
 This guy, he came up with the idea of having soft play because he grew up without the soft

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
 play.

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
 Right.

51
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,320
 He grew up in North Manchester in the shadow of Strange Way's prison and used to play in

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,200
 bombed out buildings and over like burnt out cars and stuff like that.

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
 Right.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,480
 Although bombed out buildings were the inspiration for the best playgrounds in the world.

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,080
 So the adventure playground, the origin was the bombed out buildings of World War II

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,920
 in London and kids used to play on them a lot and people they were hanging about all over

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,440
 the place and people were always your turn, these into something a bit less depressing.

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,520
 And so then they turned them into adventure playgrounds.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,240
 And then the adventure playgrounds today are more like places where they're like scrap yards,

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
 right?

61
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
 Is that right?

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
 Well, you can kind of build things.

63
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,040
 There's running machines there.

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,240
 So there's a difference between like the soft play version and a more hard play version,

65
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,200
 especially in America and you get these adventure playgrounds that have got like loose

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,880
 tires, blocks of wood, ropes, hammers, nails.

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
 Right.

68
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,280
 I read one place that they can even set fire to things, the kids.

69
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
 Wow.

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
 I've never seen one of these.

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
 I've never seen them either.

72
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,800
 But apparently they're more safe than the soft play things.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
 Yeah.

74
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,320
 And the reason being that as soon as you enter a soft play thing you go straight for the

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,640
 highest tallest thing and climb up it because like obviously you think everything's safe.

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,040
 But in these more dodgy ones with lots of like rusty nails and stuff like that, the children

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
 kind of build their own play area and they start small and they kind of build up to it.

78
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
 Or they're just quivering in fear in the corner.

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,120
 Yeah, I think that's a bit of an innovative thing they're doing in America specifically.

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
 It's in New York, isn't it?

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,920
 It's called the yard and it's the idea that they want to encourage kids to play with what's

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
 around them.

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,360
 Can we just briefly go back to ball pits?

84
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
 Yes, please.

85
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 I mostly research ball pits.

86
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
 Yeah.

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,720
 So there have been studies done about the hygiene in ball pits because some people are

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
 worried.

89
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,320
 And there was a spate of stories quite recently.

90
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,280
 One guy who worked for a phone called STEM Protect which is a STEM cell bank.

91
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,480
 So I don't know why he's sticking his aura into this field of human endeavor.

92
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
 Anyway.

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
 Everyone's going to have a hobby, mate.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 Yeah.

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,720
 So he was saying that 99.9% of ball pits contain levels of vomit and feces was how it was reported

96
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,200
 because obviously, yeah, it's absolutely believable.

97
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
 Yeah.

98
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,320
 But I mean, the way he put it sounded really distressing.

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,280
 He said, he's a parent and he said, I've watched some of these places with my professional

100
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
 hat on.

101
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,640
 And what I've learned has truly disturbed me.

102
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,720
 You take your kids to these ball pit play warehouses to have fun, but I've seen kids emerge

103
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,240
 with their legs covered in poo.

104
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,280
 And the worst thing was, it wasn't even their own poo.

105
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,560
 How could he tell?

106
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,640
 He had his professional hat on this.

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 Everyone knows.

108
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,480
 As soon as you put your professional hat on, it's poo spotting out.

109
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,440
 Swobbing the feces.

110
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,880
 There haven't actually been many studies done of this, but there has been a study in Georgia

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,000
 where they swabbed balls from six different ball pits and they found out what was in there.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,240
 And obviously, they found loads of bacteria because as they're a bacteria everywhere, you

113
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,320
 know, that's the whole point.

114
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,520
 So there are various ones like meningitis and pneumonia and septicemia and various skin

115
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
 infections.

116
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 Yeah.

117
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
 So some of the bad ones were there.

118
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
 Oh, so I'm not a bad one.

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
 Sure.

120
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
 Some of the ones that you might find in feces, for instance.

121
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
 Yeah.

122
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,640
 So fecal bacteria, we've said, they're not necessarily bad.

123
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,600
 No, it probably lots of good guy bacteria in there as well.

124
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,560
 But even fecal bacteria are not automatically going to kill you.

125
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,440
 If you can't afford some yakult, just lick a ball.

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,120
 There was one of the dirtiest ball pits that these guys found had an average of 170,818

127
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,480
 different bacteria on each ball.

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
 What?

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
 No idea if that's a lot.

130
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
 I know, because it sounds like a lot.

131
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
 It does sound like a lot, isn't it?

132
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,440
 But then if you would have to lick the whole ball to get it in like, I don't know about you,

133
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,280
 but I never licked any of the balls when I was in my ball pit years.

134
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
 Yeah.

135
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
 But you never lived.

136
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 Would you make your ball pit?

137
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
 Yeah.

138
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
 They still have, they have adult ball pits.

139
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
 That's true.

140
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
 But I've never gone to one.

141
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
 There's one in London, the ball pit bar in London.

142
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
 Is it?

143
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,760
 It started off as a one month-only pop-up in Dullston in 2016 when it was so popular that

144
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,360
 they opened it full-time.

145
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,840
 It's called Bolly Bollison.

146
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,480
 And every single ball in this place is cleaned by a mechanical ball cleaner that can clean

147
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,800
 18,000 balls per hour.

148
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
 Wow.

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,640
 And that machine is called the Gobble Muffin.

150
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 Nice.

151
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
 Okay.

152
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,240
 So they've made it up.

153
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,480
 They've made the branding very mature and adult.

154
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
 It isn't.

155
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 Have you seen how the machines work?

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
 No.

157
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,160
 So I watched a video of a professional ball cleaning machine.

158
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,560
 And was it the Gobble Muffin or?

159
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
 It wasn't.

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
 This was a slower one, and I believe, but it's basically a great big vacuum tube and

161
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,040
 you suck up all the balls and then they get pushed into the sanitizing bath and then they

162
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,960
 get shoved into a drying machine and then they get blasted back out when they're all dry

163
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
 and nice again.

164
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
 It's as you would expect.

165
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,360
 But it feels like it would be fun to get sucked into that machine, doesn't it?

166
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
 Right.

167
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
 It does.

168
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
 It feels like quite a fun ride.

169
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
 If there was a giant ball pit somewhere where you have to go in one of the balls.

170
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
 Like a hamster.

171
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
 Exactly.

172
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
 Oh, yeah.

173
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
 That's very cool.

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,400
 Why didn't they just put a sign up saying don't shit in the ball pit?

175
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,320
 Well, not everyone can read.

176
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
 We'll cut read.

177
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,320
 If this is the adult ball pit, I understand the cleaning for kids who wants your grown-up.

178
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,240
 I don't think that the adults who go to Bolly Bollison are shitting in the ball pit.

179
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,280
 It's why you don't need to clean the balls.

180
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,640
 What's up with this new Fandall Ball machine?

181
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,480
 Well, don't try and put the Gobble Muffin out of a job.

182
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
 Sorry.

183
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,640
 So I was looking at the history of playgrounds generally and actually there was this really

184
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,880
 cool story a few years ago where the older swing in the world was found.

185
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
 Cool.

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,280
 And it was just in the bottom of someone's garden.

187
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,960
 So this was a wicksteed swing.

188
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,200
 So the guy who invented the swing was a guy called Charles Wicksteed.

189
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,600
 It was in Kettering in Northamptonshire and he made this playground and came up with

190
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
 a swing.

191
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,000
 And then they were looking for Wicksteed's old playground equipment and a random family

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,880
 who lived nearby said, well, we've got this kind of old looking swing at the bottom

193
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
 of our garden.

194
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
 Come and take a look.

195
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,760
 This is pro-so type for all of that and the kids were still using it.

196
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,520
 That's not the original kids.

197
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,760
 They were very old by that point, but they were still swinging.

198
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
 Too old.

199
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,520
 They were shitting again by that same.

200
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
 How cool is that?

201
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,080
 The creator of the swing and of the ball pit grew up when we were born, I guess, two hours

202
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,680
 drive from each other, Kettering and Sheffield.

203
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
 Yeah.

204
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,520
 It's just quite amazing that that bit of the world is.

205
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
 What?

206
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
 It's about two.

207
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
 Maybe less than two hours.

208
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
 I've looked at it on Google.

209
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
 Oh, did it?

210
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
 It's an hour-40 train ride.

211
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
 Straight one again.

212
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
 I'll be on one.

213
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
 OK.

214
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
 I find that astonishing.

215
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 We know who invented the swing.

216
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
 I don't think we do.

217
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,960
 Because I would have thought cavemen were on swings and probably dinosaurs.

218
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,960
 I think he definitely invented the hang on.

219
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,520
 I'm not even going to get into that.

220
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,040
 He invented the modern swing.

221
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
 He did.

222
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,080
 So it was a cop out, like the modern Olympics, you know?

223
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
 Yeah.

224
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,800
 And also, I'm always, you know, to put on my professional hat, no, my work hat.

225
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,720
 So when we say it's surprising, they're two hours apart from each other, it's not.

226
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,040
 Because I always think these things are so western bias and so English-speaking country

227
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
 bias.

228
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,280
 They probably had swings in the Netherlands or swit.

229
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,040
 They definitely had swings in China probably 7,000 years ago.

230
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
 Yes.

231
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
 No one made a swing, for instance.

232
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
 Did he?

233
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
 Do you have a ball pit?

234
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
 He did.

235
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
 He didn't make the ball pit, but he did.

236
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
 Another Englishman.

237
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
 Of course.

238
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
 Another Englishman.

239
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
 He did it right to swing for his kids.

240
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,520
 And it sounds like the coolest house ever, so he was a super fun dad.

241
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,200
 And he built himself with the help of a local carpenter.

242
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
 He recruited for the purpose.

243
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,280
 And he had a slide instead of stairs.

244
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,800
 So in Darwin's house, he went down a slide instead of the stairs.

245
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
 And then he had to throw it up.

246
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
 Yeah.

247
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 On the hook.

248
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
 You never could.

249
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
 So he started upstairs.

250
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 And then you never saw the upstairs again.

251
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 Okay.

252
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 Which is the same because the swing he erected was actually upstairs on the upstairs corridor.

253
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 Was it?

254
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 Yeah.

255
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 This is just to go back to Wixsteed.

256
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,280
 But there is a celebrity link to Wixsteed as a modern, quite famous person.

257
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
 Oh, you mean a descendant?

258
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
 No.

259
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
 No, no, no, no.

260
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,880
 I mean, a modern famous person got their break at gathering.

261
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
 Is it James A. Custer?

262
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
 Is it?

263
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 Yeah.

264
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
 He was the only person from Casper and Gecker.

265
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
 Think of him.

266
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 Yeah.

267
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
 He makes a big thing out of being from catering.

268
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
 And his very first job was at Wixsteed Park.

269
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
 Was it?

270
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,600
 And he's mentioned it because I think he did a TV show sort of like spoof documentary about

271
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
 his early life.

272
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,840
 And the manager of the park said, "We are proud that he worked it and what he has gone

273
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
 on to achieve.

274
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,120
 But if he ever wants to come back and help out serving at one of our outlets, he is more

275
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
 than welcome."

276
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
 Luck, showbiz.

277
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
 It's a difficult industry.

278
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
 You never know.

279
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
 It's true.

280
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
 Don't burn your bridges.

281
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:45,400
 I was reading that in Germany, Hitler's bunker right next to it where his body was cremated

282
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,720
 now sits a slide for children.

283
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,480
 There is a children's play area there, isn't it?

284
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
 Right over the spot.

285
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,480
 I think they were thinking of getting rid of it because they thought it was kind of inappropriate.

286
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 It feels a bit weird.

287
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
 Yeah.

288
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
 It's all the picture of it.

289
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 I mean, they don't have a sign up or a plaque.

290
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
 Do they?

291
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
 No.

292
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
 They have the slide.

293
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
 I think that's fine, Dan.

294
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
 What's fine?

295
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
 I think it's fine that there's a children's play area.

296
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,840
 It just looks a bit eerie when you know what happened on that spot.

297
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,040
 I mean, don't tell the kids.

298
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
 Like what?

299
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,960
 Dan, campaigning with a big board, a sandwich board, bubbling information.

300
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,040
 This is a Nazi playground.

301
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:24,040
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Chazinski.

302
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,840
 My fact this week is that bananas are considered such bad luck on fishing boats that many captains

303
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,400
 ban anyone on board from wearing banana boats sunscreen or clothes made by the company

304
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,160
 Fruit of the loom because their logo used to feature a banana.

305
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,960
 You can't have anything that's been near a banana anywhere near a fishing boat.

306
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
 That is so strange.

307
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 It's so weird.

308
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,840
 And if you go on sort of fisherman's blogs and chat forums, that's what you'll do.

309
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
 Yeah.

310
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,040
 Dan, they all say they all sort of exchange their tips and so a lot of them say.

311
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
 I'll sort of avoid bananas.

312
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
 Have avoid bananas.

313
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,160
 A lot of them say, you know, if you see someone with Fruit of the loom underwear or Fruit

314
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,280
 of the loom clothes, I think it's a makeup clothes isn't it?

315
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
 How are you seeing their underwear?

316
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,880
 Well, I reckon you would have to check everyone's underwear, wouldn't you?

317
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
 You do.

318
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,360
 And then you cut the labels out of the very least, but maybe just rip all the clothes off.

319
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,200
 If it's a sexy mode.

320
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
 Do we know?

321
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,040
 Anna, why do you think they weren't the lab bananas on?

322
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 There are probably more serious about that than anything.

323
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
 Strong claim.

324
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,120
 So it could be that I think probably the most likely is that bananas go rotten so far.

325
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,360
 So it dates back to like 1700s, they were considered bad luck and that was a time when the Caribbean

326
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,920
 was exporting a lot of bananas to continental America.

327
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,920
 And if you stop to go fishing, then the bananas spoiled.

328
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,720
 And we should say that the bad luck doesn't mean someone will die usually.

329
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,800
 It just means that you're not going to catch many fish that day.

330
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,880
 And so it's like banana spoiled.

331
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,440
 They also let off a really horrible smell when they're rotted and they make other fruit

332
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,720
 rot around them.

333
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,280
 But also there's a theory that they float when bodies don't.

334
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,760
 So if a ship sinks.

335
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,040
 They think all the sailors have turned into bananas.

336
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
 Yeah.

337
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
 It was a mystery for centuries.

338
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,720
 Anna, can I just pick you up?

339
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,520
 Bodies do float.

340
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
 Bodies do float.

341
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,840
 No, the bodies think of first, don't they?

342
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
 Mmm.

343
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,320
 I'm picturing Titanic.

344
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 Yeah.

345
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
 Yeah.

346
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
 Right.

347
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
 The movie or the movie?

348
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
 The movie.

349
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 Do you remember at the end with all the bananas floating?

350
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 Yeah.

351
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,120
 The door is covered in bananas, it's like, no, I'm sorry Jack, there's no room for you on

352
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
 the door.

353
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,640
 But he does sink, sorry, to use that as a--

354
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
 He does sink.

355
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
 Yeah.

356
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,640
 But it could be that he resurfaces later.

357
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
 Anyway, it's back up.

358
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
 Yeah.

359
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,800
 The point is it used to be that when people, when boats sank at sea, they were carrying

360
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,000
 lots of bananas because they were going to export them, then people would row out and

361
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,640
 try and save everyone, and they'd just be load of floating bananas.

362
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
 Mmm.

363
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,800
 And so they attributed the cause of the sinking to them for enough, some more theories.

364
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,720
 It could be that you get lots of spiders or snakes or something in your banana shipment,

365
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,680
 or it could be that crew members were slipping on the banana peels, and so obviously that

366
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
 was really bad luck.

367
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
 Yeah.

368
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
 Oh wow.

369
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
 It's definitely that.

370
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,120
 So do we have any more unlucky things?

371
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
 Yeah.

372
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,960
 You see, redheads are supposed to be unlucky, that is people with ginger hair.

373
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
 Yes.

374
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,200
 And some people say, according to One Maritime Museum, if you meet one before boarding

375
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,840
 your ship, the only way to mitigate the bad luck is to speak to them before they can speak

376
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
 to you.

377
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
 Wow.

378
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,400
 This sounds like a plot by redheads to get people talking to you.

379
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,440
 I read that whistling is bad luck, and then in the very same list, I read that whistling

380
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
 is good luck.

381
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,840
 So I'm not sure which one to believe.

382
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
 Hmm.

383
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,480
 I would say perhaps don't believe anything in that list.

384
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,160
 That's a good thought, yeah.

385
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,320
 But the reason for it being bad luck supposedly is that they use whistles as commands to each

386
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,920
 other, if you couldn't kind of shout, you couldn't really tell them what to do, you might

387
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,200
 do one whistle for this, two whistles for no.

388
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,520
 And so if you were just whistling a jaunty, sea shanty, then it might confuse people who

389
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,040
 didn't know whether to put their sails up or sails down.

390
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,760
 Albatrosses, famously bad luck for sailors.

391
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
 Yes.

392
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:22,240
 So not for Captain Cook, because he was around in the mid 18th century, and they only became

393
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,960
 bad luck in the end of the 18th century when the rhyme with the ancient mariner came out.

394
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,400
 So they weren't bad luck at all before that came out, and it was all because of that.

395
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,920
 And actually they could be good luck.

396
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,000
 So in 1881, there was a man who fell overboard from his boat, and there was an albatross in

397
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,840
 the water, a dead albatross, and he held onto it, and it kind of floated like a banana.

398
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,480
 If you can imagine that, and it kept him upright for all that time until someone came and

399
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
 collected him.

400
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,280
 So albatrosses can be good luck.

401
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
 That's amazing.

402
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
 Wow.

403
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
 Any banana stuff?

404
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
 Oh yeah.

405
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,240
 Well, I've been looking at banana shipping.

406
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
 Okay.

407
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,560
 So I didn't know this, but they have a kind of policy, because obviously they have to

408
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,400
 be shipped when they're green, they're cut off the tree when they're green, and then

409
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,160
 when they get to the port they're going to, they're sent into these special pressurised

410
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,280
 isolation rooms.

411
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,480
 Isolation rooms suggest there's only one in each room, but that can't be true.

412
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
 It's very expensive.

413
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
 It's amazing.

414
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
 That's so cheap.

415
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
 What do you think about it?

416
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
 Sorry.

417
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
 Yeah.

418
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,680
 They're going to these kind of forced ripening centers.

419
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,400
 And the air is pumped into the boxes of bananas so that they ripen at a consistent rate.

420
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,760
 And also ethylene, which is that chemical they give off.

421
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
 They get fake ethylene too.

422
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,920
 So they get them way more ripe.

423
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,160
 But it all happens once they've arrived.

424
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,040
 And they're a special banana scientist who control these rooms, and I read a great article

425
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,480
 on packer.com, which is all about packaging and packing and shipping.

426
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,160
 And apparently these specialists, they monitor the fruit like a mother hen waiting for it

427
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
 to turn.

428
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,480
 And then when it's ready, they say, right, it's ready for asda, and they're basically trying

429
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,640
 to trick the bananas into thinking that they're back in Ecuador or whatever they've come

430
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
 from.

431
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
 That's amazing.

432
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
 Yeah.

433
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,280
 And the rooms are even pressurised to have the same, like, I guess, air pressure as in

434
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
 Ecuador.

435
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,880
 And Mr. Detail, is this all happening on the boat, or is this once it lands?

436
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
 Once they've arrived.

437
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
 Right.

438
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
 Special rooms once they've arrived.

439
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
 Yeah.

440
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
 Cool.

441
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 And how do they test the inside part?

442
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
 When I've eaten a banana, has it been unpeeled?

443
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
 And it makes you covered 100 times.

444
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 It's a syringes that's gone in.

445
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
 You know sometimes you get a hole in your banana.

446
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
 Of course.

447
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
 It's a little air.

448
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
 And air pocket.

449
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
 Yeah, that's what it is.

450
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
 And that's what it is.

451
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
 You can squeeze a banana to feel the ripeness, can't you?

452
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
 Yeah.

453
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
 That's what I do.

454
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,480
 I imagine what happens is they take one banana, test the inside of it, throw that

455
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,760
 away and sell all the other ones.

456
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,360
 You should be in charge of banana in portals, because that's much cleverer.

457
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,720
 I just had my banana scientists hat on that.

458
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
 Yeah.

459
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
 That's so cool.

460
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,520
 Do you know mesc, the shipping firm?

461
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
 Yeah.

462
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
 Biggest shipping firm in the world.

463
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
 Sure.

464
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,080
 Biggest firm most people have never heard of, you know.

465
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,160
 But they have 270,000 refrigerated shipping containers, which is I think the largest fleet

466
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
 in the world, perhaps.

467
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
 By a long way, mesc.

468
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
 It's huge.

469
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 It's a vast majority.

470
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 So these are refrigerated.

471
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
 These are refrigerated.

472
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,240
 They get called reefers.

473
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,280
 And the bananas in there effectively have Wi-Fi, because there is data being taken all

474
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,840
 the time, remote technology in each of these refrigerated containers.

475
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,920
 And the company is tracking the power status, in case one of them stops being refrigerated.

476
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
 Uh-huh.

477
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,160
 And their temperature and their humidity, and it beams it up to a satellite.

478
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
 Yeah.

479
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,280
 So if there is a malfunction in a shipping container full of bananas in the middle of

480
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,160
 the ocean, mesc can find out about it and fix it before it arrives, and they've done

481
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
 that hundreds of times.

482
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,240
 I mean, I wouldn't say that that's a banana having Wi-Fi.

483
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,000
 They're not surfing the web, are they?

484
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,280
 Well, I'm sorry for trying to make it seem a little more interesting, but it won't.

485
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
 Cool.

486
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:56,320
 So there's a room with a bit of basic technology that most things have there.

487
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
 Okay.

488
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,560
 It is time for fact number three.

489
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,640
 And that is my fact. My fact this week is that Tim Berners-Lee originally wanted to call

490
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,760
 the World Wide Web the Information Mine, Tim, for short.

491
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
 Mmm.

492
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
 Yeah.

493
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
 So I learnt this fact.

494
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,560
 In fact, we all learnt this fact when we were in Geneva earlier this year, being taken

495
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,280
 on a tour of Surn by a really great guy called James Gillies, who's a scientist who writes

496
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,160
 a lot about Surn, who works out there.

497
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,360
 And that was one of the things he told us while we were out there looking.

498
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,000
 He said there were a bunch of names that Tim Berners-Lee was actually thinking he should call

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 it.

500
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 One was mine of information.

501
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,720
 The information mine was another one.

502
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,320
 The mesh was another one.

503
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
 Mine of information would have been, "Wah."

504
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,560
 I said, "So that's also about himself."

505
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
 Yes, exactly.

506
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
 Yeah.

507
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,080
 And so the reason he didn't go for the information mine is because he thought it would be

508
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,400
 immodest, or he just found a better name.

509
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
 Yeah.

510
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,600
 Most sites I've read say that it's because it seemed too egotistical.

511
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,440
 But I can't really see any source that says, "I thought he said that he did a Reddit."

512
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,920
 Yeah, I didn't see it on Reddit when I read the answer to that.

513
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
 Oh.

514
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,720
 Yeah, I sort of read that as someone below commenting on why he said he didn't go for it.

515
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,800
 But maybe I missed his proper comment on that.

516
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,720
 So did he, do we know why, why he did it?

517
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,800
 No, I personally, I couldn't get to the bottom of it.

518
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,040
 Do we know why he did go with worldwide web?

519
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,080
 I guess it's close to mesh, isn't it?

520
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,440
 I read that mesh would have been too similar to mess.

521
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
 Yeah.

522
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,120
 I thought it sounded a bit messy.

523
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,080
 Which would be quite fitting, not necessarily in derogatory way, but it is a huge mess, isn't

524
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
 it?

525
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
 Yeah.

526
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,400
 It's a huge mess of crap worldwide web.

527
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,480
 I think it was a start with that.

528
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,960
 But he did do this AMA, which was a very revealing of a lot of things.

529
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,320
 So there's been rumors for years and years that Era 4 of 4 came as a result of there being

530
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,640
 a room called Room 4 of 4 in the office that he was working at.

531
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,200
 And he said, "No, that's absolute nonsense, not true at all."

532
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,080
 He was asked, "Is there one thing you never thought the internet would be used for,

533
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,560
 but has become one of the main reasons that people do use it."

534
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,840
 And his one word answer was kittens.

535
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,560
 So he did give some quite fun answers in this thing.

536
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,360
 The kittens thing is weird, because the internet, which is different to the worldwide web, was

537
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
 almost called the catanet.

538
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
 Was it really?

539
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
 It was.

540
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,120
 Again, how perfect would that have been?

541
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
 It was awesome.

542
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,640
 So the catanet was, this is in 1974, and an internet pioneer, Louis Pousart wrote this

543
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,560
 paper where he coined the term catanet, and he said it's going to be a network of

544
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
 networks.

545
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,440
 And he said, "I bet the world will adopt this."

546
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,040
 And he essentially described the internet, said it should be called the catanet, and people

547
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,120
 used that for the internet until the 80s.

548
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,560
 And then they changed it to the internet, and we should probably go back to the catanet

549
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,800
 given how it's evolved, or the pornanet, but it's harder to say.

550
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,400
 So the web, originally, was not meant to be read only.

551
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,880
 So Tim Berners-Lee, when he first built it, it made it.

552
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,600
 He wanted it to be an interactive thing, so everyone can edit it.

553
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,720
 And the only reason is read only, so you're going to a website, you can't just make changes

554
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
 to the website.

555
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,760
 He wanted it to be Wikipedia, basically, is what you mean.

556
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,240
 He wanted it to be every site to be Wikipedia.

557
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,680
 But more so than that, you know, might go into a Word document, like everyone's Wikipedia,

558
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,040
 there's a process to go through, I guess.

559
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
 Oh, I see.

560
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,080
 So like a Google Doc, basically, a shared Google Doc.

561
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,080
 So you might go on to BBC News, and you could just change Boris Johnson's name to Trevor

562
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
 McDonald, if you wanted to.

563
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
 Yeah.

564
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,960
 I don't know why that's the first thing that came into my head.

565
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
 So weird.

566
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,360
 So many insults you could have come up with.

567
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,000
 You were lost to the protest on the street.

568
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,080
 I was thinking, what's you going to go with?

569
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
 I bet it's going to be really rude.

570
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,280
 I'm really, really going to get him.

571
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,160
 I was thinking of what's the most confusing thing you've got out there.

572
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
 I know.

573
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
 I know.

574
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
 Why is Trevor McDonald private as well in a sudden?

575
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
 That's like Eddie says.

576
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,960
 I'm now just thinking, I wonder what Trevor McDonald's up to.

577
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
 I haven't heard from him in years.

578
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
 Well, he's retired.

579
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
 He's pretty elderly now.

580
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
 Yeah, but what's he doing?

581
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
 Where is he?

582
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,240
 He's out negotiating with Europe.

583
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:56,840
 So why didn't, why didn't that obviously insane idea come to fruition?

584
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,520
 It wasn't for any reasons like it being obviously insane.

585
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,520
 It was just that logistically, practically, it was too difficult to get it done, the coding

586
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,960
 and the organisation of it.

587
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,760
 So it was like, oh, so it is easier to make it a redone.

588
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,800
 And actually, you could argue that's why the internet's gotten to all the trouble that

589
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,320
 it has because it means that all these big companies have power over it, whereas we can't

590
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
 all interact actively.

591
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
 It could have been such a different thing.

592
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
 Yeah.

593
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,000
 The worldwide Google doc.

594
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Yeah.

595
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 It's so cool.

596
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,760
 And it's so weird that we're calling it worldwide Google doc.

597
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,800
 Given that Google is obviously one of the things that's benefited from this huge monopoly

598
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 the companies have.

599
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 Anyway.

600
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,240
 I was looking into the earliest transaction, digital transaction.

601
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,920
 So digital money for a product.

602
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,600
 There's quite a few competing theories about what it was, no one's quite tracked it down,

603
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,240
 but one of the leading ones is that in 1971 and 1972, the first transaction, so between

604
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,280
 that time, a first transaction was made and it was between students at Stanford University

605
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,320
 and MIT and they were selling weed to each other.

606
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
 Cool.

607
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,400
 So the first transaction potentially was a drug deal.

608
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
 Yeah.

609
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
 Sorry, I just said cool.

610
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
 Like, wanting to be cool.

611
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
 Brilliant.

612
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
 Cool, dude.

613
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

614
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
 I know.

615
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 Yeah.

616
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,360
 Got one in my bag right now.

617
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 Okay.

618
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,960
 Because there was a lady earlier who dordered something by telephone, but that didn't count

619
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,840
 because she paid in cash when it was delivered to her door.

620
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,000
 She predates that, but this is the first digital money transaction.

621
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Very cool.

622
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I don't think it is cool.

623
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 It's not cool.

624
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It's not cool.

625
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 As a cop, I can confirm it's not cool.

626
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,440
 I'm just going to put my cop's hat on it.

627
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
 Haha.

628
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,200
 Two of you are wearing hats right now.

629
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,640
 To have a James of wearing their hats right now.

630
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
 Yeah.

631
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
 It's a new thing.

632
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
 We're in different kinds of hats.

633
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
 Yeah.

634
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,560
 You're from different eras by judging by the hat.

635
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,760
 We're not even going to say what the hat's on.

636
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,080
 We're just going to let you, if you send a drawing in of the hats, you think Dan and James

637
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
 are wearing at the moment.

638
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,360
 Whoever gets closest will win a small prize.

639
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,160
 Seven and two.

640
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
 Andrew Hansen-Murray.

641
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
 Two.

642
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
 Oh.

643
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,160
 I don't even get a try-corn.

644
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
 Do you like that?

645
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,320
 I don't really think that Ku Klux Klan hat is very appropriate.

646
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
 Oh, dear.

647
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,800
 I hope you take that off before you go to the soft play area.

648
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
 Haha.

649
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,480
 I found sort of a precursor to the World Wide Web, or in fact Wikipedia, which was the

650
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,200
 Mondanium, which I can't believe I've never read about.

651
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,440
 But this was a thing that was created in 1910.

652
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,280
 And it was after this initiative from 1895 of two Belgian lawyers called Paul Octlet and

653
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,480
 Henry Lafontaine.

654
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,120
 And they wanted to create what they were called a world palace, basically all the world's

655
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,360
 knowledge and information.

656
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,000
 They wanted to catalog it.

657
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And so they started doing this.

658
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,320
 And it was in the Palais Mondiales, so the palace of the world, they think in Brussels.

659
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,920
 And they got up to 12 million index cards.

660
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,160
 So as a sort of side effect of this, he also invented the index.

661
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
 No.

662
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
 Yeah.

663
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,760
 And 12 million index cards, 12 of information.

664
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,800
 And it was sitting there in Brussels for decades.

665
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
 And then of course.

666
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,440
 So it's just in a big room.

667
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,680
 And there's loads of filing cabinets with index cards, which has all the information in

668
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
 the world.

669
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
 Yeah.

670
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
 Wow.

671
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
 It's impressive, isn't it?

672
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
 Just two of them probably had a few secretaries.

673
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
 That's amazing.

674
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
 That's incredible.

675
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
 Is it still around?

676
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
 Is it still accessible?

677
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
 Irritatingly.

678
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
 And I know they always ruin everything.

679
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,880
 But in 1940, the Nazis rocked up, and the Third Reich replaced it with a bunch of Third

680
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,480
 Reich art.

681
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,120
 And some of it was left over, most of it we don't know where it's gone.

682
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
 Oh.

683
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
 Yeah.

684
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
 I know that was bastards.

685
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,080
 It's always a response to the Nazis doing something.

686
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
 Oh, God.

687
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
 That's sick.

688
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,120
 I'm going to stop going to that child's play area in Berlin.

689
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,120
 All his birthday.

690
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
 Yeah.

691
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
 The outfit.

692
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:53,600
 Look, Dan's the one in the hood.

693
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:03,320
 OK, it is time for a final fact of the show, and that is James.

694
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,520
 OK, my fact this week is that the first non-use of the word "beland" to refer to a person

695
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,080
 was for the entire 1992 West Bromwich LVN football team.

696
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
 Amazing.

697
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,080
 I mean, what a fact.

698
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
 Yeah.

699
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,880
 What a bunch of "beland".

700
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,880
 So the word "beland", one of the first uses was the flaired end of a trumpet or other wind

701
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:34,280
 instrument opposite to the mouthpiece, and that's from 1826, and then in 1819 it meant the enclosed

702
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,640
 extension from the main living space of a tent, especially one with a rounded shape.

703
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
 That was in 1819.

704
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:48,120
 That was in 1919, sorry if I said 18, and then 1961 it became referring to the penis.

705
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,960
 And then in 1992, someone was on a use net news group on the 28th of September, and said,

706
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:03,040
 "Perhaps you are referring to that infamous collection of "beland" known as WBA win-bug-a-all."

707
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,920
 They were insulting West Brom, but it was a bit harsh because they looked at their results

708
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,440
 around this time, and there had been nine games that season, and they'd won seven, drawn

709
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,560
 one, and lost one, and they got promoted at the end of the season.

710
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
 Oh, wow.

711
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,680
 A bunch of bad luck.

712
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,320
 Interesting fact, the man who wrote that comment was Tim Berners-Lee, who was the whole reason

713
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,280
 he had invented the WBA win-bug.

714
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,640
 Oh, there you go.

715
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,040
 It's a very British insult, isn't it?

716
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,720
 I don't think it gets used in America.

717
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
 No, no.

718
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
 No, it shouldn't think so.

719
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
 No.

720
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,960
 It had synonyms, so when it became used for the end of the penis in 1961, as you said, in

721
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,000
 the dictionary of slang and unconventional English, then it was synonymous with a blond

722
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,720
 end and red end, which have fallen out of use, but we could bring back.

723
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
 Bluntend.

724
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
 Well, a bunch of blond ends.

725
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,720
 But you don't have a sharp end at the other end of the penis?

726
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,760
 Well, maybe you should see someone around that.

727
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,360
 I don't have two ends.

728
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,800
 Oh, you really should see someone around that.

729
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,160
 There's only one other word in the Oxford English Dictionary, whose first citation references

730
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,800
 West Bromwich, L.D., and football club, and that is the word "maximum", referring to

731
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,980
 someone who scores lots of goals in a football team.

732
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,640
 It says West Bromwich, L.D., and are largely relying on James Cuxen, the marksman of Chesterfield.

733
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,960
 There you go.

734
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
 That is great.

735
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,840
 Who knew they were such a hotbed of neologisms in West Bromwich, L.D., and I looked at Birmingham

736
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,480
 City Football Club and asked a villa football club who were both similar local teams, and

737
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
 they don't have a single one.

738
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
 Wow.

739
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,000
 So West Bromwich, there's Shakespeare at our time over there.

740
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,680
 One insult that is in the Oxford English Dictionary that has a fantastic reference or citation

741
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,760
 of, quote, is "dickweed".

742
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,520
 And "dickweed" is a word that got popularised in Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.

743
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,320
 So they use a quote from that movie in the Oxford English Dictionary, and it's a word

744
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,480
 that I grew up with because I love that movie and used to be, used to call people a "dickweed",

745
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,960
 but I didn't know what "dickweed" actually meant, and it's pubic hair.

746
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,760
 I just had, I'd not put, like, connection together.

747
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,440
 Do you think it's play on the word "duckweed"?

748
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,360
 Which is, like, a type of plant you get in a pond.

749
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
 Is it?

750
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
 Okay.

751
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
 No, do you think it is?

752
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,200
 I don't think he was stating that it was, and I doubt that they'd thought about it to

753
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
 that extent.

754
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,880
 Oh, I reckon it might be, though, because it's not a common word, but it's reasonably

755
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
 common.

756
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
 Are you "duckweed"?

757
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
 Are you "dickweed"?

758
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
 No.

759
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
 I think that's plausible.

760
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
 I'm not saying it's totally impossible.

761
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
 I just think it's one of those "unknowables".

762
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,600
 There will never be a smoking gun on this.

763
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,520
 And "bellend" is also a village, and that is, coincidentally, only 10 miles from West

764
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
 Bromwich Albion's football ground.

765
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,960
 And I think, as far as I can tell, that West Bromwich Albion is the closest English football

766
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,880
 team to the village of "bellend".

767
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
 No way.

768
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
 I believe so.

769
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
 That is insane.

770
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,720
 It's close, but I think it is.

771
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,160
 Oh, that's much better than my two-hour journey from Kettering to Shaffield.

772
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,560
 I wonder if the person who knows, I wonder if the person who wrote that comment online,

773
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,720
 in 1992, knows that they have other first use of a word recorded in language.

774
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,920
 No, and of course, it's hard to imagine that he made it up, right?

775
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
 Right.

776
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,200
 I think it feels like lots of people are saying it, but it's just the first written

777
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
 out.

778
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
 Yeah, because there weren't many.

779
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,800
 It wasn't mentioned in newspapers much.

780
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 No.

781
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,080
 I've been in private correspondence, maybe in Churchill's letters, you're right, to someone

782
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
 else.

783
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
 Heller is such a bellend.

784
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,400
 Well, even though they did the "Mondanium", Michael flatly fits into the bellend's story

785
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
 as well.

786
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,280
 I think we might have mentioned this in the book of the first-ever book of the year.

787
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
 Okay.

788
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
 Can you explain who he is for?

789
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 Oh, of course.

790
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,160
 So, sorry, Michael flatly, the father of "revidance", Irish dance, not the father, one

791
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,880
 of his descendants, but he's an Irish dancer and performer.

792
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,080
 And you know, the big thing with a line-up and they all dance.

793
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
 He's very famous for that.

794
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,960
 He's called him "Lord of the Dance".

795
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,600
 And he said in late 2016 that he would perform at Donald Trump's inauguration, and as a result

796
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,240
 of that, someone redirected the website colossalbellend.com so that when you type that in, it went to

797
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,560
 Michael flatly's website.

798
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
 Yeah.

799
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
 That's very good.

800
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
 But it's amazing.

801
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,720
 Bell was used to mean penis in 1593.

802
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
 Yes.

803
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,160
 That's the first use of bell to mean penis, and that's from Jonathan Green's Dictionary

804
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,000
 of Flang, and it refers to a young man wagging his bobble and bringing his bell, and it's clearly

805
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 a knob gag.

806
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,280
 And yet it took so long for us to really embrace it.

807
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,120
 Well, just for bell to become bell-end, and then for that to become a personal thing.

808
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
 Yeah.

809
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,360
 That was in a, what sounds like a great book called "The Passion of Maurice".

810
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
 What?

811
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,600
 That's like someone's penpal.

812
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:55,640
 I love "The Passion of Maurice". I'm waggling my bobble as I think.

813
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,240
 You've got a martial art sort of penpal, so you've had a child.

814
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,720
 Why were considerably table stuff?

815
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,240
 But he got pickpocketed in the story as he was doing that, so let this be a lesson to all

816
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
 men.

817
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
 What?

818
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
 He fancied this woman in the story.

819
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,720
 I assumed the character "The Passion of Maurice", and he said he was very pleased by her,

820
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,600
 and he showed this with wagging his bobble and bringing his bell while she picked his pocket

821
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,240
 and cut his purse.

822
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,440
 So if you will get your willy out and start publicly wanking, you will be pickpocketed.

823
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
 Why?

824
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
 Is the moral of that story?

825
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,560
 What a bold time to pickpocket someone.

826
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,320
 You'd be catered to the pickpocket, is.

827
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,320
 I suppose if you're taking your trousers off to waggle it, then actually it is easier to

828
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,920
 pickpocket someone, isn't it?

829
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,600
 I don't think you'd fully, I think it's a weird, I think it's a weird fashion, who fully

830
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,320
 takes off the trousers, folds them up and puts them on in there, but I see, it's on the train.

831
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,760
 Flashes are a weird, barn-shielding element.

832
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,080
 I'm not saying they're not, but they're saying that would require a very organised, flashing

833
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
 mentality.

834
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,440
 And we're going to have to wrap up shortly.

835
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,320
 Yep, just a couple of older bits of insult.

836
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,600
 This is from a classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue, which was published in 1785,

837
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,960
 and you can get it online, and some really good ones, I like in there, are, what to be

838
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,320
 dicked in the knob, is.

839
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,640
 I don't think you need to tell us about that.

840
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
 That could mean anything, couldn't it?

841
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,200
 It just means silly, guys, it just means you're a silly, silly dicked in the knob, dicked

842
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
 in the knob.

843
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
 It's a knob-meaning head.

844
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
 Yes, believe so.

845
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,400
 So, Dickey has in something's gone wrong.

846
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,040
 You could also say that somebody is Captain Queer Nabs, and that's if they are an ill-dressed

847
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
 or shabby fellow.

848
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
 Oh, okay.

849
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,280
 Or, if you're, this isn't really an insult, it's just, if you're surprised or confounded,

850
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,560
 you are betwattled.

851
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,000
 That's great, we should bring that back.

852
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Yeah.

853
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Definitely so.

854
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,460
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts.

855
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,800
