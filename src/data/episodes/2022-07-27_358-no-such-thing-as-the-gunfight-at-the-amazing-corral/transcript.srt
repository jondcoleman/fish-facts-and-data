00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,320
 four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,960
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,040
 Starting with fact number one and that is James. Okay, my fact this week, embrace yourselves people,

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,320
 is that founding father of the United States of America, Governor Morris, died after sticking a

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,240
 whale bone into his own penis. I mean, you would expect that you might die after sticking it to

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,080
 someone else's penis because they would be so angry with you. Yeah. He did it to himself. He did it to

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,600
 himself. It's quite a sad story. It's quite a funny story, James. It's quite funny. Yeah, I mean,

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:15,200
 was this the asphyxia wank of the 1870s? It wasn't that. Basically. The great opening with this fact

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,880
 immediately. Okay, so basically, first of all, Governor Morris, you might know him if you've

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,880
 never heard his name said as Gouverneur Morris, because that's how his first name is pronounced,

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,520
 but he was a big deal. He was known as the pen man of the Constitution. He signed the articles of

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,480
 the Confederation and the Constitution. He helped plan the Erie Canal. He helped lay out the streets

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:47,200
 of Manhattan. Here's a real proper big deal in the early United States, but he had some problem

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,080
 with his urinary tract. We don't know exactly what it was. It could have been just a UTI urinary

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,840
 tract infection. It could have been something more serious, but whatever it was, he decided

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,880
 to self-medicate and try and clear the blockage in his penis. What are you going to do that with?

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,520
 Obviously, with a whale bone. When I say a whale bone, I don't mean like the backbone of a blue

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,400
 whale or something like that. It was a kind of almost like an early plastic, which was taken

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,440
 from the Baleen of Wales. It could have been like the ear of a pair of spectacles or the

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
 handle of a knife or something. All that stuff was made out of whale bone. Anyway, he took a

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,600
 piece of this, put it in his penis, gave himself a very even worse infection, and eventually died

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,920
 of said infection. Such a shame. I really hope that the day before he did this, he was having

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,320
 a chat with friends going, "What do you think in like 200, 300 years they're going to remember me?"

27
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,640
 Imagine a podcast as a fact about me. What do you think that's going to be?

28
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,920
 It's so unfair because he's one of the most interesting people. He's one of the most

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,080
 interesting founding fathers, I think. There's so much amazing stuff about him. Yet, I think this

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,080
 is the only thing holding it back from him having a big budget musical about him. It should have

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,080
 been Morris instead of Hamilton. I don't really want to see the final part of that musical.

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
 Hamilton was so clever to get into and die of that rather than the whale bone thing.

33
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,280
 So, this was a guy. He was very, like Andy says, an extremely crazy character of the late 18th century.

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,440
 He's quite letharious, wasn't he, as well, which is something that comes up as much as

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
 his sort of political achievements. The fact that- But less than the whale bone of the penis.

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,840
 That's the ranking order, yeah. Whale bone penis, penmanship of the Constitution,

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,080
 likes to kiss ladies a lot. That's the order. Yeah, he had a lot of

38
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,200
 injuries that were supposedly connected to his womanizing. He had a peg leg, for example,

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,800
 later on in life, and that was a result supposedly of him trying to escape a furious

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,880
 husband. That's a rumor, but it comes up a lot. I think it's not true. Yeah, I agree. I think it's

41
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,600
 not true. He did have a carriage accident and he lost the leg in that. And it's a really tragic

42
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,800
 story. That's the bit I assumed you believed, Andy. I didn't think it was the husband running away.

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,560
 No, but he clearly did do a lot of running away from husbands in his time. But he was taking

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,240
 the reins of a carriage in New York. I think it was in New York, maybe it was elsewhere.

45
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,320
 He was taking the reins of a carriage and the horse is bolted and his leg was broken in several

46
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,960
 places. And then his regular doctor wasn't available. And the doctor, they got in and said,

47
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,880
 "Well, we'll have to amputate this below the knee." And so they did. And then his real doctor,

48
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,240
 his regular doctor, came back and said, "Oh, we could absolutely have saved your leg."

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You can see why he started self-medicating later in life, can't you?

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,120
 But he was okay with the leg amputation. In fact, I think that he might have been happy about it,

51
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,520
 because it really cemented his reputation as a bit of a character. And even at the time,

52
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,640
 a friend visited him the day after he'd had it off and hasn't had the leg off.

53
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,440
 Well, that's probably where the rumor started, actually. They were like, "What happened with

54
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,520
 your leg?" He said, "Oh, I had it off." They're like, "Oh, really?" His friend was trying to do the

55
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,360
 good thing of telling him the advantages of his situation, saying, "Look, with one leg, you're

56
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,760
 going to build up such great strength of character. It's a great challenge to have to overcome in

57
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,800
 life. You'll be a better man for it." And Morris immediately said, "You argue the matter so handsomely

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,040
 and point out so clearly the advantages of being without legs that I am tempted to part with the

59
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,520
 other." So he took it in good humor. Didn't he still also use it in battle?

60
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,040
 Really? No. Did he? Yeah. I think this is another story. Go on. This is another story that he used

61
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,600
 to beat off revolutionaries with his peg leg, again, a good off. Beat off is another thing where he

62
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:49,440
 was a secretary. I think that there was one incident where he was posted to Paris by Washington,

63
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,480
 and it was around about the time when there were quite a lot of revolutionaries on the streets of

64
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,240
 Paris. And they said, "Don't come out in your carriages." And he'd come out in his carriage

65
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,360
 anyway, and they descended on his carriage one time. And apparently, he said that he stuck his

66
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,800
 wooden leg out the window and said something like, "Oh, look, I've got this fighting for freedom too,

67
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,920
 so lay off." And they did. Yeah. They were shouting, "He's an aristocrat. He's an aristocrat because

68
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,920
 he's in a lovely carriage." And then he shouted, "Yes, truly, one who lost his leg in the cause of

69
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,280
 liberty." And he kind of brandished his wooden leg at them. But there's another version of the

70
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
 story where he just pulled off his leg and shoved it out of the window to distract the

71
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
 crowd. And they all started chasing off the bloke over the carriage.

72
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,960
 Like one of those lizards that kind of got soft at the end of their tail.

73
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,880
 Wow. As a two-year-old, he was sold for $600,000. What? Really?

74
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
 I'm joking. That's a racehorse also called Governor Morris, which...

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,200
 There aren't many Governor Morrisers, are there? I mean, Governor itself,

76
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,560
 not a very popular name, "governure". It was actually his mother's maiden name,

77
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,760
 and it's what's morphed in to be "governor" today. The spelling has turned into our modern-day

78
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,920
 spelling of "governor". But I did outside of your racehorse, Andy. I found one other Governor

79
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,920
 Morris, which was a novelist, Governor Morris IV, who was actually a descendant of Governor Morrisers.

80
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,520
 And he wrote a bunch of novels. And his novels were often adapted into movies,

81
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,480
 including one called "The Penalty", which was released in 1920. And it was about a legless man

82
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,880
 and starred Lon Shady, a good friend. You're joking.

83
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,480
 No. The descendant of Governor Morris. Yeah, I wrote a Lon Shady legless movie,

84
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,840
 as referenced in last week's episode. In that film, then, he plays a man with no legs,

85
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,880
 whose legs were unnecessarily amputated, just like that of Governor Morris.

86
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
 It feels like they didn't use much imagination for the plot of this film.

87
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,280
 They just basically looked into the family history of one of their lead men.

88
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,920
 I think they had a punch on for weird names, because one of his brothers was called "Stat".

89
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,320
 Okay. How many A's do you spell that?

90
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,040
 Okay. It's only a double A. But how do you pronounce a double A? It's S-T-Double-A-T-S.

91
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,880
 Governor Morris' wife's middle name was Gary. Do you know why?

92
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,240
 You know what? I thought that. And I read somewhere that she was called Gary.

93
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
 But then, I just doubted myself and quickly googled it. And on Wikipedia,

94
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,400
 she's called Anne Gary, C-A-R-Y Morris. I read Gary in a few places.

95
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,720
 That was a big scandal as well, because she was his housekeeper,

96
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
 and she was a fair bit younger than him, 22 years younger than him.

97
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,880
 And he wrote in his diary. He had an amazingly naughty diary,

98
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
 where he wrote all sorts of rude things that he'd been up to.

99
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,920
 He said, "I married this day Anne Gary Randolph. No small surprise to my guests."

100
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,600
 So, he clearly liked causing a fuss.

101
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,640
 Well, because he genuinely did surprise them with it as a Christmas present.

102
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,960
 I think he invited all his family around for Christmas dinner, as you do.

103
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,720
 And then, in the middle of it, called a vicarin, whatever,

104
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
 got someone to, you know, had planned in advance called a vicarin,

105
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,200
 and gotten to marry them, got him to marry them in front of everyone.

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,840
 So, I think it was quite a surprise. Not what you'd expect.

107
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,760
 Well, it would have been surprised when they said,

108
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,360
 "Do you Anne Gary Randolph?" It's like that episode of Only Fools and Horses,

109
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,400
 when they find out that Rodney's middle name is whatever it is,

110
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,160
 Charlton or Crystal Palace or whatever it is.

111
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,040
 We should say that part of the reason she was controversial,

112
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,960
 as well as being his housekeeper, is that she was thought to have killed her baby.

113
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,240
 There were sort of two things. There was the housekeeper thing,

114
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
 and there was the, "Did you kill your baby thing?"

115
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,280
 Was earlier in her life.

116
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,440
 She married her brother-in-law, hadn't she?

117
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,360
 Oh, no, she'd had an affair with her brother-in-law.

118
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
 Allegedly.

119
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,240
 Allegedly. And the baby supposedly, allegedly, came from that affair,

120
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,360
 and she was allegedly so embarrassed that she killed the baby,

121
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
 but she said it was still both.

122
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,520
 Allegedly.

123
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:49,920
 Yes.

124
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,400
 Allegedly.

125
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
 But she was from a bizarre family, by which I mean,

126
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,560
 her family estate was called bizarre.

127
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,200
 Brilliant. Brilliant.

128
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,520
 That's great, because we don't have to say allegedly for that bit.

129
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,480
 They can't sue us.

130
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,440
 No, they can't. It's just a place called bizarre.

131
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
 It's in Virginia.

132
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
 Just, I mean, just on this guy's actual career,

133
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
 which we probably should touch on briefly,

134
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
 because it was unbelievably successful.

135
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,480
 And obviously, as James said, he was incredibly influential.

136
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,960
 One of the things he did was, he came up with the phrase,

137
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,560
 "We the people of the United States."

138
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,280
 And this was in an early draft of, is it the Declaration?

139
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,640
 It's the Constitution.

140
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,680
 The Constitution, sorry.

141
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,360
 So that was in the Constitution, and the phrase,

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,800
 "We the people of the United States."

143
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,560
 In an earlier draft, it was,

144
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
 "We the people of the States of New Hampshire,

145
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,

146
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
 Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,

147
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,280
 Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,

148
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,840
 and Georgia."

149
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,480
 And he said, "I think we've got an edit in here."

150
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,040
 And he came up with that lovely phrase.

151
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,520
 And this is claimed to have been an absolute stroke of genius,

152
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,920
 and does make me think that we're bringing him up too much,

153
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,160
 because I reckon I could have come up with that edit.

154
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,240
 And he left a bunch of spelling mistakes in the actual document.

155
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,200
 There was a Pennsylvania, it was spelled with one N,

156
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
 which apparently sometimes it could be seen to be

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,960
 spelled like that back in the day, but not really very often.

158
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,480
 Well, which two Ns did they remove from Pennsylvania then?

159
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,960
 Sorry, it was Pennsylvania, in fact.

160
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,360
 Got it.

161
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,520
 No, it was, sorry, it was spelled with two Ns,

162
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,960
 but without the double.

163
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,040
 And even worse, there was a sentence in the Constitution

164
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,320
 that said the fragment is necessary for executing its inspection laws,

165
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,520
 and there was an apostrophe between the T and the S of it,

166
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,840
 the possessive it.

167
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,960
 On the Declaration of Independence, slightly different,

168
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,800
 but around the same time, of course,

169
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
 it's signed by the Founding Fathers,

170
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,080
 signed by one woman, or one woman's name was on there.

171
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,760
 Do you know who that might be?

172
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,560
 Gary.

173
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:52,960
 Gary.

174
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,920
 That's how she got away with it.

175
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,080
 Everyone was like, well, Gary's obviously a man's name.

176
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,320
 Who is it?

177
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,480
 It's Mary Catherine Goddard, and the reason she got on there

178
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
 is because she owned a publishing house in Baltimore,

179
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,920
 and she printed out the Declaration of Independence.

180
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
 And at the very, very bottom, it says printed by Mary Catherine Goddard.

181
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
 So there is a woman's name on the Declaration of Independence.

182
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
 And you might think, okay, well, that's a bit of a cheat,

183
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,560
 and I suppose it kind of is.

184
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,920
 But by doing that, basically, she opened herself up to trees

185
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,280
 and charges and stuff like that.

186
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,400
 So it would have been very easy for her to not put her name on there,

187
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,240
 but she saw it was such an important document

188
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
 that she thought she should be on there.

189
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,400
 It was kind of cool.

190
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:34,880
 Very cool.

191
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,000
 There's a very famous statue that people are probably familiar with

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,560
 that is mostly Governor Morris, and that is the--

193
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
 Is it the statue of Long John Silver?

194
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,720
 Is it the whale at the Natural History Museum?

195
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
 Oh, no.

196
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
 That wasn't most of him.

197
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,080
 His penis didn't take up most of his body.

198
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,600
 But he was very large, very tall, and a lot of people have commented

199
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
 that the Founding Fathers, many of them are quite short and rotund,

200
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,440
 and that's partly because they drank in a huge amount

201
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
 while they were writing the Constitution.

202
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,800
 And he was tall and slim, much like Washington.

203
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,640
 So when the great French sculptor, Houdon,

204
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,200
 was commissioned to do a sculpture of Washington,

205
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,120
 which is the very famous one that's now--

206
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
 It's in the state capital of Virginia.

207
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,400
 It's copied sort of everywhere.

208
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
 It's like he's got his hand on a pillar,

209
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,520
 and then another hand on a stick.

210
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,960
 That's Washington's head, but it's Governor Morris's body.

211
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,360
 And this is--

212
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,720
 Yeah, the sculptor popped over from France to DC,

213
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,680
 took lots of mass of Washington's face,

214
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,840
 took a lot of eye photographs of his body.

215
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 But then when he went back to France,

216
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,240
 he realized that Morris was in France as well,

217
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
 so he called him around to his house and said,

218
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,680
 "Can I use your body as the model for my statue?"

219
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,920
 Wow, can I ask whose leg it is?

220
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,720
 Like, is it his wife's leg?

221
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
 I think maybe it's Gary's leg, and if you look at it,

222
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,880
 it's the extremely spelt kind of woman's leg,

223
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,280
 and then a big man's body, and then Washington's head.

224
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,520
 Well, if you do look at it, one leg is longer than the other,

225
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,000
 and that's why, because he dressed him up in Washington's clothes,

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
 but his wooden leg had to extend to the length of a shoe,

227
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,320
 so he wouldn't wear a shoe over his leg,

228
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,560
 so his leg was a bit longer than a normal leg.

229
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,160
 So if you look at the statue,

230
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,960
 the left leg is a little bit longer than the right leg,

231
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,880
 because his leg was longer than the other leg.

232
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
 That's a great fact.

233
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
 That's extraordinary.

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,520
 That's a pretty crap artist as well,

235
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,200
 who couldn't chisel the way to make sure the legs were the right leg.

236
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,440
 You can't fake it.

237
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
 He was a realist.

238
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,120
 So one reason for Governor Morris's death

239
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,000
 could have been the French Revolution in a slightly strange way,

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,840
 and that is because when the French Revolution happened,

241
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,600
 everyone stopped wearing really posh aristocratic clothes,

242
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,040
 because as we said before,

243
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,720
 you probably get dragged out of your carriage

244
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,280
 and beaten to death, probably, or guillotined or something.

245
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,200
 These kind of big dresses that women wore had a lot of whalebone in them,

246
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,160
 and so when the fashion industry in France collapsed,

247
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,480
 they had all this spare whalebone,

248
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
 and the price absolutely plummeted.

249
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,920
 So it was something that you used to not be able to get very easily,

250
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
 and then suddenly you can get it anywhere for any price,

251
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,400
 and the result of that was this was a really useful material to use,

252
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,560
 and so they started using it in everything,

253
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,600
 and so you would have whalebone umbrellas and whalebone,

254
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,840
 like I said before, knives and spectacles and whatever,

255
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,760
 and so it was because of the French Revolution

256
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,400
 that you had so much whalebone in his house,

257
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,520
 which meant, I mean,

258
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,920
 maybe he would have found something else to stick up his well with that.

259
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,240
 It was because of the revolution that you had this whalebone to hand.

260
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,760
 I mean, amazingly, a torturous link.

261
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,360
 They got him in the end after he escaped that carriage incident.

262
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
 I knew they'd get him eventually.

263
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,400
 Did whalebone-related penis nests rocket during that period

264
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,160
 when it became widely available?

265
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,760
 I think it probably did, yeah.

266
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,720
 I think we should say he had stuck something up his penis before,

267
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
 so we can't exclusively blame the whale.

268
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,520
 He had foam.

269
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
 Yeah, foam.

270
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,280
 He made a catheter once with a flexible piece of hickory.

271
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
 Hickory dickory cock.

272
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:33,840
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

273
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,320
 My fact this week is that before entering a town in the wild west,

274
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
 you had to leave your gun outside, pick up a token,

275
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
 and use that token to collect your gun on the way out,

276
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
 but slightly leaving your coat in a bar.

277
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
 Very sensible.

278
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,120
 Wait a minute.

279
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,840
 Did they know I've seen lots of wild west movies

280
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,360
 and they all have guns all the time?

281
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,400
 And yet, they're all fake.

282
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,080
 They all take place in the cloakroom, don't they?

283
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:04,640
 This is, I was just reading a thing recently about how gun control

284
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,080
 in the 19th century in the Old West was really strict.

285
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,960
 And in most frontier towns, carrying any kind of weapon,

286
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,800
 so a gun or a knife or anything,

287
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,000
 was not permitted at all, not just publicly at all,

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,640
 except if you're outside the town borders or inside your home.

289
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
 So if you lived in the town, then you could have a gun,

290
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,360
 but you were only allowed to kill people in your own house.

291
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,960
 And obviously people broke this law,

292
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,600
 so it's not totally fake when you see westerns,

293
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
 because cowboys would go into the town

294
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,800
 and not check their coat into the cloakroom,

295
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 or their gun into the gun room,

296
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,440
 and then have big shoot-ups and people would die.

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,240
 Well, actually, some of the big shoot-outs

298
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,360
 were as a result of people flouting the law,

299
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,480
 and then people trying to stop them from flouting the law, right?

300
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
 The famous one is the gunfight at the Ok Corral.

301
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,400
 And the whole point of that is that the sheriff

302
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
 went over to these guys and said,

303
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
 "You're not supposed to have guns here, mate."

304
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,280
 And they went, "Well, we do, so, bang."

305
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,360
 I mean, that's not the whole two-hour film of...

306
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
 It should be, though. It's insane.

307
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,640
 So I was reading about the gunfight at the Ok Corral.

308
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,240
 I mean, it lasted 30 seconds.

309
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
 So, yeah, there is a lot of padding in the movie.

310
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,080
 And I thought it was Wyatt Earp.

311
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,680
 You know, he's one of the famous sheriffs.

312
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,120
 But it wasn't really Wyatt Earp.

313
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
 It was his brother, Virgil Earp.

314
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
 Amazing. I mean, people did just have better names

315
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
 in America in the 18th and 19th centuries.

316
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
 Yeah, it was him.

317
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
 And it wasn't at the Ok Corral either.

318
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,360
 It was the doors down.

319
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
 Yeah, but it sounds better.

320
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,720
 It sounds better, doesn't it, Andy?

321
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
 Well, I read somewhere saying it should have been

322
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,880
 called the Gunfight Outside Flies Photographic Studio.

323
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
 Yeah?

324
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
 That doesn't quite work.

325
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
 I think that is better, though,

326
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,480
 because the gunfight at the Ok Corral has always confused me

327
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
 because of the presence of "OK",

328
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,920
 which just means "OK" to us.

329
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,520
 I mean, what is an Ok Corral?

330
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,680
 Was it an amazing Corral? No, no, it was OK.

331
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,640
 Three stars on Google TripAdvisor reviews.

332
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,560
 Which stands for Old Kindersley, by the way.

333
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,920
 But it's confusing before you've researched it.

334
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,880
 Oh, and what was that?

335
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,280
 The name of the person who ran the Corral?

336
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,040
 Yeah, who ran the horse, the field.

337
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,760
 Oh, really?

338
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
 This Corral was, yeah.

339
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
 I'm annoyed that we don't have photos of it,

340
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,000
 given it was literally outside of Photographic Studio.

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
 Well, they would have had to hold still

342
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
 for a few seconds, wouldn't they?

343
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
 Which was a 30-second battle.

344
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,360
 You had enough time.

345
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,840
 Yeah, you're right.

346
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,520
 I'm going to say that version that you're saying,

347
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,160
 it sounds a bit like the Gunfight at Snappy Snaps, doesn't it?

348
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,240
 Also, I didn't know what a Corral was

349
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
 until researching this actual fact.

350
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,240
 What is it?

351
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,920
 I mean, it's a horse and livestock holding pen.

352
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,720
 Oh, is it like where you corral horses into the pen or something?

353
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,560
 Yeah, it's pretty much a car park.

354
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,080
 It's the Old West version of a car park.

355
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,440
 So the Wild West, if you're in the Wild West

356
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
 around about Wild West time,

357
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,000
 which I guess we're talking sort of late 19th century,

358
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
 there were camels wandering around with you.

359
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,480
 It's in the early period, really.

360
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,000
 So I hadn't realized that the US, just before the Civil War,

361
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,200
 decided that it wanted to start a camel corps.

362
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,600
 And I think the logic was that it was quite successful in Egypt

363
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
 and the desert plains in parts of America

364
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
 was pretty similar to Egypt.

365
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,880
 So they imported 75 camels altogether.

366
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,680
 And they were for the cowboy lands

367
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,600
 for the frontier for expanding territory.

368
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
 So hauling supplies to and fro at the frontier.

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,480
 And they weren't that successful,

370
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,200
 partly because apparently there was a very strong mule lobby,

371
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,960
 which I think was people who owned mules,

372
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,160
 not the mules themselves.

373
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,640
 And then the Civil War came

374
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,240
 and everyone forgot about the camels.

375
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,880
 And they just wandered feral through the deserts.

376
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,320
 And they were sort of like that,

377
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,240
 you know, when people see big cats these days

378
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
 in a garden in Barkshire,

379
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
 they were that equivalent in Arizona.

380
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,720
 So there was in the 1880s, Arizona was haunted by Red Ghost,

381
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,400
 which was a 30 foot tall, monstrous red camel,

382
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,640
 which apparently trampled the woman to death.

383
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,520
 30 foot tall.

384
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,360
 It killed a grizzly bear.

385
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,040
 It, there was one story about how someone spotted it

386
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,800
 in the distance and shot at it.

387
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,040
 And it ran away and something fell off its back.

388
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,280
 And the thing that fell off its back was a human skeleton

389
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,000
 who had been strapped to it obviously long before.

390
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,240
 Anyway, this was, this is all part,

391
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,360
 this all came out of the fact

392
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,960
 there were camels wandering the deserts

393
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,360
 and the stories got less and less plausible

394
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
 as people spotted them.

395
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,080
 Right.

396
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
 So what I'm saying is there were camels,

397
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,680
 but they weren't 30 foot tall

398
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,280
 and they didn't eat grizzly bears.

399
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,840
 Got it.

400
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,560
 Okay, Dad, make sure you got the right part of that story.

401
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,400
 There are other camels in America now.

402
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,320
 I don't, there are probably some.

403
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,440
 There must be some in zoos and things,

404
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,280
 but I just don't wonder if they're any still feral.

405
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,600
 Yeah.

406
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,960
 Don't think there are any wanderers anymore.

407
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,560
 You know the Lone Ranger,

408
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,600
 just to go on kind of myths of the old West now.

409
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,480
 I had no idea how successful it was.

410
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,400
 So it was a radio show,

411
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
 or one of the early iterations was a radio show,

412
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,520
 which ran for 20 years and 3000 episodes.

413
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,840
 It went through about eight different Lone Rangers show.

414
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,880
 Yeah.

415
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
 There was one time where the actor playing the Lone Ranger,

416
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
 who was a guy called Earl Grazer,

417
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
 he was killed in the car accident,

418
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
 but they had to just keep making the show.

419
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,480
 They couldn't stop making it.

420
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,160
 So they just had him speak in a whisper.

421
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,520
 They just got in a replacement,

422
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,080
 who was clearly someone with a completely different voice.

423
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
 And he just spoke in a whisper for several episodes.

424
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,120
 And Tonto, his sidekick had to do all the actual dialogue

425
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,800
 and say, what's that Lone Ranger?

426
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,880
 Oh, I'm still feeling very bad.

427
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,840
 And they just kept making it.

428
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,200
 It was quite weird in the Wild West

429
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,600
 how reality bled into entertainment

430
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,880
 in a semi-confusing way, right?

431
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,520
 So Buffalo Bill, was he a real cowboy,

432
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,360
 or was he an entertainer cowboy?

433
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 He, it feels like they really bridged the gap.

434
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,680
 So he started out as a bison hunter,

435
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,760
 and he fought in the war,

436
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,080
 and, you know, it was great with a gun.

437
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,920
 And then he sort of turned that lifestyle

438
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,840
 into this amazing show.

439
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
 But he was incredible.

440
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,640
 He, his career started out with being a Buffalo hunter,

441
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,760
 hence the name.

442
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,320
 And he once killed 6,000 Buffalo in one year.

443
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
 That's a lot of Buffalo.

444
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,120
 It's too many Buffalo.

445
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,200
 He was sort of single-handedly responsible

446
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
 for the near extinction of Buffalo.

447
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,000
 That's 20 Buffalo a day.

448
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
 That's a lot.

449
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,480
 How did he do that thing,

450
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,040
 where you kind of chased them off a cliff and they all...

451
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
 There must have been one really big incident

452
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,360
 where he knocked off a few thousand in one go,

453
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,960
 and then he could take a few days off

454
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,040
 this exhaustive Buffalo slaughter schedule.

455
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,720
 Because he must have had a few weeks holiday,

456
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,200
 mustn't he?

457
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
 So it's even more than that.

458
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
 You can't take a holiday as a bison hunter.

459
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,280
 It's just, you've got to keep going.

460
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,520
 He once killed 48 Buffalo in 30 minutes.

461
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,760
 But yeah, this America started out

462
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,560
 with millions of Buffalo in the 1600s.

463
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,640
 And by the end of the 19th century,

464
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,240
 really partly because of him,

465
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,680
 they had a couple of hundred left.

466
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,120
 Wow.

467
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,400
 One last thing about The Lone Ranger.

468
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
 In the TV series,

469
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
 he was played by a guy called Clayton Moore.

470
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,520
 And after the series ended,

471
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,880
 he kept doing public appearances as The Lone Ranger, right?

472
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
 The guy who bought the rights to The Lone Ranger

473
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,040
 got a restraining order against The Lone Ranger, Clayton Moore,

474
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,440
 saying you can't go out wearing your mask in public.

475
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,280
 You have to take your mask off in public, right?

476
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,720
 Stop pretending to be The Lone Ranger.

477
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,200
 That's quite ironic in 2021, isn't it?

478
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
 Yeah, must not wear a mask in public.

479
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,040
 And Clayton Moore was so wedded to the character

480
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,640
 that he started instead just wearing

481
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,000
 huge wraparound sunglasses

482
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,080
 to make it look like he was wearing a domino mask,

483
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,960
 like The Lone Ranger.

484
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,120
 Anyway, this led to a huge controversy in about 1980.

485
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
 And he went on the show Real People

486
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,920
 to discuss The Lone Ranger,

487
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,120
 ironic considering he was pretending to be someone he wasn't.

488
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,840
 But he came on stage for a live broadcast interview.

489
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,120
 And The Lone Ranger, he was so popular, Clayton Moore,

490
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,880
 that the studio audience who were there,

491
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
 they applauded for so long when he came on

492
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,920
 that it used up the entire broadcast slot for the interview.

493
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,280
 And they had to just go to an ad break

494
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,400
 without speaking to him.

495
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
 Of all the people that you want to have two of,

496
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
 The Lone Ranger is not one of us.

497
00:24:50,080 --> 00:25:02,080
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

498
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,840
 My fact is that just off the coast of Kent

499
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,800
 is a sunken ship, which is under 24-hour surveillance,

500
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,000
 because it contains 14,000 unexploded bombs.

501
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,040
 And yeah, it's extraordinary.

502
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,960
 And if they go off, we don't really know what's going to happen.

503
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,800
 Something bad will happen if they all go off.

504
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,360
 Well, bad for the fish, probably.

505
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,400
 Really bad for the fish.

506
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,560
 Really bad for she and S, which is the nearest town.

507
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,560
 And there's a theory that it could flood London if they go off.

508
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
 It'll create a five-meter wave,

509
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,040
 which will just come up the Thames and swamp London.

510
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,120
 Wow, five meters.

511
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,600
 I reckon on five meters above the Thames, we're all right here.

512
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
 Yeah, I'm upstairs at the moment.

513
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,560
 So this was from a guy called Tom Whitwell,

514
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,880
 who every year he makes a list of the 52 best things

515
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,640
 he's found out during the previous year.

516
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,680
 Really great list.

517
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,920
 I will post a link to the latest one.

518
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,640
 And it's a ship called the SS Richard Montgomery.

519
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,520
 It was an American ship, and in 1944,

520
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,000
 it was sailing over to France.

521
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,560
 It was taking 6,000 tons of explosives to Normandy

522
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,200
 to support the invasion.

523
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,160
 And it hit a sand bank in the Thames, broken half sank.

524
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,000
 And it's just been there since then.

525
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,440
 With it, this is really creepy.

526
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,320
 It's masts are poking up above the water.

527
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
 So you can see where it is.

528
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,960
 And some of it has been excavated,

529
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
 or some explosives have been removed from it.

530
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,040
 But there's still, I think, about 1,400 tons remaining on there.

531
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,760
 And we're just waiting to see what happens.

532
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,400
 It's absolutely nuts.

533
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,200
 And there's a sort of exclusion zone that they've put around it

534
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,800
 because they've had so many times

535
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,120
 where a ship has almost hit it by accident coming in.

536
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,480
 Or, in fact, what they used to do is locals used to charge

537
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,400
 two shillings to take people out

538
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
 and literally touch the masts of the ship.

539
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,200
 And they're like, "We need to stop doing this.

540
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,840
 This is a ginormous bomb sitting underneath."

541
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,360
 It's extraordinary.

542
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,880
 In fact, it's even worse than that because local fishermen,

543
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,640
 sometimes when they're trolling for fish,

544
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,760
 will pick up some old ordnance or something like that.

545
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,880
 And quite often they'll go,

546
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
 "Well, are we going to give this to the authorities?"

547
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,240
 That's a bit of a hassle.

548
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,200
 And so what they do is they dump them next to the ship

549
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,000
 because they know that it's an exclusion zone

550
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
 and no one's allowed to go there anyway.

551
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
 So they think, "Well, that's the safest place

552
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
 to just add more bombs."

553
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
 What are the odds of it hitting one of the bombs

554
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,200
 when you're down there?

555
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
 Probably like one in three.

556
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
 But it is controversial what will happen, isn't it?

557
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,560
 There are some people who think, actually,

558
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,040
 everything down there by this time probably won't do that much damage

559
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,960
 or even if one of them goes off,

560
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
 probably it won't set all the rest of them off.

561
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,400
 There was a guy called Dave Welsh.

562
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,320
 I read an interview with the BBC

563
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,400
 and he was a former Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Expert.

564
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,960
 And they asked him about this and he said,

565
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
 "If you've got a £1,000 bomb two metres away

566
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
 from another £1,000 bomb in water,

567
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,920
 the other one won't go bank."

568
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,000
 He said, "I know that for a fact.

569
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,280
 I did it last Tuesday."

570
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,680
 So there are some experts who think that it's okay

571
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,760
 and then there are other experts who think

572
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
 it's just a matter of time before this thing goes up.

573
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,800
 Yeah, it's extraordinary the theories, isn't it,

574
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,840
 that they've postulated.

575
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,160
 So in the 1970s, the Royal Military College of Sciences

576
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,240
 looked into it as well, what the consequences could be.

577
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
 As Andy says, a giant wave would go into shore supposedly.

578
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,360
 The other thing they said was,

579
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
 "If all bombs went off at the same time,

580
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,280
 a 3,000-metre-high column of water and debris

581
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,040
 would shoot into the air."

582
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,120
 So 3,000 metres for context would be...

583
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,200
 3,000 metres high, almost half the height of Everest.

584
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,160
 Exactly, that's three times the Burj Khalifa, more than that.

585
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,440
 That's how high they're saying

586
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,680
 that the debris and water column would go.

587
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,800
 And the town itself actually is quite affectionate

588
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,680
 towards this ship.

589
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,600
 They call it the Monty or Old Friend.

590
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,840
 And there's actually a large mural that you can see there

591
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,320
 of a mermaid detonating TNT with the little slogan,

592
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,520
 "You'll have a blast."

593
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
 Which, I have to say, I've been to Sheerness

594
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,960
 and that is definitely just a reference to the ship

595
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,760
 and not a genuine time you'll have.

596
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,960
 Now, I take that back.

597
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,560
 I absolutely loved my time there.

598
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,920
 Some of the best fishing ships I've ever had were on Sheerness.

599
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,040
 Really?

600
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,560
 Oh, yeah, I love Sheerness.

601
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,520
 I did go just on Sheppy, actually,

602
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,040
 because I did go on holiday to Sheppy last year,

603
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,560
 and it was so great.

604
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,000
 And the only other thing that I learned

605
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,240
 when I was there about it was that it was the home

606
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,120
 of the first, it was the home of the first live cargo flight ever.

607
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,840
 And in fact, there's a sign that says,

608
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,600
 "This is where the first flight by a British pilot

609
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
 in Britain happened."

610
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
 So it's quite a specific record.

611
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,720
 Live cargo.

612
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,360
 Yeah, so basically this was early 1900s.

613
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,560
 It was a pig, in fact.

614
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,040
 Okay.

615
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,000
 But close.

616
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
 When they were doing, like they did it as a publicity stunt

617
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,320
 because pigs would fly.

618
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,720
 Was that that one?

619
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,920
 It was exactly that, yeah.

620
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,200
 I love that, yeah.

621
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,320
 So this, well, you're not that old, James, but well remembered.

622
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,520
 So it was sort of the cradle of powered flight

623
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,000
 in the early years of the 1900s in the UK.

624
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
 And the Wright brothers visited,

625
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,360
 and they united with the short brothers,

626
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,560
 who were these British brothers,

627
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,720
 who set up a plane factory in Sheppy.

628
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,240
 And there was this guy called John Moore Brabazon,

629
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,960
 who did this flight, the first British flight

630
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,280
 by a British person in Britain in 1909.

631
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,360
 And then he went to disprove the adage

632
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
 that pigs can't fly.

633
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,320
 And so he strung a paper basket

634
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,160
 to one of the wings of the aircraft,

635
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,000
 stuck a pig in it, and flew.

636
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,640
 Amazing.

637
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,720
 On this, this is completely off topic now,

638
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,320
 but it's just because I read this yesterday.

639
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,040
 There was a company in America

640
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,440
 that got all their employees as a competition

641
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,880
 to try and make a lead balloon.

642
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,760
 And this was, I think in the,

643
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,680
 either in their early 80s or late 70s,

644
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,960
 I can't quite remember.

645
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,160
 And what they did was,

646
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,760
 it was kind of an advertising campaign

647
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,880
 or something like that.

648
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
 And they got a load of teams together

649
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,360
 and they said, who can make a lead balloon?

650
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,960
 And they gave them extremely thin sheets of lead

651
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,840
 and as much helium as they could use

652
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,520
 to make the voices go funny.

653
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,200
 And I think there were six teams,

654
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,680
 and only one of them managed to make a balloon,

655
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,960
 which actually did float

656
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,880
 with this helium made out of lead.

657
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,240
 But unfortunately, due to the wind direction,

658
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,720
 it started floating towards Logan Airport.

659
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,560
 And they had to ring up Logan Airport

660
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
 and say, hey, there's a lead balloon

661
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,080
 about your airspace.

662
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,600
 I'm just to mention the pilot saying,

663
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,400
 oh, well, it's okay.

664
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,440
 There's a balloon in our flight path,

665
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,560
 but I think our engines are going to make

666
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,480
 pretty short work of a little balloon, don't you?

667
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,600
 Ground control comes in, avoid that balloon.

668
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,440
 There was a whole load of, yeah,

669
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,040
 guffaw ring, I'm sure, because of that.

670
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,440
 And they had to ground flights for a little while.

671
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,280
 And then it was last seen floating

672
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 across the Atlantic towards Europe.

673
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,400
 It's still out there.

674
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,600
 It's still out there somewhere.

675
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,840
 With a 30-foot camel in the American desert.

676
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,440
 So just on shipwrecks.

677
00:31:59,440 --> 00:31:59,840
 Oh, yeah.

678
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,200
 UNESCO says there are three million shipwrecks

679
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,440
 around the world, which is just remarkable.

680
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,400
 That's an estimate.

681
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,480
 It's not a tally, but there are just so many out there.

682
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,800
 And we've got, we're winning on shipwrecks.

683
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,360
 Are we?

684
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,840
 Are we?

685
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,400
 Tally.

686
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,080
 We've, there's about 250,000

687
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,120
 around the coast of Britain.

688
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
 They reckon just because, see,

689
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,840
 we're in either nation

690
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,400
 and then lots of naval activities happened.

691
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,480
 And that's why shipwreck diving

692
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,360
 is so popular in the UK, which it is.

693
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,000
 And I was reading a really interesting blog

694
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,440
 by someone who's into shipwreck diving

695
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,800
 about the interesting thing about it.

696
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,840
 And I hadn't really thought through

697
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,400
 that you can't see, visibility is so poor

698
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
 that you often can't see your hand

699
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,720
 in front of your face.

700
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,640
 So, you know, you picture being able to see a wreck,

701
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,120
 like if you see Titanic, a full wreck in front of you.

702
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,960
 Actually, you're often just swimming around

703
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,560
 and so you crash into a wreck

704
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,680
 before you've even seen it.

705
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,600
 And you feel your way around it.

706
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,200
 So it will just appear out of nowhere.

707
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,560
 Yeah.

708
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,480
 In 2019, three sailors were shipwrecked

709
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,000
 off the coast of Columbia

710
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,040
 and they survived

711
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,480
 because they had something to cling onto,

712
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,000
 which was floating in the water,

713
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,800
 which was the plastic wrapped bales of cocaine

714
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,320
 that they were in the middle of smuggling.

715
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,160
 About a tonne of cocaine hydrochloride

716
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,560
 and they got picked up.

717
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,440
 God, what do you do?

718
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,320
 Do you let go of that

719
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,080
 when you see the coast guard coming?

720
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,480
 If you find anything in a shipwreck in the UK,

721
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,240
 you have to report it to the receiver of wreck.

722
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,000
 This is according to the 1995 Merchant Shipping Act.

723
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,120
 And if you don't do that and you keep it

724
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,040
 and they find out you could be fined

725
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,000
 or you have to pay the owner of whatever you've stolen

726
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,960
 or whatever you've taken twice the value.

727
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,120
 So if you take a million pounds worth of gold,

728
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,680
 you'd have to pay the Spanish privateer

729
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,120
 from the 16th century

730
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,720
 who you stole it from, two million worth.

731
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,920
 But in 2001, the receiver of the wreck

732
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,160
 who's called Sophia Exelby did a wreck amnesty

733
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,440
 where anything that you'd taken

734
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,560
 which you hadn't reported,

735
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,960
 you could then report and you wouldn't get done for it.

736
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,320
 And there's a whole load of list of things that they took.

737
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,240
 But weirdly, loads of people seem to have stolen

738
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,720
 toilet bowls from shipwrecks.

739
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,600
 And we can't really work out why they do that.

740
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
 So there are toilet bowls, toilet pumps,

741
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,920
 toilet roll holders, chamber pots,

742
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,160
 all these things stolen from shipwrecks.

743
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,240
 That's because the one thing you don't need in the sea

744
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,040
 is a toilet bowl.

745
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,320
 You're just we in the sea, guys.

746
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,960
 I guess you could do that,

747
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,800
 but how many cruises have you been on?

748
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,280
 It's a long way over the side.

749
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,160
 Just stick your ass out over the edge.

750
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,000
 And apparently they had one person

751
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,240
 who handed in a pair of white lace panties

752
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,480
 that they'd stolen from a shipwreck.

753
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,320
 Got to be a recent shipwreck.

754
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,680
 That kind of lasted very long

755
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,840
 in the unforgiving water around the coast.

756
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,480
 So, yeah, I wrote to the receiver of Wreck

757
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,000
 as research for this podcast.

758
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,440
 The current one's Camilla Moore.

759
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,600
 I just love the alternative title,

760
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,560
 The Coroner of the Seas, which is so cool.

761
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,480
 And basically, yeah, as James says,

762
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,440
 if you find a Wreck artifact,

763
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,000
 you have to report, it's your duty to report it to them.

764
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,920
 And then they make sure you get a fair price for it.

765
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,400
 But the fair price has to be agreed with the owner.

766
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,280
 So there was a thing recently

767
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,600
 where a load of shipping containers got washed up.

768
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,360
 I think someone on the coast of maybe Dorset.

769
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,120
 Yeah, it was in the news, wasn't it,

770
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,240
 that everyone was going down there

771
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
 trying to grab what they could, wasn't it?

772
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
 Yeah, quite a lot of people got new motorbikes.

773
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,400
 There was a consignment of BMW motorbikes.

774
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,720
 And BMW said, oh, they're water damaged.

775
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,560
 They're probably only worth a couple of hundred quid.

776
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,480
 And quite a lot of people with new motorbikes said,

777
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,760
 well, I'm just going to keep quiet then,

778
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,640
 because I think this brand new spotless motorbike

779
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,000
 might be worth a bit more than that.

780
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,280
 But what are they supposed to do?

781
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,480
 They're supposed to pot them all up

782
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,400
 outside Camilla Moore's house then, are they?

783
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,480
 No, you just get in touch and chill.

784
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
 You probably fill it a form or something

785
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
 and say, this is what I found.

786
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,840
 Yeah, it's fun.

787
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,680
 I quite like, because presumably their job as well

788
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,040
 is identifying pieces and having a sort of understanding

789
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,280
 of the history of shipbuilding to be like,

790
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,120
 oh, this would have been this part of the boat

791
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,680
 for anyone who had collected something.

792
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
 And that's because that's the thing that happens a lot.

793
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,720
 You find these pieces, you don't know exactly what they are.

794
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,520
 And Robert Ballard, who discovered the wreck of the Titanic,

795
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,720
 actually used a hotel in Annick in the UK

796
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,360
 to understand what certain fittings that he'd found

797
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,440
 from the Titanic's dining room were,

798
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,560
 because in Annick at the White Swan Hotel,

799
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,440
 they have a dining room, which has the exact,

800
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,760
 not a replica, but the exact dining room from the RMS Olympic,

801
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,480
 which was one of the sister ships of the Titanic.

802
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,920
 And when it got decommissioned,

803
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,320
 they removed all of the wood and everything.

804
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
 And it was brought up by this hotel owner

805
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,240
 who recreated the entire room inside his hotel

806
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,720
 to the point that Ballard was going to that room

807
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,240
 to see, ah, that's what that fitting

808
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,360
 would have been that we'd covered.

809
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,640
 - That's insane. Oh, that's cool.

810
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,680
 - Oh, it's a table. I see it.

811
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,520
 - Oh, it's not a handkerchief,

812
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,360
 it's a pair of white lace panties.

813
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,840
 What are you doing in the dining room?

814
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,760
 - That's what everyone wears to dinner on ships.

815
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,600
 - You need to get quick access

816
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,360
 if you're pissing over the side of the boat.

817
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,960
 - It feels like Anna's being on a special raunchy crew

818
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
 and thinks that this is just how all cruises operate,

819
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,560
 as opposed to mostly being deckquoits.

820
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,600
 - Oh, look, I've had some good holidays.

821
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,680
 - Do you know what the largest Titanic museum in the world is?

822
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,200
 - I thought it's in Belfast.

823
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,040
 - I think it's in a place called Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,

824
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,600
 which is very far inland.

825
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,080
 But it's half the size of the Titanic

826
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,680
 and it's shaped like the Titanic.

827
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,800
 - Wow.

828
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
 - It's really cool and it's in a pool of water.

829
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
 So you feel like you're going on the actual ship.

830
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,120
 - Is it the Titanic before the crash or...?

831
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,640
 - Yeah, it's pretty.

832
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,280
 - Okay.

833
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,080
 - It is half the size,

834
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,000
 but they haven't just recreated the front hull.

835
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,280
 - Yeah, they haven't just cut it in half.

836
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,400
 Yeah, I don't know.

837
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,160
 - Wow.

838
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,040
 - Yeah.

839
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,840
 - That's very weird because I feel like Pigeon Forge

840
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,000
 is going to be relevant later on in the show, possibly.

841
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,440
 - I was thinking the exact same thing.

842
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,720
 - A forward spoiler.

843
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,600
 Just back to Camilla more quickly, receiver of the wreck.

844
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,680
 Her other job, not only does she receive wrecks,

845
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,640
 but she's responsible for dealing with all stranded royal fish.

846
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
 - Oh, really?

847
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,240
 - She must keep her busy.

848
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,480
 So all the fish that the Queen owns,

849
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,120
 which theoretically is all dolphins, porpoises and whales

850
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,440
 that get stranded on British beaches,

851
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,520
 they belong to the monarchy since the 13th century.

852
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,320
 I think they made the rule

853
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
 because you used to get whale oil and stuff for them

854
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,840
 and technically the monarchy can claim that whale oil.

855
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,600
 And she's responsible for dealing with them.

856
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,160
 So for porpoises stranded, you call Camilla.

857
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,040
 And she doesn't like drag the whale over to Buckingham Palace

858
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,400
 and say, "Here you go, your Majesty."

859
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,000
 - He drops it at the Queen's bedroom door

860
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
 and says, "You asked for this 700 years ago."

861
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,360
 - If Prince Charles's goldfish ever jumps out of its bowl

862
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,040
 and accidentally gets stranded on the carpet,

863
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,280
 she technically is the person who has to deal with it.

864
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
 I think responsibility.

865
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,880
 - Anna, you were saying just before that shipwreck buys

866
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,360
 about 250,000 or off the coast of...

867
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,760
 - Britain, they think, yeah.

868
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,680
 I was amazed to hear, we don't know exactly

869
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,360
 how many bombs are in the oceans around the British Isles,

870
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,720
 except for the fact we do know that just after World War II,

871
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,280
 the British government dumped roughly 1.17 million tons

872
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,880
 of chemical weapons and conventional bombs into the sea,

873
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
 just off our coasts.

874
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,920
 And I should quickly say, I got this fact,

875
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,600
 as well as a lot of the things I've been saying

876
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,720
 about the Richard Montgomery ship we've been talking about

877
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,440
 from a Vice article by a guy called Joe Zado.

878
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,920
 It's a fascinating article about what we're talking about right now,

879
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,440
 so give that a read if you can.

880
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,240
 But he was saying that in 1995,

881
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,640
 while they were drilling an undersea gas line

882
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,400
 between Scotland and Northern Ireland,

883
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,080
 they hit one of the stashes of these bombs

884
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,360
 that had been dropped down there,

885
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,560
 and it released a bunch of them.

886
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,600
 And within a month, 4,500 of them had washed up

887
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,440
 to the west coast of Scotland.

888
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,920
 So we've just got bombs washing up on the shores

889
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,720
 and nitroglycerine vials and it's terrifying.

890
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,120
 It was only one nitroglycerine vial, wasn't it?

891
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,480
 One child said that they did that.

892
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,360
 One reported.

893
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,960
 Oh yeah, one reported.

894
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,600
 There is a place in Russia which has a ship's graveyard

895
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,200
 of nuclear submarine engines, which sounds terrifying.

896
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,560
 So it's a place called the Karras Sea.

897
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,760
 And the problem is that nuclear submarines,

898
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,800
 they last about 30 years and then they start rattling,

899
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,000
 they get a bit noisier in the water,

900
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,520
 so they're less secret and the technology gets outdated

901
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
 and you're just building better subs.

902
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,280
 And at its height, Russia had 245 nuclear submarines,

903
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,960
 which is a lot of nuclear power in the water.

904
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,240
 And so now there is this place

905
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,600
 which contains 14 nuclear reactors

906
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,160
 and 17,000 containers of hazardous material.

907
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,920
 And the Russian authorities would like to scrap these

908
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
 and properly scrap them and decommission them,

909
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,680
 but apparently it relies on recovery vessels

910
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,200
 which don't yet exist.

911
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,840
 So this is a task.

912
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,760
 Don't build stuff, you can't unbuild.

913
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,160
 The UK is similar.

914
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,560
 I think we've got, we certainly had a couple of years ago,

915
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,960
 20 nuclear submarines left over from the Cold War

916
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,720
 that we don't know what to do with.

917
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,960
 Can't really afford to dismantle.

918
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,040
 Why don't we just dump them next to this thing here?

919
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,200
 There was a plan, wasn't there,

920
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,480
 to put like a massive concrete casing over this ship,

921
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,160
 I think, you know, like they did in Chernobyl.

922
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,920
 But at the moment, every kind of few years,

923
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,360
 the government kind of has a meeting with some experts

924
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,120
 and they say, "What should we do about this?"

925
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,040
 And then at the end of the meeting, everyone goes,

926
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,080
 "Should we just leave it then?"

927
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,640
 Yeah, that's just...

928
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,120
 Yeah, it's so British.

929
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,160
 It's really embarrassing.

930
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,880
 It's amazing.

931
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,720
 Maybe the worst ever reason for a shipwreck was in 2003,

932
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,680
 which was a two and a half thousand ton ship

933
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,600
 called the RMS Mulheim,

934
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,360
 and it was sunk by a pair of trousers.

935
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,680
 Can we work out why that happened,

936
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,200
 or is that going to be impossible?

937
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,200
 Okay, so what could a pair of trousers done?

938
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,760
 Oh, someone snagged their trousers on the port

939
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,960
 as the ship was leaving,

940
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,040
 but the cloth was so strong

941
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,200
 that it managed to pull down the entire ship.

942
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,360
 You're not far off.

943
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,640
 I must be miles off.

944
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,360
 That sounds like that would be a trousers advert.

945
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,520
 That's a Levi-June's advert for the durability of that material.

946
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,080
 What it was, is it was the officer who was on watch.

947
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,880
 He was at the bridge.

948
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,240
 He was sitting in a chair.

949
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,760
 He tried to stand up,

950
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,200
 but his trousers snagged,

951
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,960
 and he lost his balance,

952
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,200
 fell over, knocked himself out briefly.

953
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,640
 By the time he came around,

954
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,040
 the ship was heading straight for the shoreline,

955
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,320
 and there was nothing he could do about it,

956
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,160
 because it takes about five miles to stop these ships.

957
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,920
 So bang, shipwreck.

958
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,760
 I'll be honest, you said I wasn't far off,

959
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,040
 but really the only thing I got right was the trousers part.

960
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,320
 That's true.

961
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,440
 You'd already told us.

962
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,400
 I had to give you a little clue, yeah.

963
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,040
 Again, I think attributing blame to the trousers there

964
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,440
 is a bit like attributing blame to the French Revolution

965
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,920
 for the death of old Governor Morris.

966
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,120
 The courts disagree with you, Anna,

967
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,080
 because the trousers were sued for 20 million pounds.

968
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,440
 They're still in jail.

969
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,640
 They've been in prison since, yeah.

970
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,680
 Do they have to wear prison trousers over the trousers?

971
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,920
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

972
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,120
 and that is my fact.

973
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,920
 My fact this week is that the nine-to-five singer,

974
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,240
 Dolly Parton, helped fund a COVID vaccine

975
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,600
 that has a protection rate of nine-to-five percent.

976
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,200
 Nine-to-five percent.

977
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,680
 Fortunately, not nine-to-five percent,

978
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,840
 because that actually would not be a very effective vaccine.

979
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:38,240
 Yeah, Dolly Parton, she's amazing with charity.

980
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,480
 She's always making donations to incredible causes,

981
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,760
 and one of the things that she did back in April of 2020

982
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,680
 was she donated a million dollars to COVID-19 research,

983
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,720
 and she sent that to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

984
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,120
 And the money went towards the Moderna vaccine,

985
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,800
 which came out, which has a nearly 95,

986
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,160
 I discovered at the last second,

987
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,520
 it's sort of 94.5 percent effect in this against corona.

988
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,400
 Well, there'll be letters.

989
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,680
 But everyone rounds it up to 95, so I think we're safe.

990
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,320
 Very good.

991
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,520
 I should say I found this fact while looking through Twitter

992
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,480
 on the day that it happened.

993
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,400
 A lot of people made this connection,

994
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,040
 so it was a nice little joke going around about Dolly Parton,

995
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,960
 and I thought, let's do it on the show.

996
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,920
 Do we think that they suppressed the effectiveness rate

997
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,880
 of the vaccine to make sure that they could create this fact?

998
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,120
 Could they have made a 99 percent effective one,

999
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,960
 but they knew it would ruin the gag?

1000
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,000
 But that was Jay-Z had given the money for that one, hadn't he?

1001
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,480
 Or for older people, Nina, from 99 Red Balloons fame.

1002
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,360
 But if you kind of do your jokes for different generations,

1003
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,360
 then you get more hits, don't you?

1004
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,880
 Absolutely.

1005
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,680
 You'll stand up.

1006
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,960
 One out of three jokes you'll get.

1007
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,160
 The other two for the other two-thirds of the audience.

1008
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,400
 James' stand-up gags is where the audience is rigidly divided

1009
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,440
 by age into tranches, and he'll turn to one set of crowds.

1010
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,560
 They're all in triangles.

1011
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,240
 Now, what you guys don't know about Jay-Z is that

1012
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,760
 Dolly Parton's pretty cool.

1013
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,120
 I didn't know anything about Dolly Parton,

1014
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:17,840
 apart from Big Hair and she's famous also for her boobs,

1015
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,280
 and she sings 95.

1016
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,240
 I knew 95, and I knew Joe Lee, and that's basically all I knew,

1017
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,320
 but my God, she's had an interesting life.

1018
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,040
 She grew up in a little place in Tennessee,

1019
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,280
 which is, I think, better known as the home of the world's largest

1020
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,160
 Titanic museum.

1021
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,000
 What, Belfast?

1022
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,280
 Pigeon Forge.

1023
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,480
 Pigeon Forge, man.

1024
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,160
 Yeah, in extreme poverty, it was so poor there that the funeral home

1025
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,640
 kept sets of teeth from people who'd been buried,

1026
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,720
 and you could go down and get a set if you needed a set of teeth.

1027
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,520
 Really?

1028
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,240
 Yeah.

1029
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:50,880
 Wow.

1030
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,720
 Yeah, and her family was so poor.

1031
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,560
 She was the fourth of 12 children.

1032
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,760
 Supposedly, they had no money to pay the doctor who delivered her,

1033
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,200
 so instead, the dad gave him a bag of oatmeal as payment.

1034
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,560
 That was the first exchange.

1035
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,240
 She's got quite an oat-based childhood.

1036
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,040
 Her childhood was bookended by oats,

1037
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,200
 because then, after she graduated high school,

1038
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,840
 she says that she got on a bus straight away to go to Nashville

1039
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,400
 to make her fortune doing music in the city,

1040
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,880
 and she got on a bus with what she described as her suitcase,

1041
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,360
 which was actually an empty box of Quaker Oats.

1042
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,560
 Really?

1043
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,840
 Which isn't going to hold much,

1044
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,440
 unless Quaker Oats came in much larger, much stronger boxes back then.

1045
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,840
 Wow, that's amazing.

1046
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,160
 Yeah.

1047
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,560
 They were so poor that they ate a lot of animals

1048
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,240
 that the father could find, didn't they?

1049
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,240
 So she said they would eat turtle, frogs, groundhogs,

1050
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,000
 but they never ate possum,

1051
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,560
 because apparently, possum is the most disgusting meat

1052
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,840
 that you can eat around there.

1053
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,720
 Wow.

1054
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,920
 So they never did that, yeah.

1055
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,920
 She also used to get by on room service.

1056
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,120
 That sounds fancy.

1057
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,280
 In Nashville, she would walk up and down hotel corridors

1058
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,120
 looking for half-eaten trays of room service

1059
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,760
 that people had left outside their rooms.

1060
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,360
 That must have stuck with her throughout life,

1061
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,280
 the idea of food not being available,

1062
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,440
 because even at this age, still on tour,

1063
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,600
 she always makes sure she has a packed lunch

1064
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,680
 or snacks with her wherever she goes,

1065
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,800
 despite her millions,

1066
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,920
 and despite probably access to any restaurant she wants.

1067
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,320
 She will always have things like potted meat

1068
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,440
 or a Vienna sausage with her in order to...

1069
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,080
 With her?

1070
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,720
 So if you sit just in her pocket or something,

1071
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,400
 she's always got a sausage in her pocket.

1072
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,680
 Those outfits are very tight.

1073
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,560
 And if you look, you can see the outline of a sausage

1074
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,080
 at some point on her person.

1075
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,240
 And she's actually got a completely flat chest,

1076
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,560
 but her bra is just stuffed with potted meat.

1077
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,360
 The only fact I really knew about Dolly Parton before this

1078
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,440
 is that she once lost a Dolly Parton lookalike competition.

1079
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,840
 That's like an old bit of trivia

1080
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,120
 that you kind of see every now and then,

1081
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,400
 but I looked into it and it's slightly different than that.

1082
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,800
 She basically entered a drag queen celebrity impersonator contest.

1083
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,080
 Okay.

1084
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,800
 And there were loads of drag queens there,

1085
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,880
 and they were all dressed as different people,

1086
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,200
 like Cher or Dolly Parton or whatever,

1087
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,280
 but they couldn't be dressed as anyone they wanted.

1088
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,840
 And also they had to be drag queens.

1089
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,280
 So you had this beautiful kind of massive hair

1090
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,080
 and all that makeup and eyelashes and stuff.

1091
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,480
 And Dolly Parton, as great as she looked,

1092
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,080
 was just dressed as Dolly Parton.

1093
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,720
 So obviously she didn't look anything like a drag queen

1094
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,000
 pretending to be Dolly Parton.

1095
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,120
 She looked like Dolly Parton.

1096
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,200
 So of course she didn't win.

1097
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,000
 That's interesting.

1098
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,960
 I didn't know that.

1099
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,920
 That's how they justify it.

1100
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,080
 That sounds like the judge's justification speech

1101
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,760
 at the end when he realized who she was.

1102
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,040
 Okay.

1103
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,640
 Reloaded.

1104
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,680
 How do we get out of this one?

1105
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,000
 She has released over 200 albums in her career.

1106
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,240
 200 albums.

1107
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,680
 That's so stupid.

1108
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,240
 That's like Buffalo Bill with Bison for me.

1109
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,560
 Like, how can you do that many?

1110
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,480
 Like, 185 compilation albums worldwide she's released.

1111
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,680
 Oh, 185 compilations.

1112
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,960
 She's only made 15 albums,

1113
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,480
 and she's done 185 compilations

1114
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,240
 of incredibly different combinations.

1115
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,160
 That's the thing.

1116
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,080
 If your album has 15 tracks in,

1117
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,560
 there are 15 factorial possibilities

1118
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,000
 of putting those in any order.

1119
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,040
 So you could do that.

1120
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,200
 But now you've got Spotify now,

1121
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,960
 which does it in a random order anyway.

1122
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,480
 You can no longer justify the 185 different orders.

1123
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:14,960
 She's had--

1124
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,360
 Why are we not releasing each episode four different times?

1125
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,760
 Great idea.

1126
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,280
 51 studio albums, which I still think is insane.

1127
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,080
 That's a lot.

1128
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,880
 Yeah, it is mad.

1129
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,800
 And she says she's written over 3,000 songs.

1130
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,280
 Not all of them have been recorded.

1131
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,280
 But that's a lot of songwriting.

1132
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,720
 And with a lot of hits as well.

1133
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,000
 Jolene, as you mentioned, Andy, I will always love you,

1134
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,400
 which for me, I only know through Whitney Houston.

1135
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,120
 But it's good.

1136
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,320
 I only know it through Saddam Hussein, that one.

1137
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,680
 I know it was beautiful.

1138
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,880
 That's right.

1139
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,320
 It's a cool about that if you don't get,

1140
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,440
 then you're going to have your suspicions

1141
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,960
 about James's political leanings.

1142
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,800
 Oh, she wrote those two in the same day, actually.

1143
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,680
 Which is just both the question,

1144
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,200
 what has she done for the last 40 years,

1145
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,040
 giving them the two most famous?

1146
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,160
 It is like Buffalo Bill,

1147
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,680
 because he killed like 48 buffaloes in six hours,

1148
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,200
 which meant it could take a few weeks off.

1149
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,000
 And she didn't say it.

1150
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 She just knocked them out.

1151
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,400
 She doesn't quite remember if she wrote them on the same day.

1152
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,280
 That's the problem.

1153
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,360
 But they're on the same tape or the same...

1154
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,920
 The evidence that she has suggests

1155
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,760
 that they were written in the same session.

1156
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,960
 And she sort of says,

1157
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,640
 people always say that was a good writing day.

1158
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,120
 She's a very good self-promoter

1159
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,400
 in the best possible way, isn't she?

1160
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,080
 So every interview she gives,

1161
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,800
 she remembers these amazing details about her life.

1162
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,080
 And then sometimes she remembers

1163
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,280
 slightly contradictory things.

1164
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,440
 But she definitely knows...

1165
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,520
 That's such a nice way of saying so was a liar.

1166
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,760
 She's a self-promotorizer.

1167
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,520
 She's had a long old life.

1168
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,160
 And, you know, you can't remember everything.

1169
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,000
 But she does say that she wears stilettos

1170
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,280
 to make breakfast every day.

1171
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,960
 Like she's always dressed up.

1172
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,200
 It's not like she goes home, takes off her wig,

1173
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,640
 takes off her makeup.

1174
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,440
 Pills out the sausage.

1175
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,480
 Chunks of meat out and devours them.

1176
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,680
 She says she wants to make sure

1177
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,040
 she's always ambulance ready,

1178
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,160
 which is quite a nice way of describing it.

1179
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,680
 It's got to come at 4 a.m.

1180
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,080
 You know, there's one of her songs

1181
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,200
 that we haven't heard,

1182
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,880
 which is called My Place in History.

1183
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,080
 And it's not going to be revealed

1184
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,600
 until her 100th birthday,

1185
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,760
 which is going to be the 19th of January, 2046.

1186
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,680
 She should do it on her 95th birthday.

1187
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,960
 Shouldn't she really?

1188
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,520
 Yes, so it had 9 to 5.

1189
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,760
 But it's locked in a box in Dollywood.

1190
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,960
 So if you want to petition them

1191
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,240
 to release it early, James, you can.

1192
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,160
 But until then, it's going to be in a box

1193
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,520
 and they're going to release it then.

1194
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,880
 And I don't know what happened.

1195
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,680
 That's very exciting.

1196
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,240
 That's very cool.

1197
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:36,640
 Yeah.

1198
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,040
 Dollywood is very cool, by the way.

1199
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,840
 I mean, not many people have their own theme park.

1200
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,880
 And Dolly Parkton is one of those refu.

1201
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,280
 It's packed with roller coaster rides

1202
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,880
 and all sorts of fun things.

1203
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,240
 But she inherited an existing theme park,

1204
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,600
 which had been changing ownership for many, many years.

1205
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,200
 It started, Dollywood initially,

1206
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,440
 as a place called Rebel Railroad.

1207
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,080
 And the idea was that there was a steam train.

1208
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,000
 They had a general shop as well and a few other things.

1209
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,120
 But you could get on this theme-inspired train.

1210
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,760
 And it was to celebrate the centennial anniversary

1211
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,960
 of the Civil War.

1212
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,320
 So as you were on the train,

1213
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,800
 you would be attacked by Union soldiers.

1214
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,280
 You would have train robbers trying to rob you.

1215
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,640
 You would have Native Americans trying to rob you as well.

1216
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,560
 And you were protected on board this train

1217
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,200
 by the Confederates who were fighting off the attackers

1218
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,240
 as they were coming for you.

1219
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,200
 That was what Dollywood started as, this little train.

1220
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,320
 It was a celebration of the fact

1221
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,320
 the Confederates won the Civil War, wasn't it?

1222
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,400
 Certainly sounds like very confusing for everyone,

1223
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,200
 if you're saying, if you're positioning it like that.

1224
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,760
 And in fact, Dolly does say that when she was growing up,

1225
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,520
 one of the things she thought was that the Confederates

1226
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,400
 won the Civil War.

1227
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:42,960
 Wow.

1228
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,680
 Different when she was young.

1229
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,000
 Really?

1230
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,640
 Yeah.

1231
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,120
 Well, she did used to have a Civil War themed restaurant as well.

1232
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,840
 Which was a dinner experience called Dixie Stampede,

1233
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,320
 where you had to choose which side you were on,

1234
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,000
 north or south in the Civil War.

1235
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,600
 She has since changed that a bit.

1236
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,160
 Well, she actually, she renamed it, didn't she?

1237
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,920
 Quite recently, Dollyparton Stampede,

1238
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,400
 because she didn't realise the word Dixie had

1239
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,480
 quite problematic connotations

1240
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,000
 with the black community in America.

1241
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,280
 Dollyparton Stampede, however,

1242
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,280
 is a terrifying name for something.

1243
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,640
 Imagine 30,000 Dollypartons stampeding towards you.

1244
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,160
 Oh, yeah.

1245
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,560
 I'm just one more thing on Dollywood.

1246
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,640
 Dolly doesn't go on the rides herself.

1247
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,840
 She's not tall enough, is she?

1248
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,040
 She is five foot two.

1249
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,160
 She doesn't go on it because she says it could damage her hair.

1250
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,080
 And she also said,

1251
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,080
 "This is interesting, considering what we've been talking about."

1252
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,640
 She said, "Lord knows what else could fall out of me."

1253
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,200
 And I think that might be a reference to the secret sausage

1254
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,280
 or the possum leaf in the bosom.

1255
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,640
 Imagine if you sat behind Dollyparton,

1256
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,480
 and just as the photo comes up,

1257
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,920
 the sausage hits you in the face.

1258
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,680
 "Pepper Army Cascade on the Looper Loops."

1259
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,520
 Her marriage is sort of an amazing love story, isn't it?

1260
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,400
 With Carl Dean, who she's been married to for 57 years,

1261
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,760
 although there have always been rumours

1262
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,640
 that he doesn't exist because he's never, ever seen in public.

1263
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,880
 But she said that this is because in 1966,

1264
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,560
 sort of just after they got married,

1265
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,600
 she won this award for a song called "Put It Off Until Tomorrow".

1266
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,480
 And they had an award ceremony to go to.

1267
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,680
 And she got all dressed up.

1268
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,720
 He got all dressed up.

1269
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,840
 They went to the ceremony.

1270
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,360
 They came back home afterwards and he said,

1271
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,920
 "Don't you ever make me go to one of those damn things again?"

1272
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,960
 And she didn't.

1273
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,480
 And he just hates the limelight.

1274
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,760
 Absolutely loves her.

1275
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,480
 Obviously stuck it out for almost six decades.

1276
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,600
 But he's never been to a gig either.

1277
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,880
 He doesn't need to be sat on stage at the gig.

1278
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,200
 He can be quite anonymous in the crowd watching it,

1279
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,560
 but he's never gone to a gig.

1280
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,760
 What if he doesn't like her kind of music?

1281
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,960
 He actually doesn't.

1282
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,160
 He says he likes hard rock and bluegrass and stuff.

1283
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,640
 But he does actually see her perform sometimes,

1284
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,600
 or at least he goes to her gigs when she performs at state fairs.

1285
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,600
 And that's because he really likes going to the tractor pool.

1286
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,160
 Okay, so he's hearing it in the background.

1287
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,680
 He's not been to her gig.

1288
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,080
 He's watching the tractor pull away while she's singing back.

1289
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,120
 Can you keep it down over there?

1290
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,400
 I can't hear the tractors.

1291
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,800
 Okay, that's it.

1292
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,920
 That is all of our facts.

1293
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,200
