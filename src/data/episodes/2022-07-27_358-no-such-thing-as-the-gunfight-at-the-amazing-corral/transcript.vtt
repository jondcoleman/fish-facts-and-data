00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.320
 four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.960
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.040
 Starting with fact number one and that is James. Okay, my fact this week, embrace yourselves people,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.320
 is that founding father of the United States of America, Governor Morris, died after sticking a

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.240
 whale bone into his own penis. I mean, you would expect that you might die after sticking it to

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.080
 someone else's penis because they would be so angry with you. Yeah. He did it to himself. He did it to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.600
 himself. It's quite a sad story. It's quite a funny story, James. It's quite funny. Yeah, I mean,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.200
 was this the asphyxia wank of the 1870s? It wasn't that. Basically. The great opening with this fact

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.880
 immediately. Okay, so basically, first of all, Governor Morris, you might know him if you've

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 never heard his name said as Gouverneur Morris, because that's how his first name is pronounced,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.520
 but he was a big deal. He was known as the pen man of the Constitution. He signed the articles of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.480
 the Confederation and the Constitution. He helped plan the Erie Canal. He helped lay out the streets

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.200
 of Manhattan. Here's a real proper big deal in the early United States, but he had some problem

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.080
 with his urinary tract. We don't know exactly what it was. It could have been just a UTI urinary

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.840
 tract infection. It could have been something more serious, but whatever it was, he decided

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.880
 to self-medicate and try and clear the blockage in his penis. What are you going to do that with?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.520
 Obviously, with a whale bone. When I say a whale bone, I don't mean like the backbone of a blue

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.400
 whale or something like that. It was a kind of almost like an early plastic, which was taken

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.440
 from the Baleen of Wales. It could have been like the ear of a pair of spectacles or the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.200
 handle of a knife or something. All that stuff was made out of whale bone. Anyway, he took a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.600
 piece of this, put it in his penis, gave himself a very even worse infection, and eventually died

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.920
 of said infection. Such a shame. I really hope that the day before he did this, he was having

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.320
 a chat with friends going, "What do you think in like 200, 300 years they're going to remember me?"

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.640
 Imagine a podcast as a fact about me. What do you think that's going to be?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.920
 It's so unfair because he's one of the most interesting people. He's one of the most

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.080
 interesting founding fathers, I think. There's so much amazing stuff about him. Yet, I think this

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.080
 is the only thing holding it back from him having a big budget musical about him. It should have

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.080
 been Morris instead of Hamilton. I don't really want to see the final part of that musical.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.080
 Hamilton was so clever to get into and die of that rather than the whale bone thing.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.280
 So, this was a guy. He was very, like Andy says, an extremely crazy character of the late 18th century.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.440
 He's quite letharious, wasn't he, as well, which is something that comes up as much as

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.280
 his sort of political achievements. The fact that- But less than the whale bone of the penis.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.840
 That's the ranking order, yeah. Whale bone penis, penmanship of the Constitution,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.080
 likes to kiss ladies a lot. That's the order. Yeah, he had a lot of

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.200
 injuries that were supposedly connected to his womanizing. He had a peg leg, for example,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.800
 later on in life, and that was a result supposedly of him trying to escape a furious

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.880
 husband. That's a rumor, but it comes up a lot. I think it's not true. Yeah, I agree. I think it's

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.600
 not true. He did have a carriage accident and he lost the leg in that. And it's a really tragic

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.800
 story. That's the bit I assumed you believed, Andy. I didn't think it was the husband running away.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.560
 No, but he clearly did do a lot of running away from husbands in his time. But he was taking

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.240
 the reins of a carriage in New York. I think it was in New York, maybe it was elsewhere.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.320
 He was taking the reins of a carriage and the horse is bolted and his leg was broken in several

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.960
 places. And then his regular doctor wasn't available. And the doctor, they got in and said,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.880
 "Well, we'll have to amputate this below the knee." And so they did. And then his real doctor,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.240
 his regular doctor, came back and said, "Oh, we could absolutely have saved your leg."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 You can see why he started self-medicating later in life, can't you?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.120
 But he was okay with the leg amputation. In fact, I think that he might have been happy about it,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.520
 because it really cemented his reputation as a bit of a character. And even at the time,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.640
 a friend visited him the day after he'd had it off and hasn't had the leg off.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.440
 Well, that's probably where the rumor started, actually. They were like, "What happened with

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.520
 your leg?" He said, "Oh, I had it off." They're like, "Oh, really?" His friend was trying to do the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.360
 good thing of telling him the advantages of his situation, saying, "Look, with one leg, you're

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.760
 going to build up such great strength of character. It's a great challenge to have to overcome in

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.800
 life. You'll be a better man for it." And Morris immediately said, "You argue the matter so handsomely

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.040
 and point out so clearly the advantages of being without legs that I am tempted to part with the

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.520
 other." So he took it in good humor. Didn't he still also use it in battle?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.040
 Really? No. Did he? Yeah. I think this is another story. Go on. This is another story that he used

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.600
 to beat off revolutionaries with his peg leg, again, a good off. Beat off is another thing where he

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:49.440
 was a secretary. I think that there was one incident where he was posted to Paris by Washington,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.480
 and it was around about the time when there were quite a lot of revolutionaries on the streets of

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.240
 Paris. And they said, "Don't come out in your carriages." And he'd come out in his carriage

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.360
 anyway, and they descended on his carriage one time. And apparently, he said that he stuck his

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.800
 wooden leg out the window and said something like, "Oh, look, I've got this fighting for freedom too,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.920
 so lay off." And they did. Yeah. They were shouting, "He's an aristocrat. He's an aristocrat because

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.920
 he's in a lovely carriage." And then he shouted, "Yes, truly, one who lost his leg in the cause of

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.280
 liberty." And he kind of brandished his wooden leg at them. But there's another version of the

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.400
 story where he just pulled off his leg and shoved it out of the window to distract the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.680
 crowd. And they all started chasing off the bloke over the carriage.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.960
 Like one of those lizards that kind of got soft at the end of their tail.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.880
 Wow. As a two-year-old, he was sold for $600,000. What? Really?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.080
 I'm joking. That's a racehorse also called Governor Morris, which...

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.200
 There aren't many Governor Morrisers, are there? I mean, Governor itself,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.560
 not a very popular name, "governure". It was actually his mother's maiden name,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.760
 and it's what's morphed in to be "governor" today. The spelling has turned into our modern-day

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.920
 spelling of "governor". But I did outside of your racehorse, Andy. I found one other Governor

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.920
 Morris, which was a novelist, Governor Morris IV, who was actually a descendant of Governor Morrisers.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.520
 And he wrote a bunch of novels. And his novels were often adapted into movies,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.480
 including one called "The Penalty", which was released in 1920. And it was about a legless man

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.880
 and starred Lon Shady, a good friend. You're joking.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.480
 No. The descendant of Governor Morris. Yeah, I wrote a Lon Shady legless movie,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.840
 as referenced in last week's episode. In that film, then, he plays a man with no legs,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.880
 whose legs were unnecessarily amputated, just like that of Governor Morris.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.120
 It feels like they didn't use much imagination for the plot of this film.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.280
 They just basically looked into the family history of one of their lead men.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.920
 I think they had a punch on for weird names, because one of his brothers was called "Stat".

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.320
 Okay. How many A's do you spell that?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.040
 Okay. It's only a double A. But how do you pronounce a double A? It's S-T-Double-A-T-S.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.880
 Governor Morris' wife's middle name was Gary. Do you know why?

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.240
 You know what? I thought that. And I read somewhere that she was called Gary.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.160
 But then, I just doubted myself and quickly googled it. And on Wikipedia,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.400
 she's called Anne Gary, C-A-R-Y Morris. I read Gary in a few places.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.720
 That was a big scandal as well, because she was his housekeeper,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.160
 and she was a fair bit younger than him, 22 years younger than him.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.880
 And he wrote in his diary. He had an amazingly naughty diary,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.120
 where he wrote all sorts of rude things that he'd been up to.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.920
 He said, "I married this day Anne Gary Randolph. No small surprise to my guests."

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.600
 So, he clearly liked causing a fuss.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.640
 Well, because he genuinely did surprise them with it as a Christmas present.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.960
 I think he invited all his family around for Christmas dinner, as you do.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.720
 And then, in the middle of it, called a vicarin, whatever,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.680
 got someone to, you know, had planned in advance called a vicarin,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.200
 and gotten to marry them, got him to marry them in front of everyone.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.840
 So, I think it was quite a surprise. Not what you'd expect.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.760
 Well, it would have been surprised when they said,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.360
 "Do you Anne Gary Randolph?" It's like that episode of Only Fools and Horses,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.400
 when they find out that Rodney's middle name is whatever it is,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.160
 Charlton or Crystal Palace or whatever it is.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.040
 We should say that part of the reason she was controversial,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.960
 as well as being his housekeeper, is that she was thought to have killed her baby.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.240
 There were sort of two things. There was the housekeeper thing,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.080
 and there was the, "Did you kill your baby thing?"

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.280
 Was earlier in her life.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.440
 She married her brother-in-law, hadn't she?

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.360
 Oh, no, she'd had an affair with her brother-in-law.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.120
 Allegedly.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.240
 Allegedly. And the baby supposedly, allegedly, came from that affair,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.360
 and she was allegedly so embarrassed that she killed the baby,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.120
 but she said it was still both.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.520
 Allegedly.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:49.920
 Yes.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.400
 Allegedly.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.400
 But she was from a bizarre family, by which I mean,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.560
 her family estate was called bizarre.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.200
 Brilliant. Brilliant.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.520
 That's great, because we don't have to say allegedly for that bit.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.480
 They can't sue us.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.440
 No, they can't. It's just a place called bizarre.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.240
 It's in Virginia.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.200
 Just, I mean, just on this guy's actual career,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.040
 which we probably should touch on briefly,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.200
 because it was unbelievably successful.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.480
 And obviously, as James said, he was incredibly influential.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.960
 One of the things he did was, he came up with the phrase,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.560
 "We the people of the United States."

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.280
 And this was in an early draft of, is it the Declaration?

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.640
 It's the Constitution.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.680
 The Constitution, sorry.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.360
 So that was in the Constitution, and the phrase,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.800
 "We the people of the United States."

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.560
 In an earlier draft, it was,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.320
 "We the people of the States of New Hampshire,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.320
 Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.800
 Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.280
 Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.840
 and Georgia."

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.480
 And he said, "I think we've got an edit in here."

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.040
 And he came up with that lovely phrase.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.520
 And this is claimed to have been an absolute stroke of genius,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.920
 and does make me think that we're bringing him up too much,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.160
 because I reckon I could have come up with that edit.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.240
 And he left a bunch of spelling mistakes in the actual document.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.200
 There was a Pennsylvania, it was spelled with one N,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.000
 which apparently sometimes it could be seen to be

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.960
 spelled like that back in the day, but not really very often.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.480
 Well, which two Ns did they remove from Pennsylvania then?

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.960
 Sorry, it was Pennsylvania, in fact.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.360
 Got it.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.520
 No, it was, sorry, it was spelled with two Ns,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.960
 but without the double.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.040
 And even worse, there was a sentence in the Constitution

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.320
 that said the fragment is necessary for executing its inspection laws,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.520
 and there was an apostrophe between the T and the S of it,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.840
 the possessive it.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.960
 On the Declaration of Independence, slightly different,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.800
 but around the same time, of course,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.120
 it's signed by the Founding Fathers,

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.080
 signed by one woman, or one woman's name was on there.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.760
 Do you know who that might be?

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.560
 Gary.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:52.960
 Gary.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.920
 That's how she got away with it.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.080
 Everyone was like, well, Gary's obviously a man's name.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.320
 Who is it?

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.480
 It's Mary Catherine Goddard, and the reason she got on there

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.440
 is because she owned a publishing house in Baltimore,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.920
 and she printed out the Declaration of Independence.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.680
 And at the very, very bottom, it says printed by Mary Catherine Goddard.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.040
 So there is a woman's name on the Declaration of Independence.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.040
 And you might think, okay, well, that's a bit of a cheat,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.560
 and I suppose it kind of is.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.920
 But by doing that, basically, she opened herself up to trees

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.280
 and charges and stuff like that.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.400
 So it would have been very easy for her to not put her name on there,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.240
 but she saw it was such an important document

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.920
 that she thought she should be on there.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.400
 It was kind of cool.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:34.880
 Very cool.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.000
 There's a very famous statue that people are probably familiar with

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.560
 that is mostly Governor Morris, and that is the--

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.240
 Is it the statue of Long John Silver?

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.720
 Is it the whale at the Natural History Museum?

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.760
 Oh, no.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.960
 That wasn't most of him.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.080
 His penis didn't take up most of his body.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.600
 But he was very large, very tall, and a lot of people have commented

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.880
 that the Founding Fathers, many of them are quite short and rotund,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.440
 and that's partly because they drank in a huge amount

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.880
 while they were writing the Constitution.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.800
 And he was tall and slim, much like Washington.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.640
 So when the great French sculptor, Houdon,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.200
 was commissioned to do a sculpture of Washington,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.120
 which is the very famous one that's now--

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.800
 It's in the state capital of Virginia.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.400
 It's copied sort of everywhere.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.840
 It's like he's got his hand on a pillar,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.520
 and then another hand on a stick.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.960
 That's Washington's head, but it's Governor Morris's body.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.360
 And this is--

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.720
 Yeah, the sculptor popped over from France to DC,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.680
 took lots of mass of Washington's face,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.840
 took a lot of eye photographs of his body.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.840
 But then when he went back to France,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.240
 he realized that Morris was in France as well,

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.600
 so he called him around to his house and said,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.680
 "Can I use your body as the model for my statue?"

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.920
 Wow, can I ask whose leg it is?

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.720
 Like, is it his wife's leg?

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.920
 I think maybe it's Gary's leg, and if you look at it,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.880
 it's the extremely spelt kind of woman's leg,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.280
 and then a big man's body, and then Washington's head.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.520
 Well, if you do look at it, one leg is longer than the other,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.000
 and that's why, because he dressed him up in Washington's clothes,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.480
 but his wooden leg had to extend to the length of a shoe,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.320
 so he wouldn't wear a shoe over his leg,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.560
 so his leg was a bit longer than a normal leg.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.160
 So if you look at the statue,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.960
 the left leg is a little bit longer than the right leg,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.880
 because his leg was longer than the other leg.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.480
 That's a great fact.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.000
 That's extraordinary.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.520
 That's a pretty crap artist as well,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.200
 who couldn't chisel the way to make sure the legs were the right leg.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.440
 You can't fake it.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.120
 He was a realist.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.120
 So one reason for Governor Morris's death

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.000
 could have been the French Revolution in a slightly strange way,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.840
 and that is because when the French Revolution happened,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.600
 everyone stopped wearing really posh aristocratic clothes,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.040
 because as we said before,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.720
 you probably get dragged out of your carriage

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.280
 and beaten to death, probably, or guillotined or something.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.200
 These kind of big dresses that women wore had a lot of whalebone in them,

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.160
 and so when the fashion industry in France collapsed,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.480
 they had all this spare whalebone,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.720
 and the price absolutely plummeted.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.920
 So it was something that you used to not be able to get very easily,

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.800
 and then suddenly you can get it anywhere for any price,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.400
 and the result of that was this was a really useful material to use,

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.560
 and so they started using it in everything,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.600
 and so you would have whalebone umbrellas and whalebone,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.840
 like I said before, knives and spectacles and whatever,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.760
 and so it was because of the French Revolution

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.400
 that you had so much whalebone in his house,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.520
 which meant, I mean,

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.920
 maybe he would have found something else to stick up his well with that.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.240
 It was because of the revolution that you had this whalebone to hand.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.760
 I mean, amazingly, a torturous link.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.360
 They got him in the end after he escaped that carriage incident.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.720
 I knew they'd get him eventually.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:08.400
 Did whalebone-related penis nests rocket during that period

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.160
 when it became widely available?

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.760
 I think it probably did, yeah.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.720
 I think we should say he had stuck something up his penis before,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.240
 so we can't exclusively blame the whale.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.520
 He had foam.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.320
 Yeah, foam.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.280
 He made a catheter once with a flexible piece of hickory.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.280
 Hickory dickory cock.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:33.840
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.320
 My fact this week is that before entering a town in the wild west,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.920
 you had to leave your gun outside, pick up a token,

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.560
 and use that token to collect your gun on the way out,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.040
 but slightly leaving your coat in a bar.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.480
 Very sensible.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.120
 Wait a minute.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.840
 Did they know I've seen lots of wild west movies

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.360
 and they all have guns all the time?

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.400
 And yet, they're all fake.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.080
 They all take place in the cloakroom, don't they?

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:04.640
 This is, I was just reading a thing recently about how gun control

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.080
 in the 19th century in the Old West was really strict.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.960
 And in most frontier towns, carrying any kind of weapon,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.800
 so a gun or a knife or anything,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.000
 was not permitted at all, not just publicly at all,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.640
 except if you're outside the town borders or inside your home.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.640
 So if you lived in the town, then you could have a gun,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.360
 but you were only allowed to kill people in your own house.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.960
 And obviously people broke this law,

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.600
 so it's not totally fake when you see westerns,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.400
 because cowboys would go into the town

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.800
 and not check their coat into the cloakroom,

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 or their gun into the gun room,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.440
 and then have big shoot-ups and people would die.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.240
 Well, actually, some of the big shoot-outs

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.360
 were as a result of people flouting the law,

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.480
 and then people trying to stop them from flouting the law, right?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.360
 The famous one is the gunfight at the Ok Corral.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.400
 And the whole point of that is that the sheriff

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.840
 went over to these guys and said,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.200
 "You're not supposed to have guns here, mate."

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.280
 And they went, "Well, we do, so, bang."

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.360
 I mean, that's not the whole two-hour film of...

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.480
 It should be, though. It's insane.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.640
 So I was reading about the gunfight at the Ok Corral.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.240
 I mean, it lasted 30 seconds.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.160
 So, yeah, there is a lot of padding in the movie.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.080
 And I thought it was Wyatt Earp.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.680
 You know, he's one of the famous sheriffs.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.120
 But it wasn't really Wyatt Earp.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.960
 It was his brother, Virgil Earp.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.520
 Amazing. I mean, people did just have better names

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.280
 in America in the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.200
 Yeah, it was him.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.960
 And it wasn't at the Ok Corral either.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.360
 It was the doors down.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.280
 Yeah, but it sounds better.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.720
 It sounds better, doesn't it, Andy?

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.080
 Well, I read somewhere saying it should have been

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.880
 called the Gunfight Outside Flies Photographic Studio.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.200
 Yeah?

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.640
 That doesn't quite work.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.760
 I think that is better, though,

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.480
 because the gunfight at the Ok Corral has always confused me

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.160
 because of the presence of "OK",

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.920
 which just means "OK" to us.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.520
 I mean, what is an Ok Corral?

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.680
 Was it an amazing Corral? No, no, it was OK.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.640
 Three stars on Google TripAdvisor reviews.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.560
 Which stands for Old Kindersley, by the way.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.920
 But it's confusing before you've researched it.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.880
 Oh, and what was that?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.280
 The name of the person who ran the Corral?

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.040
 Yeah, who ran the horse, the field.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.760
 Oh, really?

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.120
 This Corral was, yeah.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.600
 I'm annoyed that we don't have photos of it,

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.000
 given it was literally outside of Photographic Studio.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200
 Well, they would have had to hold still

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.400
 for a few seconds, wouldn't they?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.720
 Which was a 30-second battle.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.360
 You had enough time.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:21.840
 Yeah, you're right.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.520
 I'm going to say that version that you're saying,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.160
 it sounds a bit like the Gunfight at Snappy Snaps, doesn't it?

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:32.240
 Also, I didn't know what a Corral was

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.840
 until researching this actual fact.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.240
 What is it?

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.920
 I mean, it's a horse and livestock holding pen.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.720
 Oh, is it like where you corral horses into the pen or something?

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.560
 Yeah, it's pretty much a car park.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.080
 It's the Old West version of a car park.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.440
 So the Wild West, if you're in the Wild West

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.120
 around about Wild West time,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.000
 which I guess we're talking sort of late 19th century,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.480
 there were camels wandering around with you.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.480
 It's in the early period, really.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.000
 So I hadn't realized that the US, just before the Civil War,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.200
 decided that it wanted to start a camel corps.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.600
 And I think the logic was that it was quite successful in Egypt

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.000
 and the desert plains in parts of America

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.200
 was pretty similar to Egypt.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.880
 So they imported 75 camels altogether.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.680
 And they were for the cowboy lands

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.600
 for the frontier for expanding territory.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.000
 So hauling supplies to and fro at the frontier.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.480
 And they weren't that successful,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.200
 partly because apparently there was a very strong mule lobby,

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.960
 which I think was people who owned mules,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.160
 not the mules themselves.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.640
 And then the Civil War came

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.240
 and everyone forgot about the camels.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.880
 And they just wandered feral through the deserts.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.320
 And they were sort of like that,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.240
 you know, when people see big cats these days

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.000
 in a garden in Barkshire,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.880
 they were that equivalent in Arizona.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.720
 So there was in the 1880s, Arizona was haunted by Red Ghost,

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.400
 which was a 30 foot tall, monstrous red camel,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.640
 which apparently trampled the woman to death.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.520
 30 foot tall.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.360
 It killed a grizzly bear.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:07.040
 It, there was one story about how someone spotted it

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.800
 in the distance and shot at it.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.040
 And it ran away and something fell off its back.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.280
 And the thing that fell off its back was a human skeleton

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.000
 who had been strapped to it obviously long before.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.240
 Anyway, this was, this is all part,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.360
 this all came out of the fact

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.960
 there were camels wandering the deserts

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.360
 and the stories got less and less plausible

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.960
 as people spotted them.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.080
 Right.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.080
 So what I'm saying is there were camels,

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.680
 but they weren't 30 foot tall

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.280
 and they didn't eat grizzly bears.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:31.840
 Got it.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.560
 Okay, Dad, make sure you got the right part of that story.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.400
 There are other camels in America now.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.320
 I don't, there are probably some.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.440
 There must be some in zoos and things,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.280
 but I just don't wonder if they're any still feral.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.600
 Yeah.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.960
 Don't think there are any wanderers anymore.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.560
 You know the Lone Ranger,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.600
 just to go on kind of myths of the old West now.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.480
 I had no idea how successful it was.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.400
 So it was a radio show,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.240
 or one of the early iterations was a radio show,

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.520
 which ran for 20 years and 3000 episodes.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.840
 It went through about eight different Lone Rangers show.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.880
 Yeah.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.960
 There was one time where the actor playing the Lone Ranger,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.400
 who was a guy called Earl Grazer,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.600
 he was killed in the car accident,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.120
 but they had to just keep making the show.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.480
 They couldn't stop making it.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.160
 So they just had him speak in a whisper.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.520
 They just got in a replacement,

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.080
 who was clearly someone with a completely different voice.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.000
 And he just spoke in a whisper for several episodes.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.120
 And Tonto, his sidekick had to do all the actual dialogue

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.800
 and say, what's that Lone Ranger?

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.880
 Oh, I'm still feeling very bad.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.840
 And they just kept making it.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.200
 It was quite weird in the Wild West

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.600
 how reality bled into entertainment

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.880
 in a semi-confusing way, right?

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.520
 So Buffalo Bill, was he a real cowboy,

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.360
 or was he an entertainer cowboy?

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.360
 He, it feels like they really bridged the gap.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.680
 So he started out as a bison hunter,

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.760
 and he fought in the war,

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.080
 and, you know, it was great with a gun.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.920
 And then he sort of turned that lifestyle

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.840
 into this amazing show.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.360
 But he was incredible.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.640
 He, his career started out with being a Buffalo hunter,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.760
 hence the name.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.320
 And he once killed 6,000 Buffalo in one year.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.080
 That's a lot of Buffalo.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.120
 It's too many Buffalo.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.200
 He was sort of single-handedly responsible

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.720
 for the near extinction of Buffalo.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.000
 That's 20 Buffalo a day.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.880
 That's a lot.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.480
 How did he do that thing,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.040
 where you kind of chased them off a cliff and they all...

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.040
 There must have been one really big incident

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.360
 where he knocked off a few thousand in one go,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.960
 and then he could take a few days off

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.040
 this exhaustive Buffalo slaughter schedule.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.720
 Because he must have had a few weeks holiday,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.200
 mustn't he?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.960
 So it's even more than that.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.440
 You can't take a holiday as a bison hunter.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.280
 It's just, you've got to keep going.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.520
 He once killed 48 Buffalo in 30 minutes.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.760
 But yeah, this America started out

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.560
 with millions of Buffalo in the 1600s.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.640
 And by the end of the 19th century,

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.240
 really partly because of him,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.680
 they had a couple of hundred left.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.120
 Wow.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.400
 One last thing about The Lone Ranger.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.240
 In the TV series,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.000
 he was played by a guy called Clayton Moore.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.520
 And after the series ended,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.880
 he kept doing public appearances as The Lone Ranger, right?

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.720
 The guy who bought the rights to The Lone Ranger

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.040
 got a restraining order against The Lone Ranger, Clayton Moore,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.440
 saying you can't go out wearing your mask in public.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.280
 You have to take your mask off in public, right?

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.720
 Stop pretending to be The Lone Ranger.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.200
 That's quite ironic in 2021, isn't it?

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200
 Yeah, must not wear a mask in public.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.040
 And Clayton Moore was so wedded to the character

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.640
 that he started instead just wearing

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.000
 huge wraparound sunglasses

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.080
 to make it look like he was wearing a domino mask,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:18.960
 like The Lone Ranger.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.120
 Anyway, this led to a huge controversy in about 1980.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.880
 And he went on the show Real People

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.920
 to discuss The Lone Ranger,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.120
 ironic considering he was pretending to be someone he wasn't.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.840
 But he came on stage for a live broadcast interview.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.120
 And The Lone Ranger, he was so popular, Clayton Moore,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.880
 that the studio audience who were there,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.880
 they applauded for so long when he came on

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.920
 that it used up the entire broadcast slot for the interview.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.280
 And they had to just go to an ad break

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.400
 without speaking to him.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.400
 Of all the people that you want to have two of,

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.080
 The Lone Ranger is not one of us.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:25:02.080
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.840
 My fact is that just off the coast of Kent

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.800
 is a sunken ship, which is under 24-hour surveillance,

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.000
 because it contains 14,000 unexploded bombs.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.040
 And yeah, it's extraordinary.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.960
 And if they go off, we don't really know what's going to happen.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.800
 Something bad will happen if they all go off.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.360
 Well, bad for the fish, probably.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.400
 Really bad for the fish.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.560
 Really bad for she and S, which is the nearest town.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.560
 And there's a theory that it could flood London if they go off.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.560
 It'll create a five-meter wave,

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.040
 which will just come up the Thames and swamp London.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.120
 Wow, five meters.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.600
 I reckon on five meters above the Thames, we're all right here.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.600
 Yeah, I'm upstairs at the moment.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:48.560
 So this was from a guy called Tom Whitwell,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.880
 who every year he makes a list of the 52 best things

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.640
 he's found out during the previous year.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.680
 Really great list.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.920
 I will post a link to the latest one.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.640
 And it's a ship called the SS Richard Montgomery.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.520
 It was an American ship, and in 1944,

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.000
 it was sailing over to France.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.560
 It was taking 6,000 tons of explosives to Normandy

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.200
 to support the invasion.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.160
 And it hit a sand bank in the Thames, broken half sank.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.000
 And it's just been there since then.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.440
 With it, this is really creepy.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.320
 It's masts are poking up above the water.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.080
 So you can see where it is.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.960
 And some of it has been excavated,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960
 or some explosives have been removed from it.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.040
 But there's still, I think, about 1,400 tons remaining on there.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.760
 And we're just waiting to see what happens.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.400
 It's absolutely nuts.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.200
 And there's a sort of exclusion zone that they've put around it

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.800
 because they've had so many times

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:45.120
 where a ship has almost hit it by accident coming in.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.480
 Or, in fact, what they used to do is locals used to charge

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.400
 two shillings to take people out

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.600
 and literally touch the masts of the ship.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.200
 And they're like, "We need to stop doing this.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.840
 This is a ginormous bomb sitting underneath."

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.360
 It's extraordinary.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.880
 In fact, it's even worse than that because local fishermen,

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.640
 sometimes when they're trolling for fish,

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.760
 will pick up some old ordnance or something like that.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.880
 And quite often they'll go,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.960
 "Well, are we going to give this to the authorities?"

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.240
 That's a bit of a hassle.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.200
 And so what they do is they dump them next to the ship

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.000
 because they know that it's an exclusion zone

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.440
 and no one's allowed to go there anyway.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.960
 So they think, "Well, that's the safest place

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.240
 to just add more bombs."

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.480
 What are the odds of it hitting one of the bombs

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.200
 when you're down there?

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.200
 Probably like one in three.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.600
 But it is controversial what will happen, isn't it?

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.560
 There are some people who think, actually,

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.040
 everything down there by this time probably won't do that much damage

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.960
 or even if one of them goes off,

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.960
 probably it won't set all the rest of them off.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.400
 There was a guy called Dave Welsh.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.320
 I read an interview with the BBC

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.400
 and he was a former Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Expert.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.960
 And they asked him about this and he said,

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.840
 "If you've got a £1,000 bomb two metres away

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.240
 from another £1,000 bomb in water,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.920
 the other one won't go bank."

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.000
 He said, "I know that for a fact.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.280
 I did it last Tuesday."

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.680
 So there are some experts who think that it's okay

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.760
 and then there are other experts who think

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.840
 it's just a matter of time before this thing goes up.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.800
 Yeah, it's extraordinary the theories, isn't it,

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.840
 that they've postulated.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.160
 So in the 1970s, the Royal Military College of Sciences

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.240
 looked into it as well, what the consequences could be.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.240
 As Andy says, a giant wave would go into shore supposedly.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.360
 The other thing they said was,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.360
 "If all bombs went off at the same time,

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.280
 a 3,000-metre-high column of water and debris

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.040
 would shoot into the air."

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.120
 So 3,000 metres for context would be...

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.200
 3,000 metres high, almost half the height of Everest.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.160
 Exactly, that's three times the Burj Khalifa, more than that.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.440
 That's how high they're saying

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.680
 that the debris and water column would go.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.800
 And the town itself actually is quite affectionate

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.680
 towards this ship.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.600
 They call it the Monty or Old Friend.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.840
 And there's actually a large mural that you can see there

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.320
 of a mermaid detonating TNT with the little slogan,

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.520
 "You'll have a blast."

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.600
 Which, I have to say, I've been to Sheerness

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.960
 and that is definitely just a reference to the ship

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.760
 and not a genuine time you'll have.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.960
 Now, I take that back.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.560
 I absolutely loved my time there.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.920
 Some of the best fishing ships I've ever had were on Sheerness.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.040
 Really?

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.560
 Oh, yeah, I love Sheerness.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.520
 I did go just on Sheppy, actually,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.040
 because I did go on holiday to Sheppy last year,

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.560
 and it was so great.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.000
 And the only other thing that I learned

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.240
 when I was there about it was that it was the home

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.120
 of the first, it was the home of the first live cargo flight ever.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.840
 And in fact, there's a sign that says,

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.600
 "This is where the first flight by a British pilot

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.280
 in Britain happened."

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.280
 So it's quite a specific record.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.720
 Live cargo.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.360
 Yeah, so basically this was early 1900s.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.560
 It was a pig, in fact.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.040
 Okay.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.000
 But close.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.560
 When they were doing, like they did it as a publicity stunt

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.320
 because pigs would fly.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:56.720
 Was that that one?

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.920
 It was exactly that, yeah.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.200
 I love that, yeah.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.320
 So this, well, you're not that old, James, but well remembered.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.520
 So it was sort of the cradle of powered flight

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.000
 in the early years of the 1900s in the UK.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.600
 And the Wright brothers visited,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.360
 and they united with the short brothers,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.560
 who were these British brothers,

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.720
 who set up a plane factory in Sheppy.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.240
 And there was this guy called John Moore Brabazon,

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.960
 who did this flight, the first British flight

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.280
 by a British person in Britain in 1909.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.360
 And then he went to disprove the adage

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.960
 that pigs can't fly.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.320
 And so he strung a paper basket

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.160
 to one of the wings of the aircraft,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.000
 stuck a pig in it, and flew.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.640
 Amazing.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.720
 On this, this is completely off topic now,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.320
 but it's just because I read this yesterday.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.040
 There was a company in America

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.440
 that got all their employees as a competition

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.880
 to try and make a lead balloon.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.760
 And this was, I think in the,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.680
 either in their early 80s or late 70s,

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.960
 I can't quite remember.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.160
 And what they did was,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.760
 it was kind of an advertising campaign

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.880
 or something like that.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.720
 And they got a load of teams together

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.360
 and they said, who can make a lead balloon?

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.960
 And they gave them extremely thin sheets of lead

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.840
 and as much helium as they could use

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.520
 to make the voices go funny.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.200
 And I think there were six teams,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.680
 and only one of them managed to make a balloon,

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.960
 which actually did float

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.880
 with this helium made out of lead.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.240
 But unfortunately, due to the wind direction,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.720
 it started floating towards Logan Airport.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.560
 And they had to ring up Logan Airport

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.560
 and say, hey, there's a lead balloon

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.080
 about your airspace.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.600
 I'm just to mention the pilot saying,

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.400
 oh, well, it's okay.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.440
 There's a balloon in our flight path,

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.560
 but I think our engines are going to make

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.480
 pretty short work of a little balloon, don't you?

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.600
 Ground control comes in, avoid that balloon.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.440
 There was a whole load of, yeah,

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.040
 guffaw ring, I'm sure, because of that.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.440
 And they had to ground flights for a little while.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.280
 And then it was last seen floating

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.280
 across the Atlantic towards Europe.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.400
 It's still out there.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.600
 It's still out there somewhere.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.840
 With a 30-foot camel in the American desert.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:59.440
 So just on shipwrecks.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:31:59.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.200
 UNESCO says there are three million shipwrecks

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.440
 around the world, which is just remarkable.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.400
 That's an estimate.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.480
 It's not a tally, but there are just so many out there.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.800
 And we've got, we're winning on shipwrecks.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.360
 Are we?

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:13.840
 Are we?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.400
 Tally.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.080
 We've, there's about 250,000

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.120
 around the coast of Britain.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.960
 They reckon just because, see,

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.840
 we're in either nation

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.400
 and then lots of naval activities happened.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.480
 And that's why shipwreck diving

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.360
 is so popular in the UK, which it is.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.000
 And I was reading a really interesting blog

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.440
 by someone who's into shipwreck diving

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.800
 about the interesting thing about it.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.840
 And I hadn't really thought through

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.400
 that you can't see, visibility is so poor

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.600
 that you often can't see your hand

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.720
 in front of your face.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.640
 So, you know, you picture being able to see a wreck,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.120
 like if you see Titanic, a full wreck in front of you.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.960
 Actually, you're often just swimming around

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.560
 and so you crash into a wreck

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.680
 before you've even seen it.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.600
 And you feel your way around it.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.200
 So it will just appear out of nowhere.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.560
 Yeah.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.480
 In 2019, three sailors were shipwrecked

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.000
 off the coast of Columbia

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.040
 and they survived

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.480
 because they had something to cling onto,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.000
 which was floating in the water,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.800
 which was the plastic wrapped bales of cocaine

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.320
 that they were in the middle of smuggling.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.160
 About a tonne of cocaine hydrochloride

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.560
 and they got picked up.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.440
 God, what do you do?

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.320
 Do you let go of that

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.080
 when you see the coast guard coming?

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.480
 If you find anything in a shipwreck in the UK,

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.240
 you have to report it to the receiver of wreck.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.000
 This is according to the 1995 Merchant Shipping Act.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.120
 And if you don't do that and you keep it

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.040
 and they find out you could be fined

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.000
 or you have to pay the owner of whatever you've stolen

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.960
 or whatever you've taken twice the value.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.120
 So if you take a million pounds worth of gold,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.680
 you'd have to pay the Spanish privateer

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.120
 from the 16th century

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.720
 who you stole it from, two million worth.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.920
 But in 2001, the receiver of the wreck

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.160
 who's called Sophia Exelby did a wreck amnesty

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.440
 where anything that you'd taken

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.560
 which you hadn't reported,

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.960
 you could then report and you wouldn't get done for it.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.320
 And there's a whole load of list of things that they took.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.240
 But weirdly, loads of people seem to have stolen

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.720
 toilet bowls from shipwrecks.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.600
 And we can't really work out why they do that.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.600
 So there are toilet bowls, toilet pumps,

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.920
 toilet roll holders, chamber pots,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.160
 all these things stolen from shipwrecks.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.240
 That's because the one thing you don't need in the sea

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.040
 is a toilet bowl.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.320
 You're just we in the sea, guys.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.960
 I guess you could do that,

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.800
 but how many cruises have you been on?

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.280
 It's a long way over the side.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.160
 Just stick your ass out over the edge.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.000
 And apparently they had one person

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.240
 who handed in a pair of white lace panties

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.480
 that they'd stolen from a shipwreck.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.320
 Got to be a recent shipwreck.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.680
 That kind of lasted very long

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.840
 in the unforgiving water around the coast.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.480
 So, yeah, I wrote to the receiver of Wreck

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.000
 as research for this podcast.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.440
 The current one's Camilla Moore.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.600
 I just love the alternative title,

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.560
 The Coroner of the Seas, which is so cool.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.480
 And basically, yeah, as James says,

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.440
 if you find a Wreck artifact,

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.000
 you have to report, it's your duty to report it to them.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.920
 And then they make sure you get a fair price for it.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.400
 But the fair price has to be agreed with the owner.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.280
 So there was a thing recently

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.600
 where a load of shipping containers got washed up.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.360
 I think someone on the coast of maybe Dorset.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.120
 Yeah, it was in the news, wasn't it,

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.240
 that everyone was going down there

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.000
 trying to grab what they could, wasn't it?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.240
 Yeah, quite a lot of people got new motorbikes.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.400
 There was a consignment of BMW motorbikes.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.720
 And BMW said, oh, they're water damaged.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.560
 They're probably only worth a couple of hundred quid.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.480
 And quite a lot of people with new motorbikes said,

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.760
 well, I'm just going to keep quiet then,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.640
 because I think this brand new spotless motorbike

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.000
 might be worth a bit more than that.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.280
 But what are they supposed to do?

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.480
 They're supposed to pot them all up

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.400
 outside Camilla Moore's house then, are they?

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.480
 No, you just get in touch and chill.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.800
 You probably fill it a form or something

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.960
 and say, this is what I found.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.840
 Yeah, it's fun.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.680
 I quite like, because presumably their job as well

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.040
 is identifying pieces and having a sort of understanding

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.280
 of the history of shipbuilding to be like,

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.120
 oh, this would have been this part of the boat

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.680
 for anyone who had collected something.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.280
 And that's because that's the thing that happens a lot.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.720
 You find these pieces, you don't know exactly what they are.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:11.520
 And Robert Ballard, who discovered the wreck of the Titanic,

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.720
 actually used a hotel in Annick in the UK

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.360
 to understand what certain fittings that he'd found

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.440
 from the Titanic's dining room were,

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.560
 because in Annick at the White Swan Hotel,

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.440
 they have a dining room, which has the exact,

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.760
 not a replica, but the exact dining room from the RMS Olympic,

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.480
 which was one of the sister ships of the Titanic.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.920
 And when it got decommissioned,

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.320
 they removed all of the wood and everything.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.320
 And it was brought up by this hotel owner

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.240
 who recreated the entire room inside his hotel

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.720
 to the point that Ballard was going to that room

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.240
 to see, ah, that's what that fitting

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.360
 would have been that we'd covered.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.640
 - That's insane. Oh, that's cool.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.680
 - Oh, it's a table. I see it.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.520
 - Oh, it's not a handkerchief,

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.360
 it's a pair of white lace panties.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.840
 What are you doing in the dining room?

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.760
 - That's what everyone wears to dinner on ships.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.600
 - You need to get quick access

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.360
 if you're pissing over the side of the boat.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.960
 - It feels like Anna's being on a special raunchy crew

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.960
 and thinks that this is just how all cruises operate,

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.560
 as opposed to mostly being deckquoits.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.600
 - Oh, look, I've had some good holidays.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.680
 - Do you know what the largest Titanic museum in the world is?

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.200
 - I thought it's in Belfast.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.040
 - I think it's in a place called Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.600
 which is very far inland.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.080
 But it's half the size of the Titanic

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.680
 and it's shaped like the Titanic.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.800
 - Wow.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.960
 - It's really cool and it's in a pool of water.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.800
 So you feel like you're going on the actual ship.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.120
 - Is it the Titanic before the crash or...?

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.640
 - Yeah, it's pretty.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.280
 - Okay.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.080
 - It is half the size,

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.000
 but they haven't just recreated the front hull.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.280
 - Yeah, they haven't just cut it in half.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.400
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.160
 - Wow.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.040
 - Yeah.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.840
 - That's very weird because I feel like Pigeon Forge

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.000
 is going to be relevant later on in the show, possibly.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.440
 - I was thinking the exact same thing.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.720
 - A forward spoiler.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.600
 Just back to Camilla more quickly, receiver of the wreck.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.680
 Her other job, not only does she receive wrecks,

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.640
 but she's responsible for dealing with all stranded royal fish.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.640
 - Oh, really?

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.240
 - She must keep her busy.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.480
 So all the fish that the Queen owns,

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.120
 which theoretically is all dolphins, porpoises and whales

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.440
 that get stranded on British beaches,

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.520
 they belong to the monarchy since the 13th century.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.320
 I think they made the rule

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.320
 because you used to get whale oil and stuff for them

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.840
 and technically the monarchy can claim that whale oil.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.600
 And she's responsible for dealing with them.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.160
 So for porpoises stranded, you call Camilla.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.040
 And she doesn't like drag the whale over to Buckingham Palace

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.400
 and say, "Here you go, your Majesty."

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.000
 - He drops it at the Queen's bedroom door

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.800
 and says, "You asked for this 700 years ago."

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.360
 - If Prince Charles's goldfish ever jumps out of its bowl

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.040
 and accidentally gets stranded on the carpet,

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.280
 she technically is the person who has to deal with it.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.880
 I think responsibility.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.880
 - Anna, you were saying just before that shipwreck buys

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.360
 about 250,000 or off the coast of...

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.760
 - Britain, they think, yeah.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.680
 I was amazed to hear, we don't know exactly

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.360
 how many bombs are in the oceans around the British Isles,

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.720
 except for the fact we do know that just after World War II,

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.280
 the British government dumped roughly 1.17 million tons

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.880
 of chemical weapons and conventional bombs into the sea,

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.800
 just off our coasts.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.920
 And I should quickly say, I got this fact,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.600
 as well as a lot of the things I've been saying

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.720
 about the Richard Montgomery ship we've been talking about

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.440
 from a Vice article by a guy called Joe Zado.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.920
 It's a fascinating article about what we're talking about right now,

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.440
 so give that a read if you can.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.240
 But he was saying that in 1995,

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.640
 while they were drilling an undersea gas line

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.400
 between Scotland and Northern Ireland,

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.080
 they hit one of the stashes of these bombs

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.360
 that had been dropped down there,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.560
 and it released a bunch of them.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.600
 And within a month, 4,500 of them had washed up

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.440
 to the west coast of Scotland.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.920
 So we've just got bombs washing up on the shores

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.720
 and nitroglycerine vials and it's terrifying.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.120
 It was only one nitroglycerine vial, wasn't it?

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.480
 One child said that they did that.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.360
 One reported.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.960
 Oh yeah, one reported.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.600
 There is a place in Russia which has a ship's graveyard

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.200
 of nuclear submarine engines, which sounds terrifying.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.560
 So it's a place called the Karras Sea.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.760
 And the problem is that nuclear submarines,

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.800
 they last about 30 years and then they start rattling,

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.000
 they get a bit noisier in the water,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.520
 so they're less secret and the technology gets outdated

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.200
 and you're just building better subs.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.280
 And at its height, Russia had 245 nuclear submarines,

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.960
 which is a lot of nuclear power in the water.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.240
 And so now there is this place

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.600
 which contains 14 nuclear reactors

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.160
 and 17,000 containers of hazardous material.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.920
 And the Russian authorities would like to scrap these

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.520
 and properly scrap them and decommission them,

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.680
 but apparently it relies on recovery vessels

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.200
 which don't yet exist.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.840
 So this is a task.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.760
 Don't build stuff, you can't unbuild.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.160
 The UK is similar.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.560
 I think we've got, we certainly had a couple of years ago,

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.960
 20 nuclear submarines left over from the Cold War

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.720
 that we don't know what to do with.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.960
 Can't really afford to dismantle.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.040
 Why don't we just dump them next to this thing here?

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.200
 There was a plan, wasn't there,

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.480
 to put like a massive concrete casing over this ship,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.160
 I think, you know, like they did in Chernobyl.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.920
 But at the moment, every kind of few years,

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.360
 the government kind of has a meeting with some experts

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.120
 and they say, "What should we do about this?"

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.040
 And then at the end of the meeting, everyone goes,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.080
 "Should we just leave it then?"

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:30.640
 Yeah, that's just...

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.120
 Yeah, it's so British.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.160
 It's really embarrassing.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.880
 It's amazing.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.720
 Maybe the worst ever reason for a shipwreck was in 2003,

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.680
 which was a two and a half thousand ton ship

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.600
 called the RMS Mulheim,

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.360
 and it was sunk by a pair of trousers.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.680
 Can we work out why that happened,

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.200
 or is that going to be impossible?

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.200
 Okay, so what could a pair of trousers done?

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.760
 Oh, someone snagged their trousers on the port

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.960
 as the ship was leaving,

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.040
 but the cloth was so strong

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.200
 that it managed to pull down the entire ship.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.360
 You're not far off.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.640
 I must be miles off.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.360
 That sounds like that would be a trousers advert.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.520
 That's a Levi-June's advert for the durability of that material.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.080
 What it was, is it was the officer who was on watch.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.880
 He was at the bridge.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.240
 He was sitting in a chair.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.760
 He tried to stand up,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.200
 but his trousers snagged,

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.960
 and he lost his balance,

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.200
 fell over, knocked himself out briefly.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.640
 By the time he came around,

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.040
 the ship was heading straight for the shoreline,

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.320
 and there was nothing he could do about it,

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.160
 because it takes about five miles to stop these ships.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.920
 So bang, shipwreck.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.760
 I'll be honest, you said I wasn't far off,

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.040
 but really the only thing I got right was the trousers part.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.320
 That's true.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.440
 You'd already told us.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.400
 I had to give you a little clue, yeah.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.040
 Again, I think attributing blame to the trousers there

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.440
 is a bit like attributing blame to the French Revolution

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.920
 for the death of old Governor Morris.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.120
 The courts disagree with you, Anna,

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.080
 because the trousers were sued for 20 million pounds.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.440
 They're still in jail.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.640
 They've been in prison since, yeah.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.680
 Do they have to wear prison trousers over the trousers?

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:13.920
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.120
 and that is my fact.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.920
 My fact this week is that the nine-to-five singer,

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.240
 Dolly Parton, helped fund a COVID vaccine

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.600
 that has a protection rate of nine-to-five percent.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.200
 Nine-to-five percent.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.680
 Fortunately, not nine-to-five percent,

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.840
 because that actually would not be a very effective vaccine.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:38.240
 Yeah, Dolly Parton, she's amazing with charity.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.480
 She's always making donations to incredible causes,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.760
 and one of the things that she did back in April of 2020

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.680
 was she donated a million dollars to COVID-19 research,

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.720
 and she sent that to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.120
 And the money went towards the Moderna vaccine,

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.800
 which came out, which has a nearly 95,

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.160
 I discovered at the last second,

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:05.520
 it's sort of 94.5 percent effect in this against corona.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.400
 Well, there'll be letters.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.680
 But everyone rounds it up to 95, so I think we're safe.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.320
 Very good.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.520
 I should say I found this fact while looking through Twitter

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.480
 on the day that it happened.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.400
 A lot of people made this connection,

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.040
 so it was a nice little joke going around about Dolly Parton,

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.960
 and I thought, let's do it on the show.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.920
 Do we think that they suppressed the effectiveness rate

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.880
 of the vaccine to make sure that they could create this fact?

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.120
 Could they have made a 99 percent effective one,

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.960
 but they knew it would ruin the gag?

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.000
 But that was Jay-Z had given the money for that one, hadn't he?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.480
 Or for older people, Nina, from 99 Red Balloons fame.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:45.360
 But if you kind of do your jokes for different generations,

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.360
 then you get more hits, don't you?

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.880
 Absolutely.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.680
 You'll stand up.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.960
 One out of three jokes you'll get.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.160
 The other two for the other two-thirds of the audience.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.400
 James' stand-up gags is where the audience is rigidly divided

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.440
 by age into tranches, and he'll turn to one set of crowds.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.560
 They're all in triangles.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.240
 Now, what you guys don't know about Jay-Z is that

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.760
 Dolly Parton's pretty cool.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.120
 I didn't know anything about Dolly Parton,

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:17.840
 apart from Big Hair and she's famous also for her boobs,

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.280
 and she sings 95.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.240
 I knew 95, and I knew Joe Lee, and that's basically all I knew,

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.320
 but my God, she's had an interesting life.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.040
 She grew up in a little place in Tennessee,

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.280
 which is, I think, better known as the home of the world's largest

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.160
 Titanic museum.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.000
 What, Belfast?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.280
 Pigeon Forge.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.480
 Pigeon Forge, man.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.160
 Yeah, in extreme poverty, it was so poor there that the funeral home

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.640
 kept sets of teeth from people who'd been buried,

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.720
 and you could go down and get a set if you needed a set of teeth.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.520
 Really?

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.240
 Yeah.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:50.880
 Wow.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.720
 Yeah, and her family was so poor.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.560
 She was the fourth of 12 children.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.760
 Supposedly, they had no money to pay the doctor who delivered her,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.200
 so instead, the dad gave him a bag of oatmeal as payment.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.560
 That was the first exchange.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.240
 She's got quite an oat-based childhood.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.040
 Her childhood was bookended by oats,

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.200
 because then, after she graduated high school,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.840
 she says that she got on a bus straight away to go to Nashville

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.400
 to make her fortune doing music in the city,

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.880
 and she got on a bus with what she described as her suitcase,

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.360
 which was actually an empty box of Quaker Oats.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.560
 Really?

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.840
 Which isn't going to hold much,

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.440
 unless Quaker Oats came in much larger, much stronger boxes back then.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.840
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.160
 Yeah.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.560
 They were so poor that they ate a lot of animals

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.240
 that the father could find, didn't they?

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.240
 So she said they would eat turtle, frogs, groundhogs,

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.000
 but they never ate possum,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.560
 because apparently, possum is the most disgusting meat

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.840
 that you can eat around there.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.720
 Wow.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.920
 So they never did that, yeah.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.920
 She also used to get by on room service.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.120
 That sounds fancy.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.280
 In Nashville, she would walk up and down hotel corridors

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.120
 looking for half-eaten trays of room service

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.760
 that people had left outside their rooms.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.360
 That must have stuck with her throughout life,

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.280
 the idea of food not being available,

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.440
 because even at this age, still on tour,

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.600
 she always makes sure she has a packed lunch

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.680
 or snacks with her wherever she goes,

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.800
 despite her millions,

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.920
 and despite probably access to any restaurant she wants.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.320
 She will always have things like potted meat

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.440
 or a Vienna sausage with her in order to...

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.080
 With her?

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.720
 So if you sit just in her pocket or something,

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.400
 she's always got a sausage in her pocket.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.680
 Those outfits are very tight.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.560
 And if you look, you can see the outline of a sausage

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.080
 at some point on her person.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.240
 And she's actually got a completely flat chest,

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.560
 but her bra is just stuffed with potted meat.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.360
 The only fact I really knew about Dolly Parton before this

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.440
 is that she once lost a Dolly Parton lookalike competition.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.840
 That's like an old bit of trivia

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.120
 that you kind of see every now and then,

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.400
 but I looked into it and it's slightly different than that.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.800
 She basically entered a drag queen celebrity impersonator contest.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.080
 Okay.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.800
 And there were loads of drag queens there,

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.880
 and they were all dressed as different people,

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.200
 like Cher or Dolly Parton or whatever,

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.280
 but they couldn't be dressed as anyone they wanted.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.840
 And also they had to be drag queens.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.280
 So you had this beautiful kind of massive hair

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.080
 and all that makeup and eyelashes and stuff.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.480
 And Dolly Parton, as great as she looked,

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.080
 was just dressed as Dolly Parton.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.720
 So obviously she didn't look anything like a drag queen

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.000
 pretending to be Dolly Parton.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.120
 She looked like Dolly Parton.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.200
 So of course she didn't win.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.000
 That's interesting.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.960
 I didn't know that.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.920
 That's how they justify it.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.080
 That sounds like the judge's justification speech

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.760
 at the end when he realized who she was.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.040
 Okay.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.640
 Reloaded.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.680
 How do we get out of this one?

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.000
 She has released over 200 albums in her career.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.240
 200 albums.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.680
 That's so stupid.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.240
 That's like Buffalo Bill with Bison for me.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.560
 Like, how can you do that many?

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.480
 Like, 185 compilation albums worldwide she's released.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.680
 Oh, 185 compilations.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.960
 She's only made 15 albums,

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.480
 and she's done 185 compilations

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.240
 of incredibly different combinations.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.160
 That's the thing.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.080
 If your album has 15 tracks in,

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.560
 there are 15 factorial possibilities

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.000
 of putting those in any order.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.040
 So you could do that.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.200
 But now you've got Spotify now,

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.960
 which does it in a random order anyway.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.480
 You can no longer justify the 185 different orders.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:14.960
 She's had--

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.360
 Why are we not releasing each episode four different times?

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.760
 Great idea.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.280
 51 studio albums, which I still think is insane.

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.080
 That's a lot.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:24.880
 Yeah, it is mad.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.800
 And she says she's written over 3,000 songs.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.280
 Not all of them have been recorded.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.280
 But that's a lot of songwriting.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.720
 And with a lot of hits as well.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.000
 Jolene, as you mentioned, Andy, I will always love you,

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.400
 which for me, I only know through Whitney Houston.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.120
 But it's good.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.320
 I only know it through Saddam Hussein, that one.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.680
 I know it was beautiful.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.880
 That's right.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.320
 It's a cool about that if you don't get,

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.440
 then you're going to have your suspicions

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.960
 about James's political leanings.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.800
 Oh, she wrote those two in the same day, actually.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.680
 Which is just both the question,

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.200
 what has she done for the last 40 years,

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.040
 giving them the two most famous?

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.160
 It is like Buffalo Bill,

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.680
 because he killed like 48 buffaloes in six hours,

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.200
 which meant it could take a few weeks off.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.000
 And she didn't say it.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 She just knocked them out.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.400
 She doesn't quite remember if she wrote them on the same day.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.280
 That's the problem.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.360
 But they're on the same tape or the same...

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.920
 The evidence that she has suggests

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.760
 that they were written in the same session.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.960
 And she sort of says,

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.640
 people always say that was a good writing day.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.120
 She's a very good self-promoter

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.400
 in the best possible way, isn't she?

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.080
 So every interview she gives,

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.800
 she remembers these amazing details about her life.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.080
 And then sometimes she remembers

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.280
 slightly contradictory things.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.440
 But she definitely knows...

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.520
 That's such a nice way of saying so was a liar.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.760
 She's a self-promotorizer.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.520
 She's had a long old life.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.160
 And, you know, you can't remember everything.

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.000
 But she does say that she wears stilettos

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.280
 to make breakfast every day.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.960
 Like she's always dressed up.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.200
 It's not like she goes home, takes off her wig,

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.640
 takes off her makeup.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.440
 Pills out the sausage.

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.480
 Chunks of meat out and devours them.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.680
 She says she wants to make sure

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.040
 she's always ambulance ready,

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.160
 which is quite a nice way of describing it.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.680
 It's got to come at 4 a.m.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.080
 You know, there's one of her songs

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.200
 that we haven't heard,

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.880
 which is called My Place in History.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.080
 And it's not going to be revealed

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.600
 until her 100th birthday,

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.760
 which is going to be the 19th of January, 2046.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.680
 She should do it on her 95th birthday.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.960
 Shouldn't she really?

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.520
 Yes, so it had 9 to 5.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.760
 But it's locked in a box in Dollywood.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.960
 So if you want to petition them

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.240
 to release it early, James, you can.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.160
 But until then, it's going to be in a box

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.520
 and they're going to release it then.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.880
 And I don't know what happened.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.680
 That's very exciting.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.240
 That's very cool.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:36.640
 Yeah.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.040
 Dollywood is very cool, by the way.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.840
 I mean, not many people have their own theme park.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.880
 And Dolly Parkton is one of those refu.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.280
 It's packed with roller coaster rides

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.880
 and all sorts of fun things.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:52.240
 But she inherited an existing theme park,

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.600
 which had been changing ownership for many, many years.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.200
 It started, Dollywood initially,

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.440
 as a place called Rebel Railroad.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.080
 And the idea was that there was a steam train.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.000
 They had a general shop as well and a few other things.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.120
 But you could get on this theme-inspired train.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.760
 And it was to celebrate the centennial anniversary

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.960
 of the Civil War.

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.320
 So as you were on the train,

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.800
 you would be attacked by Union soldiers.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.280
 You would have train robbers trying to rob you.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.640
 You would have Native Americans trying to rob you as well.

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.560
 And you were protected on board this train

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:25.200
 by the Confederates who were fighting off the attackers

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.240
 as they were coming for you.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.200
 That was what Dollywood started as, this little train.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.320
 It was a celebration of the fact

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.320
 the Confederates won the Civil War, wasn't it?

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.400
 Certainly sounds like very confusing for everyone,

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.200
 if you're saying, if you're positioning it like that.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.760
 And in fact, Dolly does say that when she was growing up,

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.520
 one of the things she thought was that the Confederates

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.400
 won the Civil War.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:42.960
 Wow.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.680
 Different when she was young.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.000
 Really?

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.640
 Yeah.

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.120
 Well, she did used to have a Civil War themed restaurant as well.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.840
 Which was a dinner experience called Dixie Stampede,

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.320
 where you had to choose which side you were on,

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.000
 north or south in the Civil War.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.600
 She has since changed that a bit.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.160
 Well, she actually, she renamed it, didn't she?

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.920
 Quite recently, Dollyparton Stampede,

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.400
 because she didn't realise the word Dixie had

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.480
 quite problematic connotations

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.000
 with the black community in America.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.280
 Dollyparton Stampede, however,

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.280
 is a terrifying name for something.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.640
 Imagine 30,000 Dollypartons stampeding towards you.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.560
 I'm just one more thing on Dollywood.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.640
 Dolly doesn't go on the rides herself.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.840
 She's not tall enough, is she?

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.040
 She is five foot two.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.160
 She doesn't go on it because she says it could damage her hair.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.080
 And she also said,

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.080
 "This is interesting, considering what we've been talking about."

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.640
 She said, "Lord knows what else could fall out of me."

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.200
 And I think that might be a reference to the secret sausage

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.280
 or the possum leaf in the bosom.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.640
 Imagine if you sat behind Dollyparton,

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.480
 and just as the photo comes up,

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.920
 the sausage hits you in the face.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.680
 "Pepper Army Cascade on the Looper Loops."

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:53.520
 Her marriage is sort of an amazing love story, isn't it?

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:58.400
 With Carl Dean, who she's been married to for 57 years,

00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.760
 although there have always been rumours

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.640
 that he doesn't exist because he's never, ever seen in public.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.880
 But she said that this is because in 1966,

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.560
 sort of just after they got married,

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.600
 she won this award for a song called "Put It Off Until Tomorrow".

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.480
 And they had an award ceremony to go to.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.680
 And she got all dressed up.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.720
 He got all dressed up.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.840
 They went to the ceremony.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.360
 They came back home afterwards and he said,

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.920
 "Don't you ever make me go to one of those damn things again?"

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.960
 And she didn't.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.480
 And he just hates the limelight.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.760
 Absolutely loves her.

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.480
 Obviously stuck it out for almost six decades.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.600
 But he's never been to a gig either.

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.880
 He doesn't need to be sat on stage at the gig.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.200
 He can be quite anonymous in the crowd watching it,

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.560
 but he's never gone to a gig.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.760
 What if he doesn't like her kind of music?

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.960
 He actually doesn't.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.160
 He says he likes hard rock and bluegrass and stuff.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.640
 But he does actually see her perform sometimes,

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.600
 or at least he goes to her gigs when she performs at state fairs.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.600
 And that's because he really likes going to the tractor pool.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:00.160
 Okay, so he's hearing it in the background.

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.680
 He's not been to her gig.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.080
 He's watching the tractor pull away while she's singing back.

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.120
 Can you keep it down over there?

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.400
 I can't hear the tractors.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.800
 Okay, that's it.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.920
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.200
