00:00:13,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:26,00:00:30,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:30,00:00:36,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:43,"Starting with fact number one and that is James. Okay, my fact this week, embrace yourselves people,"
00:00:43,00:00:48,"is that founding father of the United States of America, Governor Morris, died after sticking a"
00:00:48,00:00:54,"whale bone into his own penis. I mean, you would expect that you might die after sticking it to"
00:00:54,00:01:00,someone else's penis because they would be so angry with you. Yeah. He did it to himself. He did it to
00:01:00,00:01:05,"himself. It's quite a sad story. It's quite a funny story, James. It's quite funny. Yeah, I mean,"
00:01:05,00:01:15,was this the asphyxia wank of the 1870s? It wasn't that. Basically. The great opening with this fact
00:01:15,00:01:22,"immediately. Okay, so basically, first of all, Governor Morris, you might know him if you've"
00:01:22,00:01:28,"never heard his name said as Gouverneur Morris, because that's how his first name is pronounced,"
00:01:28,00:01:35,but he was a big deal. He was known as the pen man of the Constitution. He signed the articles of
00:01:35,00:01:40,the Confederation and the Constitution. He helped plan the Erie Canal. He helped lay out the streets
00:01:40,00:01:47,"of Manhattan. Here's a real proper big deal in the early United States, but he had some problem"
00:01:47,00:01:52,with his urinary tract. We don't know exactly what it was. It could have been just a UTI urinary
00:01:52,00:01:55,"tract infection. It could have been something more serious, but whatever it was, he decided"
00:01:55,00:02:02,to self-medicate and try and clear the blockage in his penis. What are you going to do that with?
00:02:02,00:02:07,"Obviously, with a whale bone. When I say a whale bone, I don't mean like the backbone of a blue"
00:02:07,00:02:12,"whale or something like that. It was a kind of almost like an early plastic, which was taken"
00:02:12,00:02:19,from the Baleen of Wales. It could have been like the ear of a pair of spectacles or the
00:02:19,00:02:23,"handle of a knife or something. All that stuff was made out of whale bone. Anyway, he took a"
00:02:23,00:02:29,"piece of this, put it in his penis, gave himself a very even worse infection, and eventually died"
00:02:29,00:02:35,"of said infection. Such a shame. I really hope that the day before he did this, he was having"
00:02:35,00:02:40,"a chat with friends going, ""What do you think in like 200, 300 years they're going to remember me?"""
00:02:40,00:02:44,Imagine a podcast as a fact about me. What do you think that's going to be?
00:02:45,00:02:49,It's so unfair because he's one of the most interesting people. He's one of the most
00:02:49,00:02:54,"interesting founding fathers, I think. There's so much amazing stuff about him. Yet, I think this"
00:02:54,00:02:58,is the only thing holding it back from him having a big budget musical about him. It should have
00:02:58,00:03:04,been Morris instead of Hamilton. I don't really want to see the final part of that musical.
00:03:04,00:03:08,Hamilton was so clever to get into and die of that rather than the whale bone thing.
00:03:10,00:03:17,"So, this was a guy. He was very, like Andy says, an extremely crazy character of the late 18th century."
00:03:17,00:03:23,"He's quite letharious, wasn't he, as well, which is something that comes up as much as"
00:03:23,00:03:27,his sort of political achievements. The fact that- But less than the whale bone of the penis.
00:03:27,00:03:33,"That's the ranking order, yeah. Whale bone penis, penmanship of the Constitution,"
00:03:33,00:03:40,"likes to kiss ladies a lot. That's the order. Yeah, he had a lot of"
00:03:40,00:03:45,"injuries that were supposedly connected to his womanizing. He had a peg leg, for example,"
00:03:45,00:03:50,"later on in life, and that was a result supposedly of him trying to escape a furious"
00:03:50,00:03:54,"husband. That's a rumor, but it comes up a lot. I think it's not true. Yeah, I agree. I think it's"
00:03:54,00:03:59,not true. He did have a carriage accident and he lost the leg in that. And it's a really tragic
00:03:59,00:04:04,"story. That's the bit I assumed you believed, Andy. I didn't think it was the husband running away."
00:04:05,00:04:10,"No, but he clearly did do a lot of running away from husbands in his time. But he was taking"
00:04:10,00:04:14,"the reins of a carriage in New York. I think it was in New York, maybe it was elsewhere."
00:04:14,00:04:18,He was taking the reins of a carriage and the horse is bolted and his leg was broken in several
00:04:18,00:04:24,"places. And then his regular doctor wasn't available. And the doctor, they got in and said,"
00:04:24,00:04:28,"""Well, we'll have to amputate this below the knee."" And so they did. And then his real doctor,"
00:04:28,00:04:32,"his regular doctor, came back and said, ""Oh, we could absolutely have saved your leg."""
00:04:34,00:04:38,"You can see why he started self-medicating later in life, can't you?"
00:04:38,00:04:45,"But he was okay with the leg amputation. In fact, I think that he might have been happy about it,"
00:04:45,00:04:49,"because it really cemented his reputation as a bit of a character. And even at the time,"
00:04:49,00:04:54,a friend visited him the day after he'd had it off and hasn't had the leg off.
00:04:54,00:04:59,"Well, that's probably where the rumor started, actually. They were like, ""What happened with"
00:04:59,00:05:05,"your leg?"" He said, ""Oh, I had it off."" They're like, ""Oh, really?"" His friend was trying to do the"
00:05:05,00:05:09,"good thing of telling him the advantages of his situation, saying, ""Look, with one leg, you're"
00:05:09,00:05:13,going to build up such great strength of character. It's a great challenge to have to overcome in
00:05:13,00:05:18,"life. You'll be a better man for it."" And Morris immediately said, ""You argue the matter so handsomely"
00:05:18,00:05:23,and point out so clearly the advantages of being without legs that I am tempted to part with the
00:05:23,00:05:29,"other."" So he took it in good humor. Didn't he still also use it in battle?"
00:05:29,00:05:37,Really? No. Did he? Yeah. I think this is another story. Go on. This is another story that he used
00:05:37,00:05:41,"to beat off revolutionaries with his peg leg, again, a good off. Beat off is another thing where he"
00:05:41,00:05:49,"was a secretary. I think that there was one incident where he was posted to Paris by Washington,"
00:05:49,00:05:52,and it was around about the time when there were quite a lot of revolutionaries on the streets of
00:05:52,00:05:56,"Paris. And they said, ""Don't come out in your carriages."" And he'd come out in his carriage"
00:05:56,00:06:01,"anyway, and they descended on his carriage one time. And apparently, he said that he stuck his"
00:06:01,00:06:06,"wooden leg out the window and said something like, ""Oh, look, I've got this fighting for freedom too,"
00:06:06,00:06:11,"so lay off."" And they did. Yeah. They were shouting, ""He's an aristocrat. He's an aristocrat because"
00:06:11,00:06:15,"he's in a lovely carriage."" And then he shouted, ""Yes, truly, one who lost his leg in the cause of"
00:06:15,00:06:19,"liberty."" And he kind of brandished his wooden leg at them. But there's another version of the"
00:06:19,00:06:22,story where he just pulled off his leg and shoved it out of the window to distract the
00:06:22,00:06:25,crowd. And they all started chasing off the bloke over the carriage.
00:06:25,00:06:28,Like one of those lizards that kind of got soft at the end of their tail.
00:06:28,00:06:36,"Wow. As a two-year-old, he was sold for $600,000. What? Really?"
00:06:36,00:06:40,"I'm joking. That's a racehorse also called Governor Morris, which..."
00:06:40,00:06:45,"There aren't many Governor Morrisers, are there? I mean, Governor itself,"
00:06:45,00:06:50,"not a very popular name, ""governure"". It was actually his mother's maiden name,"
00:06:50,00:06:55,"and it's what's morphed in to be ""governor"" today. The spelling has turned into our modern-day"
00:06:55,00:06:59,"spelling of ""governor"". But I did outside of your racehorse, Andy. I found one other Governor"
00:06:59,00:07:05,"Morris, which was a novelist, Governor Morris IV, who was actually a descendant of Governor Morrisers."
00:07:05,00:07:11,"And he wrote a bunch of novels. And his novels were often adapted into movies,"
00:07:11,00:07:18,"including one called ""The Penalty"", which was released in 1920. And it was about a legless man"
00:07:18,00:07:24,"and starred Lon Shady, a good friend. You're joking."
00:07:24,00:07:30,"No. The descendant of Governor Morris. Yeah, I wrote a Lon Shady legless movie,"
00:07:30,00:07:35,"as referenced in last week's episode. In that film, then, he plays a man with no legs,"
00:07:35,00:07:40,"whose legs were unnecessarily amputated, just like that of Governor Morris."
00:07:40,00:07:45,It feels like they didn't use much imagination for the plot of this film.
00:07:45,00:07:49,They just basically looked into the family history of one of their lead men.
00:07:49,00:07:53,"I think they had a punch on for weird names, because one of his brothers was called ""Stat""."
00:07:53,00:07:58,Okay. How many A's do you spell that?
00:07:58,00:08:03,Okay. It's only a double A. But how do you pronounce a double A? It's S-T-Double-A-T-S.
00:08:03,00:08:06,Governor Morris' wife's middle name was Gary. Do you know why?
00:08:06,00:08:12,You know what? I thought that. And I read somewhere that she was called Gary.
00:08:12,00:08:16,"But then, I just doubted myself and quickly googled it. And on Wikipedia,"
00:08:16,00:08:22,"she's called Anne Gary, C-A-R-Y Morris. I read Gary in a few places."
00:08:22,00:08:26,"That was a big scandal as well, because she was his housekeeper,"
00:08:26,00:08:30,"and she was a fair bit younger than him, 22 years younger than him."
00:08:30,00:08:32,"And he wrote in his diary. He had an amazingly naughty diary,"
00:08:32,00:08:35,where he wrote all sorts of rude things that he'd been up to.
00:08:35,00:08:39,"He said, ""I married this day Anne Gary Randolph. No small surprise to my guests."""
00:08:40,00:08:43,"So, he clearly liked causing a fuss."
00:08:43,00:08:48,"Well, because he genuinely did surprise them with it as a Christmas present."
00:08:48,00:08:52,"I think he invited all his family around for Christmas dinner, as you do."
00:08:52,00:08:56,"And then, in the middle of it, called a vicarin, whatever,"
00:08:56,00:08:59,"got someone to, you know, had planned in advance called a vicarin,"
00:08:59,00:09:03,"and gotten to marry them, got him to marry them in front of everyone."
00:09:03,00:09:05,"So, I think it was quite a surprise. Not what you'd expect."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"Well, it would have been surprised when they said,"
00:09:07,00:09:13,"""Do you Anne Gary Randolph?"" It's like that episode of Only Fools and Horses,"
00:09:13,00:09:16,"when they find out that Rodney's middle name is whatever it is,"
00:09:16,00:09:18,Charlton or Crystal Palace or whatever it is.
00:09:18,00:09:21,"We should say that part of the reason she was controversial,"
00:09:21,00:09:24,"as well as being his housekeeper, is that she was thought to have killed her baby."
00:09:24,00:09:28,"There were sort of two things. There was the housekeeper thing,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,"and there was the, ""Did you kill your baby thing?"""
00:09:30,00:09:33,Was earlier in her life.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"She married her brother-in-law, hadn't she?"
00:09:35,00:09:37,"Oh, no, she'd had an affair with her brother-in-law."
00:09:38,00:09:39,Allegedly.
00:09:39,00:09:44,"Allegedly. And the baby supposedly, allegedly, came from that affair,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"and she was allegedly so embarrassed that she killed the baby,"
00:09:47,00:09:49,but she said it was still both.
00:09:49,00:09:49,Allegedly.
00:09:49,00:09:49,Yes.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Allegedly.
00:09:50,00:09:54,"But she was from a bizarre family, by which I mean,"
00:09:54,00:09:56,her family estate was called bizarre.
00:09:56,00:09:59,Brilliant. Brilliant.
00:09:59,00:10:03,"That's great, because we don't have to say allegedly for that bit."
00:10:03,00:10:04,They can't sue us.
00:10:04,00:10:07,"No, they can't. It's just a place called bizarre."
00:10:07,00:10:08,It's in Virginia.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"Just, I mean, just on this guy's actual career,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"which we probably should touch on briefly,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,because it was unbelievably successful.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"And obviously, as James said, he was incredibly influential."
00:10:18,00:10:20,"One of the things he did was, he came up with the phrase,"
00:10:20,00:10:22,"""We the people of the United States."""
00:10:22,00:10:29,"And this was in an early draft of, is it the Declaration?"
00:10:29,00:10:30,It's the Constitution.
00:10:30,00:10:31,"The Constitution, sorry."
00:10:32,00:10:35,"So that was in the Constitution, and the phrase,"
00:10:35,00:10:36,"""We the people of the United States."""
00:10:36,00:10:38,"In an earlier draft, it was,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,"""We the people of the States of New Hampshire,"
00:10:40,00:10:42,"Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,"
00:10:42,00:10:44,"Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,"Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,"
00:10:47,00:10:47,"and Georgia."""
00:10:47,00:10:50,"And he said, ""I think we've got an edit in here."""
00:10:50,00:10:53,And he came up with that lovely phrase.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"And this is claimed to have been an absolute stroke of genius,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"and does make me think that we're bringing him up too much,"
00:10:57,00:11:00,because I reckon I could have come up with that edit.
00:11:01,00:11:04,And he left a bunch of spelling mistakes in the actual document.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"There was a Pennsylvania, it was spelled with one N,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,which apparently sometimes it could be seen to be
00:11:10,00:11:12,"spelled like that back in the day, but not really very often."
00:11:12,00:11:16,"Well, which two Ns did they remove from Pennsylvania then?"
00:11:16,00:11:20,"Sorry, it was Pennsylvania, in fact."
00:11:20,00:11:21,Got it.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"No, it was, sorry, it was spelled with two Ns,"
00:11:23,00:11:24,but without the double.
00:11:24,00:11:29,"And even worse, there was a sentence in the Constitution"
00:11:29,00:11:34,"that said the fragment is necessary for executing its inspection laws,"
00:11:34,00:11:37,"and there was an apostrophe between the T and the S of it,"
00:11:37,00:11:39,the possessive it.
00:11:39,00:11:42,"On the Declaration of Independence, slightly different,"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"but around the same time, of course,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"it's signed by the Founding Fathers,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"signed by one woman, or one woman's name was on there."
00:11:50,00:11:51,Do you know who that might be?
00:11:51,00:11:52,Gary.
00:11:52,00:11:52,Gary.
00:11:52,00:11:55,That's how she got away with it.
00:11:55,00:11:58,"Everyone was like, well, Gary's obviously a man's name."
00:11:58,00:12:00,Who is it?
00:12:00,00:12:04,"It's Mary Catherine Goddard, and the reason she got on there"
00:12:04,00:12:07,"is because she owned a publishing house in Baltimore,"
00:12:07,00:12:11,and she printed out the Declaration of Independence.
00:12:11,00:12:15,"And at the very, very bottom, it says printed by Mary Catherine Goddard."
00:12:15,00:12:19,So there is a woman's name on the Declaration of Independence.
00:12:19,00:12:21,"And you might think, okay, well, that's a bit of a cheat,"
00:12:21,00:12:22,and I suppose it kind of is.
00:12:22,00:12:25,"But by doing that, basically, she opened herself up to trees"
00:12:25,00:12:27,and charges and stuff like that.
00:12:27,00:12:30,"So it would have been very easy for her to not put her name on there,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,but she saw it was such an important document
00:12:32,00:12:33,that she thought she should be on there.
00:12:33,00:12:34,It was kind of cool.
00:12:34,00:12:34,Very cool.
00:12:34,00:12:40,There's a very famous statue that people are probably familiar with
00:12:40,00:12:44,"that is mostly Governor Morris, and that is the--"
00:12:44,00:12:46,Is it the statue of Long John Silver?
00:12:46,00:12:50,Is it the whale at the Natural History Museum?
00:12:50,00:12:53,"Oh, no."
00:12:53,00:12:54,That wasn't most of him.
00:12:54,00:12:58,His penis didn't take up most of his body.
00:12:58,00:13:03,"But he was very large, very tall, and a lot of people have commented"
00:13:03,00:13:06,"that the Founding Fathers, many of them are quite short and rotund,"
00:13:06,00:13:09,and that's partly because they drank in a huge amount
00:13:09,00:13:10,while they were writing the Constitution.
00:13:10,00:13:14,"And he was tall and slim, much like Washington."
00:13:14,00:13:18,"So when the great French sculptor, Houdon,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,"was commissioned to do a sculpture of Washington,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,which is the very famous one that's now--
00:13:23,00:13:24,It's in the state capital of Virginia.
00:13:24,00:13:26,It's copied sort of everywhere.
00:13:26,00:13:27,"It's like he's got his hand on a pillar,"
00:13:27,00:13:29,and then another hand on a stick.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"That's Washington's head, but it's Governor Morris's body."
00:13:32,00:13:35,And this is--
00:13:35,00:13:38,"Yeah, the sculptor popped over from France to DC,"
00:13:38,00:13:41,"took lots of mass of Washington's face,"
00:13:41,00:13:45,took a lot of eye photographs of his body.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"But then when he went back to France,"
00:13:47,00:13:50,"he realized that Morris was in France as well,"
00:13:50,00:13:51,"so he called him around to his house and said,"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"""Can I use your body as the model for my statue?"""
00:13:53,00:13:55,"Wow, can I ask whose leg it is?"
00:13:55,00:13:58,"Like, is it his wife's leg?"
00:13:58,00:14:01,"I think maybe it's Gary's leg, and if you look at it,"
00:14:01,00:14:04,"it's the extremely spelt kind of woman's leg,"
00:14:04,00:14:07,"and then a big man's body, and then Washington's head."
00:14:07,00:14:11,"Well, if you do look at it, one leg is longer than the other,"
00:14:11,00:14:16,"and that's why, because he dressed him up in Washington's clothes,"
00:14:16,00:14:20,"but his wooden leg had to extend to the length of a shoe,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,"so he wouldn't wear a shoe over his leg,"
00:14:22,00:14:24,so his leg was a bit longer than a normal leg.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"So if you look at the statue,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,"the left leg is a little bit longer than the right leg,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,because his leg was longer than the other leg.
00:14:30,00:14:32,That's a great fact.
00:14:32,00:14:34,That's extraordinary.
00:14:34,00:14:35,"That's a pretty crap artist as well,"
00:14:35,00:14:39,who couldn't chisel the way to make sure the legs were the right leg.
00:14:39,00:14:41,You can't fake it.
00:14:41,00:14:43,He was a realist.
00:14:43,00:14:47,So one reason for Governor Morris's death
00:14:47,00:14:52,"could have been the French Revolution in a slightly strange way,"
00:14:52,00:14:55,"and that is because when the French Revolution happened,"
00:14:55,00:14:59,"everyone stopped wearing really posh aristocratic clothes,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,"because as we said before,"
00:15:01,00:15:02,you probably get dragged out of your carriage
00:15:02,00:15:05,"and beaten to death, probably, or guillotined or something."
00:15:05,00:15:11,"These kind of big dresses that women wore had a lot of whalebone in them,"
00:15:11,00:15:16,"and so when the fashion industry in France collapsed,"
00:15:16,00:15:18,"they had all this spare whalebone,"
00:15:18,00:15:20,and the price absolutely plummeted.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"So it was something that you used to not be able to get very easily,"
00:15:23,00:15:26,"and then suddenly you can get it anywhere for any price,"
00:15:26,00:15:30,"and the result of that was this was a really useful material to use,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,"and so they started using it in everything,"
00:15:32,00:15:35,"and so you would have whalebone umbrellas and whalebone,"
00:15:35,00:15:39,"like I said before, knives and spectacles and whatever,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,and so it was because of the French Revolution
00:15:41,00:15:44,"that you had so much whalebone in his house,"
00:15:44,00:15:45,"which meant, I mean,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,maybe he would have found something else to stick up his well with that.
00:15:47,00:15:52,It was because of the revolution that you had this whalebone to hand.
00:15:52,00:15:55,"I mean, amazingly, a torturous link."
00:15:55,00:15:59,They got him in the end after he escaped that carriage incident.
00:15:59,00:16:00,I knew they'd get him eventually.
00:16:00,00:16:08,Did whalebone-related penis nests rocket during that period
00:16:08,00:16:10,when it became widely available?
00:16:10,00:16:11,"I think it probably did, yeah."
00:16:11,00:16:14,"I think we should say he had stuck something up his penis before,"
00:16:14,00:16:16,so we can't exclusively blame the whale.
00:16:16,00:16:17,He had foam.
00:16:17,00:16:18,"Yeah, foam."
00:16:18,00:16:21,He made a catheter once with a flexible piece of hickory.
00:16:21,00:16:23,Hickory dickory cock.
00:16:23,00:16:33,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:16:33,00:16:38,"My fact this week is that before entering a town in the wild west,"
00:16:38,00:16:41,"you had to leave your gun outside, pick up a token,"
00:16:41,00:16:44,"and use that token to collect your gun on the way out,"
00:16:44,00:16:47,but slightly leaving your coat in a bar.
00:16:47,00:16:48,Very sensible.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Wait a minute.
00:16:49,00:16:51,Did they know I've seen lots of wild west movies
00:16:51,00:16:53,and they all have guns all the time?
00:16:53,00:16:56,"And yet, they're all fake."
00:16:56,00:16:58,"They all take place in the cloakroom, don't they?"
00:16:58,00:17:04,"This is, I was just reading a thing recently about how gun control"
00:17:04,00:17:08,in the 19th century in the Old West was really strict.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"And in most frontier towns, carrying any kind of weapon,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,"so a gun or a knife or anything,"
00:17:12,00:17:16,"was not permitted at all, not just publicly at all,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,except if you're outside the town borders or inside your home.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"So if you lived in the town, then you could have a gun,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,but you were only allowed to kill people in your own house.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"And obviously people broke this law,"
00:17:24,00:17:27,"so it's not totally fake when you see westerns,"
00:17:27,00:17:30,because cowboys would go into the town
00:17:30,00:17:32,"and not check their coat into the cloakroom,"
00:17:32,00:17:34,"or their gun into the gun room,"
00:17:34,00:17:37,and then have big shoot-ups and people would die.
00:17:38,00:17:40,"Well, actually, some of the big shoot-outs"
00:17:40,00:17:43,"were as a result of people flouting the law,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,"and then people trying to stop them from flouting the law, right?"
00:17:46,00:17:49,The famous one is the gunfight at the Ok Corral.
00:17:49,00:17:52,And the whole point of that is that the sheriff
00:17:52,00:17:53,"went over to these guys and said,"
00:17:53,00:17:55,"""You're not supposed to have guns here, mate."""
00:17:55,00:17:57,"And they went, ""Well, we do, so, bang."""
00:17:57,00:18:01,"I mean, that's not the whole two-hour film of..."
00:18:01,00:18:04,"It should be, though. It's insane."
00:18:04,00:18:06,So I was reading about the gunfight at the Ok Corral.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"I mean, it lasted 30 seconds."
00:18:08,00:18:10,"So, yeah, there is a lot of padding in the movie."
00:18:10,00:18:14,And I thought it was Wyatt Earp.
00:18:14,00:18:15,"You know, he's one of the famous sheriffs."
00:18:15,00:18:17,But it wasn't really Wyatt Earp.
00:18:17,00:18:18,"It was his brother, Virgil Earp."
00:18:18,00:18:21,"Amazing. I mean, people did just have better names"
00:18:21,00:18:23,in America in the 18th and 19th centuries.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"Yeah, it was him."
00:18:25,00:18:26,And it wasn't at the Ok Corral either.
00:18:26,00:18:29,It was the doors down.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"Yeah, but it sounds better."
00:18:31,00:18:32,"It sounds better, doesn't it, Andy?"
00:18:32,00:18:34,"Well, I read somewhere saying it should have been"
00:18:34,00:18:36,called the Gunfight Outside Flies Photographic Studio.
00:18:36,00:18:39,Yeah?
00:18:39,00:18:40,That doesn't quite work.
00:18:40,00:18:41,"I think that is better, though,"
00:18:41,00:18:44,because the gunfight at the Ok Corral has always confused me
00:18:44,00:18:46,"because of the presence of ""OK"","
00:18:46,00:18:47,"which just means ""OK"" to us."
00:18:47,00:18:49,"I mean, what is an Ok Corral?"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"Was it an amazing Corral? No, no, it was OK."
00:18:51,00:18:56,Three stars on Google TripAdvisor reviews.
00:18:56,00:19:00,"Which stands for Old Kindersley, by the way."
00:19:00,00:19:03,But it's confusing before you've researched it.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"Oh, and what was that?"
00:19:04,00:19:07,The name of the person who ran the Corral?
00:19:07,00:19:09,"Yeah, who ran the horse, the field."
00:19:09,00:19:09,"Oh, really?"
00:19:09,00:19:11,"This Corral was, yeah."
00:19:11,00:19:13,"I'm annoyed that we don't have photos of it,"
00:19:13,00:19:16,given it was literally outside of Photographic Studio.
00:19:16,00:19:17,"Well, they would have had to hold still"
00:19:17,00:19:18,"for a few seconds, wouldn't they?"
00:19:18,00:19:20,Which was a 30-second battle.
00:19:20,00:19:21,You had enough time.
00:19:21,00:19:21,"Yeah, you're right."
00:19:21,00:19:23,"I'm going to say that version that you're saying,"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"it sounds a bit like the Gunfight at Snappy Snaps, doesn't it?"
00:19:26,00:19:32,"Also, I didn't know what a Corral was"
00:19:32,00:19:33,until researching this actual fact.
00:19:33,00:19:34,What is it?
00:19:34,00:19:37,"I mean, it's a horse and livestock holding pen."
00:19:37,00:19:40,"Oh, is it like where you corral horses into the pen or something?"
00:19:40,00:19:42,"Yeah, it's pretty much a car park."
00:19:42,00:19:44,It's the Old West version of a car park.
00:19:44,00:19:49,"So the Wild West, if you're in the Wild West"
00:19:49,00:19:51,"around about Wild West time,"
00:19:51,00:19:54,"which I guess we're talking sort of late 19th century,"
00:19:54,00:19:56,there were camels wandering around with you.
00:19:56,00:20:00,"It's in the early period, really."
00:20:00,00:20:04,"So I hadn't realized that the US, just before the Civil War,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,decided that it wanted to start a camel corps.
00:20:07,00:20:11,And I think the logic was that it was quite successful in Egypt
00:20:11,00:20:14,and the desert plains in parts of America
00:20:14,00:20:15,was pretty similar to Egypt.
00:20:15,00:20:18,So they imported 75 camels altogether.
00:20:18,00:20:21,And they were for the cowboy lands
00:20:21,00:20:23,for the frontier for expanding territory.
00:20:23,00:20:26,So hauling supplies to and fro at the frontier.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"And they weren't that successful,"
00:20:28,00:20:31,"partly because apparently there was a very strong mule lobby,"
00:20:31,00:20:32,"which I think was people who owned mules,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,not the mules themselves.
00:20:34,00:20:36,And then the Civil War came
00:20:36,00:20:38,and everyone forgot about the camels.
00:20:38,00:20:40,And they just wandered feral through the deserts.
00:20:40,00:20:42,"And they were sort of like that,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,"you know, when people see big cats these days"
00:20:44,00:20:46,"in a garden in Barkshire,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,they were that equivalent in Arizona.
00:20:48,00:20:52,"So there was in the 1880s, Arizona was haunted by Red Ghost,"
00:20:52,00:20:56,"which was a 30 foot tall, monstrous red camel,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,which apparently trampled the woman to death.
00:20:58,00:20:59,30 foot tall.
00:20:59,00:21:01,It killed a grizzly bear.
00:21:01,00:21:07,"It, there was one story about how someone spotted it"
00:21:07,00:21:08,in the distance and shot at it.
00:21:08,00:21:11,And it ran away and something fell off its back.
00:21:11,00:21:13,And the thing that fell off its back was a human skeleton
00:21:13,00:21:16,who had been strapped to it obviously long before.
00:21:16,00:21:18,"Anyway, this was, this is all part,"
00:21:18,00:21:19,this all came out of the fact
00:21:19,00:21:20,there were camels wandering the deserts
00:21:20,00:21:23,and the stories got less and less plausible
00:21:23,00:21:24,as people spotted them.
00:21:24,00:21:26,Right.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"So what I'm saying is there were camels,"
00:21:28,00:21:29,but they weren't 30 foot tall
00:21:29,00:21:31,and they didn't eat grizzly bears.
00:21:31,00:21:31,Got it.
00:21:31,00:21:34,"Okay, Dad, make sure you got the right part of that story."
00:21:34,00:21:38,There are other camels in America now.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"I don't, there are probably some."
00:21:40,00:21:41,"There must be some in zoos and things,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,but I just don't wonder if they're any still feral.
00:21:43,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Don't think there are any wanderers anymore.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"You know the Lone Ranger,"
00:21:46,00:21:49,just to go on kind of myths of the old West now.
00:21:49,00:21:52,I had no idea how successful it was.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"So it was a radio show,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,"or one of the early iterations was a radio show,"
00:21:56,00:21:59,which ran for 20 years and 3000 episodes.
00:21:59,00:22:01,It went through about eight different Lone Rangers show.
00:22:01,00:22:02,Yeah.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"There was one time where the actor playing the Lone Ranger,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"who was a guy called Earl Grazer,"
00:22:06,00:22:07,"he was killed in the car accident,"
00:22:07,00:22:09,but they had to just keep making the show.
00:22:09,00:22:10,They couldn't stop making it.
00:22:10,00:22:12,So they just had him speak in a whisper.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"They just got in a replacement,"
00:22:13,00:22:16,who was clearly someone with a completely different voice.
00:22:16,00:22:18,And he just spoke in a whisper for several episodes.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"And Tonto, his sidekick had to do all the actual dialogue"
00:22:21,00:22:22,"and say, what's that Lone Ranger?"
00:22:22,00:22:24,"Oh, I'm still feeling very bad."
00:22:24,00:22:27,And they just kept making it.
00:22:27,00:22:29,It was quite weird in the Wild West
00:22:29,00:22:31,how reality bled into entertainment
00:22:31,00:22:32,"in a semi-confusing way, right?"
00:22:32,00:22:35,"So Buffalo Bill, was he a real cowboy,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,or was he an entertainer cowboy?
00:22:37,00:22:39,"He, it feels like they really bridged the gap."
00:22:39,00:22:41,"So he started out as a bison hunter,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,"and he fought in the war,"
00:22:43,00:22:46,"and, you know, it was great with a gun."
00:22:46,00:22:47,And then he sort of turned that lifestyle
00:22:47,00:22:49,into this amazing show.
00:22:49,00:22:51,But he was incredible.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"He, his career started out with being a Buffalo hunter,"
00:22:54,00:22:55,hence the name.
00:22:55,00:23:00,"And he once killed 6,000 Buffalo in one year."
00:23:00,00:23:02,That's a lot of Buffalo.
00:23:02,00:23:03,It's too many Buffalo.
00:23:03,00:23:05,He was sort of single-handedly responsible
00:23:05,00:23:06,for the near extinction of Buffalo.
00:23:06,00:23:08,That's 20 Buffalo a day.
00:23:08,00:23:08,That's a lot.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"How did he do that thing,"
00:23:10,00:23:13,where you kind of chased them off a cliff and they all...
00:23:13,00:23:15,There must have been one really big incident
00:23:15,00:23:17,"where he knocked off a few thousand in one go,"
00:23:17,00:23:18,and then he could take a few days off
00:23:18,00:23:21,this exhaustive Buffalo slaughter schedule.
00:23:21,00:23:22,"Because he must have had a few weeks holiday,"
00:23:22,00:23:23,mustn't he?
00:23:23,00:23:24,So it's even more than that.
00:23:24,00:23:27,You can't take a holiday as a bison hunter.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"It's just, you've got to keep going."
00:23:29,00:23:31,He once killed 48 Buffalo in 30 minutes.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"But yeah, this America started out"
00:23:33,00:23:36,with millions of Buffalo in the 1600s.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"And by the end of the 19th century,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,"really partly because of him,"
00:23:40,00:23:41,they had a couple of hundred left.
00:23:41,00:23:43,Wow.
00:23:43,00:23:44,One last thing about The Lone Ranger.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"In the TV series,"
00:23:46,00:23:48,he was played by a guy called Clayton Moore.
00:23:48,00:23:49,"And after the series ended,"
00:23:49,00:23:52,"he kept doing public appearances as The Lone Ranger, right?"
00:23:52,00:23:54,The guy who bought the rights to The Lone Ranger
00:23:54,00:23:59,"got a restraining order against The Lone Ranger, Clayton Moore,"
00:23:59,00:24:01,saying you can't go out wearing your mask in public.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"You have to take your mask off in public, right?"
00:24:03,00:24:04,Stop pretending to be The Lone Ranger.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"That's quite ironic in 2021, isn't it?"
00:24:07,00:24:09,"Yeah, must not wear a mask in public."
00:24:09,00:24:13,And Clayton Moore was so wedded to the character
00:24:13,00:24:14,that he started instead just wearing
00:24:14,00:24:16,huge wraparound sunglasses
00:24:16,00:24:18,"to make it look like he was wearing a domino mask,"
00:24:18,00:24:18,like The Lone Ranger.
00:24:18,00:24:23,"Anyway, this led to a huge controversy in about 1980."
00:24:23,00:24:24,And he went on the show Real People
00:24:24,00:24:25,"to discuss The Lone Ranger,"
00:24:25,00:24:29,ironic considering he was pretending to be someone he wasn't.
00:24:29,00:24:31,But he came on stage for a live broadcast interview.
00:24:31,00:24:35,"And The Lone Ranger, he was so popular, Clayton Moore,"
00:24:35,00:24:36,"that the studio audience who were there,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,they applauded for so long when he came on
00:24:38,00:24:41,that it used up the entire broadcast slot for the interview.
00:24:41,00:24:43,And they had to just go to an ad break
00:24:43,00:24:44,without speaking to him.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"Of all the people that you want to have two of,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,The Lone Ranger is not one of us.
00:24:50,00:25:02,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:25:02,00:25:03,My fact is that just off the coast of Kent
00:25:03,00:25:06,"is a sunken ship, which is under 24-hour surveillance,"
00:25:06,00:25:10,"because it contains 14,000 unexploded bombs."
00:25:11,00:25:15,"And yeah, it's extraordinary."
00:25:15,00:25:18,"And if they go off, we don't really know what's going to happen."
00:25:18,00:25:20,Something bad will happen if they all go off.
00:25:20,00:25:23,"Well, bad for the fish, probably."
00:25:23,00:25:24,Really bad for the fish.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"Really bad for she and S, which is the nearest town."
00:25:26,00:25:30,And there's a theory that it could flood London if they go off.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"It'll create a five-meter wave,"
00:25:32,00:25:35,which will just come up the Thames and swamp London.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"Wow, five meters."
00:25:37,00:25:39,"I reckon on five meters above the Thames, we're all right here."
00:25:40,00:25:41,"Yeah, I'm upstairs at the moment."
00:25:41,00:25:48,"So this was from a guy called Tom Whitwell,"
00:25:48,00:25:52,who every year he makes a list of the 52 best things
00:25:52,00:25:54,he's found out during the previous year.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Really great list.
00:25:55,00:25:57,I will post a link to the latest one.
00:25:57,00:26:00,And it's a ship called the SS Richard Montgomery.
00:26:00,00:26:03,"It was an American ship, and in 1944,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,it was sailing over to France.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"It was taking 6,000 tons of explosives to Normandy"
00:26:08,00:26:11,to support the invasion.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"And it hit a sand bank in the Thames, broken half sank."
00:26:14,00:26:16,And it's just been there since then.
00:26:16,00:26:17,"With it, this is really creepy."
00:26:17,00:26:20,It's masts are poking up above the water.
00:26:20,00:26:22,So you can see where it is.
00:26:22,00:26:24,"And some of it has been excavated,"
00:26:24,00:26:26,or some explosives have been removed from it.
00:26:26,00:26:31,"But there's still, I think, about 1,400 tons remaining on there."
00:26:31,00:26:33,And we're just waiting to see what happens.
00:26:33,00:26:36,It's absolutely nuts.
00:26:36,00:26:39,And there's a sort of exclusion zone that they've put around it
00:26:39,00:26:40,because they've had so many times
00:26:40,00:26:45,where a ship has almost hit it by accident coming in.
00:26:45,00:26:48,"Or, in fact, what they used to do is locals used to charge"
00:26:48,00:26:50,two shillings to take people out
00:26:50,00:26:53,and literally touch the masts of the ship.
00:26:53,00:26:55,"And they're like, ""We need to stop doing this."
00:26:55,00:26:57,"This is a ginormous bomb sitting underneath."""
00:26:57,00:26:59,It's extraordinary.
00:26:59,00:27:02,"In fact, it's even worse than that because local fishermen,"
00:27:02,00:27:04,"sometimes when they're trolling for fish,"
00:27:04,00:27:07,will pick up some old ordnance or something like that.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"And quite often they'll go,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,"""Well, are we going to give this to the authorities?"""
00:27:10,00:27:12,That's a bit of a hassle.
00:27:12,00:27:15,And so what they do is they dump them next to the ship
00:27:15,00:27:18,because they know that it's an exclusion zone
00:27:18,00:27:19,and no one's allowed to go there anyway.
00:27:19,00:27:20,"So they think, ""Well, that's the safest place"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"to just add more bombs."""
00:27:22,00:27:24,What are the odds of it hitting one of the bombs
00:27:24,00:27:25,when you're down there?
00:27:25,00:27:27,Probably like one in three.
00:27:27,00:27:29,"But it is controversial what will happen, isn't it?"
00:27:29,00:27:32,"There are some people who think, actually,"
00:27:32,00:27:37,everything down there by this time probably won't do that much damage
00:27:37,00:27:38,"or even if one of them goes off,"
00:27:38,00:27:40,probably it won't set all the rest of them off.
00:27:40,00:27:42,There was a guy called Dave Welsh.
00:27:42,00:27:44,I read an interview with the BBC
00:27:44,00:27:48,and he was a former Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Expert.
00:27:48,00:27:50,"And they asked him about this and he said,"
00:27:50,00:27:53,"""If you've got a £1,000 bomb two metres away"
00:27:53,00:27:56,"from another £1,000 bomb in water,"
00:27:56,00:27:57,"the other one won't go bank."""
00:27:57,00:28:00,"He said, ""I know that for a fact."
00:28:00,00:28:01,"I did it last Tuesday."""
00:28:02,00:28:05,So there are some experts who think that it's okay
00:28:05,00:28:07,and then there are other experts who think
00:28:07,00:28:09,it's just a matter of time before this thing goes up.
00:28:09,00:28:12,"Yeah, it's extraordinary the theories, isn't it,"
00:28:12,00:28:13,that they've postulated.
00:28:13,00:28:18,"So in the 1970s, the Royal Military College of Sciences"
00:28:18,00:28:20,"looked into it as well, what the consequences could be."
00:28:20,00:28:24,"As Andy says, a giant wave would go into shore supposedly."
00:28:24,00:28:25,"The other thing they said was,"
00:28:25,00:28:27,"""If all bombs went off at the same time,"
00:28:27,00:28:31,"a 3,000-metre-high column of water and debris"
00:28:31,00:28:33,"would shoot into the air."""
00:28:33,00:28:35,"So 3,000 metres for context would be..."
00:28:35,00:28:39,"3,000 metres high, almost half the height of Everest."
00:28:39,00:28:42,"Exactly, that's three times the Burj Khalifa, more than that."
00:28:42,00:28:43,That's how high they're saying
00:28:43,00:28:45,that the debris and water column would go.
00:28:45,00:28:48,And the town itself actually is quite affectionate
00:28:48,00:28:49,towards this ship.
00:28:49,00:28:51,They call it the Monty or Old Friend.
00:28:51,00:28:53,And there's actually a large mural that you can see there
00:28:53,00:28:58,"of a mermaid detonating TNT with the little slogan,"
00:28:58,00:28:59,"""You'll have a blast."""
00:28:59,00:29:01,"Which, I have to say, I've been to Sheerness"
00:29:01,00:29:04,and that is definitely just a reference to the ship
00:29:04,00:29:07,and not a genuine time you'll have.
00:29:07,00:29:08,"Now, I take that back."
00:29:08,00:29:10,I absolutely loved my time there.
00:29:10,00:29:13,Some of the best fishing ships I've ever had were on Sheerness.
00:29:13,00:29:15,Really?
00:29:15,00:29:16,"Oh, yeah, I love Sheerness."
00:29:16,00:29:19,"I did go just on Sheppy, actually,"
00:29:19,00:29:21,"because I did go on holiday to Sheppy last year,"
00:29:21,00:29:22,and it was so great.
00:29:22,00:29:24,And the only other thing that I learned
00:29:24,00:29:28,when I was there about it was that it was the home
00:29:28,00:29:33,"of the first, it was the home of the first live cargo flight ever."
00:29:33,00:29:35,"And in fact, there's a sign that says,"
00:29:35,00:29:39,"""This is where the first flight by a British pilot"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"in Britain happened."""
00:29:41,00:29:43,So it's quite a specific record.
00:29:43,00:29:44,Live cargo.
00:29:44,00:29:49,"Yeah, so basically this was early 1900s."
00:29:49,00:29:50,"It was a pig, in fact."
00:29:50,00:29:51,Okay.
00:29:51,00:29:52,But close.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"When they were doing, like they did it as a publicity stunt"
00:29:54,00:29:56,because pigs would fly.
00:29:56,00:29:56,Was that that one?
00:29:56,00:29:57,"It was exactly that, yeah."
00:29:57,00:29:59,"I love that, yeah."
00:29:59,00:30:04,"So this, well, you're not that old, James, but well remembered."
00:30:04,00:30:07,So it was sort of the cradle of powered flight
00:30:07,00:30:10,in the early years of the 1900s in the UK.
00:30:10,00:30:11,"And the Wright brothers visited,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"and they united with the short brothers,"
00:30:13,00:30:14,"who were these British brothers,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,who set up a plane factory in Sheppy.
00:30:16,00:30:20,"And there was this guy called John Moore Brabazon,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,"who did this flight, the first British flight"
00:30:22,00:30:25,by a British person in Britain in 1909.
00:30:25,00:30:27,And then he went to disprove the adage
00:30:27,00:30:28,that pigs can't fly.
00:30:28,00:30:32,And so he strung a paper basket
00:30:32,00:30:34,"to one of the wings of the aircraft,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"stuck a pig in it, and flew."
00:30:36,00:30:36,Amazing.
00:30:36,00:30:38,"On this, this is completely off topic now,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,but it's just because I read this yesterday.
00:30:40,00:30:43,There was a company in America
00:30:43,00:30:45,that got all their employees as a competition
00:30:45,00:30:46,to try and make a lead balloon.
00:30:46,00:30:49,"And this was, I think in the,"
00:30:49,00:30:51,"either in their early 80s or late 70s,"
00:30:51,00:30:52,I can't quite remember.
00:30:52,00:30:54,"And what they did was,"
00:30:54,00:30:55,it was kind of an advertising campaign
00:30:55,00:30:56,or something like that.
00:30:56,00:30:58,And they got a load of teams together
00:30:58,00:31:01,"and they said, who can make a lead balloon?"
00:31:01,00:31:04,And they gave them extremely thin sheets of lead
00:31:04,00:31:07,and as much helium as they could use
00:31:07,00:31:09,to make the voices go funny.
00:31:09,00:31:11,"And I think there were six teams,"
00:31:11,00:31:13,"and only one of them managed to make a balloon,"
00:31:13,00:31:14,which actually did float
00:31:14,00:31:16,with this helium made out of lead.
00:31:16,00:31:20,"But unfortunately, due to the wind direction,"
00:31:20,00:31:22,it started floating towards Logan Airport.
00:31:22,00:31:24,And they had to ring up Logan Airport
00:31:24,00:31:26,"and say, hey, there's a lead balloon"
00:31:26,00:31:28,about your airspace.
00:31:28,00:31:31,"I'm just to mention the pilot saying,"
00:31:31,00:31:32,"oh, well, it's okay."
00:31:32,00:31:33,"There's a balloon in our flight path,"
00:31:33,00:31:34,but I think our engines are going to make
00:31:34,00:31:36,"pretty short work of a little balloon, don't you?"
00:31:36,00:31:39,"Ground control comes in, avoid that balloon."
00:31:39,00:31:41,"There was a whole load of, yeah,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,"guffaw ring, I'm sure, because of that."
00:31:43,00:31:45,And they had to ground flights for a little while.
00:31:45,00:31:47,And then it was last seen floating
00:31:47,00:31:49,across the Atlantic towards Europe.
00:31:49,00:31:50,It's still out there.
00:31:50,00:31:51,It's still out there somewhere.
00:31:51,00:31:53,With a 30-foot camel in the American desert.
00:31:53,00:31:59,So just on shipwrecks.
00:31:59,00:31:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:59,00:32:03,UNESCO says there are three million shipwrecks
00:32:03,00:32:05,"around the world, which is just remarkable."
00:32:05,00:32:06,That's an estimate.
00:32:06,00:32:10,"It's not a tally, but there are just so many out there."
00:32:10,00:32:12,"And we've got, we're winning on shipwrecks."
00:32:12,00:32:13,Are we?
00:32:13,00:32:13,Are we?
00:32:13,00:32:14,Tally.
00:32:14,00:32:16,"We've, there's about 250,000"
00:32:16,00:32:17,around the coast of Britain.
00:32:17,00:32:18,"They reckon just because, see,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,we're in either nation
00:32:19,00:32:22,and then lots of naval activities happened.
00:32:22,00:32:24,And that's why shipwreck diving
00:32:24,00:32:27,"is so popular in the UK, which it is."
00:32:27,00:32:30,And I was reading a really interesting blog
00:32:30,00:32:31,by someone who's into shipwreck diving
00:32:31,00:32:32,about the interesting thing about it.
00:32:32,00:32:33,And I hadn't really thought through
00:32:33,00:32:36,"that you can't see, visibility is so poor"
00:32:36,00:32:37,that you often can't see your hand
00:32:37,00:32:38,in front of your face.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"So, you know, you picture being able to see a wreck,"
00:32:40,00:32:43,"like if you see Titanic, a full wreck in front of you."
00:32:43,00:32:44,"Actually, you're often just swimming around"
00:32:44,00:32:46,and so you crash into a wreck
00:32:46,00:32:47,before you've even seen it.
00:32:47,00:32:49,And you feel your way around it.
00:32:49,00:32:51,So it will just appear out of nowhere.
00:32:51,00:32:52,Yeah.
00:32:52,00:32:54,"In 2019, three sailors were shipwrecked"
00:32:54,00:32:56,off the coast of Columbia
00:32:56,00:32:57,and they survived
00:32:57,00:32:58,"because they had something to cling onto,"
00:32:58,00:33:00,"which was floating in the water,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,which was the plastic wrapped bales of cocaine
00:33:02,00:33:04,that they were in the middle of smuggling.
00:33:04,00:33:08,About a tonne of cocaine hydrochloride
00:33:08,00:33:10,and they got picked up.
00:33:10,00:33:11,"God, what do you do?"
00:33:11,00:33:12,Do you let go of that
00:33:12,00:33:14,when you see the coast guard coming?
00:33:17,00:33:20,"If you find anything in a shipwreck in the UK,"
00:33:20,00:33:24,you have to report it to the receiver of wreck.
00:33:24,00:33:28,This is according to the 1995 Merchant Shipping Act.
00:33:28,00:33:31,And if you don't do that and you keep it
00:33:31,00:33:33,and they find out you could be fined
00:33:33,00:33:36,or you have to pay the owner of whatever you've stolen
00:33:36,00:33:38,or whatever you've taken twice the value.
00:33:38,00:33:41,"So if you take a million pounds worth of gold,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,you'd have to pay the Spanish privateer
00:33:43,00:33:45,from the 16th century
00:33:45,00:33:46,"who you stole it from, two million worth."
00:33:47,00:33:49,"But in 2001, the receiver of the wreck"
00:33:49,00:33:54,who's called Sophia Exelby did a wreck amnesty
00:33:54,00:33:55,where anything that you'd taken
00:33:55,00:33:56,"which you hadn't reported,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,you could then report and you wouldn't get done for it.
00:33:58,00:34:02,And there's a whole load of list of things that they took.
00:34:02,00:34:06,"But weirdly, loads of people seem to have stolen"
00:34:06,00:34:08,toilet bowls from shipwrecks.
00:34:08,00:34:11,And we can't really work out why they do that.
00:34:11,00:34:13,"So there are toilet bowls, toilet pumps,"
00:34:13,00:34:15,"toilet roll holders, chamber pots,"
00:34:15,00:34:18,all these things stolen from shipwrecks.
00:34:18,00:34:20,That's because the one thing you don't need in the sea
00:34:20,00:34:21,is a toilet bowl.
00:34:21,00:34:22,"You're just we in the sea, guys."
00:34:22,00:34:24,"I guess you could do that,"
00:34:24,00:34:26,but how many cruises have you been on?
00:34:26,00:34:31,It's a long way over the side.
00:34:31,00:34:34,Just stick your ass out over the edge.
00:34:34,00:34:38,And apparently they had one person
00:34:38,00:34:40,who handed in a pair of white lace panties
00:34:40,00:34:42,that they'd stolen from a shipwreck.
00:34:42,00:34:44,Got to be a recent shipwreck.
00:34:44,00:34:45,That kind of lasted very long
00:34:45,00:34:47,in the unforgiving water around the coast.
00:34:47,00:34:52,"So, yeah, I wrote to the receiver of Wreck"
00:34:52,00:34:54,as research for this podcast.
00:34:54,00:34:55,The current one's Camilla Moore.
00:34:55,00:34:57,"I just love the alternative title,"
00:34:57,00:35:00,"The Coroner of the Seas, which is so cool."
00:35:00,00:35:02,"And basically, yeah, as James says,"
00:35:02,00:35:03,"if you find a Wreck artifact,"
00:35:03,00:35:06,"you have to report, it's your duty to report it to them."
00:35:06,00:35:07,And then they make sure you get a fair price for it.
00:35:07,00:35:10,But the fair price has to be agreed with the owner.
00:35:10,00:35:11,So there was a thing recently
00:35:11,00:35:13,where a load of shipping containers got washed up.
00:35:13,00:35:15,I think someone on the coast of maybe Dorset.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"Yeah, it was in the news, wasn't it,"
00:35:17,00:35:18,that everyone was going down there
00:35:18,00:35:20,"trying to grab what they could, wasn't it?"
00:35:20,00:35:22,"Yeah, quite a lot of people got new motorbikes."
00:35:22,00:35:24,There was a consignment of BMW motorbikes.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"And BMW said, oh, they're water damaged."
00:35:26,00:35:28,They're probably only worth a couple of hundred quid.
00:35:28,00:35:30,"And quite a lot of people with new motorbikes said,"
00:35:30,00:35:31,"well, I'm just going to keep quiet then,"
00:35:31,00:35:34,because I think this brand new spotless motorbike
00:35:34,00:35:36,might be worth a bit more than that.
00:35:36,00:35:39,But what are they supposed to do?
00:35:39,00:35:40,They're supposed to pot them all up
00:35:40,00:35:42,"outside Camilla Moore's house then, are they?"
00:35:42,00:35:44,"No, you just get in touch and chill."
00:35:44,00:35:46,You probably fill it a form or something
00:35:46,00:35:48,"and say, this is what I found."
00:35:48,00:35:49,"Yeah, it's fun."
00:35:49,00:35:51,"I quite like, because presumably their job as well"
00:35:51,00:35:55,is identifying pieces and having a sort of understanding
00:35:55,00:35:57,"of the history of shipbuilding to be like,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,"oh, this would have been this part of the boat"
00:35:59,00:36:01,for anyone who had collected something.
00:36:01,00:36:03,And that's because that's the thing that happens a lot.
00:36:03,00:36:06,"You find these pieces, you don't know exactly what they are."
00:36:06,00:36:11,"And Robert Ballard, who discovered the wreck of the Titanic,"
00:36:11,00:36:16,actually used a hotel in Annick in the UK
00:36:16,00:36:19,to understand what certain fittings that he'd found
00:36:19,00:36:21,"from the Titanic's dining room were,"
00:36:21,00:36:24,"because in Annick at the White Swan Hotel,"
00:36:24,00:36:27,"they have a dining room, which has the exact,"
00:36:27,00:36:31,"not a replica, but the exact dining room from the RMS Olympic,"
00:36:31,00:36:34,which was one of the sister ships of the Titanic.
00:36:34,00:36:35,"And when it got decommissioned,"
00:36:35,00:36:38,they removed all of the wood and everything.
00:36:38,00:36:40,And it was brought up by this hotel owner
00:36:40,00:36:44,who recreated the entire room inside his hotel
00:36:44,00:36:46,to the point that Ballard was going to that room
00:36:46,00:36:48,"to see, ah, that's what that fitting"
00:36:48,00:36:49,would have been that we'd covered.
00:36:49,00:36:50,"- That's insane. Oh, that's cool."
00:36:50,00:36:53,"- Oh, it's a table. I see it."
00:36:53,00:36:55,"- Oh, it's not a handkerchief,"
00:36:55,00:36:57,it's a pair of white lace panties.
00:36:57,00:36:59,What are you doing in the dining room?
00:36:59,00:37:01,- That's what everyone wears to dinner on ships.
00:37:01,00:37:05,- You need to get quick access
00:37:05,00:37:07,if you're pissing over the side of the boat.
00:37:08,00:37:10,- It feels like Anna's being on a special raunchy crew
00:37:10,00:37:12,"and thinks that this is just how all cruises operate,"
00:37:12,00:37:14,as opposed to mostly being deckquoits.
00:37:14,00:37:17,"- Oh, look, I've had some good holidays."
00:37:17,00:37:19,- Do you know what the largest Titanic museum in the world is?
00:37:19,00:37:21,- I thought it's in Belfast.
00:37:21,00:37:27,"- I think it's in a place called Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,"
00:37:27,00:37:29,which is very far inland.
00:37:29,00:37:32,But it's half the size of the Titanic
00:37:32,00:37:33,and it's shaped like the Titanic.
00:37:33,00:37:34,- Wow.
00:37:34,00:37:36,- It's really cool and it's in a pool of water.
00:37:36,00:37:38,So you feel like you're going on the actual ship.
00:37:38,00:37:41,- Is it the Titanic before the crash or...?
00:37:41,00:37:42,"- Yeah, it's pretty."
00:37:42,00:37:43,- Okay.
00:37:43,00:37:44,"- It is half the size,"
00:37:44,00:37:46,but they haven't just recreated the front hull.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"- Yeah, they haven't just cut it in half."
00:37:47,00:37:48,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:37:48,00:37:50,- Wow.
00:37:50,00:37:51,- Yeah.
00:37:51,00:37:53,- That's very weird because I feel like Pigeon Forge
00:37:53,00:37:56,"is going to be relevant later on in the show, possibly."
00:37:56,00:37:59,- I was thinking the exact same thing.
00:37:59,00:38:00,- A forward spoiler.
00:38:00,00:38:03,"Just back to Camilla more quickly, receiver of the wreck."
00:38:03,00:38:05,"Her other job, not only does she receive wrecks,"
00:38:05,00:38:08,but she's responsible for dealing with all stranded royal fish.
00:38:08,00:38:10,"- Oh, really?"
00:38:10,00:38:12,- She must keep her busy.
00:38:12,00:38:14,"So all the fish that the Queen owns,"
00:38:14,00:38:17,"which theoretically is all dolphins, porpoises and whales"
00:38:17,00:38:19,"that get stranded on British beaches,"
00:38:19,00:38:23,they belong to the monarchy since the 13th century.
00:38:23,00:38:24,I think they made the rule
00:38:24,00:38:26,because you used to get whale oil and stuff for them
00:38:26,00:38:29,and technically the monarchy can claim that whale oil.
00:38:29,00:38:31,And she's responsible for dealing with them.
00:38:31,00:38:34,"So for porpoises stranded, you call Camilla."
00:38:34,00:38:37,And she doesn't like drag the whale over to Buckingham Palace
00:38:37,00:38:38,"and say, ""Here you go, your Majesty."""
00:38:38,00:38:42,- He drops it at the Queen's bedroom door
00:38:42,00:38:44,"and says, ""You asked for this 700 years ago."""
00:38:44,00:38:47,- If Prince Charles's goldfish ever jumps out of its bowl
00:38:47,00:38:49,"and accidentally gets stranded on the carpet,"
00:38:49,00:38:51,she technically is the person who has to deal with it.
00:38:51,00:38:52,I think responsibility.
00:38:52,00:38:56,"- Anna, you were saying just before that shipwreck buys"
00:38:56,00:38:59,"about 250,000 or off the coast of..."
00:38:59,00:39:01,"- Britain, they think, yeah."
00:39:01,00:39:05,"I was amazed to hear, we don't know exactly"
00:39:05,00:39:09,"how many bombs are in the oceans around the British Isles,"
00:39:09,00:39:12,"except for the fact we do know that just after World War II,"
00:39:12,00:39:17,the British government dumped roughly 1.17 million tons
00:39:17,00:39:20,"of chemical weapons and conventional bombs into the sea,"
00:39:20,00:39:22,just off our coasts.
00:39:22,00:39:25,"And I should quickly say, I got this fact,"
00:39:25,00:39:27,as well as a lot of the things I've been saying
00:39:27,00:39:30,about the Richard Montgomery ship we've been talking about
00:39:30,00:39:33,from a Vice article by a guy called Joe Zado.
00:39:33,00:39:35,"It's a fascinating article about what we're talking about right now,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,so give that a read if you can.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"But he was saying that in 1995,"
00:39:40,00:39:42,while they were drilling an undersea gas line
00:39:42,00:39:44,"between Scotland and Northern Ireland,"
00:39:44,00:39:46,they hit one of the stashes of these bombs
00:39:46,00:39:47,"that had been dropped down there,"
00:39:47,00:39:48,and it released a bunch of them.
00:39:48,00:39:51,"And within a month, 4,500 of them had washed up"
00:39:51,00:39:53,to the west coast of Scotland.
00:39:53,00:39:55,So we've just got bombs washing up on the shores
00:39:55,00:39:58,and nitroglycerine vials and it's terrifying.
00:39:58,00:40:01,"It was only one nitroglycerine vial, wasn't it?"
00:40:01,00:40:02,One child said that they did that.
00:40:02,00:40:03,One reported.
00:40:03,00:40:04,"Oh yeah, one reported."
00:40:04,00:40:07,There is a place in Russia which has a ship's graveyard
00:40:07,00:40:11,"of nuclear submarine engines, which sounds terrifying."
00:40:11,00:40:12,So it's a place called the Karras Sea.
00:40:12,00:40:15,"And the problem is that nuclear submarines,"
00:40:15,00:40:18,"they last about 30 years and then they start rattling,"
00:40:18,00:40:20,"they get a bit noisier in the water,"
00:40:20,00:40:23,so they're less secret and the technology gets outdated
00:40:23,00:40:25,and you're just building better subs.
00:40:25,00:40:29,"And at its height, Russia had 245 nuclear submarines,"
00:40:29,00:40:32,which is a lot of nuclear power in the water.
00:40:32,00:40:34,And so now there is this place
00:40:34,00:40:37,which contains 14 nuclear reactors
00:40:37,00:40:40,"and 17,000 containers of hazardous material."
00:40:40,00:40:43,And the Russian authorities would like to scrap these
00:40:43,00:40:45,"and properly scrap them and decommission them,"
00:40:45,00:40:47,but apparently it relies on recovery vessels
00:40:47,00:40:49,which don't yet exist.
00:40:49,00:40:51,So this is a task.
00:40:51,00:40:53,"Don't build stuff, you can't unbuild."
00:40:54,00:40:56,The UK is similar.
00:40:56,00:40:58,"I think we've got, we certainly had a couple of years ago,"
00:40:58,00:41:00,20 nuclear submarines left over from the Cold War
00:41:00,00:41:02,that we don't know what to do with.
00:41:02,00:41:04,Can't really afford to dismantle.
00:41:04,00:41:07,Why don't we just dump them next to this thing here?
00:41:07,00:41:11,"There was a plan, wasn't there,"
00:41:11,00:41:16,"to put like a massive concrete casing over this ship,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,"I think, you know, like they did in Chernobyl."
00:41:18,00:41:21,"But at the moment, every kind of few years,"
00:41:21,00:41:25,the government kind of has a meeting with some experts
00:41:25,00:41:27,"and they say, ""What should we do about this?"""
00:41:27,00:41:29,"And then at the end of the meeting, everyone goes,"
00:41:29,00:41:30,"""Should we just leave it then?"""
00:41:30,00:41:30,"Yeah, that's just..."
00:41:30,00:41:33,"Yeah, it's so British."
00:41:33,00:41:34,It's really embarrassing.
00:41:34,00:41:34,It's amazing.
00:41:34,00:41:38,"Maybe the worst ever reason for a shipwreck was in 2003,"
00:41:38,00:41:41,which was a two and a half thousand ton ship
00:41:41,00:41:43,"called the RMS Mulheim,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,and it was sunk by a pair of trousers.
00:41:45,00:41:49,"Can we work out why that happened,"
00:41:49,00:41:51,or is that going to be impossible?
00:41:51,00:41:55,"Okay, so what could a pair of trousers done?"
00:41:55,00:41:59,"Oh, someone snagged their trousers on the port"
00:41:59,00:42:00,"as the ship was leaving,"
00:42:00,00:42:03,but the cloth was so strong
00:42:03,00:42:05,that it managed to pull down the entire ship.
00:42:05,00:42:07,You're not far off.
00:42:07,00:42:08,I must be miles off.
00:42:08,00:42:11,That sounds like that would be a trousers advert.
00:42:11,00:42:15,That's a Levi-June's advert for the durability of that material.
00:42:15,00:42:18,"What it was, is it was the officer who was on watch."
00:42:18,00:42:18,He was at the bridge.
00:42:18,00:42:20,He was sitting in a chair.
00:42:20,00:42:21,"He tried to stand up,"
00:42:21,00:42:25,"but his trousers snagged,"
00:42:25,00:42:26,"and he lost his balance,"
00:42:26,00:42:29,"fell over, knocked himself out briefly."
00:42:29,00:42:30,"By the time he came around,"
00:42:30,00:42:33,"the ship was heading straight for the shoreline,"
00:42:33,00:42:34,"and there was nothing he could do about it,"
00:42:34,00:42:36,because it takes about five miles to stop these ships.
00:42:36,00:42:37,"So bang, shipwreck."
00:42:37,00:42:39,"I'll be honest, you said I wasn't far off,"
00:42:39,00:42:43,but really the only thing I got right was the trousers part.
00:42:43,00:42:44,That's true.
00:42:44,00:42:45,You'd already told us.
00:42:45,00:42:46,"I had to give you a little clue, yeah."
00:42:48,00:42:51,"Again, I think attributing blame to the trousers there"
00:42:51,00:42:53,is a bit like attributing blame to the French Revolution
00:42:53,00:42:55,for the death of old Governor Morris.
00:42:55,00:42:57,"The courts disagree with you, Anna,"
00:42:57,00:43:00,because the trousers were sued for 20 million pounds.
00:43:00,00:43:01,They're still in jail.
00:43:01,00:43:02,"They've been in prison since, yeah."
00:43:02,00:43:05,Do they have to wear prison trousers over the trousers?
00:43:05,00:43:13,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:43:13,00:43:15,and that is my fact.
00:43:15,00:43:17,"My fact this week is that the nine-to-five singer,"
00:43:17,00:43:20,"Dolly Parton, helped fund a COVID vaccine"
00:43:20,00:43:23,that has a protection rate of nine-to-five percent.
00:43:23,00:43:27,Nine-to-five percent.
00:43:27,00:43:29,"Fortunately, not nine-to-five percent,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,because that actually would not be a very effective vaccine.
00:43:31,00:43:38,"Yeah, Dolly Parton, she's amazing with charity."
00:43:38,00:43:40,"She's always making donations to incredible causes,"
00:43:40,00:43:43,and one of the things that she did back in April of 2020
00:43:43,00:43:47,"was she donated a million dollars to COVID-19 research,"
00:43:47,00:43:50,and she sent that to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
00:43:50,00:43:55,"And the money went towards the Moderna vaccine,"
00:43:55,00:43:58,"which came out, which has a nearly 95,"
00:43:58,00:44:00,"I discovered at the last second,"
00:44:00,00:44:05,it's sort of 94.5 percent effect in this against corona.
00:44:05,00:44:06,"Well, there'll be letters."
00:44:06,00:44:09,"But everyone rounds it up to 95, so I think we're safe."
00:44:09,00:44:10,Very good.
00:44:10,00:44:13,I should say I found this fact while looking through Twitter
00:44:13,00:44:14,on the day that it happened.
00:44:14,00:44:16,"A lot of people made this connection,"
00:44:16,00:44:19,"so it was a nice little joke going around about Dolly Parton,"
00:44:19,00:44:20,"and I thought, let's do it on the show."
00:44:20,00:44:23,Do we think that they suppressed the effectiveness rate
00:44:23,00:44:26,of the vaccine to make sure that they could create this fact?
00:44:26,00:44:29,"Could they have made a 99 percent effective one,"
00:44:29,00:44:30,but they knew it would ruin the gag?
00:44:30,00:44:34,"But that was Jay-Z had given the money for that one, hadn't he?"
00:44:34,00:44:40,"Or for older people, Nina, from 99 Red Balloons fame."
00:44:40,00:44:45,"But if you kind of do your jokes for different generations,"
00:44:45,00:44:47,"then you get more hits, don't you?"
00:44:47,00:44:48,Absolutely.
00:44:48,00:44:49,You'll stand up.
00:44:49,00:44:50,One out of three jokes you'll get.
00:44:50,00:44:54,The other two for the other two-thirds of the audience.
00:44:54,00:44:56,James' stand-up gags is where the audience is rigidly divided
00:44:56,00:44:59,"by age into tranches, and he'll turn to one set of crowds."
00:44:59,00:45:00,They're all in triangles.
00:45:00,00:45:04,"Now, what you guys don't know about Jay-Z is that"
00:45:04,00:45:07,Dolly Parton's pretty cool.
00:45:07,00:45:11,"I didn't know anything about Dolly Parton,"
00:45:11,00:45:17,"apart from Big Hair and she's famous also for her boobs,"
00:45:17,00:45:19,and she sings 95.
00:45:19,00:45:22,"I knew 95, and I knew Joe Lee, and that's basically all I knew,"
00:45:22,00:45:24,"but my God, she's had an interesting life."
00:45:24,00:45:27,"She grew up in a little place in Tennessee,"
00:45:27,00:45:31,"which is, I think, better known as the home of the world's largest"
00:45:31,00:45:32,Titanic museum.
00:45:32,00:45:34,"What, Belfast?"
00:45:34,00:45:37,Pigeon Forge.
00:45:37,00:45:38,"Pigeon Forge, man."
00:45:38,00:45:42,"Yeah, in extreme poverty, it was so poor there that the funeral home"
00:45:42,00:45:44,"kept sets of teeth from people who'd been buried,"
00:45:44,00:45:48,and you could go down and get a set if you needed a set of teeth.
00:45:48,00:45:49,Really?
00:45:49,00:45:50,Yeah.
00:45:50,00:45:50,Wow.
00:45:50,00:45:52,"Yeah, and her family was so poor."
00:45:52,00:45:54,She was the fourth of 12 children.
00:45:54,00:45:57,"Supposedly, they had no money to pay the doctor who delivered her,"
00:45:57,00:46:01,"so instead, the dad gave him a bag of oatmeal as payment."
00:46:01,00:46:04,That was the first exchange.
00:46:04,00:46:06,She's got quite an oat-based childhood.
00:46:07,00:46:09,"Her childhood was bookended by oats,"
00:46:09,00:46:11,"because then, after she graduated high school,"
00:46:11,00:46:13,she says that she got on a bus straight away to go to Nashville
00:46:13,00:46:16,"to make her fortune doing music in the city,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,"and she got on a bus with what she described as her suitcase,"
00:46:18,00:46:21,which was actually an empty box of Quaker Oats.
00:46:21,00:46:22,Really?
00:46:22,00:46:23,"Which isn't going to hold much,"
00:46:23,00:46:27,"unless Quaker Oats came in much larger, much stronger boxes back then."
00:46:27,00:46:29,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:46:29,00:46:30,Yeah.
00:46:30,00:46:32,They were so poor that they ate a lot of animals
00:46:32,00:46:34,"that the father could find, didn't they?"
00:46:34,00:46:38,"So she said they would eat turtle, frogs, groundhogs,"
00:46:38,00:46:40,"but they never ate possum,"
00:46:40,00:46:42,"because apparently, possum is the most disgusting meat"
00:46:42,00:46:43,that you can eat around there.
00:46:43,00:46:44,Wow.
00:46:44,00:46:45,"So they never did that, yeah."
00:46:45,00:46:49,She also used to get by on room service.
00:46:49,00:46:51,That sounds fancy.
00:46:51,00:46:53,"In Nashville, she would walk up and down hotel corridors"
00:46:53,00:46:55,looking for half-eaten trays of room service
00:46:55,00:46:57,that people had left outside their rooms.
00:46:57,00:46:59,"That must have stuck with her throughout life,"
00:46:59,00:47:01,"the idea of food not being available,"
00:47:01,00:47:03,"because even at this age, still on tour,"
00:47:03,00:47:05,she always makes sure she has a packed lunch
00:47:05,00:47:07,"or snacks with her wherever she goes,"
00:47:07,00:47:08,"despite her millions,"
00:47:08,00:47:11,and despite probably access to any restaurant she wants.
00:47:11,00:47:14,She will always have things like potted meat
00:47:14,00:47:17,or a Vienna sausage with her in order to...
00:47:17,00:47:18,With her?
00:47:18,00:47:20,"So if you sit just in her pocket or something,"
00:47:20,00:47:22,she's always got a sausage in her pocket.
00:47:22,00:47:23,Those outfits are very tight.
00:47:23,00:47:26,"And if you look, you can see the outline of a sausage"
00:47:26,00:47:28,at some point on her person.
00:47:28,00:47:30,"And she's actually got a completely flat chest,"
00:47:30,00:47:32,but her bra is just stuffed with potted meat.
00:47:33,00:47:37,The only fact I really knew about Dolly Parton before this
00:47:37,00:47:41,is that she once lost a Dolly Parton lookalike competition.
00:47:41,00:47:43,That's like an old bit of trivia
00:47:43,00:47:45,"that you kind of see every now and then,"
00:47:45,00:47:48,but I looked into it and it's slightly different than that.
00:47:48,00:47:52,She basically entered a drag queen celebrity impersonator contest.
00:47:52,00:47:54,Okay.
00:47:54,00:47:56,"And there were loads of drag queens there,"
00:47:56,00:47:58,"and they were all dressed as different people,"
00:47:58,00:48:01,"like Cher or Dolly Parton or whatever,"
00:48:01,00:48:03,but they couldn't be dressed as anyone they wanted.
00:48:03,00:48:05,And also they had to be drag queens.
00:48:05,00:48:09,So you had this beautiful kind of massive hair
00:48:09,00:48:12,and all that makeup and eyelashes and stuff.
00:48:12,00:48:14,"And Dolly Parton, as great as she looked,"
00:48:14,00:48:16,was just dressed as Dolly Parton.
00:48:16,00:48:18,So obviously she didn't look anything like a drag queen
00:48:18,00:48:20,pretending to be Dolly Parton.
00:48:20,00:48:21,She looked like Dolly Parton.
00:48:21,00:48:23,So of course she didn't win.
00:48:23,00:48:24,That's interesting.
00:48:24,00:48:24,I didn't know that.
00:48:24,00:48:25,That's how they justify it.
00:48:25,00:48:28,That sounds like the judge's justification speech
00:48:28,00:48:29,at the end when he realized who she was.
00:48:30,00:48:31,Okay.
00:48:31,00:48:32,Reloaded.
00:48:32,00:48:33,How do we get out of this one?
00:48:33,00:48:38,She has released over 200 albums in her career.
00:48:38,00:48:40,200 albums.
00:48:40,00:48:41,That's so stupid.
00:48:41,00:48:44,That's like Buffalo Bill with Bison for me.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"Like, how can you do that many?"
00:48:46,00:48:50,"Like, 185 compilation albums worldwide she's released."
00:48:50,00:48:51,"Oh, 185 compilations."
00:48:51,00:48:52,"She's only made 15 albums,"
00:48:52,00:48:54,and she's done 185 compilations
00:48:54,00:48:56,of incredibly different combinations.
00:48:56,00:48:58,That's the thing.
00:48:58,00:49:02,"If your album has 15 tracks in,"
00:49:02,00:49:04,there are 15 factorial possibilities
00:49:04,00:49:06,of putting those in any order.
00:49:06,00:49:07,So you could do that.
00:49:07,00:49:09,"But now you've got Spotify now,"
00:49:09,00:49:10,which does it in a random order anyway.
00:49:10,00:49:14,You can no longer justify the 185 different orders.
00:49:14,00:49:14,She's had--
00:49:14,00:49:17,Why are we not releasing each episode four different times?
00:49:17,00:49:19,Great idea.
00:49:19,00:49:23,"51 studio albums, which I still think is insane."
00:49:23,00:49:24,That's a lot.
00:49:24,00:49:24,"Yeah, it is mad."
00:49:24,00:49:26,"And she says she's written over 3,000 songs."
00:49:26,00:49:29,Not all of them have been recorded.
00:49:29,00:49:31,But that's a lot of songwriting.
00:49:31,00:49:32,And with a lot of hits as well.
00:49:32,00:49:36,"Jolene, as you mentioned, Andy, I will always love you,"
00:49:36,00:49:38,"which for me, I only know through Whitney Houston."
00:49:38,00:49:39,But it's good.
00:49:39,00:49:42,"I only know it through Saddam Hussein, that one."
00:49:42,00:49:43,I know it was beautiful.
00:49:43,00:49:44,That's right.
00:49:44,00:49:46,"It's a cool about that if you don't get,"
00:49:46,00:49:47,then you're going to have your suspicions
00:49:47,00:49:48,about James's political leanings.
00:49:48,00:49:52,"Oh, she wrote those two in the same day, actually."
00:49:52,00:49:53,"Which is just both the question,"
00:49:53,00:49:55,"what has she done for the last 40 years,"
00:49:55,00:49:57,giving them the two most famous?
00:49:57,00:49:58,"It is like Buffalo Bill,"
00:49:58,00:50:01,"because he killed like 48 buffaloes in six hours,"
00:50:01,00:50:03,which meant it could take a few weeks off.
00:50:03,00:50:04,And she didn't say it.
00:50:04,00:50:06,She just knocked them out.
00:50:06,00:50:08,She doesn't quite remember if she wrote them on the same day.
00:50:08,00:50:09,That's the problem.
00:50:09,00:50:11,But they're on the same tape or the same...
00:50:11,00:50:13,The evidence that she has suggests
00:50:13,00:50:15,that they were written in the same session.
00:50:15,00:50:16,"And she sort of says,"
00:50:16,00:50:18,people always say that was a good writing day.
00:50:18,00:50:23,She's a very good self-promoter
00:50:23,00:50:24,"in the best possible way, isn't she?"
00:50:24,00:50:26,"So every interview she gives,"
00:50:26,00:50:28,she remembers these amazing details about her life.
00:50:28,00:50:30,And then sometimes she remembers
00:50:30,00:50:31,slightly contradictory things.
00:50:31,00:50:33,But she definitely knows...
00:50:33,00:50:35,That's such a nice way of saying so was a liar.
00:50:35,00:50:39,She's a self-promotorizer.
00:50:39,00:50:41,She's had a long old life.
00:50:41,00:50:44,"And, you know, you can't remember everything."
00:50:44,00:50:46,But she does say that she wears stilettos
00:50:46,00:50:47,to make breakfast every day.
00:50:47,00:50:48,Like she's always dressed up.
00:50:48,00:50:51,"It's not like she goes home, takes off her wig,"
00:50:51,00:50:52,takes off her makeup.
00:50:52,00:50:53,Pills out the sausage.
00:50:53,00:50:58,Chunks of meat out and devours them.
00:50:58,00:50:59,She says she wants to make sure
00:50:59,00:51:01,"she's always ambulance ready,"
00:51:01,00:51:04,which is quite a nice way of describing it.
00:51:04,00:51:05,It's got to come at 4 a.m.
00:51:05,00:51:08,"You know, there's one of her songs"
00:51:08,00:51:09,"that we haven't heard,"
00:51:09,00:51:10,which is called My Place in History.
00:51:10,00:51:12,And it's not going to be revealed
00:51:12,00:51:13,"until her 100th birthday,"
00:51:13,00:51:17,"which is going to be the 19th of January, 2046."
00:51:17,00:51:19,She should do it on her 95th birthday.
00:51:19,00:51:20,Shouldn't she really?
00:51:20,00:51:23,"Yes, so it had 9 to 5."
00:51:23,00:51:27,But it's locked in a box in Dollywood.
00:51:27,00:51:28,So if you want to petition them
00:51:28,00:51:30,"to release it early, James, you can."
00:51:30,00:51:32,"But until then, it's going to be in a box"
00:51:32,00:51:33,and they're going to release it then.
00:51:33,00:51:34,And I don't know what happened.
00:51:34,00:51:35,That's very exciting.
00:51:35,00:51:36,That's very cool.
00:51:36,00:51:36,Yeah.
00:51:36,00:51:39,"Dollywood is very cool, by the way."
00:51:39,00:51:41,"I mean, not many people have their own theme park."
00:51:41,00:51:44,And Dolly Parkton is one of those refu.
00:51:44,00:51:47,It's packed with roller coaster rides
00:51:47,00:51:48,and all sorts of fun things.
00:51:48,00:51:52,"But she inherited an existing theme park,"
00:51:52,00:51:55,"which had been changing ownership for many, many years."
00:51:55,00:51:57,"It started, Dollywood initially,"
00:51:57,00:51:59,as a place called Rebel Railroad.
00:51:59,00:52:02,And the idea was that there was a steam train.
00:52:02,00:52:04,They had a general shop as well and a few other things.
00:52:04,00:52:07,But you could get on this theme-inspired train.
00:52:07,00:52:09,And it was to celebrate the centennial anniversary
00:52:09,00:52:10,of the Civil War.
00:52:10,00:52:12,"So as you were on the train,"
00:52:12,00:52:14,you would be attacked by Union soldiers.
00:52:14,00:52:17,You would have train robbers trying to rob you.
00:52:17,00:52:20,You would have Native Americans trying to rob you as well.
00:52:20,00:52:22,And you were protected on board this train
00:52:22,00:52:25,by the Confederates who were fighting off the attackers
00:52:25,00:52:26,as they were coming for you.
00:52:26,00:52:29,"That was what Dollywood started as, this little train."
00:52:29,00:52:30,It was a celebration of the fact
00:52:30,00:52:32,"the Confederates won the Civil War, wasn't it?"
00:52:32,00:52:34,"Certainly sounds like very confusing for everyone,"
00:52:34,00:52:37,"if you're saying, if you're positioning it like that."
00:52:37,00:52:39,"And in fact, Dolly does say that when she was growing up,"
00:52:39,00:52:41,one of the things she thought was that the Confederates
00:52:41,00:52:42,won the Civil War.
00:52:42,00:52:42,Wow.
00:52:42,00:52:43,Different when she was young.
00:52:43,00:52:44,Really?
00:52:44,00:52:44,Yeah.
00:52:44,00:52:47,"Well, she did used to have a Civil War themed restaurant as well."
00:52:47,00:52:49,"Which was a dinner experience called Dixie Stampede,"
00:52:49,00:52:52,"where you had to choose which side you were on,"
00:52:52,00:52:54,north or south in the Civil War.
00:52:54,00:52:55,She has since changed that a bit.
00:52:55,00:52:58,"Well, she actually, she renamed it, didn't she?"
00:52:58,00:52:59,"Quite recently, Dollyparton Stampede,"
00:52:59,00:53:02,because she didn't realise the word Dixie had
00:53:02,00:53:04,quite problematic connotations
00:53:04,00:53:06,with the black community in America.
00:53:06,00:53:07,"Dollyparton Stampede, however,"
00:53:07,00:53:09,is a terrifying name for something.
00:53:09,00:53:12,"Imagine 30,000 Dollypartons stampeding towards you."
00:53:12,00:53:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:53:14,00:53:16,I'm just one more thing on Dollywood.
00:53:16,00:53:18,Dolly doesn't go on the rides herself.
00:53:18,00:53:19,"She's not tall enough, is she?"
00:53:19,00:53:23,She is five foot two.
00:53:23,00:53:26,She doesn't go on it because she says it could damage her hair.
00:53:26,00:53:28,"And she also said,"
00:53:28,00:53:30,"""This is interesting, considering what we've been talking about."""
00:53:30,00:53:32,"She said, ""Lord knows what else could fall out of me."""
00:53:32,00:53:35,And I think that might be a reference to the secret sausage
00:53:35,00:53:37,or the possum leaf in the bosom.
00:53:37,00:53:40,"Imagine if you sat behind Dollyparton,"
00:53:40,00:53:42,"and just as the photo comes up,"
00:53:42,00:53:43,the sausage hits you in the face.
00:53:45,00:53:47,"""Pepper Army Cascade on the Looper Loops."""
00:53:47,00:53:53,"Her marriage is sort of an amazing love story, isn't it?"
00:53:53,00:53:58,"With Carl Dean, who she's been married to for 57 years,"
00:53:58,00:53:59,although there have always been rumours
00:53:59,00:54:02,"that he doesn't exist because he's never, ever seen in public."
00:54:02,00:54:06,"But she said that this is because in 1966,"
00:54:06,00:54:08,"sort of just after they got married,"
00:54:08,00:54:11,"she won this award for a song called ""Put It Off Until Tomorrow""."
00:54:11,00:54:14,And they had an award ceremony to go to.
00:54:15,00:54:17,And she got all dressed up.
00:54:17,00:54:18,He got all dressed up.
00:54:18,00:54:19,They went to the ceremony.
00:54:19,00:54:21,"They came back home afterwards and he said,"
00:54:21,00:54:23,"""Don't you ever make me go to one of those damn things again?"""
00:54:23,00:54:24,And she didn't.
00:54:24,00:54:26,And he just hates the limelight.
00:54:26,00:54:27,Absolutely loves her.
00:54:27,00:54:30,Obviously stuck it out for almost six decades.
00:54:30,00:54:33,But he's never been to a gig either.
00:54:33,00:54:36,He doesn't need to be sat on stage at the gig.
00:54:36,00:54:39,"He can be quite anonymous in the crowd watching it,"
00:54:39,00:54:40,but he's never gone to a gig.
00:54:40,00:54:43,What if he doesn't like her kind of music?
00:54:43,00:54:44,He actually doesn't.
00:54:44,00:54:48,He says he likes hard rock and bluegrass and stuff.
00:54:48,00:54:50,"But he does actually see her perform sometimes,"
00:54:50,00:54:53,or at least he goes to her gigs when she performs at state fairs.
00:54:53,00:54:55,And that's because he really likes going to the tractor pool.
00:54:55,00:55:00,"Okay, so he's hearing it in the background."
00:55:00,00:55:01,He's not been to her gig.
00:55:01,00:55:04,He's watching the tractor pull away while she's singing back.
00:55:04,00:55:05,Can you keep it down over there?
00:55:05,00:55:06,I can't hear the tractors.
00:55:06,00:55:10,"Okay, that's it."
