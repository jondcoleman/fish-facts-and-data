00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were"
00:00:05,00:00:13,"joined at the Soho Theatre by Ella Alshamahi. Yes, it is Ella, our explorer friend. She's"
00:00:13,00:00:19,"a paleoanthropologist, she's an evolutionary biologist, a TV presenter, she is absolutely"
00:00:19,00:00:25,"badass and she came to join us on stage for a really, really fun show. Absolutely certain"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"you're going to really love this one. I just messaged Ella, she's off somewhere around"
00:00:30,00:00:34,"the world and asked her if she wanted me to plug anything, she said not, but I really"
00:00:34,00:00:38,"think I should probably mention that she does have a book, it's called The Handshake a Gripping"
00:00:38,00:00:43,"History, that's available wherever you get your books. One last thing while I have a"
00:00:43,00:00:50,"little bit of time is if you go to NoSuchThingsAsAFish.com and look for the shop there, I don't think"
00:00:50,00:00:54,"we've mentioned this for a while, we have quite a bit of merch that you can get a hold"
00:00:54,00:01:00,"of, there's nerdy t-shirts, there's pin batches, there's all sorts of stuff, there is also"
00:01:00,00:01:05,"the Ultimate Guide, this was like a program that we made for our live shows, it was put"
00:01:05,00:01:10,"together by Alex Bell, it's got interviews, it's got photos, it's got tons and tons of"
00:01:10,00:01:15,"facts, Andy did a whole page on moss, basically if you love the show you will definitely,"
00:01:15,00:01:20,"definitely love it. So yeah, go to NoSuchThingsAsAFish.com and look for the shop and you'll find"
00:01:20,00:01:25,"the details there, but anyway, let's just get on with the show, live from the Soho Theatre"
00:01:25,00:01:32,"in London with Ella Al-Shamahi. Okay, on with the podcast."
00:01:32,00:01:50,"Hello and welcome to another episode of NoSuchThingAsAsAFish, a weekly podcast this week coming"
00:01:50,00:02:00,"to you live from the Soho Theatre. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James"
00:02:00,00:02:05,"Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Ella Al-Shamahi and once again, we have gathered around the"
00:02:05,00:02:09,microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:02:09,00:02:14,"order here we go, starting with fact number one and that is, Ella."
00:02:14,00:02:24,I feel like I must have at some point cried in the ocean and I've felt a bit better for
00:02:24,00:02:28,"it, you know. That's true, you can see you crying in the ocean is the point, right? And"
00:02:28,00:02:33,this was salty when I got here. Can you not see people crying in the ocean? With your
00:02:33,00:02:40,"heads under water. No, hold on seriously, okay, if you're actually"
00:02:40,00:02:45,"properly bawling, would you be able to tell? You'd certainly be able to tell the facial"
00:02:45,00:02:49,"expression of someone who's crying, for sure. Okay, so I think that's what's really amazing"
00:02:49,00:02:55,"to me about this fact, is that when I think about whales, I think about their songs, right?"
00:02:55,00:03:00,"And how emotive they are, how they move people, like there's been congressional hearings"
00:03:00,00:03:06,"in the US where people haven't actually given testimony, they've just played whale song."
00:03:06,00:03:10,And to think that those beautiful creatures who sit there communicating in this way that's
00:03:10,00:03:16,"just like moves us, can't cry, is really bad. But they cry vocally, don't they? Yeah."
00:03:16,00:03:20,"That's what we know about whales. Would they do that, right?"
00:03:20,00:03:25,"How is your CD selling, Dan? Dan's song. Shriver's whale song, yeah."
00:03:25,00:03:32,"Shopping centers, don't you? You're dropping to sleep, it's very calm. But they do do that,"
00:03:32,00:03:36,"right? Yes, so 100% they express emotion, etc., etc."
00:03:36,00:03:42,"I've got a question. So if, because obviously they live in water, if you cry, there's your"
00:03:42,00:03:47,"water is coming out of your eyes, would it be a pressure problem? Would it be harder"
00:03:47,00:03:53,"to push a tear out of your eye? Probably not. I don't know, apparently they just don't"
00:03:53,00:03:58,have tear ducts. So they just don't have the ducts full stop. They've still got the ability
00:03:58,00:04:03,"to secrete and clean their eyeballs. Yeah, so they've got like a useful tear, basically."
00:04:03,00:04:05,"Like a windscreen water. It's like a windscreen, yeah, exactly."
00:04:05,00:04:10,"Can I, can I, I just want to test a misconception that I definitely had before researching this,"
00:04:10,00:04:15,and I wonder if anyone else in the room had it. Right. I have had tear ducts wrong my
00:04:15,00:04:20,whole life. I thought that tear ducts take the tears from wherever they're made to your
00:04:20,00:04:28,"eye, right? Does anyone else think that? Yeah, some. Okay, so I'm not not as many as, not"
00:04:28,00:04:33,"nearly as many as I hoped would have made this error. But no, they carry tears away from"
00:04:33,00:04:40,"the eye, which are drainage bait. The tear duct is the gutter for tears. They get made"
00:04:40,00:04:46,"kind of in your eyes, lacrimal sac, and then they run into the corner and then that collects"
00:04:46,00:04:49,"and then it drains into your nose, which is why when you cry, your nose runs. If you look"
00:04:49,00:04:52,"into the corner of someone's eye, you'll see a little black dot and that's the tear"
00:04:52,00:04:56,"duct where the tears go into. Right. And it's just the gutter. It's not like a, sort of,"
00:04:56,00:05:00,I thought it was a kind of. So how come our nose doesn't run every single time we cry?
00:05:00,00:05:06,"It does, but it might go down the back of your nose as opposed to. Another thing that's"
00:05:06,00:05:11,"similar between the nose, the tear ducts and the nose is that in whales, they have this"
00:05:11,00:05:16,"stuff that they put on their eyes, but it's much more viscous than human tears. And it's"
00:05:16,00:05:22,"full of mucans, which basically means it's the same as snot pretty much. Not exactly"
00:05:22,00:05:25,"the same, but it's got the same stuff in. And they don't have to do it very often. They"
00:05:25,00:05:29,only have to do it every couple of hours. They kind of smear their eye with snot and
00:05:29,00:05:37,then they don't have to blink again for hours and hours. Is it worth the trade off of never
00:05:37,00:05:40,"having to blink, but you have snotty eyes? That's my question."
00:05:40,00:05:41,I would go for that. Would you?
00:05:41,00:05:42,I would go for that.
00:05:42,00:05:43,Yeah. Yeah.
00:05:43,00:05:44,"Because the ocean would wash it off, right?"
00:05:44,00:05:45,It does eventually.
00:05:45,00:05:46,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:05:46,00:05:47,That's pretty useful.
00:05:47,00:05:48,Okay.
00:05:48,00:05:52,"No, I'm just thinking you just save all that time, you know, constantly. Sorry I'm late."
00:05:52,00:05:53,I was blinking.
00:05:53,00:05:58,"But you miss like a tenth of whatever's happening in the world, don't you?"
00:05:58,00:05:59,Yeah.
00:05:59,00:06:00,This is why you need more women on this panel.
00:06:00,00:06:01,What?
00:06:01,00:06:02,What?
00:06:02,00:06:03,What?
00:06:03,00:06:04,"Oh, should we have snotty eyeballs?"
00:06:04,00:06:12,"Yeah, such lads. Fucking lads. Come back to mind, guys. Let's talk about fucking eyelids"
00:06:12,00:06:13,on whales.
00:06:13,00:06:19,"Oh, stripclops. Fuck that. We're going to talk about the nose problem."
00:06:19,00:06:24,Do you know what? I preferred it done when you were doing whale sound from the video.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"Shall we do some lads, lads, lads stuff then?"
00:06:26,00:06:27,Yeah.
00:06:27,00:06:32,So what is the one body part of a whale that will be able to tell you what species they
00:06:32,00:06:34,are better than any other body part?
00:06:34,00:06:35,Oh.
00:06:35,00:06:36,Like what species of whale?
00:06:36,00:06:37,Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Because I know it's a whale already.
00:06:38,00:06:39,You'll know it's a whale.
00:06:39,00:06:42,"You'll be like, oh, is this a pygmy right whale or is it a whatever whale?"
00:06:42,00:06:48,The right whale has the biggest testicle in all of the whales species.
00:06:48,00:06:49,All whales.
00:06:49,00:06:50,There we go.
00:06:50,00:06:51,Is that your bitch?
00:06:51,00:06:52,"Of all species on earth, right?"
00:06:52,00:06:53,It's the biggest species.
00:06:53,00:06:54,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:54,00:06:55,It's bigger than any other thing.
00:06:55,00:06:56,They're big.
00:06:56,00:06:57,They're big.
00:06:57,00:06:58,"Yeah, I would have thought blue whale."
00:06:58,00:06:59,"Okay, Ella, do you want to have have a pitch?"
00:06:59,00:07:00,"Oh, jeez. The..."
00:07:00,00:07:01,That's right. The vagina.
00:07:01,00:07:02,Oh.
00:07:02,00:07:03,Wow.
00:07:03,00:07:11,Do you know what? You laugh about this. I was once on camera trying to do a whale neck
00:07:11,00:07:15,"autopsy, which is like the autopsy you did give an animal."
00:07:15,00:07:19,"Walking past this huge say whale, and on camera we're like talking through all the different"
00:07:19,00:07:23,"bits and then I'm about to point at something and be like, so what's that?"
00:07:23,00:07:26,Because it was so huge.
00:07:26,00:07:27,Wow.
00:07:27,00:07:28,That's amazing.
00:07:28,00:07:29,It was quite terrifying.
00:07:29,00:07:30,That is something.
00:07:30,00:07:33,"I've never seen one in real life, but I've only gone off what I've read."
00:07:33,00:07:39,"But apparently, so there's a woman called Dr. Sarah Messnick who studies whale vaginas"
00:07:39,00:07:45,"and she says that basically they're just a series of flaps, folds, blind alleys, funnels."
00:07:45,00:07:49,"They said that the first time they opened one up, they couldn't work out, like in a maze,"
00:07:49,00:07:53,they couldn't work out how to get from the opening to where the sperm is needed to be.
00:07:53,00:07:55,They literally couldn't work out the maze.
00:07:55,00:07:56,Wow.
00:07:56,00:07:57,Like most men.
00:07:57,00:08:04,"But yeah, and because they're so different in all the different species, they're a really,"
00:08:04,00:08:05,really good way.
00:08:05,00:08:10,"If you only have one piece of a whale to look at, go for the vagina."
00:08:10,00:08:12,Can I pick the whale's head to differentiate the species?
00:08:12,00:08:13,Sure.
00:08:13,00:08:16,And you'll say the vaginas would better steer.
00:08:16,00:08:18,"Well, they all just look like whales, don't they?"
00:08:18,00:08:19,Yeah.
00:08:19,00:08:20,That's true.
00:08:20,00:08:21,And that's really not true.
00:08:21,00:08:22,"No, they don't."
00:08:22,00:08:28,"Like there are some of the whales, like a beluga whale looks really different to a sperm whale,"
00:08:28,00:08:29,for instance.
00:08:29,00:08:33,"But a lot of the closer species do look quite similar, I would say."
00:08:33,00:08:35,Do you want to fact about whale eyes?
00:08:35,00:08:36,This is as they're on tear ducts in Wales.
00:08:36,00:08:37,Yeah.
00:08:37,00:08:39,Lots of whales can't see blue.
00:08:39,00:08:40,Oh.
00:08:40,00:08:43,"Oh, that's another really sad one."
00:08:43,00:08:44,It's really sad.
00:08:44,00:08:45,They're monochromatic.
00:08:45,00:08:46,They just see shades of grey.
00:08:46,00:08:47,"Yeah, it's lots of whales."
00:08:47,00:08:48,It's so depressing.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Yeah.
00:08:49,00:08:50,They can't cry.
00:08:50,00:08:51,They can't see colours.
00:08:51,00:08:52,I don't know what.
00:08:52,00:08:53,I just feel really moved by.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"It's not everyone's moved by whales, right?"
00:08:55,00:08:56,That's like a thing.
00:08:56,00:08:57,Yeah.
00:08:57,00:08:58,Yeah.
00:08:58,00:08:59,So I think like facts like that just make me a bit sad that they don't.
00:08:59,00:09:01,But they can see something very cool.
00:09:01,00:09:02,This is great.
00:09:02,00:09:05,"Whales have big eyes, right?"
00:09:05,00:09:08,"Actually not that big, as in compared with the size of the whale."
00:09:08,00:09:11,"They're obviously way bigger than our eyes, but they're not huge."
00:09:11,00:09:12,Sure.
00:09:12,00:09:15,And their pupils are about half as large again as human pupils.
00:09:15,00:09:19,"So again, not a huge discrepancy, but enough of that means, I was reading an article about"
00:09:19,00:09:20,astronomy.
00:09:20,00:09:21,It was a brilliant article.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"Even with that smallish difference in pupil size, they would be able to see twice as many"
00:09:24,00:09:27,stars in the night sky as we can.
00:09:27,00:09:28,Wow.
00:09:28,00:09:29,That's cool.
00:09:29,00:09:31,They live underwater.
00:09:31,00:09:35,But they do come up.
00:09:35,00:09:36,They do come up.
00:09:36,00:09:37,They do come up.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"Although they have to remember to breathe, which I think is quite amusing."
00:09:39,00:09:41,Imagine having to remember to breathe.
00:09:41,00:09:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:42,00:09:43,It's not automatic.
00:09:43,00:09:44,It's incredible.
00:09:44,00:09:45,"Oh, because they can commit suicide, can't they?"
00:09:45,00:09:46,It's really dark.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Yeah.
00:09:47,00:09:48,It's really dark.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Join us next week on Sad Facts about Whales.
00:09:50,00:09:51,"No, they can't."
00:09:51,00:09:56,Those are the interstitials between my whale cries on my CD.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Whales commit suicide.
00:09:57,00:10:04,"Anyway, listen, can I steer us away from this incessant lad chat and get us to something"
00:10:04,00:10:12,"different, which is, in Star Trek, as part of the crew, there are whales and dolphins"
00:10:12,00:10:14,on the actual Starship Enterprise.
00:10:14,00:10:15,Other.
00:10:15,00:10:16,Yeah.
00:10:16,00:10:22,"There's a Citation Navigation Lab, which is always alluded to, which consists of twelve"
00:10:22,00:10:26,bottlenose dolphins and a couple of whales that are on board.
00:10:26,00:10:31,Because they can see the stars better.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"It's their echolocation, and it's the navigation system."
00:10:34,00:10:35,Space echolocation.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Yeah.
00:10:36,00:10:38,So they're navigating for Captain Picard.
00:10:38,00:10:40,"They're like, ""Where should we go?"
00:10:40,00:10:41,Ask the dolphins and whales.
00:10:41,00:10:42,"Isn't that cool?"""
00:10:42,00:10:44,That's utterly bizarre.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:47,Surely their echolocation wouldn't work in space.
00:10:47,00:10:52,"They're probably space whales, as in they're probably, oh, I assume they're space whales."
00:10:52,00:10:53,"I think it's the future Star Trek, right?"
00:10:53,00:10:54,So they must have evolved to.
00:10:54,00:10:59,Has the universe evolved to have molecules in between the stars as well?
00:10:59,00:11:01,We're going to have to move on in a sec.
00:11:01,00:11:02,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:11:02,00:11:03,What about crying?
00:11:03,00:11:04,So many.
00:11:04,00:11:05,Yep.
00:11:05,00:11:06,Doves don't cry.
00:11:06,00:11:07,Doves it.
00:11:07,00:11:08,Yeah.
00:11:08,00:11:09,Doves don't cry.
00:11:09,00:11:11,"I think most animals don't cry, really, do they?"
00:11:11,00:11:12,That's true.
00:11:12,00:11:17,"But there's only one song about doves that do cry, as like Princeton really suckled when"
00:11:17,00:11:20,worms cry.
00:11:20,00:11:26,"No, they do have tear ducts, gutters, and can keep their eyes moist, but they don't do"
00:11:26,00:11:27,emotional crying.
00:11:27,00:11:28,Talking to birds.
00:11:28,00:11:31,"You know how we always think, like, the birdsong..."
00:11:31,00:11:32,Talking to birds.
00:11:32,00:11:35,"Who's the lad now, eh?"
00:11:35,00:11:39,"So, you know how we think birdsong is all about communication?"
00:11:39,00:11:40,Yeah.
00:11:40,00:11:44,"They've discovered that, actually, no, sometimes birds are just muttering to themselves."
00:11:44,00:11:45,No.
00:11:45,00:11:47,It's just so cute.
00:11:47,00:11:52,"Apparently sometimes they're just like, ""It's just really not going well today."""
00:11:52,00:11:56,"I read that whales, if there's, like, predators around and they have the baby whales near"
00:11:56,00:11:59,"them, they'll whisper, like, ""Guys, we've got to be careful."""
00:11:59,00:12:00,"Like, whales whisper."
00:12:00,00:12:01,Cool.
00:12:01,00:12:04,That's pretty fascinating that they know to lower their tone.
00:12:04,00:12:10,"So my second crazy whale fact, if I can get it in, is that since the 1960s, blue whales"
00:12:10,00:12:16,"have lowered their sound, so, like, the gommel baritone, shifting the equivalent of three"
00:12:16,00:12:21,"white keys on a piano, which ironically used to once be made of whalebone."
00:12:21,00:12:26,"And it's really mad how they've completely changed, as well, the distance that they can"
00:12:26,00:12:27,communicate in.
00:12:27,00:12:32,"And part of that might be a good reason, so it might be that they have gone lower in sound"
00:12:32,00:12:36,"because there's more of them since the 1960s, because the whaling conventions and anti-whaling"
00:12:36,00:12:42,"and blah, blah, blah, it's actually worked, but the bad explanation is that the ocean's"
00:12:42,00:12:48,"more acidic and, therefore, sound travels quicker and it was like, ""You can pick your"
00:12:48,00:12:51,"explanation, be happy or depressed, basically."""
00:12:51,00:12:52,"Okay, great."
00:12:52,00:12:54,"Bad place to end, isn't it?"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"Well, let me quickly tell you about some new science that's been done."
00:12:57,00:13:04,"So there were some people who were swimming next to a whale and before they knew it, this"
00:13:04,00:13:07,"guy who was writing about it said, ""The water was like chocolate milk."
00:13:07,00:13:10,I couldn't see my hand when I held it in front of my face.
00:13:10,00:13:16,"I had poo in my eyes, mouth, wetsuit, everywhere, and I was soaked in it from head to toe."""
00:13:16,00:13:17,"Oh, no."
00:13:17,00:13:22,"Okay, but the interesting thing is they reckon this is evidence that perhaps whales will expel"
00:13:22,00:13:27,feces when they're scared as a defence technique to try and stop people from attacking them.
00:13:27,00:13:28,So that's why.
00:13:28,00:13:29,Maybe.
00:13:29,00:13:31,They have a mate who collects whale poo.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"She's like, ""Ashah, divorce."
00:13:32,00:13:34,"Yeah, she's really into like Sri Lankan whale poo."""
00:13:34,00:13:36,"Has she ever been covered in it, like this person?"
00:13:36,00:13:38,"I think there's a bit, but not quite to that extent, maybe, I don't know."
00:13:38,00:13:43,"Well, I read this article in Vice and they said, ""If this punado was newly observed defence"
00:13:43,00:13:47,"mechanism, then the divers have made a great discovery."
00:13:47,00:13:56,"If not, they just got covered in shit."""
00:13:56,00:14:00,It is time for fact number two and that is James.
00:14:00,00:14:06,"Okay, my fact this week is that in the 1950s, Campbell's tried to persuade people to start"
00:14:06,00:14:10,drinking cocktails made out of beef soup.
00:14:10,00:14:13,No?
00:14:13,00:14:14,It sounds amazing.
00:14:14,00:14:15,It does sound amazing.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Do you not fancy that?
00:14:16,00:14:17,It was over ice.
00:14:17,00:14:19,Maybe with a bit of alcohol.
00:14:19,00:14:20,Lovely.
00:14:20,00:14:21,No?
00:14:21,00:14:22,Perfect temperature for beef soup.
00:14:22,00:14:23,I see.
00:14:23,00:14:26,What was the beef soup made of?
00:14:26,00:14:27,Like beef.
00:14:27,00:14:31,"Like, beef broth, or like..."
00:14:31,00:14:32,Beef bouillon.
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Bouillon, bouillon."
00:14:33,00:14:34,What does that mean?
00:14:34,00:14:35,Bouillon.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"Basically, it was like soup."
00:14:37,00:14:39,I don't know what to say.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"It's like Campbell's, so they're like tens of tens of soups."
00:14:42,00:14:43,You know Campbell's?
00:14:43,00:14:47,"Yeah, I know, but like for any bougie women in the room, you know that there's this movement"
00:14:47,00:14:49,right now with like beef broth and bone marrow.
00:14:49,00:14:50,What's that?
00:14:50,00:14:51,It's bone marrow.
00:14:51,00:14:53,It's supposed to be really good for your gut health.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Right.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Where are the IBS ladies in the room?
00:14:55,00:14:56,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:56,00:15:03,"Sorry, this is a bit of a laddie podcast, we don't really do that stuff."
00:15:03,00:15:07,"This is in 1955 and the idea was, Campbell's, they decided that this was going to be their"
00:15:07,00:15:09,new marketing campaign.
00:15:09,00:15:17,They sent a load of what could just be described as cans of soup and ice buckets and recipe
00:15:17,00:15:23,"cards to a load of magazine editors and influencers, what we would call influencers today."
00:15:23,00:15:25,"And they just said, ""This is the new thing."
00:15:25,00:15:26,"This is what you have to do."""
00:15:26,00:15:29,They did adverts in magazines.
00:15:29,00:15:33,These soup cocktails actually appeared on menus in Los Angeles and New York.
00:15:33,00:15:37,"And it was all the way up until the 1970s, they were saying that this is something you"
00:15:37,00:15:38,could do.
00:15:38,00:15:42,"You could even add bitters, you could add vodka, you could add lemon, but the main"
00:15:42,00:15:44,bit of it was soup over ice.
00:15:44,00:15:48,"Did they have a massive surplus or something, whether they were trying to shift or was it"
00:15:48,00:15:49,not?
00:15:49,00:15:51,"No, it was just how do we find a new market?"
00:15:51,00:15:56,"And they, as James says, it was sent to like the Dodgers, the baseball team, they all received"
00:15:56,00:15:57,it.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"And the marketing, this is the wording that they were sending some of the stuff out within"
00:16:00,00:16:01,in the adverts.
00:16:01,00:16:07,"""For a summertime drink, it is low in calories, less than 30 calories per generous serving."
00:16:07,00:16:08,It is inexpensive.
00:16:08,00:16:14,It is especially valuable to athletes and golfers in replacing salt loss through exercise.
00:16:14,00:16:17,"Best of all, it's downright delicious."""
00:16:17,00:16:22,And they would put the recipes on the side of cans and it was a moment where they almost
00:16:22,00:16:23,made it a thing.
00:16:23,00:16:27,"Yeah, there was a guy called Lester Lannan who was an orchestra leader and he introduced"
00:16:27,00:16:32,"a new dance called The Soup, which you would dance after you've had a few soup cocktails."
00:16:32,00:16:33,"Oh, it's so..."
00:16:33,00:16:36,"It's a lack of foresight, really, that you didn't think to buy some Campbells."
00:16:36,00:16:37,"We should have done, yeah."
00:16:37,00:16:40,"We could have added some vodka, added some..."
00:16:40,00:16:43,"Because the amazing thing is last year, Campbells did it again."
00:16:43,00:16:44,No.
00:16:44,00:16:49,"Like this disappeared in the '70s and then last year, the Campbells website had a page"
00:16:49,00:16:56,"where it could tell you how to make a mushroom truffle daiquiri, a foe mango bourbon sour,"
00:16:56,00:17:01,a Thai chicken negroni and a pork ramen margarita.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"No, thank you."
00:17:03,00:17:05,"Some room temperature water, please."
00:17:05,00:17:06,It's so fat.
00:17:06,00:17:07,It's so grubby.
00:17:07,00:17:08,Who would try it?
00:17:08,00:17:09,"Oh, definitely."
00:17:09,00:17:10,I'd try it.
00:17:10,00:17:11,Who would try it?
00:17:11,00:17:12,Yeah.
00:17:12,00:17:13,"Oh, do you lot?"
00:17:13,00:17:14,"Oh, really safe, aren't you?"
00:17:14,00:17:19,"It was a massive thing and one of the other things which I had never read about before,"
00:17:19,00:17:22,"this is a thing like James has said, kind of just keeps coming back and this is largely"
00:17:22,00:17:27,"down to people on TikTok sort of reintroducing this as a thing, but there's also tomato"
00:17:27,00:17:28,soup cake.
00:17:28,00:17:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:29,00:17:30,It's a big thing and people were genuinely...
00:17:30,00:17:31,Was that in the '50s as well?
00:17:31,00:17:32,"Yeah, it was in the '50s, yeah."
00:17:32,00:17:35,"It does feel like people thought, ""Wow, it's the nuclear age now."
00:17:35,00:17:36,"Fuck it."""
00:17:36,00:17:37,Yeah.
00:17:37,00:17:38,That's just nothing matters.
00:17:38,00:17:39,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:39,00:17:41,And now it's 2022 and they're doing the same thing.
00:17:41,00:17:42,It's a bad sign.
00:17:42,00:17:43,Yeah.
00:17:43,00:17:45,I've got a lot of cans of soup left over from COVID.
00:17:45,00:17:46,Right?
00:17:46,00:17:47,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:47,00:17:48,Don't do something with it.
00:17:48,00:17:49,It's a Thai chicken negroni.
00:17:49,00:17:50,Lovely.
00:17:50,00:17:52,Can I tell you a hero of soup?
00:17:52,00:17:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:53,00:17:54,One of the heroes of the soup world.
00:17:54,00:17:56,There's a guy called John Dorrance.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"Oh, Dorrance, yeah."
00:17:57,00:17:59,And John Dorrance became the head of the Campbell soup company.
00:17:59,00:18:04,"Through his genius, he realized at one point, you know, because I think he was working for"
00:18:04,00:18:08,"Campbell's and he realized, ""My God, we're just transporting water."""
00:18:08,00:18:09,You know?
00:18:09,00:18:12,"Because that's a huge part of the cost of soup, he's moving it all around and he invented"
00:18:12,00:18:13,condensed soup.
00:18:13,00:18:17,"He created the magic formula and as a result, his family are all billionaires now."
00:18:17,00:18:18,Yeah.
00:18:18,00:18:20,"Because he just thought, ""Let's just take the water out."""
00:18:20,00:18:21,That's clever.
00:18:21,00:18:22,"Well, I thought so."
00:18:22,00:18:26,"The Dorrance family, there was a list of the richest people in the world, the richest families"
00:18:26,00:18:28,"in the world, so we're not talking individual billionaires."
00:18:28,00:18:36,"In 2023, they are listed as the 19th richest family in the world, according to this list,"
00:18:36,00:18:39,and above them is basically just a bunch of cocks.
00:18:39,00:18:47,"It's, you've got in at number eight, the Cox family, who they are the ones that have done"
00:18:47,00:18:49,"cable and broadband, Cox communications."
00:18:49,00:18:50,Who else have we got?
00:18:50,00:18:51,I've got...
00:18:51,00:18:52,"Legally, I'm feeling quite nervous."
00:18:52,00:18:53,I know.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Have you got more cocks?
00:18:54,00:18:55,"Well, no, it's interesting."
00:18:55,00:18:56,There's two cocks.
00:18:56,00:18:57,There's one that's spelt differently.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"There's the butts, the butt family, and there's a bush."
00:19:00,00:19:07,"So within the top 20, four of the richest families are two cocks, one butt and a bush."
00:19:07,00:19:08,What more do you need?
00:19:08,00:19:14,"Well, there's a hunt, but it was a close."
00:19:14,00:19:17,How much money was put into this marketing campaign?
00:19:17,00:19:19,"Well, they were just sending stuff out to people."
00:19:19,00:19:23,"They did do a full-page advert on Life magazine, so that would have cost a bit, but mostly"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"it was just sending out recipe cards and stuff, so not too much."
00:19:26,00:19:31,"I just find these food trends to be completely bizarre, like, remember that paleo trend that"
00:19:31,00:19:32,was going on?
00:19:32,00:19:34,"Yes, the diet, you mean?"
00:19:34,00:19:35,Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:36,What was that?
00:19:36,00:19:40,"You eat like a caveman, so you eat raw meat and dinosaurs?"
00:19:40,00:19:41,You eat like...
00:19:41,00:19:42,No!
00:19:42,00:19:44,"Oh, God, somebody teach him geology."
00:19:44,00:19:51,"Okay, so the dinosaurs came, but, yeah, that's just when you just eat beef and you eat a"
00:19:51,00:19:54,"lot of meat and grain and stuff, but it was really awkward for those of us that actually"
00:19:54,00:19:58,"studied human evolution because they kept asking us about it, and we were like, yeah,"
00:19:58,00:19:59,"I mean, two things."
00:19:59,00:20:03,"One is they were eating all aspects of the animal, so unless you're going to start eating"
00:20:03,00:20:07,"the intestines of an animal and the inside of the intestines of the animal, like, squeeze"
00:20:07,00:20:10,out the inside of the intestines of the animal and eat the eyes of the animal and the tear
00:20:10,00:20:14,"ducts, then it's not really the paleo duct because that's what our ancestors were doing."
00:20:14,00:20:16,"They were, like, being quite, you know..."
00:20:16,00:20:17,"No, the tail."
00:20:17,00:20:18,"Yeah, like, everything."
00:20:18,00:20:19,Yeah.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"But then the other side of it is, like, I love this whole, like, oh, the original thing was"
00:20:22,00:20:26,"the best thing because I'm like, they were all dead by our age."
00:20:26,00:20:27,So...
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:28,00:20:29,Do you know what I mean?
00:20:29,00:20:30,They were all killed by dinosaurs.
00:20:30,00:20:31,That's for sure.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Yeah.
00:20:32,00:20:33,They were actually.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"But anyway, oh, God."
00:20:35,00:20:36,We never talked about bovrule properly.
00:20:36,00:20:38,We've talked mentioned that once or twice.
00:20:38,00:20:39,All right.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"What is that, exactly?"
00:20:40,00:20:42,"It reminds me of your stag do, Andy."
00:20:42,00:20:43,"Yes, uh..."
00:20:43,00:20:50,"Bovrule is, it was originally called Johnston's Fluid Beef, and it's just..."
00:20:50,00:20:51,It's ultra...
00:20:51,00:20:52,That's nice.
00:20:52,00:20:58,"It's ultra-condensed, very condensed paste, which is very beefy, and it's a bit..."
00:20:58,00:20:59,Can we say it's a bit marmite?
00:20:59,00:21:00,It's kind of...
00:21:00,00:21:01,"Oh, wow."
00:21:01,00:21:02,"Like, you make a drink out of it."
00:21:02,00:21:03,"Oh, wow."
00:21:03,00:21:04,It's like a very thick substance.
00:21:04,00:21:05,You make...
00:21:05,00:21:06,You turn it into a drink.
00:21:06,00:21:07,Uh-huh.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Yeah.
00:21:08,00:21:09,"It's like very weak beef soup, but you drink it like tea."
00:21:09,00:21:10,Yeah.
00:21:10,00:21:11,You drink it like you don't care.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Yeah.
00:21:12,00:21:13,Yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:14,It's a drink.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Is this an English thing?
00:21:15,00:21:16,Yeah.
00:21:16,00:21:17,"Yeah, oh, yeah."
00:21:17,00:21:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:18,00:21:19,This is...
00:21:19,00:21:20,But bovrule used to be absolutely huge.
00:21:20,00:21:21,"It was invented in about the 1870s, and it was, again, condensing all the good stuff and"
00:21:21,00:21:23,the invention of stock and things like that.
00:21:23,00:21:28,"But in fact, the pope appeared in a bovrule advert at the time."
00:21:28,00:21:29,Yeah.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Like a TV ad.
00:21:30,00:21:31,No.
00:21:31,00:21:32,Is that not unethical?
00:21:32,00:21:33,A TV ad in 1870s.
00:21:33,00:21:34,"Sorry, I missed the year."
00:21:34,00:21:35,"Yeah, sorry."
00:21:35,00:21:39,"It was only in 1900, but it was a magazine ad, and I don't think it had full pages."
00:21:39,00:21:43,"It was a paper clearance, because it showed him drinking bovrule on his papal throne, and"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"the slogan was ""The two infallible powers, the pope and bovrule."""
00:21:46,00:21:52,"So it was not, like it was not strictly on brand, I think, for him."
00:21:52,00:21:54,But have you heard of chevril?
00:21:54,00:21:55,Chevril?
00:21:55,00:21:56,No.
00:21:56,00:21:57,No.
00:21:57,00:21:58,Can you ever guess?
00:21:58,00:21:59,Is it chicken bovrule?
00:21:59,00:22:00,Is it a different country?
00:22:00,00:22:01,"No, it's chev..."
00:22:01,00:22:02,Chev...
00:22:02,00:22:03,Chev...
00:22:03,00:22:04,It's not chervil.
00:22:04,00:22:05,Cheval...
00:22:05,00:22:06,Horse.
00:22:06,00:22:07,It's horse.
00:22:07,00:22:08,Oh.
00:22:08,00:22:09,And this was not an official drink.
00:22:09,00:22:10,It was a drink during the beurre war.
00:22:10,00:22:11,The beurre war?
00:22:11,00:22:12,"The beurre, beurre, beurre."
00:22:12,00:22:17,Is that the one that keeps appearing on my iPhone that tells me to celebrate the day?
00:22:17,00:22:19,"No, that's the battle of the boine."
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Ah, the boine!"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"And so, the beurre war?"
00:22:22,00:22:23,"Beurre war, yeah."
00:22:23,00:22:24,How would we say it?
00:22:24,00:22:29,"The way you sound it, it's like a butter war in France."
00:22:29,00:22:30,Beurre.
00:22:30,00:22:31,Beurre.
00:22:31,00:22:32,But B-O-E-R.
00:22:32,00:22:33,"Oh, we all..."
00:22:33,00:22:34,"What, is that again?"
00:22:34,00:22:35,Beurre.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Beurre.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Beurre.
00:22:37,00:22:38,"So, that conflict..."
00:22:38,00:22:43,"It was the second of those two wars, by the way."
00:22:43,00:22:44,There was a siege.
00:22:44,00:22:47,There was a place called Lady Smith that was under siege as part of the...
00:22:47,00:22:48,"Oh, it might have been the first one."
00:22:48,00:22:52,"And the garrison, they were so desperate that they made themselves horse bovril, because"
00:22:52,00:22:55,"by the end of the siege, they were so reduced to eating, you know, they'd eat all the food,"
00:22:55,00:22:58,"they'd eat all the stuff that looked a bit like food, and then they had to eat the horses."
00:22:58,00:23:01,"But they had a bit of fun with it, because they got to, you know, boil down the horses"
00:23:01,00:23:02,and make chevril.
00:23:02,00:23:05,"So, that just shows the cultural power of bovril."
00:23:05,00:23:06,It seems...
00:23:06,00:23:12,"It might seem like I said that quite long thing for no good reason, but that's not the case."
00:23:12,00:23:13,Just...
00:23:13,00:23:15,"OK, do people still eat, drink bovril?"
00:23:15,00:23:16,Yes.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:17,00:23:18,It's massive.
00:23:18,00:23:19,Really?
00:23:19,00:23:21,"You would get it if you go to a football match, you would see it."
00:23:21,00:23:22,Yes.
00:23:22,00:23:23,Do you?
00:23:23,00:23:24,You've been to a pub at last orders.
00:23:24,00:23:25,Yeah.
00:23:25,00:23:26,"Yeah, everyone."
00:23:26,00:23:27,Have you noticed everyone around you gets a steaming hot mug?
00:23:27,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:29,That's the final.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Yeah.
00:23:30,00:23:31,Yeah.
00:23:31,00:23:32,It keeps you warm on the walk home.
00:23:32,00:23:33,Yeah.
00:23:33,00:23:34,Yeah.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"For your walk, sir."
00:23:35,00:23:36,Yeah.
00:23:36,00:23:37,You must have...
00:23:37,00:23:38,"OK, I know that's untrue, obviously."
00:23:38,00:23:39,"They ring the bovril bell, don't they?"
00:23:39,00:23:40,They ring the bovril bell.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"This is a podcast about facts, guys."
00:23:43,00:23:46,"But, OK, so you guys have all had bovril?"
00:23:46,00:23:47,Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"Well, not..."
00:23:48,00:23:49,You've had bovril?
00:23:49,00:23:52,"Ella, it's like everyone has."
00:23:52,00:23:53,It's very...
00:23:53,00:23:54,"And I'm not British, but I've..."
00:23:54,00:23:55,Yeah.
00:23:55,00:23:57,"Well, after this, if anyone wants bovril, we'll go together."
00:23:57,00:24:01,"Well, we've got to wait for last orders, and we've got no choice."
00:24:01,00:24:03,"Well, why don't we all go and have the most expensive soup in the world?"
00:24:03,00:24:04,Do you fancy some of that?
00:24:04,00:24:05,Sure.
00:24:05,00:24:06,It's called cordyceps soup.
00:24:06,00:24:08,Would you like some cordyceps soup?
00:24:08,00:24:09,It's a cordyceps...
00:24:09,00:24:10,It's a cordyceps mushroom-y thing?
00:24:10,00:24:11,"Yeah, cordyceps mushroom."
00:24:11,00:24:12,You like it?
00:24:12,00:24:13,It's got chicken.
00:24:13,00:24:14,"So, obviously, it's veggies."
00:24:14,00:24:15,"Yeah, yeah, sorry."
00:24:15,00:24:16,But we can have it without the chicken.
00:24:16,00:24:20,"Red dates, loganberries and cordyceps, which is a mushroom."
00:24:20,00:24:21,Yeah.
00:24:21,00:24:26,It's that mushroom which goes inside caterpillars and sort of makes them climb up to the top
00:24:26,00:24:31,of a plant and then grows out of their brains and then makes birds eat them.
00:24:31,00:24:32,You know that mushroom?
00:24:32,00:24:33,"Yeah, I do."
00:24:33,00:24:34,Yeah.
00:24:34,00:24:35,Lovely parasitic mushroom.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Yeah.
00:24:36,00:24:39,It goes out of their brains and then they explode and all the spores go everywhere.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Yeah.
00:24:40,00:24:43,"Again, I think the room temperature of water just feels hungry."
00:24:43,00:24:46,"Well, this is the world's most expensive soup."
00:24:46,00:24:53,"One bowl is $688 last time I checked, and it's made with this stuff, and these cordyceps"
00:24:53,00:24:58,"fungi which grow in the insects and caterpillars, especially in China and the Tibet area, they"
00:24:58,00:25:01,"get it, and it's supposed to be, you know, very good for you."
00:25:01,00:25:02,Right.
00:25:02,00:25:07,"So, that's the same mechanism as in the TV show and the computing game, The Last of"
00:25:07,00:25:08,Us.
00:25:08,00:25:09,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:09,00:25:10,That's what it's based on.
00:25:10,00:25:11,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:11,00:25:14,"And like if the zombie apocalypse happens, because some people wanted expensive soup,"
00:25:14,00:25:15,that's going to be so...
00:25:15,00:25:17,Can you time it as well?
00:25:17,00:25:20,You know when we go see flowers that we know are going to bloom once every hundred years
00:25:20,00:25:21,and they open?
00:25:21,00:25:25,Can your meal arrive as just an intact bird and then suddenly it just explodes out?
00:25:25,00:25:26,Yeah.
00:25:26,00:25:27,That would be great in the mouth.
00:25:27,00:25:28,Yeah.
00:25:28,00:25:31,"But also, you're saying people in the Himalayas are spending $600 pounds?"
00:25:31,00:25:35,"No, so they take them and then they take them to rich Chinese cities."
00:25:35,00:25:36,Yeah.
00:25:36,00:25:37,Are those Sherpas?
00:25:37,00:25:38,"They own so much, don't they?"
00:25:38,00:25:39,Yeah.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"Honestly, those guys."
00:25:40,00:25:45,But there was the Chinese national games in Beijing a few years ago and there was two
00:25:45,00:25:52,"athletes, Wang Xiongxia and Chu Xiongxia, and they beat the world records in the 10,000"
00:25:52,00:25:55,"meters, the 3,000 meters and the 1,500 meters."
00:25:55,00:26:00,"And the newspapers all said it was down to this stuff, this cordyceps soup that they"
00:26:00,00:26:01,were drinking.
00:26:01,00:26:03,They were getting close to the finish line and then something just erupted out of their
00:26:03,00:26:05,head and pushed them over.
00:26:05,00:26:10,"It seems, looking bad, that it might have been due to steak sanctioned doping, but who"
00:26:10,00:26:11,knows?
00:26:11,00:26:12,Who knows?
00:26:12,00:26:13,Who knows?
00:26:13,00:26:14,Who knows?
00:26:14,00:26:15,Probably just that delicious mushroom soup.
00:26:15,00:26:18,Do you know Webster in America?
00:26:18,00:26:19,Dictionary.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Yeah.
00:26:20,00:26:21,Yeah.
00:26:21,00:26:24,"So when he was putting the dictionary together, he kind of just changed certain words to"
00:26:24,00:26:28,"what he thought was the better pronunciation, the better wording rather, the better letters"
00:26:28,00:26:30,to be used in the word.
00:26:30,00:26:31,Spelling.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Yeah.
00:26:32,00:26:38,"So like the reason, sorry, I just, I don't have his book on me to have looked that up."
00:26:38,00:26:41,"But so the word center, he changed to ER."
00:26:41,00:26:42,Okay.
00:26:42,00:26:43,Yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:44,That's why Americans do it.
00:26:44,00:26:45,He's responsible.
00:26:45,00:26:46,Color.
00:26:46,00:26:49,"There's no you in color in America because of him, but there were words that he tried"
00:26:49,00:26:52,"to use, but were kind of rejected by others."
00:26:52,00:26:53,Did he do soup?
00:26:53,00:26:54,And soup was one.
00:26:54,00:26:59,"So soup was meant to be spelled S-O-O-P, according to Webster, so the Americans might have had"
00:26:59,00:27:00,soup.
00:27:00,00:27:01,Yeah.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Gosh.
00:27:02,00:27:06,Imagine having that kind of power that you can just literally change words.
00:27:06,00:27:07,Exactly.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"An island, he tried to change as well."
00:27:08,00:27:13,"So island, he was going to get rid of the S. So his I-L-A-N-T, so island."
00:27:13,00:27:16,"And is, he was going to get rid of the S and put it as is."
00:27:16,00:27:18,And that is F.
00:27:18,00:27:19,Yeah.
00:27:19,00:27:20,Sorry.
00:27:20,00:27:21,Yeah.
00:27:21,00:27:22,Yeah.
00:27:22,00:27:23,Yeah.
00:27:23,00:27:24,I need to move us on to our next fact.
00:27:24,00:27:25,So.
00:27:25,00:27:26,Okay.
00:27:26,00:27:27,Are you upset?
00:27:27,00:27:28,Do you want to cry?
00:27:28,00:27:33,"Well, there was a, I am crying, you can't tell because I'm crying into the ducts."
00:27:33,00:27:37,"No, I was going to ask if you wanted to talk about portable soup, pocket soup."
00:27:37,00:27:38,No.
00:27:38,00:27:39,Okay.
00:27:39,00:27:40,No.
00:27:40,00:27:42,It is time for fact number three.
00:27:42,00:27:45,"Well, give us portable soup, give us portable soup."
00:27:45,00:27:46,"Well, it's also known as veal glue."
00:27:46,00:27:50,"I mean, there are a few different names, but it's basically, it's basically just solid"
00:27:50,00:27:51,soup.
00:27:51,00:27:53,"And again, it was, it was invented in the 17th century."
00:27:53,00:27:57,"It's something to carry around, something to take away to sea with you, like a proto-bovril"
00:27:57,00:27:58,really.
00:27:58,00:27:59,It's condensing.
00:27:59,00:28:02,"You boil it down, you boil it down, you boil it down until eventually you have this gelatinous"
00:28:02,00:28:04,chunk of soup.
00:28:04,00:28:05,And then you just rehydrate it.
00:28:05,00:28:11,"And so Lewis and Clark, when they did their expedition, they took 193 pounds of solid"
00:28:11,00:28:12,soup.
00:28:12,00:28:15,"So that would have made, that would have fed them for ages, but they only ate it when"
00:28:15,00:28:16,"food, when things were really dead."
00:28:16,00:28:17,I think that's because it was disgusting.
00:28:17,00:28:18,Yeah.
00:28:18,00:28:19,All right.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Yeah.
00:28:20,00:28:22,"We had a fact also from a listener about Lewis and Clark, which is part of the reason"
00:28:22,00:28:23,I mentioned this.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Oh yeah.
00:28:24,00:28:26,It's an amazing trans-American voyage.
00:28:26,00:28:30,They took 150 pounds of semen with them.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Which was their dog.
00:28:31,00:28:32,He was called semen.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Lovely.
00:28:33,00:28:34,All right.
00:28:34,00:28:35,I'm out.
00:28:35,00:28:36,Okay.
00:28:36,00:28:45,It is time for fact number three.
00:28:45,00:28:46,And that is my fact.
00:28:46,00:28:54,"My fact this week is that in 2003, there were 4,096 fraudulent votes in the Belgian election."
00:28:54,00:29:02,"The culprit, it was later discovered, was the universe."
00:29:02,00:29:11,"So what happened is the universe, it's always panto season at the Soho Theatre."
00:29:11,00:29:17,The universe accidentally voted in the Belgian election and it was down to cosmic rays.
00:29:17,00:29:22,"So basically this is 2003, there was a lady who was running for a unionist party and she"
00:29:22,00:29:27,"was called Maria Vindvogel, apologies for the pronunciation."
00:29:27,00:29:31,And it was national election day and there was a precinct where they were having the
00:29:31,00:29:37,"votes counted and as they were counting it, it sort of registered 4,096, which seemed impossible"
00:29:37,00:29:41,because that was more than there was possible to have in that area.
00:29:41,00:29:43,So they thought something dodgy is going on.
00:29:43,00:29:49,"They had every single person in computers in the area look at the machine, try to work"
00:29:49,00:29:50,it out.
00:29:50,00:29:51,What the hell is going on?
00:29:51,00:29:52,Nothing.
00:29:52,00:29:54,Have you tried turning that off and on again?
00:29:54,00:29:55,Sorry.
00:29:55,00:30:00,It's a computer people game.
00:30:00,00:30:04,"Oh, you're in computers."
00:30:04,00:30:10,"So they looked at it and they looked at it and they saw that 4,096 was a very computer"
00:30:10,00:30:11,renumber.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yes.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Isn't it?
00:30:13,00:30:14,Is it genuinely?
00:30:14,00:30:15,It is.
00:30:15,00:30:16,Some people here will have worked it out.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Two to the twelve.
00:30:17,00:30:18,Two to the twelve.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Two to the twelve.
00:30:19,00:30:28,"It's two to the twelve, so in binary it's one, zero, zero, zero, zero, twelve times and so"
00:30:28,00:30:31,one of the zeros must have turned into a one.
00:30:31,00:30:32,Yeah.
00:30:32,00:30:33,So that's...
00:30:33,00:30:34,"Oh, okay."
00:30:34,00:30:35,Exactly.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"I didn't get that, but sure, yeah."
00:30:36,00:30:37,Like a mad tiny glitch.
00:30:37,00:30:42,A mad tiny glitch suddenly and they couldn't work out what it was and then a while later
00:30:42,00:30:46,there was a conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
00:30:46,00:30:50,This was happening in Boston and it was during a talk called Cloudy with a Chance of Solar
00:30:50,00:30:57,Flares that it was revealed that they believed that it was the cosmic rays of the universe
00:30:57,00:31:01,"that had hit it at this precise moment, which happens a lot on our planet."
00:31:01,00:31:05,"I think somebody should call Trump up or his lawyers and be like, ""Yo, we've got you a"
00:31:05,00:31:08,"better excuse for that whole election, but I've got..."""
00:31:08,00:31:12,"This man is just sitting here ruining democracy by like telling everybody, ""Well, here's another"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"excuse we can use in court."""
00:31:14,00:31:15,Yeah.
00:31:15,00:31:16,It's the universe.
00:31:16,00:31:19,It's actually Solar Flares and that one over there is giving you mathematical formulas.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"I'm like, ""No part in any of this, but carry on."""
00:31:22,00:31:23,No.
00:31:23,00:31:26,I like the way that it was Solar Flares that changed the selection.
00:31:26,00:31:31,"So that old newspaper headline, which was The Sun What Won It, literally was true."
00:31:31,00:31:32,Super.
00:31:32,00:31:33,That's very good.
00:31:33,00:31:34,Yes.
00:31:34,00:31:35,Yeah.
00:31:35,00:31:36,Should we say what a cosmic ray is?
00:31:36,00:31:37,Yeah.
00:31:37,00:31:38,Sure.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"So it sounds like a ray, but actually it's not, it's, they're particles, they're pieces"
00:31:41,00:31:42,of atoms.
00:31:42,00:31:47,They're obviously incredibly tiny and they are passing through all of us right now.
00:31:47,00:31:49,"Even in this basement, we're not safe."
00:31:49,00:31:55,"They're not harmful, that's the good news, but at sea level, roughly where we are, every"
00:31:55,00:31:59,square centimeter of the planet gets hit by one muon every minute and they're going at
00:31:59,00:32:00,90 muon.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Right again?
00:32:01,00:32:02,It's what you make bubble from.
00:32:02,00:32:03,It was discovery.
00:32:03,00:32:04,What was that war again?
00:32:04,00:32:05,The buon.
00:32:05,00:32:06,Get your muon.
00:32:06,00:32:07,A muon.
00:32:07,00:32:12,A muon.
00:32:12,00:32:13,Yeah.
00:32:13,00:32:14,All right.
00:32:14,00:32:19,"But all of us now, all of us are being like, just bang, bang, bang, muon's passing right"
00:32:19,00:32:20,through us.
00:32:20,00:32:23,"All of us now are being, is no one concerned even slightly?"
00:32:23,00:32:24,I'm concerned.
00:32:24,00:32:25,But you said it doesn't harm us.
00:32:25,00:32:27,It doesn't harm us at all.
00:32:27,00:32:28,I'm not concerned.
00:32:28,00:32:31,That's exactly what the muon lobby would say.
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:32,00:32:33,Here's the thing.
00:32:33,00:32:34,We say it doesn't harm us.
00:32:34,00:32:38,It does harm us because it harms the things that we use.
00:32:38,00:32:40,It harms communications.
00:32:40,00:32:45,"It harms, if you're, there's examples of airplanes literally dropping hundreds of feet because"
00:32:45,00:32:49,they've been hit by cosmic ray and the system has rebooted and freaked out.
00:32:49,00:32:50,And those...
00:32:50,00:32:51,It's rare.
00:32:51,00:32:52,It's really rare.
00:32:52,00:32:53,"It's really, really rare."
00:32:53,00:32:54,"It's really, really rare."
00:32:54,00:32:58,"So the problem, one of the problems that there is going forward is that these particles"
00:32:58,00:33:02,"have energy and they can change, they can flip transistors basically."
00:33:02,00:33:05,A transistor is a little switch in an electrical thing.
00:33:05,00:33:11,"Now the smaller a transistor is, the less energy you need to flip it and the more you"
00:33:11,00:33:13,"have, the more susceptible you are."
00:33:13,00:33:18,"And as time goes on, we have way more transistors in everything and they're way, way smaller."
00:33:18,00:33:22,"So in theory, it could be worse as time goes on."
00:33:22,00:33:23,It's bad.
00:33:23,00:33:24,Yeah.
00:33:24,00:33:25,It is bad.
00:33:25,00:33:26,Yeah.
00:33:26,00:33:27,You said it didn't harm us.
00:33:27,00:33:28,You know when this happened?
00:33:28,00:33:29,I'm wrong.
00:33:29,00:33:30,I'm wrong.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Yeah.
00:33:31,00:33:32,So it was suspicious.
00:33:32,00:33:33,Thought there was some kind of fraud going on.
00:33:33,00:33:34,"Yeah, no, absolutely."
00:33:34,00:33:38,"I mean, fortunately because it was so obviously fraudulent that it was called immediately"
00:33:38,00:33:40,even by the party that they just knew.
00:33:40,00:33:41,Yeah.
00:33:41,00:33:42,"They were a small party, right?"
00:33:42,00:33:43,So it wasn't...
00:33:43,00:33:44,Yeah.
00:33:44,00:33:47,"And they know because in the Belgium elections, these machines, they do multiple different"
00:33:47,00:33:51,"counts in different ways and if any of the counts are different, they know there's something"
00:33:51,00:33:52,off.
00:33:52,00:33:53,"That's clever, basically."
00:33:53,00:33:54,"Did she end up winning, by the way?"
00:33:54,00:33:55,I don't think so.
00:33:55,00:33:56,"No, no, she didn't."
00:33:56,00:33:57,"Oh, that's sad."
00:33:57,00:33:58,Yeah.
00:33:58,00:33:59,"She never was going to, which hence why it was sort of..."
00:33:59,00:34:03,"She saw the numbers and she was like, ""My God, the revolution is here."""
00:34:03,00:34:06,This is the way that they do the elections in this part of Belgium.
00:34:06,00:34:11,So the voters are given a magnetic card with a magnetic strip on it.
00:34:11,00:34:13,They feed that into a computer.
00:34:13,00:34:19,Then they use a light pen to point at a television screen and that information then goes back
00:34:19,00:34:20,onto the card.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"They take the card out, they put it into an urn."
00:34:23,00:34:27,"People go into the urn, they pick the cards out, they put it into another computer."
00:34:27,00:34:30,"That information is sent on the internet to another computer, which is in the polling"
00:34:30,00:34:32,station.
00:34:32,00:34:36,That information is then put on a 3.5-inch floppy disk.
00:34:36,00:34:39,"This was in 2003, this was happening."
00:34:39,00:34:42,And then it was sent to the head office in the area where they would then put it into
00:34:42,00:34:45,"another computer, which added up all the numbers."
00:34:45,00:34:46,Wow.
00:34:46,00:34:47,I think there's a lot more than solar flares going on.
00:34:47,00:34:48,That's amazing.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Wow.
00:34:49,00:34:55,"You think after that, I just imagine if it had been a serious election, the mood would"
00:34:55,00:34:57,"have been, democracy would have been at stake."
00:34:57,00:35:01,I'm sure the people of Belgium thought it was a serious election.
00:35:01,00:35:04,Belgium is quite chaotic.
00:35:04,00:35:07,"They had no government for about five years, didn't they?"
00:35:07,00:35:08,Yeah.
00:35:08,00:35:09,And it was fine.
00:35:09,00:35:10,Yeah.
00:35:10,00:35:11,We could just ...
00:35:11,00:35:12,Bye.
00:35:12,00:35:13,That's so cool.
00:35:13,00:35:17,"Yeah, because if you've seen how long it takes to vote, it's fine."
00:35:17,00:35:18,You'll do.
00:35:18,00:35:19,Stay where you are.
00:35:19,00:35:25,"We need to be more like Makassar Indonesia, which in 2018, there was one guy running completely"
00:35:25,00:35:31,"unopposed for mayor, and he's still lost the election to none of the above."
00:35:31,00:35:35,Do you say Indonesia?
00:35:35,00:35:36,Yeah.
00:35:36,00:35:40,They have almost the ... I would say the opposite system to the Belgium 2003 system.
00:35:40,00:35:41,It's entirely ...
00:35:41,00:35:42,Dictatorship.
00:35:42,00:35:46,"Well, cross it off the touring schedule for 2024."
00:35:46,00:35:49,I'm looking forward to that.
00:35:49,00:35:51,They have nail-based voting.
00:35:51,00:35:56,"So you get a ballot form, ballot paper, ballot sheet."
00:35:56,00:35:57,Might just call it a ballot.
00:35:57,00:35:58,A ballot.
00:35:58,00:36:04,"You get your ballot, and then you punch a hole next to your chosen candidate with a nail,"
00:36:04,00:36:05,and then you hold it loft during the count.
00:36:05,00:36:09,"You can see where the light shines through the little hole, and that is it."
00:36:09,00:36:14,"And they introduced pens in 2014, but the authorities said, ""You must use the pen as"
00:36:14,00:36:19,"a nail."""
00:36:19,00:36:21,Just one other election thing that I read.
00:36:21,00:36:25,Do you know who won the 2020 Nambian election?
00:36:25,00:36:26,It was a local election.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Nambian.
00:36:27,00:36:28,Sorry.
00:36:28,00:36:31,Are you using Webster's Dictionary?
00:36:31,00:36:37,"Sorry, I was looking for the region, and I got confused as I was saying it."
00:36:37,00:36:38,So there's a ...
00:36:38,00:36:43,"If I take it slowly and we all concentrate, it'll be okay."
00:36:43,00:36:44,You can do it.
00:36:44,00:36:45,You can do it.
00:36:45,00:36:56,"And the Nambian politician, guys, if I cut out all the other stuff, it sounds like you"
00:36:56,00:36:58,are all massive fans of Namibia.
00:36:58,00:37:02,"Hey, they have great landscapes, is all I'm going to say."
00:37:02,00:37:03,Beautiful.
00:37:03,00:37:06,"No, okay, there's a local politician in Namibia who is ..."
00:37:06,00:37:07,Where is it?
00:37:07,00:37:08,I'm sorry.
00:37:08,00:37:09,Where?
00:37:09,00:37:10,I'm out here as well.
00:37:10,00:37:11,In Namibia.
00:37:11,00:37:12,Did you say Namibia?
00:37:12,00:37:13,I don't know.
00:37:13,00:37:16,I don't know what comes out of my mouth.
00:37:16,00:37:17,Namibia.
00:37:17,00:37:18,There's a candidate.
00:37:18,00:37:19,Yeah.
00:37:19,00:37:24,"In 2020, there's a Namibian candidate who won a local election who is ... Can you guess"
00:37:24,00:37:25,his name?
00:37:25,00:37:26,Can you guess his name?
00:37:26,00:37:33,Whatever we guess is going to be closer than whatever you read.
00:37:33,00:37:37,"It's a former politician, so it's a name that we know."
00:37:37,00:37:38,So it's kind of like ...
00:37:38,00:37:39,Like Winston Churchill.
00:37:39,00:37:40,Kind of like that.
00:37:40,00:37:41,Tony Blair.
00:37:41,00:37:42,No.
00:37:42,00:37:45,There's lots of children named Tony Blair in places like Kosovo.
00:37:45,00:37:46,"Oh, no, they were called ..."
00:37:46,00:37:47,Tony Blair.
00:37:47,00:37:48,Tony Blair.
00:37:48,00:37:49,Tony Blair.
00:37:49,00:37:50,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:50,00:37:51,It was a squashed name.
00:37:51,00:37:52,Tony Blair.
00:37:52,00:37:53,It was a Christian name.
00:37:53,00:37:54,"Okay, so a famous politician."
00:37:54,00:37:55,Mulmullen.
00:37:55,00:37:56,No.
00:37:56,00:37:57,That's good.
00:37:57,00:37:58,Ming Campbell.
00:37:58,00:37:59,Think bigger than England.
00:37:59,00:38:00,Bigger?
00:38:00,00:38:01,Erick Pickles.
00:38:01,00:38:04,"No, you're all close."
00:38:04,00:38:05,Maybe George Washington.
00:38:05,00:38:06,Really famous politician.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"Yeah, that's a good one."
00:38:07,00:38:08,But no.
00:38:08,00:38:09,Right.
00:38:09,00:38:10,No.
00:38:10,00:38:11,Adolf Hitler.
00:38:11,00:38:12,There's a politician there called Adolf Hitler.
00:38:12,00:38:16,So Adolf is actually a common name over there.
00:38:16,00:38:17,Was.
00:38:17,00:38:18,Was.
00:38:18,00:38:19,Is it still a common name?
00:38:19,00:38:21,"Well, I guess it's a generation that are, yeah, that are sort of like getting into political"
00:38:21,00:38:24,power at age.
00:38:24,00:38:27,"And Adolf Hitler said, and it's Adolf Hitler."
00:38:27,00:38:29,That's his first and middle name.
00:38:29,00:38:33,"And he says, ""My dad absolutely knew who Hitler was."
00:38:33,00:38:37,"I don't think he knew who was a bad guy necessarily."""
00:38:37,00:38:38,You know?
00:38:38,00:38:40,He sort of gives his dad a bit of coverage on that.
00:38:40,00:38:41,But he says --
00:38:41,00:38:46,"Wasn't there maybe a German colony or something, it was okay."
00:38:46,00:38:48,Exactly it was.
00:38:48,00:38:52,"So he seems, I mean, I didn't have enough time to go to a deep dive into him, but he seems"
00:38:52,00:38:54,"like quite a cheery, happy guy."
00:38:54,00:38:55,Might be restoring the name.
00:38:55,00:38:56,I don't know.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"But he said, they said, ""Are you going to change your name?"""
00:39:00,00:39:03,"And he said, ""It's on all the papers already."
00:39:03,00:39:04,"I think I'll just leave it, actually."
00:39:04,00:39:05,"It's fine."""
00:39:05,00:39:06,So he's just kept it.
00:39:06,00:39:07,And he won his election?
00:39:07,00:39:08,"Yeah, he won it."
00:39:08,00:39:09,It's recognisable.
00:39:09,00:39:11,"Yeah, exactly."
00:39:11,00:39:16,"His Wikipedia says, by the way, it says --"
00:39:16,00:39:19,"It says, ""Not to be confused with."""
00:39:19,00:39:20,Exactly.
00:39:20,00:39:21,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:21,00:39:23,"""Not to be confused with Adolf Hitler."""
00:39:23,00:39:27,"And then on that sidebar, it has occupation, political activist, known for sharing the"
00:39:27,00:39:30,name as Adolf Hitler.
00:39:30,00:39:34,That's got to be the disambiguation on Wikipedia with the biggest difference in article length
00:39:34,00:39:36,between the one guy and the other guy.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:37,00:39:39,"I don't know what he's achieved in Namibia, you know?"
00:39:39,00:39:40,Very true.
00:39:40,00:39:41,Very true.
00:39:41,00:39:45,"Do you know, in -- it was 1964, the general election, which Harold Wilson was the victor"
00:39:45,00:39:46,in?
00:39:46,00:39:47,Yes.
00:39:47,00:39:48,Defeated Alec Douglas Hume.
00:39:48,00:39:49,Go on.
00:39:49,00:39:52,"Well, that's kind of hot."
00:39:52,00:39:57,"Oh, Dan, where were you during my university years?"
00:39:57,00:40:03,"But, yeah, so 1964, he says that one of the big reasons he believes that he won the election"
00:40:03,00:40:08,is because they managed to swing a bunch of the marginal seats that might not have gone
00:40:08,00:40:11,"to Labour had the turnout not have been as massive, right?"
00:40:11,00:40:13,So he needed to get the turnout to be massive.
00:40:13,00:40:18,"And according to him, he managed to do this by persuading the BBC to delay a repeat of"
00:40:18,00:40:22,"Steptoe and Son, the TV series, and moving it to another time."
00:40:22,00:40:26,"And as a result, no one was glued to the TV, and they went, ""All right, let's go out and"
00:40:26,00:40:27,"vote instead."""
00:40:27,00:40:31,And he says that he thinks that that's what helped shift the vote.
00:40:31,00:40:32,Harold Wilson said that.
00:40:32,00:40:33,"Harold Wilson said that, yeah."
00:40:33,00:40:34,It's actually a bit more complicated than that.
00:40:34,00:40:41,"So, it's a..."
00:40:41,00:40:44,"OK, I need to move us on to our final fact of the show."
00:40:44,00:40:47,"It's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:40:47,00:40:52,My fact is that the man who just broke the world record for living underwater got a visit
00:40:52,00:40:55,from his 80-year-old mother halfway through to keep him cheerful.
00:40:55,00:40:56,"Oh, nice."
00:40:56,00:40:57,"Oh, that's nice."
00:40:57,00:40:58,It's a pretty sweet story.
00:40:58,00:40:59,Yeah.
00:40:59,00:41:05,"A man called Joe Ditturi, and he's a brilliant scientist, and he's been studying how extreme"
00:41:05,00:41:10,"pressure affects the human body over long periods of time, and it might be helpful for"
00:41:10,00:41:13,space missions if humans ever go to Mars.
00:41:13,00:41:16,So he moved to the Florida Keys.
00:41:16,00:41:21,"There's an underwater lab, and you go down about 22 feet, and you're living under there."
00:41:21,00:41:24,"The pressure is much higher than at the surface, obviously."
00:41:24,00:41:26,So it's a dry environment.
00:41:26,00:41:31,"You're in a sort of pod capsule thing, and he was doing tests on himself every day."
00:41:31,00:41:33,"He managed 100 days, which is huge."
00:41:33,00:41:37,"Humans have lived that far down for that long before, unless you're in a submarine."
00:41:37,00:41:39,"Slightly vexed question, never mind."
00:41:39,00:41:43,"And it's the longest underwater in a fixed structure, sorry, because otherwise, a lot"
00:41:43,00:41:50,"of our listeners are on submarines, nuclear subs, and we'll get emails eventually."
00:41:50,00:41:56,"Yeah, and he's an incredible guy, and he got a visit from his mum, who sounds like"
00:41:56,00:41:57,an incredible woman.
00:41:57,00:41:59,She scuba-dived down to go up to meeting.
00:41:59,00:42:04,"So he did 100 days, and it was a bit further than the halfway, it was 81 days into it,"
00:42:04,00:42:08,"and she scuba-dived down with his brother, and there's this great photo of them just"
00:42:08,00:42:11,sitting in this underwater house.
00:42:11,00:42:12,It is quite cool.
00:42:12,00:42:16,"It's quite, you know, Ele, you're an explorer, and it's good that people go down this and"
00:42:16,00:42:17,do all this thing.
00:42:17,00:42:20,But it is a commercial hotel that he stayed in.
00:42:20,00:42:24,"So any of us, if we could afford it, could just go and live there ourselves."
00:42:24,00:42:25,Really?
00:42:25,00:42:26,Yeah.
00:42:26,00:42:29,"The problem is, there's so many people doing these, I'm going to stay down here, the longest"
00:42:29,00:42:32,"attempts, the booking is like, have you got anything in August?"
00:42:32,00:42:33,Nothing?
00:42:33,00:42:34,Yeah.
00:42:34,00:42:35,Except I've got nothing.
00:42:35,00:42:36,One guy?
00:42:36,00:42:40,"But they don't have someone coming by and cleaning the room every day, do they?"
00:42:40,00:42:44,Someone scuba-diving down with a mint that they actually do.
00:42:44,00:42:49,"They will send you down pizza, though, so it's $800 a night for two people, and there's"
00:42:49,00:42:50,a...
00:42:50,00:42:51,Is that it?
00:42:51,00:42:52,Well...
00:42:52,00:42:56,I would have expected that to be much higher.
00:42:56,00:43:00,"If you can't scuba-dive, you also have to pay for a three-hour scuba-diving class."
00:43:00,00:43:04,"Okay, but like some premier ends in the central town are busy times."
00:43:04,00:43:05,That's not bad.
00:43:05,00:43:06,"Yeah, I guess so."
00:43:06,00:43:08,"It includes a pizza dinner, which they send out."
00:43:08,00:43:12,"Apparently, I read the TripAdvisor reviews, apparently the pizza is sometimes slightly"
00:43:12,00:43:13,damp.
00:43:13,00:43:14,"Oh, really?"
00:43:14,00:43:15,Wow.
00:43:15,00:43:21,"And yeah, and then you can stay, and then you can't fly or dive again for 24 hours afterwards"
00:43:21,00:43:23,because of the pressure change that you've had.
00:43:23,00:43:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:43:24,00:43:25,"Because you're pressurised, aren't you?"
00:43:25,00:43:28,"Yeah, that's the kind of the point of his science, isn't it?"
00:43:28,00:43:32,"He's like, he thinks that the pressure down there is going to help us live for a million"
00:43:32,00:43:33,years.
00:43:33,00:43:34,A hundred and ten at least.
00:43:34,00:43:38,"So he's 55 years old, and he's saying, ""I believe that if I was living down here, that"
00:43:38,00:43:39,would be...
00:43:39,00:43:42,"I'd be at the halfway mark on my life expectancy, so I can make it..."
00:43:42,00:43:44,It's really interesting.
00:43:44,00:43:45,It is interesting.
00:43:45,00:43:47,"So, like, there's two things that come to mind."
00:43:47,00:43:48,One is that this...
00:43:48,00:43:51,"Yeah, you kind of touched on it, which is like this, forgive the words, I'm about to"
00:43:51,00:43:57,use the interface between extreme adventure and science is becoming really weird and
00:43:57,00:44:00,"actually happened quite recently with OceanX, right?"
00:44:00,00:44:04,"Like, it's just this idea that anyone can go on an expedition."
00:44:04,00:44:08,"Basically, as long as you're willing to pay enough money, like, even Everest, we're talking"
00:44:08,00:44:09,about Everest.
00:44:09,00:44:11,"There's loads of people that now aren't really training for Everest, and they've just got"
00:44:11,00:44:15,"these poor Sherpas, basically, literally hiking them up."
00:44:15,00:44:16,And there is...
00:44:16,00:44:17,"I don't know, it's really weird."
00:44:17,00:44:18,I don't know how I feel about all of it.
00:44:18,00:44:19,"This, you know..."
00:44:19,00:44:20,The theory is legit.
00:44:20,00:44:21,"No, no, I know."
00:44:21,00:44:27,"But the thing is, it's like, there's now this really weird move in exploration where a lot"
00:44:27,00:44:32,"of really big research vessels are actually also tourist vessels, so you can get on these"
00:44:32,00:44:36,"massive vessels that are basically, like, for people that are spending, like, £60,000"
00:44:36,00:44:40,"for their, like, trip of a lifetime, and there's a bunch of, like, actual hardcore scientists"
00:44:40,00:44:45,"in the corner doing all this stuff, but also have to give, like, a lecture to, like, all"
00:44:45,00:44:46,these people.
00:44:46,00:44:47,And it's just...
00:44:47,00:44:48,I don't know how I feel about it at all.
00:44:48,00:44:49,And they're doing it to help pay for it.
00:44:49,00:44:50,"Yeah, yeah."
00:44:50,00:44:51,"That's the thing, it's a funding issue, isn't it, ultimately?"
00:44:51,00:44:52,Yeah.
00:44:52,00:44:54,"So it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of a good way of making sure that your expedition happens"
00:44:54,00:44:55,at all.
00:44:55,00:44:56,But I get what you're saying.
00:44:56,00:44:58,It turns it into a tourist proposition.
00:44:58,00:45:00,"But he's found out a lot of amazing stuff, because he was down there."
00:45:00,00:45:03,He was monitoring every single bit of his body every day.
00:45:03,00:45:07,So one thing that is gonna be probably annoying for the next person in is that the toilet gets
00:45:07,00:45:11,"a lot of usage when you're down there, because your bladder is really squished, right?"
00:45:11,00:45:14,So he said you're constantly just going to the toilet.
00:45:14,00:45:19,"Increased frequency and urgency of urination, is how you put it."
00:45:19,00:45:23,"And also, he says that it's interesting that the..."
00:45:23,00:45:27,"I'm so glad you're saying this, because I've got it in my nose and you're working out a"
00:45:27,00:45:28,identical way to say it.
00:45:28,00:45:31,I was trying to look for the phrasing.
00:45:31,00:45:33,Your semen travels at short...
00:45:33,00:45:34,Your dog.
00:45:34,00:45:36,Yeah.
00:45:36,00:45:41,Seamen travels at shorter distances when you're down there as well.
00:45:41,00:45:42,And so he...
00:45:42,00:45:43,His mother's down there.
00:45:43,00:45:46,Maybe that's why he stopped it.
00:45:46,00:45:47,Don't come in.
00:45:47,00:45:48,Don't...
00:45:48,00:45:50,Don't skip what I've done here.
00:45:50,00:45:54,I'm doing an experiment.
00:45:54,00:45:58,"You can only enter by rising up through the moon pool in the floor as well, so I'm like,"
00:45:58,00:45:59,"""Go back down!"
00:45:59,00:46:01,"Go back down!"""
00:46:01,00:46:05,Is that gonna be a problem for people having children?
00:46:05,00:46:06,Yes.
00:46:06,00:46:12,He says that maybe we won't be able to continue the species beneath 22 feet under sea level.
00:46:12,00:46:16,"Which is an interesting observation, because his point is that, as part of the research,"
00:46:16,00:46:21,"and this was happening a lot in the '60s, could we set up underwater bases where people could"
00:46:21,00:46:23,live for long periods of time?
00:46:23,00:46:25,Jacques Cousteau did that.
00:46:25,00:46:26,Sylvie Earle went down.
00:46:26,00:46:29,She's an amazing oceanographer.
00:46:29,00:46:32,"They would go down for 30 days, 40 days, 50 days, and so on, trying to work out can we"
00:46:32,00:46:33,live down there?
00:46:33,00:46:34,That was the big push.
00:46:34,00:46:38,"Let's build these giant underwater civilizations, basically."
00:46:38,00:46:40,But we won't be able to ejaculate properly.
00:46:40,00:46:41,So we will...
00:46:41,00:46:42,"No, we will not."
00:46:42,00:46:43,"You've got to go up for that, and then you come back down."
00:46:43,00:46:47,"There's a lot of teenage boys just going, ""I'm just going to go for a quick..."
00:46:47,00:46:50,"I just want to see the surface quickly."""
00:46:50,00:46:51,Just want to see the stars.
00:46:51,00:46:53,There's a whale up there.
00:46:53,00:46:55,He can show me some cool new constellations.
00:46:55,00:47:00,"I was thinking a lot about James Cameron recently, because, again, because of the ocean"
00:47:00,00:47:05,"gate thing, when I first heard about what he did in the ocean space, I'll be honest,"
00:47:05,00:47:07,I didn't really believe it.
00:47:07,00:47:10,He went down to the bottom of the Mariana's trends.
00:47:10,00:47:11,"Yes, he did."
00:47:11,00:47:12,He's been deeper than any person.
00:47:12,00:47:13,He's been deeper.
00:47:13,00:47:16,So the guy who directed Avatar 2 has been deeper than anyone else on the planet.
00:47:16,00:47:17,Yes.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"Well, you also directed Titanic, so that's closer, right?"
00:47:19,00:47:25,"Well, Avatar 2, The Way of Water is a largely aquatic film, so it's actually a more relevant"
00:47:25,00:47:27,thing for me to mention at this point.
00:47:27,00:47:28,"Sure, Andy."
00:47:28,00:47:29,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:29,00:47:33,"Touched a nerve, don't know what that was about, but anyway."
00:47:33,00:47:34,Sorry.
00:47:34,00:47:35,Sorry.
00:47:35,00:47:36,I got...
00:47:36,00:47:37,"Sorry, your CBI movie, exactly."
00:47:37,00:47:38,Yes.
00:47:38,00:47:39,"Sorry, I got really, really crossed."
00:47:39,00:47:40,Yes.
00:47:40,00:47:43,"And can I say, that was not hot, OK?"
00:47:43,00:47:45,"Oh, have I undone all my good..."
00:47:45,00:47:46,Anything you undoed the sexiness of earlier.
00:47:46,00:47:49,"Of the Alec Douglas Hume moment earlier, yeah."
00:47:49,00:47:52,"It's so interesting, because he gave up his seat in the House of Lords to run as the"
00:47:52,00:47:53,conservative leader.
00:47:53,00:47:54,That's very rare.
00:47:54,00:47:55,What?
00:47:55,00:47:59,Are you saying something about...
00:47:59,00:48:03,"Cameron also went down to see the Titanic and so the Mariana's trench, and that's his"
00:48:03,00:48:04,oceanography credentials.
00:48:04,00:48:05,"No, no, no."
00:48:05,00:48:08,"But that's the thing, that's not just his oceanography credentials."
00:48:08,00:48:13,"So people think, ""Oh, he..."", so he's been to the Titanic more than 30-odd times, and"
00:48:13,00:48:14,"you're like, ""Oh, that's something..."""
00:48:14,00:48:18,"But what's actually amazing is that he is legitimately, in his own right, a deep sea"
00:48:18,00:48:22,"explorer, not in any way as a tourist, as an engineer."
00:48:22,00:48:23,And there are all these crazy stories.
00:48:23,00:48:25,"So for example, Bob Ballard, who find the Titanic."
00:48:25,00:48:29,"I don't know if you guys are following this, but after the whole catastrophe with that"
00:48:29,00:48:34,"submersible, Ballard and James Cameron came out publicly and were like, ""Look, there were"
00:48:34,00:48:37,"safety concerns, there were always safety concerns."
00:48:37,00:48:40,"We've tried to highlight this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."""
00:48:40,00:48:43,"And what was really fascinating is watching the interaction between the two of them, because"
00:48:43,00:48:48,"at one point, Bob Bloody Ballard turns around and goes, ""I mean, yeah, I'll defer to what"
00:48:48,00:48:52,"he said about the mechanics of the..."", and you're just sitting there going, ""Bob Ballard"
00:48:52,00:48:54,is respecting this guy who was one.
00:48:54,00:48:55,Like God knows...
00:48:55,00:48:59,"Stay in your lane, stop making us feel bad about ourselves."""
00:48:59,00:49:04,The guy is like this incredible filmmaker and is also this incredible tech guy and the
00:49:04,00:49:06,detail he will go into.
00:49:06,00:49:10,"And then I did some digging and apparently, like, this has always been the case..."
00:49:10,00:49:11,"Sorry, this is..."
00:49:11,00:49:13,"You've got to understand, it made me feel really bad about myself."
00:49:13,00:49:19,"So apparently at the age of 14, James Cameron turns up to the Royal Ontario Museum, where"
00:49:19,00:49:26,outside they had Canada's first permanent submersible and they had it out there and
00:49:26,00:49:30,then they were going to put it in the water in Lake Charon for like two years.
00:49:30,00:49:36,"And it's outside the museum and he writes to the museum at the age of 14, asks for"
00:49:36,00:49:40,a blueprint for the bloody submersible.
00:49:40,00:49:41,And the guy...
00:49:41,00:49:45,"I think his name's Joe McGinnis, who's like a really, really famous oceanographer."
00:49:45,00:49:49,"He's like, ""Okay, this is insane, sure, I'll give you it."""
00:49:49,00:49:55,"And he sits there, James Cameron, 14, and tries to make it based on this blueprint, puts"
00:49:55,00:49:56,a mouse in it...
00:49:56,00:49:57,"Well, he tries to make his own one."
00:49:57,00:49:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:49:58,00:50:01,"But a small one, puts a mouse in it and puts it in a lake behind the Niagara Falls where"
00:50:01,00:50:02,he lives.
00:50:02,00:50:07,And apparently the mouse makes it but it's slightly traumatised.
00:50:07,00:50:09,"And then he's like, ""Oh, I've got a problem with the windows."""
00:50:09,00:50:14,"All again at the age of 14, writes to this scientist again and goes, ""Can you help me"
00:50:14,00:50:16,"with the window design?"""
00:50:16,00:50:20,And the guy gives him the address to a company that he can write to to get...
00:50:20,00:50:21,What's it called?
00:50:21,00:50:22,The Perplex Grass?
00:50:22,00:50:23,What's it called?
00:50:23,00:50:24,Perplex?
00:50:24,00:50:25,Perplex?
00:50:25,00:50:26,Namibia.
00:50:26,00:50:27,Why can't we...
00:50:27,00:50:30,Why can't I pronounce things today?
00:50:30,00:50:38,And they actually send him a sample and then he attaches it and does it again.
00:50:38,00:50:39,"And like, ""Does this whole..."
00:50:39,00:50:42,"The age of 14, you're thinking, 'Oh, this guy's a genius!'"""
00:50:42,00:50:43,"Yeah, that is amazing."
00:50:43,00:50:46,"We're going to have to move on in a sec because we want to run away over so, yeah, we need"
00:50:46,00:50:48,to get out of here and get our bov-rolls.
00:50:48,00:50:52,"Well, I can tell you a few more things about going on the watch."
00:50:52,00:50:58,"So, the word ""urinator"" originally meant someone who dived."
00:50:58,00:50:59,Oh!
00:50:59,00:51:03,"So, the first use in English of the word ""urinator"" is someone who goes deep-sea diving and then"
00:51:03,00:51:06,later it became someone who urinates.
00:51:06,00:51:10,"Must have been a crossover, period."
00:51:10,00:51:13,Hilarious consequences.
00:51:13,00:51:16,It's impossible to fart past 20 metres.
00:51:16,00:51:17,A challenge.
00:51:17,00:51:19,A challenge for the people at Guinness.
00:51:19,00:51:21,Are you going to cry and fart underwater?
00:51:21,00:51:22,Is that what the aim is?
00:51:22,00:51:23,"So, this guy..."
00:51:23,00:51:27,"Deepest underwater simultaneous fart cry, one by Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:51:27,00:51:28,Wow.
00:51:28,00:51:31,"The guy couldn't have farted in the whole time he was there, he couldn't do."
00:51:31,00:51:32,Dr Deepsea?
00:51:32,00:51:33,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:51:33,00:51:38,"Because what happens is, due to Boyle's law, the volume is much, much smaller of your"
00:51:38,00:51:41,fats and your body just can't push it through.
00:51:41,00:51:43,"And so, what that means is, as you go up, it expands."
00:51:43,00:51:44,No!
00:51:44,00:51:45,"Oh, what?"
00:51:45,00:51:48,"Wait, that doesn't happen with the other thing, does it?"
00:51:48,00:51:50,At the front.
00:51:50,00:51:51,You mean the ejaculation stuff?
00:51:51,00:51:54,I do mean the ejaculation stuff.
00:51:54,00:52:00,"Actually, you blast your way back to the surface."
00:52:00,00:52:06,"Lads, lads, lads, lads, lads!"
00:52:06,00:52:12,"OK, that's it."
