00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:13,660
 joined at the Soho Theatre by Ella Alshamahi. Yes, it is Ella, our explorer friend. She's

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,780
 a paleoanthropologist, she's an evolutionary biologist, a TV presenter, she is absolutely

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,960
 badass and she came to join us on stage for a really, really fun show. Absolutely certain

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,160
 you're going to really love this one. I just messaged Ella, she's off somewhere around

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,520
 the world and asked her if she wanted me to plug anything, she said not, but I really

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,800
 think I should probably mention that she does have a book, it's called The Handshake a Gripping

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,220
 History, that's available wherever you get your books. One last thing while I have a

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:50,840
 little bit of time is if you go to NoSuchThingsAsAFish.com and look for the shop there, I don't think

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,680
 we've mentioned this for a while, we have quite a bit of merch that you can get a hold

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,560
 of, there's nerdy t-shirts, there's pin batches, there's all sorts of stuff, there is also

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,400
 the Ultimate Guide, this was like a program that we made for our live shows, it was put

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,680
 together by Alex Bell, it's got interviews, it's got photos, it's got tons and tons of

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,720
 facts, Andy did a whole page on moss, basically if you love the show you will definitely,

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,600
 definitely love it. So yeah, go to NoSuchThingsAsAFish.com and look for the shop and you'll find

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,160
 the details there, but anyway, let's just get on with the show, live from the Soho Theatre

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,880
 in London with Ella Al-Shamahi. Okay, on with the podcast.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:50,580
 Hello and welcome to another episode of NoSuchThingAsAsAFish, a weekly podcast this week coming

19
00:01:50,580 --> 00:02:00,200
 to you live from the Soho Theatre. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,240
 Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Ella Al-Shamahi and once again, we have gathered around the

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,160
 microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,020
 order here we go, starting with fact number one and that is, Ella.

23
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:24,680
 I feel like I must have at some point cried in the ocean and I've felt a bit better for

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,320
 it, you know. That's true, you can see you crying in the ocean is the point, right? And

25
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,520
 this was salty when I got here. Can you not see people crying in the ocean? With your

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:40,560
 heads under water. No, hold on seriously, okay, if you're actually

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,620
 properly bawling, would you be able to tell? You'd certainly be able to tell the facial

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,940
 expression of someone who's crying, for sure. Okay, so I think that's what's really amazing

29
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,740
 to me about this fact, is that when I think about whales, I think about their songs, right?

30
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,700
 And how emotive they are, how they move people, like there's been congressional hearings

31
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,020
 in the US where people haven't actually given testimony, they've just played whale song.

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,960
 And to think that those beautiful creatures who sit there communicating in this way that's

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,800
 just like moves us, can't cry, is really bad. But they cry vocally, don't they? Yeah.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,300
 That's what we know about whales. Would they do that, right?

35
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,680
 How is your CD selling, Dan? Dan's song. Shriver's whale song, yeah.

36
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,320
 Shopping centers, don't you? You're dropping to sleep, it's very calm. But they do do that,

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,820
 right? Yes, so 100% they express emotion, etc., etc.

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,580
 I've got a question. So if, because obviously they live in water, if you cry, there's your

39
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,900
 water is coming out of your eyes, would it be a pressure problem? Would it be harder

40
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,240
 to push a tear out of your eye? Probably not. I don't know, apparently they just don't

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,260
 have tear ducts. So they just don't have the ducts full stop. They've still got the ability

42
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,400
 to secrete and clean their eyeballs. Yeah, so they've got like a useful tear, basically.

43
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,600
 Like a windscreen water. It's like a windscreen, yeah, exactly.

44
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,360
 Can I, can I, I just want to test a misconception that I definitely had before researching this,

45
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,160
 and I wonder if anyone else in the room had it. Right. I have had tear ducts wrong my

46
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,280
 whole life. I thought that tear ducts take the tears from wherever they're made to your

47
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:28,300
 eye, right? Does anyone else think that? Yeah, some. Okay, so I'm not not as many as, not

48
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,740
 nearly as many as I hoped would have made this error. But no, they carry tears away from

49
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,500
 the eye, which are drainage bait. The tear duct is the gutter for tears. They get made

50
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,140
 kind of in your eyes, lacrimal sac, and then they run into the corner and then that collects

51
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,220
 and then it drains into your nose, which is why when you cry, your nose runs. If you look

52
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,960
 into the corner of someone's eye, you'll see a little black dot and that's the tear

53
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,400
 duct where the tears go into. Right. And it's just the gutter. It's not like a, sort of,

54
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,440
 I thought it was a kind of. So how come our nose doesn't run every single time we cry?

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,520
 It does, but it might go down the back of your nose as opposed to. Another thing that's

56
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,720
 similar between the nose, the tear ducts and the nose is that in whales, they have this

57
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,520
 stuff that they put on their eyes, but it's much more viscous than human tears. And it's

58
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,100
 full of mucans, which basically means it's the same as snot pretty much. Not exactly

59
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,060
 the same, but it's got the same stuff in. And they don't have to do it very often. They

60
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,820
 only have to do it every couple of hours. They kind of smear their eye with snot and

61
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:37,220
 then they don't have to blink again for hours and hours. Is it worth the trade off of never

62
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,620
 having to blink, but you have snotty eyes? That's my question.

63
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,620
 I would go for that. Would you?

64
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
 I would go for that.

65
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
 Yeah. Yeah.

66
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,620
 Because the ocean would wash it off, right?

67
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
 It does eventually.

68
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
 That's pretty useful.

70
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,620
 Okay.

71
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,840
 No, I'm just thinking you just save all that time, you know, constantly. Sorry I'm late.

72
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
 I was blinking.

73
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,360
 But you miss like a tenth of whatever's happening in the world, don't you?

74
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
 Yeah.

75
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
 This is why you need more women on this panel.

76
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
 What?

77
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
 What?

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
 What?

79
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 Oh, should we have snotty eyeballs?

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:12,860
 Yeah, such lads. Fucking lads. Come back to mind, guys. Let's talk about fucking eyelids

81
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
 on whales.

82
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,360
 Oh, stripclops. Fuck that. We're going to talk about the nose problem.

83
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,880
 Do you know what? I preferred it done when you were doing whale sound from the video.

84
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
 Shall we do some lads, lads, lads stuff then?

85
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
 Yeah.

86
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,200
 So what is the one body part of a whale that will be able to tell you what species they

87
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,340
 are better than any other body part?

88
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,340
 Oh.

89
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,340
 Like what species of whale?

90
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
 Yeah.

91
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
 Because I know it's a whale already.

92
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
 You'll know it's a whale.

93
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,520
 You'll be like, oh, is this a pygmy right whale or is it a whatever whale?

94
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,120
 The right whale has the biggest testicle in all of the whales species.

95
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
 All whales.

96
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
 There we go.

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
 Is that your bitch?

98
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
 Of all species on earth, right?

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
 It's the biggest species.

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
 It's bigger than any other thing.

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
 They're big.

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
 They're big.

104
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
 Yeah, I would have thought blue whale.

105
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
 Okay, Ella, do you want to have have a pitch?

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
 Oh, jeez. The...

107
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,280
 That's right. The vagina.

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
 Oh.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 Wow.

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,920
 Do you know what? You laugh about this. I was once on camera trying to do a whale neck

111
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,440
 autopsy, which is like the autopsy you did give an animal.

112
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,560
 Walking past this huge say whale, and on camera we're like talking through all the different

113
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,680
 bits and then I'm about to point at something and be like, so what's that?

114
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,080
 Because it was so huge.

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
 Wow.

116
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
 That's amazing.

117
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
 It was quite terrifying.

118
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
 That is something.

119
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,840
 I've never seen one in real life, but I've only gone off what I've read.

120
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,360
 But apparently, so there's a woman called Dr. Sarah Messnick who studies whale vaginas

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,360
 and she says that basically they're just a series of flaps, folds, blind alleys, funnels.

122
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,320
 They said that the first time they opened one up, they couldn't work out, like in a maze,

123
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,720
 they couldn't work out how to get from the opening to where the sperm is needed to be.

124
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,360
 They literally couldn't work out the maze.

125
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
 Wow.

126
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
 Like most men.

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,800
 But yeah, and because they're so different in all the different species, they're a really,

128
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
 really good way.

129
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,360
 If you only have one piece of a whale to look at, go for the vagina.

130
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,920
 Can I pick the whale's head to differentiate the species?

131
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
 Sure.

132
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,440
 And you'll say the vaginas would better steer.

133
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,760
 Well, they all just look like whales, don't they?

134
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
 Yeah.

135
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
 That's true.

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
 And that's really not true.

137
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
 No, they don't.

138
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,680
 Like there are some of the whales, like a beluga whale looks really different to a sperm whale,

139
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
 for instance.

140
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,840
 But a lot of the closer species do look quite similar, I would say.

141
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,200
 Do you want to fact about whale eyes?

142
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,760
 This is as they're on tear ducts in Wales.

143
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 Yeah.

144
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,600
 Lots of whales can't see blue.

145
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 Oh.

146
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,760
 Oh, that's another really sad one.

147
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
 It's really sad.

148
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
 They're monochromatic.

149
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
 They just see shades of grey.

150
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
 Yeah, it's lots of whales.

151
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
 It's so depressing.

152
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
 Yeah.

153
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
 They can't cry.

154
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
 They can't see colours.

155
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
 I don't know what.

156
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 I just feel really moved by.

157
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
 It's not everyone's moved by whales, right?

158
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
 That's like a thing.

159
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
 Yeah.

160
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
 Yeah.

161
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,900
 So I think like facts like that just make me a bit sad that they don't.

162
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,640
 But they can see something very cool.

163
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
 This is great.

164
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,840
 Whales have big eyes, right?

165
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,980
 Actually not that big, as in compared with the size of the whale.

166
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,920
 They're obviously way bigger than our eyes, but they're not huge.

167
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
 Sure.

168
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,520
 And their pupils are about half as large again as human pupils.

169
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,080
 So again, not a huge discrepancy, but enough of that means, I was reading an article about

170
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
 astronomy.

171
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
 It was a brilliant article.

172
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,720
 Even with that smallish difference in pupil size, they would be able to see twice as many

173
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,680
 stars in the night sky as we can.

174
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
 Wow.

175
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
 That's cool.

176
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
 They live underwater.

177
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,040
 But they do come up.

178
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
 They do come up.

179
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
 They do come up.

180
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,560
 Although they have to remember to breathe, which I think is quite amusing.

181
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,040
 Imagine having to remember to breathe.

182
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
 Yeah, yeah.

183
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
 It's not automatic.

184
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
 It's incredible.

185
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
 Oh, because they can commit suicide, can't they?

186
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
 It's really dark.

187
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
 Yeah.

188
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
 It's really dark.

189
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
 Yeah.

190
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
 Join us next week on Sad Facts about Whales.

191
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
 No, they can't.

192
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,240
 Those are the interstitials between my whale cries on my CD.

193
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
 Whales commit suicide.

194
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,920
 Anyway, listen, can I steer us away from this incessant lad chat and get us to something

195
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,200
 different, which is, in Star Trek, as part of the crew, there are whales and dolphins

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,360
 on the actual Starship Enterprise.

197
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
 Other.

198
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
 Yeah.

199
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,240
 There's a Citation Navigation Lab, which is always alluded to, which consists of twelve

200
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,080
 bottlenose dolphins and a couple of whales that are on board.

201
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,720
 Because they can see the stars better.

202
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,040
 It's their echolocation, and it's the navigation system.

203
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
 Space echolocation.

204
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
 Yeah.

205
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,280
 So they're navigating for Captain Picard.

206
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,000
 They're like, "Where should we go?

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,880
 Ask the dolphins and whales.

208
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
 Isn't that cool?"

209
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,360
 That's utterly bizarre.

210
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
 Yeah.

211
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
 Surely their echolocation wouldn't work in space.

212
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,200
 They're probably space whales, as in they're probably, oh, I assume they're space whales.

213
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,960
 I think it's the future Star Trek, right?

214
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
 So they must have evolved to.

215
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,480
 Has the universe evolved to have molecules in between the stars as well?

216
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,840
 We're going to have to move on in a sec.

217
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
 Oh, no, no, no.

218
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
 What about crying?

219
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
 So many.

220
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
 Yep.

221
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
 Doves don't cry.

222
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
 Doves it.

223
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
 Yeah.

224
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
 Doves don't cry.

225
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,320
 I think most animals don't cry, really, do they?

226
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 That's true.

227
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,040
 But there's only one song about doves that do cry, as like Princeton really suckled when

228
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,040
 worms cry.

229
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,920
 No, they do have tear ducts, gutters, and can keep their eyes moist, but they don't do

230
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
 emotional crying.

231
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
 Talking to birds.

232
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,360
 You know how we always think, like, the birdsong...

233
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
 Talking to birds.

234
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,360
 Who's the lad now, eh?

235
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
 So, you know how we think birdsong is all about communication?

236
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
 Yeah.

237
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,360
 They've discovered that, actually, no, sometimes birds are just muttering to themselves.

238
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
 No.

239
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,160
 It's just so cute.

240
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,360
 Apparently sometimes they're just like, "It's just really not going well today."

241
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,480
 I read that whales, if there's, like, predators around and they have the baby whales near

242
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,160
 them, they'll whisper, like, "Guys, we've got to be careful."

243
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
 Like, whales whisper.

244
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
 Cool.

245
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,160
 That's pretty fascinating that they know to lower their tone.

246
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,320
 So my second crazy whale fact, if I can get it in, is that since the 1960s, blue whales

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,360
 have lowered their sound, so, like, the gommel baritone, shifting the equivalent of three

248
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,840
 white keys on a piano, which ironically used to once be made of whalebone.

249
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,280
 And it's really mad how they've completely changed, as well, the distance that they can

250
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,840
 communicate in.

251
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,080
 And part of that might be a good reason, so it might be that they have gone lower in sound

252
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,560
 because there's more of them since the 1960s, because the whaling conventions and anti-whaling

253
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,680
 and blah, blah, blah, it's actually worked, but the bad explanation is that the ocean's

254
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,080
 more acidic and, therefore, sound travels quicker and it was like, "You can pick your

255
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,600
 explanation, be happy or depressed, basically."

256
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 Okay, great.

257
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 Bad place to end, isn't it?

258
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,920
 Well, let me quickly tell you about some new science that's been done.

259
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,040
 So there were some people who were swimming next to a whale and before they knew it, this

260
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,920
 guy who was writing about it said, "The water was like chocolate milk.

261
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,800
 I couldn't see my hand when I held it in front of my face.

262
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,280
 I had poo in my eyes, mouth, wetsuit, everywhere, and I was soaked in it from head to toe."

263
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
 Oh, no.

264
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,560
 Okay, but the interesting thing is they reckon this is evidence that perhaps whales will expel

265
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,520
 feces when they're scared as a defence technique to try and stop people from attacking them.

266
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
 So that's why.

267
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
 Maybe.

268
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,200
 They have a mate who collects whale poo.

269
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
 She's like, "Ashah, divorce.

270
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
 Yeah, she's really into like Sri Lankan whale poo."

271
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,000
 Has she ever been covered in it, like this person?

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,840
 I think there's a bit, but not quite to that extent, maybe, I don't know.

273
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,640
 Well, I read this article in Vice and they said, "If this punado was newly observed defence

274
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,080
 mechanism, then the divers have made a great discovery.

275
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:56,440
 If not, they just got covered in shit."

276
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,080
 It is time for fact number two and that is James.

277
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,320
 Okay, my fact this week is that in the 1950s, Campbell's tried to persuade people to start

278
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,400
 drinking cocktails made out of beef soup.

279
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,200
 No?

280
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,680
 It sounds amazing.

281
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
 It does sound amazing.

282
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
 Do you not fancy that?

283
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
 It was over ice.

284
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,480
 Maybe with a bit of alcohol.

285
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
 Lovely.

286
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
 No?

287
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
 Perfect temperature for beef soup.

288
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 I see.

289
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,560
 What was the beef soup made of?

290
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
 Like beef.

291
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,720
 Like, beef broth, or like...

292
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
 Beef bouillon.

293
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
 Bouillon, bouillon.

294
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
 What does that mean?

295
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 Bouillon.

296
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,040
 Basically, it was like soup.

297
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
 I don't know what to say.

298
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,400
 It's like Campbell's, so they're like tens of tens of soups.

299
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
 You know Campbell's?

300
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,080
 Yeah, I know, but like for any bougie women in the room, you know that there's this movement

301
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,760
 right now with like beef broth and bone marrow.

302
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
 What's that?

303
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
 It's bone marrow.

304
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
 It's supposed to be really good for your gut health.

305
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
 Right.

306
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,960
 Where are the IBS ladies in the room?

307
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
 Oh, yeah.

308
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,280
 Sorry, this is a bit of a laddie podcast, we don't really do that stuff.

309
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,600
 This is in 1955 and the idea was, Campbell's, they decided that this was going to be their

310
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,280
 new marketing campaign.

311
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:17,040
 They sent a load of what could just be described as cans of soup and ice buckets and recipe

312
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,560
 cards to a load of magazine editors and influencers, what we would call influencers today.

313
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,640
 And they just said, "This is the new thing.

314
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,920
 This is what you have to do."

315
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,240
 They did adverts in magazines.

316
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,920
 These soup cocktails actually appeared on menus in Los Angeles and New York.

317
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,680
 And it was all the way up until the 1970s, they were saying that this is something you

318
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
 could do.

319
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,800
 You could even add bitters, you could add vodka, you could add lemon, but the main

320
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
 bit of it was soup over ice.

321
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,680
 Did they have a massive surplus or something, whether they were trying to shift or was it

322
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
 not?

323
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,840
 No, it was just how do we find a new market?

324
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,480
 And they, as James says, it was sent to like the Dodgers, the baseball team, they all received

325
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
 it.

326
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
 And the marketing, this is the wording that they were sending some of the stuff out within

327
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
 in the adverts.

328
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,000
 "For a summertime drink, it is low in calories, less than 30 calories per generous serving.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,360
 It is inexpensive.

330
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,000
 It is especially valuable to athletes and golfers in replacing salt loss through exercise.

331
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,360
 Best of all, it's downright delicious."

332
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,320
 And they would put the recipes on the side of cans and it was a moment where they almost

333
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
 made it a thing.

334
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,320
 Yeah, there was a guy called Lester Lannan who was an orchestra leader and he introduced

335
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,400
 a new dance called The Soup, which you would dance after you've had a few soup cocktails.

336
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
 Oh, it's so...

337
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,800
 It's a lack of foresight, really, that you didn't think to buy some Campbells.

338
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
 We should have done, yeah.

339
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,400
 We could have added some vodka, added some...

340
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,240
 Because the amazing thing is last year, Campbells did it again.

341
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
 No.

342
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,160
 Like this disappeared in the '70s and then last year, the Campbells website had a page

343
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:56,000
 where it could tell you how to make a mushroom truffle daiquiri, a foe mango bourbon sour,

344
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,160
 a Thai chicken negroni and a pork ramen margarita.

345
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,280
 No, thank you.

346
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
 Some room temperature water, please.

347
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
 It's so fat.

348
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
 It's so grubby.

349
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
 Who would try it?

350
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
 Oh, definitely.

351
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
 I'd try it.

352
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
 Who would try it?

353
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
 Yeah.

354
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
 Oh, do you lot?

355
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
 Oh, really safe, aren't you?

356
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,040
 It was a massive thing and one of the other things which I had never read about before,

357
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,340
 this is a thing like James has said, kind of just keeps coming back and this is largely

358
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:27,800
 down to people on TikTok sort of reintroducing this as a thing, but there's also tomato

359
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
 soup cake.

360
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
 Oh, yeah.

361
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 It's a big thing and people were genuinely...

362
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 Was that in the '50s as well?

363
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
 Yeah, it was in the '50s, yeah.

364
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,320
 It does feel like people thought, "Wow, it's the nuclear age now.

365
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
 Fuck it."

366
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
 Yeah.

367
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
 That's just nothing matters.

368
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,040
 And now it's 2022 and they're doing the same thing.

370
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
 It's a bad sign.

371
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
 Yeah.

372
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,200
 I've got a lot of cans of soup left over from COVID.

373
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
 Right?

374
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 Don't do something with it.

376
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
 It's a Thai chicken negroni.

377
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
 Lovely.

378
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
 Can I tell you a hero of soup?

379
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 Oh, yeah.

380
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
 One of the heroes of the soup world.

381
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
 There's a guy called John Dorrance.

382
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 Oh, Dorrance, yeah.

383
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,800
 And John Dorrance became the head of the Campbell soup company.

384
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,360
 Through his genius, he realized at one point, you know, because I think he was working for

385
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,160
 Campbell's and he realized, "My God, we're just transporting water."

386
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
 You know?

387
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,320
 Because that's a huge part of the cost of soup, he's moving it all around and he invented

388
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
 condensed soup.

389
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,960
 He created the magic formula and as a result, his family are all billionaires now.

390
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
 Yeah.

391
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,360
 Because he just thought, "Let's just take the water out."

392
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
 That's clever.

393
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
 Well, I thought so.

394
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,160
 The Dorrance family, there was a list of the richest people in the world, the richest families

395
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,760
 in the world, so we're not talking individual billionaires.

396
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:36,600
 In 2023, they are listed as the 19th richest family in the world, according to this list,

397
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,520
 and above them is basically just a bunch of cocks.

398
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:47,200
 It's, you've got in at number eight, the Cox family, who they are the ones that have done

399
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,760
 cable and broadband, Cox communications.

400
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
 Who else have we got?

401
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
 I've got...

402
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
 Legally, I'm feeling quite nervous.

403
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
 I know.

404
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
 Have you got more cocks?

405
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
 Well, no, it's interesting.

406
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
 There's two cocks.

407
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
 There's one that's spelt differently.

408
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,560
 There's the butts, the butt family, and there's a bush.

409
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:07,240
 So within the top 20, four of the richest families are two cocks, one butt and a bush.

410
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 What more do you need?

411
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,840
 Well, there's a hunt, but it was a close.

412
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,440
 How much money was put into this marketing campaign?

413
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
 Well, they were just sending stuff out to people.

414
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,720
 They did do a full-page advert on Life magazine, so that would have cost a bit, but mostly

415
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,440
 it was just sending out recipe cards and stuff, so not too much.

416
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,720
 I just find these food trends to be completely bizarre, like, remember that paleo trend that

417
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
 was going on?

418
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,200
 Yes, the diet, you mean?

419
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
 Yeah.

420
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
 What was that?

421
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,080
 You eat like a caveman, so you eat raw meat and dinosaurs?

422
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
 You eat like...

423
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
 No!

424
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,920
 Oh, God, somebody teach him geology.

425
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,520
 Okay, so the dinosaurs came, but, yeah, that's just when you just eat beef and you eat a

426
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,960
 lot of meat and grain and stuff, but it was really awkward for those of us that actually

427
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,600
 studied human evolution because they kept asking us about it, and we were like, yeah,

428
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,920
 I mean, two things.

429
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,400
 One is they were eating all aspects of the animal, so unless you're going to start eating

430
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,000
 the intestines of an animal and the inside of the intestines of the animal, like, squeeze

431
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,960
 out the inside of the intestines of the animal and eat the eyes of the animal and the tear

432
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,640
 ducts, then it's not really the paleo duct because that's what our ancestors were doing.

433
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
 They were, like, being quite, you know...

434
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
 No, the tail.

435
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
 Yeah, like, everything.

436
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
 Yeah.

437
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,840
 But then the other side of it is, like, I love this whole, like, oh, the original thing was

438
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,520
 the best thing because I'm like, they were all dead by our age.

439
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
 So...

440
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
 Oh, yeah.

441
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
 Do you know what I mean?

442
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
 They were all killed by dinosaurs.

443
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
 That's for sure.

444
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
 Yeah.

445
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
 They were actually.

446
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,240
 But anyway, oh, God.

447
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,800
 We never talked about bovrule properly.

448
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,200
 We've talked mentioned that once or twice.

449
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 All right.

450
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
 What is that, exactly?

451
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,480
 It reminds me of your stag do, Andy.

452
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
 Yes, uh...

453
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,920
 Bovrule is, it was originally called Johnston's Fluid Beef, and it's just...

454
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
 It's ultra...

455
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
 That's nice.

456
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,040
 It's ultra-condensed, very condensed paste, which is very beefy, and it's a bit...

457
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,320
 Can we say it's a bit marmite?

458
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
 It's kind of...

459
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
 Oh, wow.

460
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
 Like, you make a drink out of it.

461
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
 Oh, wow.

462
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 It's like a very thick substance.

463
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
 You make...

464
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
 You turn it into a drink.

465
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
 Uh-huh.

466
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 Yeah.

467
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 It's like very weak beef soup, but you drink it like tea.

468
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 Yeah.

469
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 You drink it like you don't care.

470
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 Yeah.

471
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
 Yeah.

472
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 It's a drink.

473
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 Is this an English thing?

474
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
 Yeah.

475
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
 Yeah, oh, yeah.

476
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
 Oh, yeah.

477
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 This is...

478
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 But bovrule used to be absolutely huge.

479
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
 It was invented in about the 1870s, and it was, again, condensing all the good stuff and

480
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,900
 the invention of stock and things like that.

481
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,040
 But in fact, the pope appeared in a bovrule advert at the time.

482
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 Yeah.

483
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
 Like a TV ad.

484
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
 No.

485
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
 Is that not unethical?

486
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
 A TV ad in 1870s.

487
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
 Sorry, I missed the year.

488
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
 Yeah, sorry.

489
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,280
 It was only in 1900, but it was a magazine ad, and I don't think it had full pages.

490
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,560
 It was a paper clearance, because it showed him drinking bovrule on his papal throne, and

491
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,560
 the slogan was "The two infallible powers, the pope and bovrule."

492
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,360
 So it was not, like it was not strictly on brand, I think, for him.

493
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,040
 But have you heard of chevril?

494
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
 Chevril?

495
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
 No.

496
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
 No.

497
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
 Can you ever guess?

498
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
 Is it chicken bovrule?

499
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
 Is it a different country?

500
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
 No, it's chev...

501
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
 Chev...

502
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
 Chev...

503
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
 It's not chervil.

504
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
 Cheval...

505
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
 Horse.

506
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
 It's horse.

507
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
 Oh.

508
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
 And this was not an official drink.

509
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
 It was a drink during the beurre war.

510
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
 The beurre war?

511
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
 The beurre, beurre, beurre.

512
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,560
 Is that the one that keeps appearing on my iPhone that tells me to celebrate the day?

513
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
 No, that's the battle of the boine.

514
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
 Ah, the boine!

515
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
 And so, the beurre war?

516
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
 Beurre war, yeah.

517
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
 How would we say it?

518
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,680
 The way you sound it, it's like a butter war in France.

519
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
 Beurre.

520
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
 Beurre.

521
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
 But B-O-E-R.

522
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
 Oh, we all...

523
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
 What, is that again?

524
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
 Beurre.

525
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
 Beurre.

526
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
 Beurre.

527
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
 So, that conflict...

528
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,760
 It was the second of those two wars, by the way.

529
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
 There was a siege.

530
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,880
 There was a place called Lady Smith that was under siege as part of the...

531
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
 Oh, it might have been the first one.

532
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,480
 And the garrison, they were so desperate that they made themselves horse bovril, because

533
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,840
 by the end of the siege, they were so reduced to eating, you know, they'd eat all the food,

534
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,760
 they'd eat all the stuff that looked a bit like food, and then they had to eat the horses.

535
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,760
 But they had a bit of fun with it, because they got to, you know, boil down the horses

536
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
 and make chevril.

537
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,200
 So, that just shows the cultural power of bovril.

538
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
 It seems...

539
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,160
 It might seem like I said that quite long thing for no good reason, but that's not the case.

540
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
 Just...

541
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,760
 OK, do people still eat, drink bovril?

542
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
 Yes.

543
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

544
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
 It's massive.

545
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
 Really?

546
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,280
 You would get it if you go to a football match, you would see it.

547
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
 Yes.

548
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
 Do you?

549
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
 You've been to a pub at last orders.

550
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
 Yeah.

551
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
 Yeah, everyone.

552
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
 Have you noticed everyone around you gets a steaming hot mug?

553
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
 Yeah.

554
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
 That's the final.

555
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
 Yeah.

556
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
 Yeah.

557
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
 It keeps you warm on the walk home.

558
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
 Yeah.

559
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
 Yeah.

560
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
 For your walk, sir.

561
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
 Yeah.

562
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
 You must have...

563
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
 OK, I know that's untrue, obviously.

564
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
 They ring the bovril bell, don't they?

565
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
 They ring the bovril bell.

566
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,280
 This is a podcast about facts, guys.

567
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,960
 But, OK, so you guys have all had bovril?

568
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
 Yeah.

569
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
 Well, not...

570
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
 You've had bovril?

571
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,600
 Ella, it's like everyone has.

572
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 It's very...

573
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
 And I'm not British, but I've...

574
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
 Yeah.

575
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,640
 Well, after this, if anyone wants bovril, we'll go together.

576
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,000
 Well, we've got to wait for last orders, and we've got no choice.

577
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,960
 Well, why don't we all go and have the most expensive soup in the world?

578
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
 Do you fancy some of that?

579
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
 Sure.

580
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
 It's called cordyceps soup.

581
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,800
 Would you like some cordyceps soup?

582
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
 It's a cordyceps...

583
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 It's a cordyceps mushroom-y thing?

584
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
 Yeah, cordyceps mushroom.

585
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
 You like it?

586
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 It's got chicken.

587
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 So, obviously, it's veggies.

588
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
 Yeah, yeah, sorry.

589
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 But we can have it without the chicken.

590
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,080
 Red dates, loganberries and cordyceps, which is a mushroom.

591
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
 Yeah.

592
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,480
 It's that mushroom which goes inside caterpillars and sort of makes them climb up to the top

593
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,640
 of a plant and then grows out of their brains and then makes birds eat them.

594
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
 You know that mushroom?

595
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
 Yeah, I do.

596
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
 Yeah.

597
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
 Lovely parasitic mushroom.

598
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
 Yeah.

599
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,440
 It goes out of their brains and then they explode and all the spores go everywhere.

600
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
 Yeah.

601
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,360
 Again, I think the room temperature of water just feels hungry.

602
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,560
 Well, this is the world's most expensive soup.

603
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:53,240
 One bowl is $688 last time I checked, and it's made with this stuff, and these cordyceps

604
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,640
 fungi which grow in the insects and caterpillars, especially in China and the Tibet area, they

605
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,960
 get it, and it's supposed to be, you know, very good for you.

606
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
 Right.

607
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,160
 So, that's the same mechanism as in the TV show and the computing game, The Last of

608
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
 Us.

609
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

610
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
 That's what it's based on.

611
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

612
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,480
 And like if the zombie apocalypse happens, because some people wanted expensive soup,

613
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
 that's going to be so...

614
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,320
 Can you time it as well?

615
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,320
 You know when we go see flowers that we know are going to bloom once every hundred years

616
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
 and they open?

617
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,960
 Can your meal arrive as just an intact bird and then suddenly it just explodes out?

618
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
 Yeah.

619
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
 That would be great in the mouth.

620
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
 Yeah.

621
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,960
 But also, you're saying people in the Himalayas are spending $600 pounds?

622
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,880
 No, so they take them and then they take them to rich Chinese cities.

623
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
 Yeah.

624
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
 Are those Sherpas?

625
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
 They own so much, don't they?

626
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
 Yeah.

627
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
 Honestly, those guys.

628
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,460
 But there was the Chinese national games in Beijing a few years ago and there was two

629
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:52,280
 athletes, Wang Xiongxia and Chu Xiongxia, and they beat the world records in the 10,000

630
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,800
 meters, the 3,000 meters and the 1,500 meters.

631
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,000
 And the newspapers all said it was down to this stuff, this cordyceps soup that they

632
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 were drinking.

633
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,720
 They were getting close to the finish line and then something just erupted out of their

634
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,800
 head and pushed them over.

635
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 It seems, looking bad, that it might have been due to steak sanctioned doping, but who

636
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 knows?

637
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
 Who knows?

638
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 Who knows?

639
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
 Who knows?

640
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
 Probably just that delicious mushroom soup.

641
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,260
 Do you know Webster in America?

642
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
 Dictionary.

643
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
 Yeah.

644
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
 Yeah.

645
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,760
 So when he was putting the dictionary together, he kind of just changed certain words to

646
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,800
 what he thought was the better pronunciation, the better wording rather, the better letters

647
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,240
 to be used in the word.

648
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
 Spelling.

649
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
 Yeah.

650
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,920
 So like the reason, sorry, I just, I don't have his book on me to have looked that up.

651
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,360
 But so the word center, he changed to ER.

652
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
 Okay.

653
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 Yeah.

654
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
 That's why Americans do it.

655
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
 He's responsible.

656
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
 Color.

657
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,200
 There's no you in color in America because of him, but there were words that he tried

658
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,440
 to use, but were kind of rejected by others.

659
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
 Did he do soup?

660
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
 And soup was one.

661
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,680
 So soup was meant to be spelled S-O-O-P, according to Webster, so the Americans might have had

662
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
 soup.

663
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
 Yeah.

664
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
 Gosh.

665
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,120
 Imagine having that kind of power that you can just literally change words.

666
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
 Exactly.

667
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
 An island, he tried to change as well.

668
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,160
 So island, he was going to get rid of the S. So his I-L-A-N-T, so island.

669
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,920
 And is, he was going to get rid of the S and put it as is.

670
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,420
 And that is F.

671
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
 Yeah.

672
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
 Sorry.

673
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,420
 Yeah.

674
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
 Yeah.

675
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
 Yeah.

676
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
 I need to move us on to our next fact.

677
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
 So.

678
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,420
 Okay.

679
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,420
 Are you upset?

680
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,920
 Do you want to cry?

681
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,520
 Well, there was a, I am crying, you can't tell because I'm crying into the ducts.

682
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,840
 No, I was going to ask if you wanted to talk about portable soup, pocket soup.

683
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
 No.

684
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
 Okay.

685
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
 No.

686
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
 It is time for fact number three.

687
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,240
 Well, give us portable soup, give us portable soup.

688
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,720
 Well, it's also known as veal glue.

689
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,760
 I mean, there are a few different names, but it's basically, it's basically just solid

690
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
 soup.

691
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,560
 And again, it was, it was invented in the 17th century.

692
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,280
 It's something to carry around, something to take away to sea with you, like a proto-bovril

693
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
 really.

694
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
 It's condensing.

695
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,680
 You boil it down, you boil it down, you boil it down until eventually you have this gelatinous

696
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,440
 chunk of soup.

697
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,560
 And then you just rehydrate it.

698
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,420
 And so Lewis and Clark, when they did their expedition, they took 193 pounds of solid

699
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
 soup.

700
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,360
 So that would have made, that would have fed them for ages, but they only ate it when

701
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
 food, when things were really dead.

702
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,840
 I think that's because it was disgusting.

703
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
 Yeah.

704
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
 All right.

705
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
 Yeah.

706
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,800
 We had a fact also from a listener about Lewis and Clark, which is part of the reason

707
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 I mentioned this.

708
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
 Oh yeah.

709
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,720
 It's an amazing trans-American voyage.

710
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,040
 They took 150 pounds of semen with them.

711
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
 Which was their dog.

712
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
 He was called semen.

713
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
 Lovely.

714
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
 All right.

715
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
 I'm out.

716
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
 Okay.

717
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:45,600
 It is time for fact number three.

718
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
 And that is my fact.

719
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:54,760
 My fact this week is that in 2003, there were 4,096 fraudulent votes in the Belgian election.

720
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:02,800
 The culprit, it was later discovered, was the universe.

721
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:11,300
 So what happened is the universe, it's always panto season at the Soho Theatre.

722
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:17,480
 The universe accidentally voted in the Belgian election and it was down to cosmic rays.

723
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,960
 So basically this is 2003, there was a lady who was running for a unionist party and she

724
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,080
 was called Maria Vindvogel, apologies for the pronunciation.

725
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,440
 And it was national election day and there was a precinct where they were having the

726
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,720
 votes counted and as they were counting it, it sort of registered 4,096, which seemed impossible

727
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,920
 because that was more than there was possible to have in that area.

728
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,960
 So they thought something dodgy is going on.

729
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,720
 They had every single person in computers in the area look at the machine, try to work

730
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
 it out.

731
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 What the hell is going on?

732
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
 Nothing.

733
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,920
 Have you tried turning that off and on again?

734
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
 Sorry.

735
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,760
 It's a computer people game.

736
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,040
 Oh, you're in computers.

737
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:10,520
 So they looked at it and they looked at it and they saw that 4,096 was a very computer

738
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
 renumber.

739
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 Yes.

740
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
 Isn't it?

741
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
 Is it genuinely?

742
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
 It is.

743
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
 Some people here will have worked it out.

744
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
 Two to the twelve.

745
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
 Two to the twelve.

746
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
 Two to the twelve.

747
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:28,720
 It's two to the twelve, so in binary it's one, zero, zero, zero, zero, twelve times and so

748
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,680
 one of the zeros must have turned into a one.

749
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
 Yeah.

750
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
 So that's...

751
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
 Oh, okay.

752
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
 Exactly.

753
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
 I didn't get that, but sure, yeah.

754
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
 Like a mad tiny glitch.

755
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,440
 A mad tiny glitch suddenly and they couldn't work out what it was and then a while later

756
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,720
 there was a conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

757
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,720
 This was happening in Boston and it was during a talk called Cloudy with a Chance of Solar

758
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,320
 Flares that it was revealed that they believed that it was the cosmic rays of the universe

759
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,280
 that had hit it at this precise moment, which happens a lot on our planet.

760
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,160
 I think somebody should call Trump up or his lawyers and be like, "Yo, we've got you a

761
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,160
 better excuse for that whole election, but I've got..."

762
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,720
 This man is just sitting here ruining democracy by like telling everybody, "Well, here's another

763
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,120
 excuse we can use in court."

764
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
 Yeah.

765
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
 It's the universe.

766
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,040
 It's actually Solar Flares and that one over there is giving you mathematical formulas.

767
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,240
 I'm like, "No part in any of this, but carry on."

768
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
 No.

769
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,080
 I like the way that it was Solar Flares that changed the selection.

770
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,280
 So that old newspaper headline, which was The Sun What Won It, literally was true.

771
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
 Super.

772
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,280
 That's very good.

773
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
 Yes.

774
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
 Yeah.

775
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
 Should we say what a cosmic ray is?

776
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
 Yeah.

777
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
 Sure.

778
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,680
 So it sounds like a ray, but actually it's not, it's, they're particles, they're pieces

779
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
 of atoms.

780
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,100
 They're obviously incredibly tiny and they are passing through all of us right now.

781
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,200
 Even in this basement, we're not safe.

782
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,400
 They're not harmful, that's the good news, but at sea level, roughly where we are, every

783
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,920
 square centimeter of the planet gets hit by one muon every minute and they're going at

784
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
 90 muon.

785
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
 Right again?

786
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
 It's what you make bubble from.

787
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
 It was discovery.

788
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
 What was that war again?

789
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
 The buon.

790
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
 Get your muon.

791
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
 A muon.

792
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,920
 A muon.

793
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
 Yeah.

794
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
 All right.

795
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,180
 But all of us now, all of us are being like, just bang, bang, bang, muon's passing right

796
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,180
 through us.

797
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,320
 All of us now are being, is no one concerned even slightly?

798
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
 I'm concerned.

799
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,720
 But you said it doesn't harm us.

800
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
 It doesn't harm us at all.

801
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
 I'm not concerned.

802
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,320
 That's exactly what the muon lobby would say.

803
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
 Yeah, yeah.

804
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
 Here's the thing.

805
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
 We say it doesn't harm us.

806
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,200
 It does harm us because it harms the things that we use.

807
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
 It harms communications.

808
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,960
 It harms, if you're, there's examples of airplanes literally dropping hundreds of feet because

809
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,880
 they've been hit by cosmic ray and the system has rebooted and freaked out.

810
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
 And those...

811
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 It's rare.

812
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
 It's really rare.

813
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
 It's really, really rare.

814
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
 It's really, really rare.

815
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,120
 So the problem, one of the problems that there is going forward is that these particles

816
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,360
 have energy and they can change, they can flip transistors basically.

817
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,200
 A transistor is a little switch in an electrical thing.

818
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,160
 Now the smaller a transistor is, the less energy you need to flip it and the more you

819
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,240
 have, the more susceptible you are.

820
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,120
 And as time goes on, we have way more transistors in everything and they're way, way smaller.

821
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,160
 So in theory, it could be worse as time goes on.

822
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
 It's bad.

823
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
 Yeah.

824
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
 It is bad.

825
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
 Yeah.

826
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
 You said it didn't harm us.

827
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
 You know when this happened?

828
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
 I'm wrong.

829
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
 I'm wrong.

830
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
 Yeah.

831
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
 So it was suspicious.

832
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,640
 Thought there was some kind of fraud going on.

833
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

834
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,640
 I mean, fortunately because it was so obviously fraudulent that it was called immediately

835
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,680
 even by the party that they just knew.

836
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
 Yeah.

837
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
 They were a small party, right?

838
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
 So it wasn't...

839
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,680
 Yeah.

840
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,760
 And they know because in the Belgium elections, these machines, they do multiple different

841
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,240
 counts in different ways and if any of the counts are different, they know there's something

842
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
 off.

843
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
 That's clever, basically.

844
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
 Did she end up winning, by the way?

845
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
 I don't think so.

846
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
 No, no, she didn't.

847
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
 Oh, that's sad.

848
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
 Yeah.

849
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
 She never was going to, which hence why it was sort of...

850
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,640
 She saw the numbers and she was like, "My God, the revolution is here."

851
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,880
 This is the way that they do the elections in this part of Belgium.

852
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,160
 So the voters are given a magnetic card with a magnetic strip on it.

853
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,040
 They feed that into a computer.

854
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,320
 Then they use a light pen to point at a television screen and that information then goes back

855
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,480
 onto the card.

856
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,600
 They take the card out, they put it into an urn.

857
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,280
 People go into the urn, they pick the cards out, they put it into another computer.

858
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,800
 That information is sent on the internet to another computer, which is in the polling

859
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,040
 station.

860
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,400
 That information is then put on a 3.5-inch floppy disk.

861
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,120
 This was in 2003, this was happening.

862
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,640
 And then it was sent to the head office in the area where they would then put it into

863
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,000
 another computer, which added up all the numbers.

864
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Wow.

865
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,880
 I think there's a lot more than solar flares going on.

866
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
 That's amazing.

867
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
 Wow.

868
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,400
 You think after that, I just imagine if it had been a serious election, the mood would

869
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,640
 have been, democracy would have been at stake.

870
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,240
 I'm sure the people of Belgium thought it was a serious election.

871
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
 Belgium is quite chaotic.

872
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,880
 They had no government for about five years, didn't they?

873
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
 Yeah.

874
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
 And it was fine.

875
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
 Yeah.

876
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
 We could just ...

877
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
 Bye.

878
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
 That's so cool.

879
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,880
 Yeah, because if you've seen how long it takes to vote, it's fine.

880
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
 You'll do.

881
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
 Stay where you are.

882
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,360
 We need to be more like Makassar Indonesia, which in 2018, there was one guy running completely

883
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,600
 unopposed for mayor, and he's still lost the election to none of the above.

884
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,800
 Do you say Indonesia?

885
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
 Yeah.

886
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,880
 They have almost the ... I would say the opposite system to the Belgium 2003 system.

887
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
 It's entirely ...

888
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
 Dictatorship.

889
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,600
 Well, cross it off the touring schedule for 2024.

890
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,920
 I'm looking forward to that.

891
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
 They have nail-based voting.

892
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,920
 So you get a ballot form, ballot paper, ballot sheet.

893
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
 Might just call it a ballot.

894
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
 A ballot.

895
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,060
 You get your ballot, and then you punch a hole next to your chosen candidate with a nail,

896
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,640
 and then you hold it loft during the count.

897
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,100
 You can see where the light shines through the little hole, and that is it.

898
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,240
 And they introduced pens in 2014, but the authorities said, "You must use the pen as

899
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,480
 a nail."

900
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,360
 Just one other election thing that I read.

901
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,600
 Do you know who won the 2020 Nambian election?

902
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
 It was a local election.

903
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
 Nambian.

904
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
 Sorry.

905
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
 Are you using Webster's Dictionary?

906
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,500
 Sorry, I was looking for the region, and I got confused as I was saying it.

907
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
 So there's a ...

908
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,920
 If I take it slowly and we all concentrate, it'll be okay.

909
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
 You can do it.

910
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
 You can do it.

911
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:56,240
 And the Nambian politician, guys, if I cut out all the other stuff, it sounds like you

912
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,520
 are all massive fans of Namibia.

913
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,800
 Hey, they have great landscapes, is all I'm going to say.

914
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
 Beautiful.

915
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,320
 No, okay, there's a local politician in Namibia who is ...

916
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
 Where is it?

917
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
 I'm sorry.

918
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
 Where?

919
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
 I'm out here as well.

920
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
 In Namibia.

921
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
 Did you say Namibia?

922
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
 I don't know.

923
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,640
 I don't know what comes out of my mouth.

924
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
 Namibia.

925
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
 There's a candidate.

926
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
 Yeah.

927
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,640
 In 2020, there's a Namibian candidate who won a local election who is ... Can you guess

928
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
 his name?

929
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,840
 Can you guess his name?

930
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:33,780
 Whatever we guess is going to be closer than whatever you read.

931
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,040
 It's a former politician, so it's a name that we know.

932
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,040
 So it's kind of like ...

933
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
 Like Winston Churchill.

934
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
 Kind of like that.

935
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
 Tony Blair.

936
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
 No.

937
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,640
 There's lots of children named Tony Blair in places like Kosovo.

938
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
 Oh, no, they were called ...

939
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
 Tony Blair.

940
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
 Tony Blair.

941
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
 Tony Blair.

942
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

943
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
 It was a squashed name.

944
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
 Tony Blair.

945
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
 It was a Christian name.

946
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
 Okay, so a famous politician.

947
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
 Mulmullen.

948
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
 No.

949
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
 That's good.

950
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
 Ming Campbell.

951
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
 Think bigger than England.

952
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
 Bigger?

953
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
 Erick Pickles.

954
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,040
 No, you're all close.

955
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
 Maybe George Washington.

956
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
 Really famous politician.

957
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
 Yeah, that's a good one.

958
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
 But no.

959
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
 Right.

960
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
 No.

961
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
 Adolf Hitler.

962
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,960
 There's a politician there called Adolf Hitler.

963
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,000
 So Adolf is actually a common name over there.

964
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Was.

965
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Was.

966
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Is it still a common name?

967
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,700
 Well, I guess it's a generation that are, yeah, that are sort of like getting into political

968
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,600
 power at age.

969
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,280
 And Adolf Hitler said, and it's Adolf Hitler.

970
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,920
 That's his first and middle name.

971
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,840
 And he says, "My dad absolutely knew who Hitler was.

972
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,200
 I don't think he knew who was a bad guy necessarily."

973
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
 You know?

974
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,600
 He sort of gives his dad a bit of coverage on that.

975
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
 But he says --

976
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,720
 Wasn't there maybe a German colony or something, it was okay.

977
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,000
 Exactly it was.

978
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,080
 So he seems, I mean, I didn't have enough time to go to a deep dive into him, but he seems

979
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,840
 like quite a cheery, happy guy.

980
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
 Might be restoring the name.

981
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
 I don't know.

982
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,480
 But he said, they said, "Are you going to change your name?"

983
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,360
 And he said, "It's on all the papers already.

984
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,840
 I think I'll just leave it, actually.

985
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
 It's fine."

986
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
 So he's just kept it.

987
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
 And he won his election?

988
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
 Yeah, he won it.

989
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
 It's recognisable.

990
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,120
 Yeah, exactly.

991
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,600
 His Wikipedia says, by the way, it says --

992
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,200
 It says, "Not to be confused with."

993
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
 Exactly.

994
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
 Yeah, yeah.

995
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,160
 "Not to be confused with Adolf Hitler."

996
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,640
 And then on that sidebar, it has occupation, political activist, known for sharing the

997
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,160
 name as Adolf Hitler.

998
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,240
 That's got to be the disambiguation on Wikipedia with the biggest difference in article length

999
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,040
 between the one guy and the other guy.

1000
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
 Yeah, yeah.

1001
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,080
 I don't know what he's achieved in Namibia, you know?

1002
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,080
 Very true.

1003
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
 Very true.

1004
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,640
 Do you know, in -- it was 1964, the general election, which Harold Wilson was the victor

1005
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
 in?

1006
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
 Yes.

1007
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
 Defeated Alec Douglas Hume.

1008
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
 Go on.

1009
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,040
 Well, that's kind of hot.

1010
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,560
 Oh, Dan, where were you during my university years?

1011
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,800
 But, yeah, so 1964, he says that one of the big reasons he believes that he won the election

1012
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,240
 is because they managed to swing a bunch of the marginal seats that might not have gone

1013
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,400
 to Labour had the turnout not have been as massive, right?

1014
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,320
 So he needed to get the turnout to be massive.

1015
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,360
 And according to him, he managed to do this by persuading the BBC to delay a repeat of

1016
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,880
 Steptoe and Son, the TV series, and moving it to another time.

1017
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,720
 And as a result, no one was glued to the TV, and they went, "All right, let's go out and

1018
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,960
 vote instead."

1019
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,400
 And he says that he thinks that that's what helped shift the vote.

1020
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
 Harold Wilson said that.

1021
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
 Harold Wilson said that, yeah.

1022
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
 It's actually a bit more complicated than that.

1023
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,400
 So, it's a...

1024
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,520
 OK, I need to move us on to our final fact of the show.

1025
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,680
 It's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

1026
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,080
 My fact is that the man who just broke the world record for living underwater got a visit

1027
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,640
 from his 80-year-old mother halfway through to keep him cheerful.

1028
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
 Oh, nice.

1029
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
 Oh, that's nice.

1030
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
 It's a pretty sweet story.

1031
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
 Yeah.

1032
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,640
 A man called Joe Ditturi, and he's a brilliant scientist, and he's been studying how extreme

1033
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,360
 pressure affects the human body over long periods of time, and it might be helpful for

1034
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,680
 space missions if humans ever go to Mars.

1035
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,720
 So he moved to the Florida Keys.

1036
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,320
 There's an underwater lab, and you go down about 22 feet, and you're living under there.

1037
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,000
 The pressure is much higher than at the surface, obviously.

1038
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,360
 So it's a dry environment.

1039
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,280
 You're in a sort of pod capsule thing, and he was doing tests on himself every day.

1040
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,480
 He managed 100 days, which is huge.

1041
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,240
 Humans have lived that far down for that long before, unless you're in a submarine.

1042
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,080
 Slightly vexed question, never mind.

1043
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,880
 And it's the longest underwater in a fixed structure, sorry, because otherwise, a lot

1044
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:50,280
 of our listeners are on submarines, nuclear subs, and we'll get emails eventually.

1045
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,240
 Yeah, and he's an incredible guy, and he got a visit from his mum, who sounds like

1046
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
 an incredible woman.

1047
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,560
 She scuba-dived down to go up to meeting.

1048
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,800
 So he did 100 days, and it was a bit further than the halfway, it was 81 days into it,

1049
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,280
 and she scuba-dived down with his brother, and there's this great photo of them just

1050
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,080
 sitting in this underwater house.

1051
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,080
 It is quite cool.

1052
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,280
 It's quite, you know, Ele, you're an explorer, and it's good that people go down this and

1053
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
 do all this thing.

1054
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,720
 But it is a commercial hotel that he stayed in.

1055
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,960
 So any of us, if we could afford it, could just go and live there ourselves.

1056
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
 Really?

1057
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
 Yeah.

1058
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,200
 The problem is, there's so many people doing these, I'm going to stay down here, the longest

1059
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,200
 attempts, the booking is like, have you got anything in August?

1060
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
 Nothing?

1061
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
 Yeah.

1062
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
 Except I've got nothing.

1063
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
 One guy?

1064
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,280
 But they don't have someone coming by and cleaning the room every day, do they?

1065
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,040
 Someone scuba-diving down with a mint that they actually do.

1066
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,960
 They will send you down pizza, though, so it's $800 a night for two people, and there's

1067
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
 a...

1068
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
 Is that it?

1069
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
 Well...

1070
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,440
 I would have expected that to be much higher.

1071
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,160
 If you can't scuba-dive, you also have to pay for a three-hour scuba-diving class.

1072
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,280
 Okay, but like some premier ends in the central town are busy times.

1073
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
 That's not bad.

1074
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,560
 Yeah, I guess so.

1075
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,960
 It includes a pizza dinner, which they send out.

1076
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,440
 Apparently, I read the TripAdvisor reviews, apparently the pizza is sometimes slightly

1077
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
 damp.

1078
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
 Oh, really?

1079
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
 Wow.

1080
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,560
 And yeah, and then you can stay, and then you can't fly or dive again for 24 hours afterwards

1081
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,920
 because of the pressure change that you've had.

1082
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,920
 Yeah, yeah.

1083
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
 Because you're pressurised, aren't you?

1084
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,880
 Yeah, that's the kind of the point of his science, isn't it?

1085
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,880
 He's like, he thinks that the pressure down there is going to help us live for a million

1086
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
 years.

1087
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
 A hundred and ten at least.

1088
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,560
 So he's 55 years old, and he's saying, "I believe that if I was living down here, that

1089
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
 would be...

1090
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,400
 I'd be at the halfway mark on my life expectancy, so I can make it...

1091
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
 It's really interesting.

1092
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
 It is interesting.

1093
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,200
 So, like, there's two things that come to mind.

1094
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
 One is that this...

1095
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,400
 Yeah, you kind of touched on it, which is like this, forgive the words, I'm about to

1096
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,300
 use the interface between extreme adventure and science is becoming really weird and

1097
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,400
 actually happened quite recently with OceanX, right?

1098
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,640
 Like, it's just this idea that anyone can go on an expedition.

1099
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,640
 Basically, as long as you're willing to pay enough money, like, even Everest, we're talking

1100
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
 about Everest.

1101
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,720
 There's loads of people that now aren't really training for Everest, and they've just got

1102
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,080
 these poor Sherpas, basically, literally hiking them up.

1103
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
 And there is...

1104
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,080
 I don't know, it's really weird.

1105
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,600
 I don't know how I feel about all of it.

1106
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
 This, you know...

1107
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
 The theory is legit.

1108
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
 No, no, I know.

1109
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,040
 But the thing is, it's like, there's now this really weird move in exploration where a lot

1110
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,280
 of really big research vessels are actually also tourist vessels, so you can get on these

1111
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,960
 massive vessels that are basically, like, for people that are spending, like, £60,000

1112
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,960
 for their, like, trip of a lifetime, and there's a bunch of, like, actual hardcore scientists

1113
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,560
 in the corner doing all this stuff, but also have to give, like, a lecture to, like, all

1114
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,560
 these people.

1115
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,560
 And it's just...

1116
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
 I don't know how I feel about it at all.

1117
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,560
 And they're doing it to help pay for it.

1118
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,560
 Yeah, yeah.

1119
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
 That's the thing, it's a funding issue, isn't it, ultimately?

1120
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,560
 Yeah.

1121
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,880
 So it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of a good way of making sure that your expedition happens

1122
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,880
 at all.

1123
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,880
 But I get what you're saying.

1124
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,480
 It turns it into a tourist proposition.

1125
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,880
 But he's found out a lot of amazing stuff, because he was down there.

1126
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,600
 He was monitoring every single bit of his body every day.

1127
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,920
 So one thing that is gonna be probably annoying for the next person in is that the toilet gets

1128
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,960
 a lot of usage when you're down there, because your bladder is really squished, right?

1129
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,680
 So he said you're constantly just going to the toilet.

1130
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,120
 Increased frequency and urgency of urination, is how you put it.

1131
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,840
 And also, he says that it's interesting that the...

1132
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,920
 I'm so glad you're saying this, because I've got it in my nose and you're working out a

1133
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
 identical way to say it.

1134
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,120
 I was trying to look for the phrasing.

1135
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,240
 Your semen travels at short...

1136
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,240
 Your dog.

1137
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
 Yeah.

1138
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,360
 Seamen travels at shorter distances when you're down there as well.

1139
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
 And so he...

1140
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
 His mother's down there.

1141
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,360
 Maybe that's why he stopped it.

1142
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,360
 Don't come in.

1143
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,360
 Don't...

1144
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,360
 Don't skip what I've done here.

1145
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,360
 I'm doing an experiment.

1146
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,360
 You can only enter by rising up through the moon pool in the floor as well, so I'm like,

1147
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,360
 "Go back down!

1148
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,360
 Go back down!"

1149
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,360
 Is that gonna be a problem for people having children?

1150
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
 Yes.

1151
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:12,040
 He says that maybe we won't be able to continue the species beneath 22 feet under sea level.

1152
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,280
 Which is an interesting observation, because his point is that, as part of the research,

1153
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,680
 and this was happening a lot in the '60s, could we set up underwater bases where people could

1154
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,960
 live for long periods of time?

1155
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,440
 Jacques Cousteau did that.

1156
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,880
 Sylvie Earle went down.

1157
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,080
 She's an amazing oceanographer.

1158
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,720
 They would go down for 30 days, 40 days, 50 days, and so on, trying to work out can we

1159
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,720
 live down there?

1160
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,720
 That was the big push.

1161
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,400
 Let's build these giant underwater civilizations, basically.

1162
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,200
 But we won't be able to ejaculate properly.

1163
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,200
 So we will...

1164
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,200
 No, we will not.

1165
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,720
 You've got to go up for that, and then you come back down.

1166
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,320
 There's a lot of teenage boys just going, "I'm just going to go for a quick...

1167
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,120
 I just want to see the surface quickly."

1168
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,440
 Just want to see the stars.

1169
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
 There's a whale up there.

1170
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,280
 He can show me some cool new constellations.

1171
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,600
 I was thinking a lot about James Cameron recently, because, again, because of the ocean

1172
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,640
 gate thing, when I first heard about what he did in the ocean space, I'll be honest,

1173
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,080
 I didn't really believe it.

1174
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,120
 He went down to the bottom of the Mariana's trends.

1175
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,120
 Yes, he did.

1176
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,120
 He's been deeper than any person.

1177
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,120
 He's been deeper.

1178
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,520
 So the guy who directed Avatar 2 has been deeper than anyone else on the planet.

1179
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,520
 Yes.

1180
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,080
 Well, you also directed Titanic, so that's closer, right?

1181
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:25,720
 Well, Avatar 2, The Way of Water is a largely aquatic film, so it's actually a more relevant

1182
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,280
 thing for me to mention at this point.

1183
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,280
 Sure, Andy.

1184
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1185
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,120
 Touched a nerve, don't know what that was about, but anyway.

1186
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
 Sorry.

1187
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,120
 Sorry.

1188
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,120
 I got...

1189
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
 Sorry, your CBI movie, exactly.

1190
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,120
 Yes.

1191
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,960
 Sorry, I got really, really crossed.

1192
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
 Yes.

1193
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,680
 And can I say, that was not hot, OK?

1194
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
 Oh, have I undone all my good...

1195
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,960
 Anything you undoed the sexiness of earlier.

1196
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,520
 Of the Alec Douglas Hume moment earlier, yeah.

1197
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,640
 It's so interesting, because he gave up his seat in the House of Lords to run as the

1198
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,640
 conservative leader.

1199
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,640
 That's very rare.

1200
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,640
 What?

1201
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,520
 Are you saying something about...

1202
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,960
 Cameron also went down to see the Titanic and so the Mariana's trench, and that's his

1203
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
 oceanography credentials.

1204
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,960
 No, no, no.

1205
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,600
 But that's the thing, that's not just his oceanography credentials.

1206
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,240
 So people think, "Oh, he...", so he's been to the Titanic more than 30-odd times, and

1207
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,240
 you're like, "Oh, that's something..."

1208
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,480
 But what's actually amazing is that he is legitimately, in his own right, a deep sea

1209
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,320
 explorer, not in any way as a tourist, as an engineer.

1210
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,800
 And there are all these crazy stories.

1211
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
 So for example, Bob Ballard, who find the Titanic.

1212
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,400
 I don't know if you guys are following this, but after the whole catastrophe with that

1213
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,200
 submersible, Ballard and James Cameron came out publicly and were like, "Look, there were

1214
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,320
 safety concerns, there were always safety concerns.

1215
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,480
 We've tried to highlight this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."

1216
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,760
 And what was really fascinating is watching the interaction between the two of them, because

1217
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,680
 at one point, Bob Bloody Ballard turns around and goes, "I mean, yeah, I'll defer to what

1218
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,560
 he said about the mechanics of the...", and you're just sitting there going, "Bob Ballard

1219
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,960
 is respecting this guy who was one.

1220
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,960
 Like God knows...

1221
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,680
 Stay in your lane, stop making us feel bad about ourselves."

1222
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,840
 The guy is like this incredible filmmaker and is also this incredible tech guy and the

1223
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,360
 detail he will go into.

1224
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,120
 And then I did some digging and apparently, like, this has always been the case...

1225
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,120
 Sorry, this is...

1226
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,400
 You've got to understand, it made me feel really bad about myself.

1227
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,720
 So apparently at the age of 14, James Cameron turns up to the Royal Ontario Museum, where

1228
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:26,040
 outside they had Canada's first permanent submersible and they had it out there and

1229
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,000
 then they were going to put it in the water in Lake Charon for like two years.

1230
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,280
 And it's outside the museum and he writes to the museum at the age of 14, asks for

1231
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,560
 a blueprint for the bloody submersible.

1232
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,560
 And the guy...

1233
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,440
 I think his name's Joe McGinnis, who's like a really, really famous oceanographer.

1234
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,280
 He's like, "Okay, this is insane, sure, I'll give you it."

1235
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,000
 And he sits there, James Cameron, 14, and tries to make it based on this blueprint, puts

1236
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 a mouse in it...

1237
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 Well, he tries to make his own one.

1238
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 Yeah, yeah.

1239
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,760
 But a small one, puts a mouse in it and puts it in a lake behind the Niagara Falls where

1240
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,760
 he lives.

1241
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,360
 And apparently the mouse makes it but it's slightly traumatised.

1242
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,440
 And then he's like, "Oh, I've got a problem with the windows."

1243
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,640
 All again at the age of 14, writes to this scientist again and goes, "Can you help me

1244
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,480
 with the window design?"

1245
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,520
 And the guy gives him the address to a company that he can write to to get...

1246
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
 What's it called?

1247
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,520
 The Perplex Grass?

1248
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,520
 What's it called?

1249
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,520
 Perplex?

1250
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
 Perplex?

1251
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
 Namibia.

1252
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,520
 Why can't we...

1253
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,640
 Why can't I pronounce things today?

1254
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:38,040
 And they actually send him a sample and then he attaches it and does it again.

1255
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,040
 And like, "Does this whole...

1256
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,040
 The age of 14, you're thinking, 'Oh, this guy's a genius!'"

1257
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,040
 Yeah, that is amazing.

1258
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,600
 We're going to have to move on in a sec because we want to run away over so, yeah, we need

1259
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,480
 to get out of here and get our bov-rolls.

1260
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,160
 Well, I can tell you a few more things about going on the watch.

1261
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,000
 So, the word "urinator" originally meant someone who dived.

1262
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 Oh!

1263
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,600
 So, the first use in English of the word "urinator" is someone who goes deep-sea diving and then

1264
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,120
 later it became someone who urinates.

1265
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,080
 Must have been a crossover, period.

1266
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,160
 Hilarious consequences.

1267
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,160
 It's impossible to fart past 20 metres.

1268
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,160
 A challenge.

1269
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,960
 A challenge for the people at Guinness.

1270
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,960
 Are you going to cry and fart underwater?

1271
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
 Is that what the aim is?

1272
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,960
 So, this guy...

1273
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,400
 Deepest underwater simultaneous fart cry, one by Andrew Hunter Murray.

1274
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,400
 Wow.

1275
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,440
 The guy couldn't have farted in the whole time he was there, he couldn't do.

1276
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
 Dr Deepsea?

1277
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1278
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,640
 Because what happens is, due to Boyle's law, the volume is much, much smaller of your

1279
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,040
 fats and your body just can't push it through.

1280
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,920
 And so, what that means is, as you go up, it expands.

1281
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
 No!

1282
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
 Oh, what?

1283
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,320
 Wait, that doesn't happen with the other thing, does it?

1284
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,920
 At the front.

1285
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,920
 You mean the ejaculation stuff?

1286
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,400
 I do mean the ejaculation stuff.

1287
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,560
 Actually, you blast your way back to the surface.

1288
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:06,800
 Lads, lads, lads, lads, lads!

1289
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:12,200
 OK, that's it.

1290
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
 That is all of our facts.

 Really appreciate it.

1308
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,080
 Don't tell anyone what happened.

1309
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,080
 But that's it, and we'll see you again another time.

1310
