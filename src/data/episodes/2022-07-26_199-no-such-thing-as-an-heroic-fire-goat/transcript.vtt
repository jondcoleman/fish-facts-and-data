00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
 (playing in foreign language)

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:18.520
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.640
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.120
 this week coming to you from Lester.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.120
 (audience cheering)

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 (audience cheering)

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.440
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.200
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.160
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.840
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.760
 with our fourth favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.120
 and in no particular order.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.880
 Here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.240
 - My fact this week is that walkers, crisps,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 only source potatoes that are grown

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.280
 far away from golf courses,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.640
 because their factory machines

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.040
 can't distinguish between golf balls and potatoes.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
 (audience laughing)

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.320
 - That's amazing.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.000
 - It's true.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.840
 So this is a walkers, crisps, factory in Lester, obviously,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.240
 and red, well done guys,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.400
 a very good contribution to the country, I would say.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.600
 And yeah, it's factory has this density-based sorting system.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840
 So what it is is, all the potatoes come in,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.200
 and the machine automatically knows the stuff

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.080
 that has the right density to be a potato

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 that can be turned into a crisp.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.840
 But it just turns out the density of golf balls

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.360
 is exactly the same.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.640
 And so it used to be that there'll be a lot of golf courses

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.240
 next to the fields where farmers are growing their potatoes,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.760
 which would then be shipped to walkers,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.000
 and lots of people got like hard bits of golf ball

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 in their crisp packets.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.880
 - So would you sort of, you'd be on the green

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.920
 about to take your shot and a walkers machine

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.080
 would just nab your golf ball and whisk it off to a factory?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.720
 - I didn't read the details of it,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.520
 but I would assume it's more likely that you'd take your shot,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.760
 it would go over into the field as you're a golfer,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.560
 James, sometimes you miss hit things, right?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.400
 Not you, obviously.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.880
 - Just very, very occasionally,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.680
 every single time I ever play, yeah.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.840
 - Yeah.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.040
 - And then it gets scooped up by the tractors.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.720
 - But I wouldn't have thought I'd be able to replace

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 my golf ball with a potato, for instance.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.240
 - I know, it's weird, isn't it?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.080
 It doesn't feel like they're the same density.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.280
 - I'll give it a go.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.640
 - And so was this a problem?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.800
 Were there people sending packets back going?

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.880
 I expected Salt and vinegar crisps and I got a golf ball.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 - Like was that ever been a thing?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.360
 - People did mention it.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.600
 I mentioned that they had hard crisps,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.560
 but if you're interested, each golf ball yields 18 crisps.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.400
 (laughing)

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.640
 - That's incredible.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.480
 - But no, the factory is really cool, isn't it?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.440
 - Yeah, so one of the things I really like about it is,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.560
 basically a crisp goes from being a potato

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.120
 to being in a bag in 20 minutes.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.960
 - Wow.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.360
 - Which is extremely fast, I think.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.120
 And there's a man at the end of the whole potato line

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.960
 who just said he's the potato overlord.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.800
 And he just looks at the potatoes and he said,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.000
 they're all good, they're all good, they're all good.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.640
 That one's bad.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.560
 - Yeah, it doesn't sound quite as exciting

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.400
 as you just made it look though.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.200
 'Cause I think maybe you read the same article

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.960
 as I did in the Leicester Mercury.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.040
 (laughing)

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.880
 - Wow.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.600
 - Another great contribution to the country.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.360
 (laughing)

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 They said about this guy who's checking

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.720
 that actual potatoes go through, they said,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.960
 he looks unsurprisingly, utterly bored.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.280
 (laughing)

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.920
 The worst thing is, they probably got permission

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.160
 from walkers to go in and said,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.920
 oh, we'll write it up really nicely.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.640
 They say, look, utterly bored.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.400
 This is, surely, the worst job in the whole building.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.240
 - Whoa.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.640
 - Whoa.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.640
 - In the whole building though,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.560
 maybe everyone else is a crisp tasteer,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.240
 except that one guy.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.480
 There are crisp tasteers out there.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.040
 You have to be a super-taster if you wanna be a crisp tasteer.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.960
 And when you're doing it,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.360
 you're not allowed to drink tear or coffee

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.720
 because it will interfere with your palate.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.920
 And they have to have 20 minute breaks between tests

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.160
 where all they eat is fruit.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.840
 And they make it so that you're only allowed

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.000
 to certain number of crisps every day

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.080
 so you don't go over your salt limit for the day as well.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.920
 - Oh.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.840
 - It doesn't sound quite as cool, does it?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.680
 - No, it doesn't.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.840
 - I mean, it's better than the guy just looking

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.520
 at the potatoes all day.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.400
 - But what is that crisp once the guy's eaten it?

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.240
 - No.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.080
 - No, no.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.960
 - They don't retrieve it afterwards.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.800
 - Right.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.240
 - You have the assistant vomitter.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.000
 And I think actually that's the worst job.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.720
 And they shove their fingers down his throat

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.240
 and they get the crisp back.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.840
 - It's just for like the general batch.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.640
 - Yeah. - It's like a sample.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.480
 - Okay.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.920
 - You should have said that because that makes sense.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.400
 You left us all hanging thinking.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.120
 - I think when you say "ozol,"

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.320
 I think my feeling is that the people

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320
 have lester got that.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.400
 - I'll talk about me and the voices in my head.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.920
 - I think you said that because you've seen wine tasters

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.160
 and you've seen them taste the wine then spit it out again.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.000
 - Yes.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.840
 - Like they do, don't they?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.480
 And did you assume that other people then drunk that spot out?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.960
 - Yeah, I thought they just popped that back in the bottle.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.160
 - I have a fact about the lester walkers factory.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.560
 They aim to extract so much water from the potatoes

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.840
 that they don't need any water.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.120
 Because potatoes are 80% water, okay?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.360
 So when the potato slices get sliced up and then they get boil,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.480
 all the steam comes off and they condense it

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.440
 and get water from that that they use

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.360
 for the process of running their building.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.880
 - Well, they also use water to peel the potatoes, don't they?

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.040
 They fire it at it, so it must be for that.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.880
 - Yeah.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.960
 So basically what I'm saying is in the event of a catastrophe,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.200
 this is probably the safest place to be on the planet.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.400
 It's got self-sufficient supplies of water and potatoes.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.240
 - Yeah.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.080
 - As long as the potatoes keep being delivered.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.800
 (laughter)

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.200
 They might relax the whole no-goal course kind of deliveries.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.840
 They also have a sort of what was described

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.120
 in this amazing blog I read and I would really recommend this blog.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.000
 It was this girl who went to visit the factory

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.280
 and gives a really detailed description of her tour of it.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.440
 And I can't remember what she's called or what the blog's called.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.440
 So just Google and Google until you find it.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.280
 (laughter)

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.360
 This is, she described how there's sort of a log flume

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.920
 for the potatoes where they're dropped in this water.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.400
 And as the potatoes go through the factory,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.720
 all the starches, some of the starch comes out of it.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.880
 So in the various processes, some of the starch comes out.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.000
 So when it goes into this log flume to get transferred

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.360
 through the factory, then the starch goes into the water

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.160
 and it goes a kind of milky color.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.480
 And when she was being shown round, they reassured her.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.840
 They said, don't worry, that starch doesn't get wasted.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.400
 It goes to a starch recovery plant, which is just next door.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.520
 And then it gets turned into quavas.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.000
 - Oh.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.480
 - That's what quavas are.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.240
 - That's awesome.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.080
 - Yeah.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.680
 - Did she work that out or did they work that?

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.320
 - Would she told that for the blog?

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.520
 - How would you deduce?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520
 - How would she...

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.480
 (laughter)

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.960
 - Would she have followed a secret door that said,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.800
 "No, no, don't go ahead.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.840
 This is where we put the starch."

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.200
 She goes, "It's the quavas factory.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.360
 Holy shit."

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.640
 (laughter)

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.600
 - I just blown this thing wide open.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.840
 (laughter)

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.120
 - Oh my god.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.040
 Of all the things you could work out,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.040
 that really is one you have to be told.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.720
 (laughter)

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.080
 Just opened a bag of quavas three weeks later.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.760
 Oh my god, I recognize this.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.360
 (laughter)

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.920
 - Hey, so you know how you're saying it takes 20 minutes

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.160
 from it going from the van into...

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.400
 So that's the full potato into a crisp packet

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.920
 in 20 minutes' time.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.160
 The amount of potatoes that they use every single hour,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.640
 if you went to the Lester Tiger Stadium.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.840
 I haven't been to that, but I imagine some of you guys here have.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.040
 The amount of potatoes they use in a single hour

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.520
 would carpet the entire floor of that stadium.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.200
 That's how many potatoes per hour.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.600
 That's every day that this happens.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.320
 So there's way more potatoes on earth than I realised.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.080
 - That's why I get from that.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.200
 - That's a lot of potatoes.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.880
 - That would make the sports matches

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.600
 that get played at the Lester Tiger Stadium

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.800
 extremely amusing.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.240
 (laughter)

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.120
 What gets played there?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.960
 - Oh brilliant.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960
 - Come on Andy.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.800
 I'm sorry.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.040
 - I've got to do your research before coming to these cities.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.840
 (laughter)

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.920
 - Did you guys read about my favorite part

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.760
 of the factory?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.600
 And then we can move on from it.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.120
 But it's a machine called the OptiSort.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.480
 And this is the last machine that the crisps are put through.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.440
 And this is to check for potatoes

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.080
 that might have flaws in them.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.640
 So there's a machine at the beginning that looks at them

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.680
 to check for green bits and shave the green bits off.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.200
 But there might still be some left.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.000
 And what the OptiSort does is it separates the crisps

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.680
 individually onto this conveyor belt.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.360
 So they're one layer thick.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.120
 And then they get hurled.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.760
 Like catapulted really fast.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.440
 At three meters per second passed this camera,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.440
 really high speed camera that checks for flaws.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.440
 And if the camera sees any kind of little speck of green

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.200
 or any speck of black or something,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.200
 then the crisps flies over a gap.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.160
 Still going really fast.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.680
 A 10 centimeter wide gap.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.840
 And if it's a dodgy one, then there's a swift puff of air

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.160
 that blows down through the gap

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.080
 and dismisses it from the production line.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.920
 - Wow.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.760
 Isn't that cool?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.280
 - Yeah, but why all the drama of the speed and the tight?

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.600
 - Because you've just got to be incredibly quick.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.440
 Because you've got to make so many bloody crisps.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.440
 - That's actually the motto of Walker's crisps.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.080
 We've got to make so many bloody crisps.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.160
 (all laughing)

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.120
 I suppose you think it's easy.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.680
 You bastard's a kettle hand manufacturing everyone.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.560
 We've got a proper company to run here.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.560
 (all laughing)

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.240
 - We should move on.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.080
 We need to move on.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.720
 - I have so much stuff on golf.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.680
 - No, we don't have time.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.200
 - We don't have time.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.640
 Why don't you try and crowbar a golf?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.520
 - Oh yeah, I'll do a fact in one of these.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.680
 - Just wait for that later on.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680
 - Yeah.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.680
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is James.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.560
 - Okay, my fact is about golf.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.400
 (all laughing)

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.040
 - It's not, it's not.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.000
 - I could make it about golf.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.840
 (all laughing)

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.840
 That would really screw up the podcast with me.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.680
 - In a word, yeah.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.280
 - Okay, no, it's not about golf.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.640
 My fact this week is that during World War One,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.640
 truces would occasionally be called in the trenches,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.680
 so both sides could yell insults at one another.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.520
 (all laughing)

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.360
 - So good.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360
 - That is really cool, isn't it?

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.200
 - Yeah.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.840
 - So this is the diaries of a guy called Sapa French.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.760
 Sapa was his nickname and he said in one of his diaries,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.680
 and this was been quite recently found.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.800
 I saw a rather curious thing in the trenches this morning,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.600
 heard some shouting and laughing,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.880
 and saw a German leaning over the parapet

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.680
 and shouting across to our men.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.920
 The distance was about 75 yards.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.120
 One of our men shouted, come on over Fritz.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.480
 Fritz shouted back in perfect English.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.000
 No bluing fear.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.680
 In fact, they could all speak good English.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.960
 This went on for half an hour,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.400
 and then all the heads went down,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.720
 and the war went on the same as usual.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.720
 (all laughing)

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.560
 Wow.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.400
 - That's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.240
 - Yeah.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.080
 - They just thought, let's just do a bit of insults,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.400
 and then we'll carry on shooting.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.240
 - That's amazing.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.280
 - A lot of German people who had been in Britain

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.160
 before the war had been waiters,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.520
 and there was one instance,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.440
 which was a bit of a nicer instance of how

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.960
 they used to actually chat between the trenches

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.440
 when they weren't actually at war,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.200
 and someone recorded how one Englishman had shouted

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.800
 "Good and Morgan" at dawn,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.720
 presumably the only two words he knew,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.000
 and then the German guy on the other side had responded

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.320
 and said hello in English,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.160
 and then they started exchanging some kind of fun insults,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.720
 and they'd ended by saying the English guy said,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.560
 "Waiter!"

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.600
 And the German guy said, coming sir.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.440
 So...

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.280
 - Ah, ah.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.160
 - The war so nearly tipped over into banter,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.320
 and it would have...

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.600
 We could have avoided hundreds of thousands of deaths.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.800
 - Yeah.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.440
 - Yeah. - The trenches were really interesting

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.000
 because the British ones were made

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.560
 as if it was gonna be quite temporary,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.760
 that's what they thought,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.760
 and the Germans thought we might be here for a while.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.680
 And so their trenches, they had doorbells?

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.680
 - No. - Yep.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.560
 They had staircases, electric lights, steel doors,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.840
 real kitchens, and wallpaper.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.160
 - Wallpaper?

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.400
 - No, wallpaper on the trenches, yeah.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.040
 - The doorbell is a especially impressive thing,

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.840
 'cause obviously when the British go over the top

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.160
 and arrive, they'll have to wait after ringing the doorbell.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.040
 - Very clever.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.840
 - But they were.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.360
 I just recently read All Quiet on the Western Fund,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.600
 which is an uplifting read if you haven't been there yet,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.760
 but about the First World War.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.800
 And the constant chat among the German troops

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.680
 was how their stuff was better than the Allies.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680
 - That's cool.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.840
 And there's kind of a history of yelling and shouting in wars.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.040
 The Georgian hero, Tariel,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.640
 was apparently able to drop opposing warriors

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.480
 using only the force of his mighty war cry.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.280
 - Okay.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.280
 And in Welsh mythology, their hero, Colhwook,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.720
 he was said to be able to give a battle cry so loud

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.160
 and violent that all women in the courts

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.760
 would become sterile.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.760
 - Oh.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.600
 - Whoa.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.960
 - He must have been a really popular guy in party zone.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.760
 I thought you were going, I was wondering where you were going.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.320
 And I thought you were going to say pregnant.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.800
 - No, it sounds like it would be that, doesn't it?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.480
 - Yeah, exactly the opposite, actually.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.480
 - Yes.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.200
 - Really?

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.360
 - Yes.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.560
 - A sobering thought.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.200
 I have another fact about life in the trenches.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.040
 - Okay.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.600
 - And sort of agreements between the two sides in the trenches.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.360
 So there was a guy in the First World War, British officer,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.800
 Captain Robert Campbell.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.640
 He got captured by the Germans,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.320
 I think after the Battle of Mons.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.520
 And after nearly two years in prison,

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.040
 in a German prisoner of war camp,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.640
 he heard his mother was dying and he wrote to the Kaiser,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.520
 you know, asking to be released to go and be with his dying mother.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.280
 Incredibly, the request was granted.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.160
 He was given two weeks leave from a prisoner of war camp

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.960
 on the German side to go back to England,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.920
 visit his mother on the understanding

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.800
 that he would then go back and go to prison again.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.800
 And he did.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.920
 He visited his mother.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.880
 He spent time with her in the last days of her life.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.760
 And he then honored the agreement and returned.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.360
 And then the next day, he's like,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.720
 "Oh, my dad's sick now."

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.800
 And that's the only time that happened in the whole of the war.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.880
 Well, because didn't the Allies then...

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.560
 So there was a German prisoner of war

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.000
 with the Allies who tried it, I think, because that had happened.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 I'm really.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.080
 And the Allies did not let him go.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.120
 And then they said, "No, we didn't trust you."

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.440
 And so then it was clamped down on.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.880
 So yeah, he didn't, the only one.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.960
 Wow, it's so weird, though.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.600
 I think these insults mean a lot to military

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.520
 when they're doing it to each other.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.160
 Because it still goes on to this day.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.960
 And a few years back, there was a big moment

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.440
 between North Korea and the Americans.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.240
 The North Korean soldiers were seeing American soldiers

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.680
 pointed them, make strange noises.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.680
 They were pulling disgusting facial expressions at them.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.000
 And this was their big problem with them.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.720
 And the Americans said, "We wouldn't do this."

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.120
 And this is how important that is

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.800
 in the follow-up bit to the statement

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.400
 of them going, "They're pulling faces at us.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.040
 They're pointing at us really weirdly."

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.080
 They said, "Oh, also, they're aiming their guns at us."

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.480
 That's like the second thing on the list.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.000
 And then just to prove how childish it is,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.520
 the statement warned US troops to stop the hooliganism

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.040
 or face dogs' death anytime, any place.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.520
 Like, it's all it is, it's like banter wars, isn't it?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.240
 That reminds me of, is it in that book,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.640
 or did we cut it in Bhutan?

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.560
 It's in the book, yeah.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.880
 So in Bhutan, there was a battle.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.720
 It wasn't a battle.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.400
 It was an argument between India and China.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.720
 And they went kind of arguing of this tiny bit of Bhutan.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.680
 And if they went to war, it would have been something

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.600
 like a quarter of the world's population would have gone to war.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.040
 And they all went to this tiny bit of Bhutan,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.320
 but they decided they'd not have one really wanted to have a war.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.360
 And so no one brought any weapons.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.720
 And you can see videos of it.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.840
 And it's just basically some Chinese soldiers

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.160
 and some Indian soldiers kind of just chest bump in each other.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.000
 Yeah.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.960
 It's incredible.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.920
 Yeah, it's literally-- it's a whole line of army members

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.680
 just not fighting, but sort of--

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.440
 It's giggling.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.440
 Yeah.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.600
 I can now tell in Leicester.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.480
 Is that what it's like here?

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.680
 You don't know, just go home and have a nice pack of crisps.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.040
 There was a lot of friendliness.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.880
 There's a really good book about World War I

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.320
 called Meeting the Enemy, the Human Face of the Great War.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.480
 And even more friendly than that, there

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.120
 was one instance where Brits arrived at the psalm.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.960
 And they were expecting they were like,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.040
 we're fighting the enemy, you know, all geared up

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.120
 from massive battle, and they arrived.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.840
 And they just found, on a bit of barbed wire, a note.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.440
 And it was from the Germans saying,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.440
 why don't you send two or three of your guys with some stuff

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.400
 you want to trade, and we'll send two or three of ours,

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.640
 and we'll swap presents.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.360
 And they met up in the middle of No Man's

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.600
 then that first day.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.080
 And they exchanged kind of magazines, and souvenirs,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.040
 and periodicals that they wanted to read.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.840
 And--

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.440
 It's amazing having a book club in the middle of a total.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.480
 It really is.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.680
 It's so impressive.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.760
 So we haven't even mentioned the Christmas truce,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.920
 which was a big thing, a sporadic thing,

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.920
 along a lot of the West and Front.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.240
 So I didn't know, though.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.680
 It's stretched not only in the army,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.880
 it's stretched to the other services as well.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.800
 So on Christmas Eve, 1914, the Royal Flying

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.840
 Corps flew over a German airfield at Lille,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.040
 and they dropped on the runway a plum pudding.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.000
 And then on Christmas Day, the German Air Force flew over

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.800
 a British airfield, and they dropped a bottle of rum

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.080
 to say thank you.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.520
 The Christmas truce, there was one really lovely moment.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.640
 A lot of Germans had been living in the UK before the war.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.800
 And during the Christmas truce, they all went up into No Man's

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.480
 Land, and one of the English guides

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.720
 realized that one of the German guys was his barber

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.480
 who used to cut his hair in Hoban.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.880
 And he said, "I need a haircut."

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.640
 And so his Hoban barber cut his hair for him.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.720
 I mean, that was very trusting, isn't it?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.920
 You know, it didn't take part.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.240
 It was an absolute killjoy at the Christmas truce, actually.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.960
 Oh, was it the senior officers or the...?

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.640
 Yeah, they didn't, but in particular,

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.320
 one soldier on the German side.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.680
 You might be able to guess it was.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.960
 Oh, I can guess.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.280
 Is it the most famous one?

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.560
 It's the most famous one.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.320
 Hitler.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.680
 He absolutely was not a fan.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.880
 He hated the Christmas truce.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.080
 Yeah, refused to take part.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.360
 He sat in a strop on his own

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.240
 and just said really disapproving things

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.760
 like you guys have no sense of honor.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.880
 And this isn't what we should be doing in wartime.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.880
 Classic Hitler.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:58.720
 Hey, we should move on to our next factor, right?

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.960
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.480
 And that is my fact.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.120
 My fact this week is this.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.120
 And I find this so interesting.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:12.800
 14% of all California's firefighters are in prison.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.920
 Is that amazing?

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.080
 What do you mean by that?

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.720
 They take people who are in prison, women who are in prison,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.920
 and they say, would you like to sign up for this?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.600
 We'll relocate you to a program whereby you'll

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.680
 be a firefighter under the confines.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.440
 But you won't be an actual prison.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.240
 And lots and lots of women have signed up to it.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.680
 So as a result, 14% of their whole firefighting force

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.800
 are prisoners who are serving time.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.640
 And then when they're needed, they go in either fight fires

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.560
 or they clear paths where fires might happen.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.400
 And--

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400
 Yeah.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.920
 I mean, it's women on men, isn't it?

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.560
 It's women on men.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.540
 At one point, it was 40%, it was 40%, but I think--

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.000
 Yeah, no, it's both.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.760
 Lots of men.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.440
 And I don't think they get to do the super fun stuff,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440
 like the hosing.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.600
 They do a lot more clearing, like you said.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.040
 Yeah, some of them do get chainsaws.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.800
 Ooh.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.440
 Yeah, because obviously you need to clear a path in forest.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.040
 Yeah, you can only need a chainsaw to do it.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.520
 Yeah.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520
 So yeah.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.360
 And they get paid something like $1 an hour in America.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.880
 But the exchange bit is that they're not

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.120
 in a classic prison system.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.520
 And they get days off.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.280
 They're sentenced every time they serve for what they're doing

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.640
 with their job as a firefighter.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.400
 But it's only $1 an hour when you're actively fighting a fire.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.960
 Normally, you get paid about $1 a day.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.960
 But I think there is a certain economy in prisons,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.720
 isn't there?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.760
 And there's a lot of trading that goes on.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.800
 And did you know that they have their own shopping catalogs?

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.400
 Well, in prison.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:36.880
 Yeah.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.680
 So they're in shopping catalogs, at least in America.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.280
 So Gizmodo, the really great website,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.080
 did a series of articles called Lockdown.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.920
 And interview this guy who said that they have a shopping

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.880
 catalog of approved items.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.320
 So is anything that you want?

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.080
 Really, from TVs to toothbrushes or whatever.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.600
 And what happens is you can pick what you want.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.000
 And you take it out of the small pay

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.560
 that you might have got in prison or your family can buy it.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.800
 And then it gets delivered.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.280
 And then it gets engraved.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.080
 So you get automatically engraved items.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.760
 Because otherwise, all the other prisoners have also

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.280
 got the same stuff.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.880
 And so you need to know that it's yours.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.600
 And actually, weirdly, in the YouTube clip

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.280
 I was watching of the guy being interviewed,

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.720
 he was saying, and this is some of the stuff

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.960
 the prisoners have ordered this week.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.440
 And he was opening packages.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.680
 And he opened up a DVD of the series Richie Rich, season 2.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.320
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.200
 I only know Richie Rich as a film.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.240
 I did too until I had to look into this.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.280
 You're saying they've made a TV series of Richie Rich?

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.240
 Yeah, it's the same general thesis.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.320
 Oh, sure.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.520
 That is fantastic.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.600
 Well, I mean, you heard a fact within a fact there.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.480
 It gets something like 22% on Ross and Tomatoes.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.160
 But you could certainly give it a go.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.520
 But so the thing that really amazed me about this fact

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.080
 was, A, that's an amazing percentage

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.760
 that are in prison that are working for the firefighters.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.200
 But B, I thought that firefighting was largely

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.720
 about fighting fires.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.440
 And it turns out that it's not.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.320
 It turns out that most of the time that firefighters

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.800
 spend is doing tasks that the public call for them to do.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.440
 And there was a report from the UK from a few years ago

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.280
 that said, we need to stop responding

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.400
 to these weird calls that we're getting

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.640
 because we just keep wasting our time.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.320
 Between 2009 and 2011, these are the stats.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.080
 1,613 incidents where people were locked out,

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.560
 where firefighters had to go and let them back in.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.200
 276 adults called firefighters out

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.840
 because they were locked in toilets.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.600
 14 people were locked in cupboards.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.040
 One woman was stuck in a fridge.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.800
 One man was stuck in a freezer.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.920
 And one person was stuck in a recycling bag.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.560
 There's so many ridiculous things that they get called out

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.920
 on a day-to-day basis.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.040
 They used to shout as they ran to a fire.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.720
 And this was going on as late as 1901 in America.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.240
 As they went to the fire, they would shout, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.000
 Well, they're doing the knee-nails themselves.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.920
 Well, it seems that way, right?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.920
 Yeah.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.440
 I mean, I kind of worked out what I thought the tune might be.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.480
 It might not have been that.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.000
 OK.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.920
 It might have been hi, hi, hi, hi.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.000
 I don't know.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.320
 But when they decided to replace the shouting

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.480
 with a gong, a gong, and they all hated it,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.040
 they were like, no, we like doing the hi, I think.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.880
 Who are you?

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.200
 And also, when automatic fire alarms came in,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.880
 they all hated that as well.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.840
 At the reason being that they had lookouts who

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.960
 would look out for the fire.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.080
 And as soon as the automatic fire alarms came in,

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.400
 those guys lost their job.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.400
 Is the robot's taking over the jobs, isn't it?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.440
 That was the start of it.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.240
 It is pretty much.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.800
 And so then the firemen started doing fire alarm

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.480
 pranks to set off these fire alarms.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.080
 No.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.120
 Did they?

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.600
 Oh, but that's a thing.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.120
 They used to be loads of rival gangs of fire fighters.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.200
 And there's a scene in New York where all the fire fighters

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.520
 get in the scrap outside of fire,

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.320
 because they all want to be the ones to solve the fire.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.520
 So you know, in Japan firefighters,

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.320
 they bring water pumps to the fire.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.280
 But they don't aim the water at the fire.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.640
 They emit it themselves.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.480
 What?

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.920
 So they wet themselves down so they're not flammable.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.960
 And then this was in the Edo period in the 17th century.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.480
 Oh, right.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.000
 Not now.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Yeah.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 No.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.800
 So they would wet themselves down.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.680
 They'd run into the house.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.240
 And then they pulled the house down.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.800
 And that's how they stopped the fires.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.800
 And they used to--

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.600
 Smother them, didn't they?

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.920
 So they had deliberately very, very thick clothes

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.480
 that would weigh, you know, as much as a person when they were wet.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.040
 And they would go up to a fire and just--

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.880
 Smother it.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.200
 They'd go up to a smother it.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.720
 They would just jump on it, basically.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.680
 They would be able to get close enough that they could

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.640
 puffer it up.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.960
 But amazingly, they were positions of real respect

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.160
 in Japan in the Edo period.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.800
 So up until 1868.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.640
 And they used to wear outfits that look like normal firemen

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.840
 as outfits on the outside, so they were quite plain.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.760
 But then on the inside of their suits,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.240
 they had unbelievable works of art stitched throughout them.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.960
 And they had stories and everything.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.800
 It was kind of like manga that kind of style.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.040
 And they became really famous.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.120
 And if they were successful and they put out a fire,

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.200
 they all turn their coats inside out.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.600
 And they paraded through the streets,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.480
 victoriously.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.000
 Wow.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.720
 And they often had their bodies tattooed

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.120
 with the designs on their coats, because, you know,

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.000
 it was such a mark of, you know, something special.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.160
 And, yeah, and also the stories that were told on the inside

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.480
 of their jackets became bestsellers in Japan.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.480
 So the kind of cartoon strips that firefighters had

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.760
 became well-known stories that you tell your children.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.080
 There was another thing which, speaking of covering

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.160
 yourself completely in water to be going in.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.320
 That was in the early days, one of the things

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.160
 with firefighters breathing was very hard.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.200
 And so in order to get into a fire and keep your own breath

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.520
 and not suffocate was a hard thing.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.240
 So most firefighters used to have a massive beard.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.960
 The male firefighters, I would go in.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.760
 And what they would do is they drenched their beard

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.120
 into a bucket of water.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.960
 And then they would bite into their beard and hold it

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.840
 over their mouth.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.560
 And that's how they would survive the fires,

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.080
 because they would have this beard mask

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.560
 that stopped the smoke coming through to them.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.200
 Is that true?

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.560
 Yeah.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.400
 That's incredible.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.320
 Isn't it true that the guy with the longest beard ever

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.000
 died because there was a fire, and he ran out of his house,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.680
 and he forgot to put his beard in this pocket,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.240
 and he tripped over it and fell down the stairs.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.040
 Yes.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.400
 She just wiped it, she just dipped it in the bath before he left.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.640
 That doesn't stop you tripping over it.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.920
 If anything, it makes it more rope-like,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.800
 makes it likely that the fire went up.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.840
 Just lock it up.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.240
 Have you guys heard about the firefighting goats of San Francisco?

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.000
 No, but I get the feeling we're about to.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.080
 Sure thing.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.040
 San Francisco has firefighting goats.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.800
 That's great.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800
 Right, moving on.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.960
 Time for fact number four.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.120
 And...

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.360
 Do you want to say it?

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.760
 Yes, sure.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.080
 Well, they're kind of pre-firefighting goats.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.760
 So they're let loose around San Francisco to eat bits of dry scrublin

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.320
 that would otherwise be a massive fire risk.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.120
 Oh, that's clever.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.280
 But they've been introduced, and it's helped massively

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.640
 with the problems of fire-breaking out in the summer.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.240
 That's really clever.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.800
 It's not as kind of rock 'n' roll when you explain it.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.320
 When the goat goes home to his wife, and he's like,

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.560
 "I'm a firefighter."

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.880
 "What'd you do today, darling?"

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.000
 I just ate some more grass.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.960
 It was really nice.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.960
 Save some lives.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.240
 Should we move on to our final thoughts?

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.640
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.240
 And that is Andy.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.920
 My fact is that mere cats can turn their bottoms inside out.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.680
 So do they do it on purpose?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.520
 They do do it on purpose.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.680
 They do it to socialise.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.960
 So...

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.280
 They've all got a party trick,

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.240
 and it's all turning their bottoms inside out.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.480
 So they have what's called an anal pouch.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.040
 And it's under their tails.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.000
 And they produce this kind of paste inside it.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.160
 And it's nature.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.360
 You can't go, "It's nature."

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.760
 And they smear it on plants and rocks

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.480
 to mark territory as their own.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.000
 And they even sometimes smear it on other mere cats.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.920
 I read that this paste comes out of them a lot like

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.160
 when Play Doe is extruded from one of those doll's heads.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.840
 I believe so, yeah.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.040
 From a doll's head?

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.480
 Yeah, you know those things, you remember.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.960
 It was like an old kind of tie

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.000
 from there, probably you're too young, I guess.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.040
 But you used to have Play Doe, and you used to squeeze it,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.160
 and then you had these little dolls,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.240
 and it would come out their hair and their hair would end up looking like that.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.800
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.160
 And scientists do squeeze it, didn't they?

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.800
 So when they're trying to study the makeup of this paste,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.520
 that's how they get it when they've extruded their pouches.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.800
 The scientists literally grab it, and they squeeze it,

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.080
 and you can actually get it out like that.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.000
 Yeah, that, I think, is a worse job than being the crisp.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.760
 A tester at walkers hanging outside a mere cat's nest

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.560
 with a cotton bud just waiting.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.080
 But this came to light, I think, probably,

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.400
 and you read this, they've done a new study

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.640
 about the bacteria in myocard bottoms.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.400
 Yeah.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.760
 And they've found that it's the bacteria that

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.040
 makes up this, the different smells, which

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:59.240
 means they can kind of say whose anal paste it is.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.800
 Yeah, so the smell comes not from the myocard,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.080
 it comes from the bacteria.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.320
 But the myocards use the bacteria to judge what's going on,

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:13.160
 so they swapped these anal pouches to get the bacteria.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.600
 And I read an article in popular science,

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.040
 and they were talking about these guys who

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.720
 were doing the swabbing, and they said,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.600
 these pouches are wide open.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.280
 They're almost asking to be swabbed.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.200
 So myocards are kind of bastards, aren't they?

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.720
 Sure.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720
 Yeah, mostly.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.240
 Yeah, they really are.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.000
 They've actually did a study recently

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.720
 looking at the most murderous mammals.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.680
 And myocards came out on top, and they're

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.520
 looking at how many of their deaths are caused by members

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520
 of their own species.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.640
 And with myocards, it's 20%.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.640
 So the 20% of myocard deaths are caused by other myocards.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.320
 Which is amazing.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.480
 They're always killing each other.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.960
 They kill their own babies.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.800
 They kill their mate's babies.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.640
 Wow.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.560
 I love killing babies.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.760
 And I read that study as well.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.840
 And it also said that sea lions are more murderous

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.840
 than actual lions.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.440
 Oh, wow.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.840
 That's quite a good fact, isn't it?

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.120
 And humans are not very murderous, how

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.560
 are we according to what we should be?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.000
 Apparently, we should be about 200 times more murderous

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.320
 than we actually are.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.880
 Should be going to the rules laid out 100 million years ago,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.280
 pinned to a tree.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.240
 That's really nice that we've kind of mastered our worst

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.760
 instincts.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.560
 Yeah, it kind of goes off a few times when this wasn't shit.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.120
 Sometimes they when they're fighting,

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.400
 they latch on to their enemy.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.160
 So I think basically the tension in myocard colonies,

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.600
 it's caused by the fact that they'll

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.280
 have colonies of 50 myocards.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.720
 And there's basically one mating couple, isn't there?

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.400
 And no one else is really allowed to have kids.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.320
 And if someone else has kids, then the lead couple

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.520
 kills those kids.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.440
 And also, who's the dominant couple?

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.000
 It's all decided on based on the size and their weight

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.120
 and their age.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.400
 And so everyone's always looking at each other

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.440
 and working out who's going to be bigger,

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.040
 who's going to be the next in line.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.480
 And they are literally, as one article pointed out,

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.320
 all the myocards are comparing the myocards.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.240
 That's what they're doing.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.960
 That's very good.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.320
 Because of me.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.480
 Just on compare the myocard.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.360
 Did you know that in 2010, remember the lead myocard?

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.680
 Oh, love.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.520
 Sure.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.000
 He released an autobiography that year.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.120
 Do you remember?

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.200
 No, I don't remember.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.920
 No, you should have.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.360
 Because it was one of the biggest selling books of that year.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.760
 That was the year that Tony Blair released his memoirs.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.280
 And they were more--

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.160
 I do remember that one.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:33.680
 Yeah.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.040
 There were more pre-orders on the myocards book.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.760
 Then there were on Tony Blair's memoirs.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.520
 Russell Brands' book on David Beckham's book,

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.000
 then Cheryl Coles' book.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.760
 This guy outsold everyone.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.560
 No way.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.360
 Yeah.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.760
 Did you have any big reveals?

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.280
 No.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:48.880
 The fortune.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.640
 Yeah, he started the Iraq war.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.240
 Yes, yeah.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.320
 I knew it.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.000
 But no, actually, I read, here's one odd reveal.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.840
 It's not in the book.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.000
 The voice of the myocards is--

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.880
 and this is very niche, but this is for anyone

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.400
 who's watched Alan Partridge, the second series of Alan Partridge

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.440
 when he's staying in the hotel.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.200
 It's the guy who fixes everything.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.080
 You know that guy?

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:11.600
 Michael?

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.120
 Yeah.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.120
 Michael is the voice--

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.360
 Michael, the Jordy ex-soldier guy.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.600
 Yes, yeah.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.880
 He's the voice of--

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.600
 I was watching Alan Partridge this afternoon.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.240
 So this is an amazing fact for me.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.560
 You were saying about comparing the myocards.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.640
 This study, I think, you were talking about.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.360
 It's a guy called Clutton Brock.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.480
 And he did these experiments where they fed extra food

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.200
 to some of the myocards that were the main myocards.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.480
 And when they got fatter, the main myocards got fatter as well.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.160
 And so they found that basically, when

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.720
 you're comparing with the other myocards,

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.960
 if someone gets bigger than you, you immediately

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.200
 eat a load of pizza or whatever they eat

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.720
 and then just try and get bigger than them.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.480
 Because you always want to be the biggest one.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.680
 Because it's the biggest one who's the most important.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.520
 So you're always looking around and it's

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.720
 going, oh, he's looking--

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.840
 Barry's looking a bit fat.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.200
 I think someone compared it to something that gobyfish do,

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.920
 which is almost the opposite, but it's quite interesting,

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.920
 is that gobyfish go on diets.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.000
 And it's for the same kind of peer pressure reasons,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.440
 like the biggest gobyfish is the one who's dominant.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.160
 And they don't want to cause conflict.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.360
 And so if they see a big gobyfish,

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.440
 they make themselves less big.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.400
 They eat a bit less.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.760
 Because they're like, oh, I don't want to start a fight with that guy.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.200
 I'll just go on a little diet.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.440
 Be small.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.880
 Which is quite sweet, isn't it?

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.380
 That's good.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.960
 But meocards are much more up in your face.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.720
 If you're going to get big, I'm going to get big.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.960
 I'll race you to the top kind of attitude.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.240
 Yep, true.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.320
 And meocats, when they sleep, it's quite interesting what they do.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.520
 They pile on top of one another to keep warm.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520
 Adorable.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.020
 Yeah.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.040
 So like, in summer, when it's hotter,

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.400
 they kind of spread out a lot.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.480
 And in winter, when it's cold, they kind of grab another meocat

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.040
 on top that they kind of snuggle in.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.240
 Quickly murder them.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.840
 They all have meocat rugs in their homes.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.040
 I had some stuff on anuses, if that's--

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.440
 Yes.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.840
 So this fact is about they can turn their bottoms inside out.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.600
 I didn't realize I was reading a BBC article apparently

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.080
 to chart the evolution in history of anuses

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.680
 is really hard because a lot of species have a bum.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.840
 And then they suddenly don't have a bum.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.000
 And then they have a bum again.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.440
 And so there's this like missing link of anuses that--

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.440
 All right.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.720
 Yes, you can't through the fossils chart it properly,

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.440
 because suddenly it's just out of nowhere, no bum.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.960
 And then thousands of years later,

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.440
 suddenly there's a bum again.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.600
 That's so odd.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.120
 Do we have examples of--

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.400
 Well, there's no bummed-then-unbummed creatures.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.560
 I can't remember any, but there is a thing called having

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.680
 a transient anus.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.840
 A transient anus?

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840
 Yes.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.340
 Yeah.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.440
 But I think I might be in the lifetime of an individual.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.120
 You have a bum, and then you don't have a bum.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:48.600
 Exactly.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.800
 No, that's a very short-term example of the long-term thing.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.800
 That's what I was mentioning.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.240
 So we've covered the sea cucumber before, which is a little--

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.480
 It's not a cucumber, but it does live in the sea.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.320
 What is it?

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.040
 It's a kind of fishy organism.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.960
 It's not a fish.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.400
 They're really weird.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.720
 They look like odd cucumbers underwater.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:12.280
 But we've said before, they can self-avisorate

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.960
 when they're threatened by a predator.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.920
 They distract the predator by squirting their own intestines

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.760
 out of themselves, and that distracts the predator,

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.480
 because he thinks, what's this?

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.280
 And then they slowly leave.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.600
 But the other incredible thing is, they

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:32.200
 can turn solid or mushy on command, on self-command.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.280
 So they can turn their body into a mush,

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.400
 and then climb through a tiny crack,

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.840
 and then resellify into lumps, so they can't be got out

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.320
 through the crack by a predator.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.840
 Wow.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.920
 Then nuts.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.520
 They're so nuts.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.600
 And then it's not only for self-defense

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.840
 that they self-avisorate, it's a seasonal thing.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.520
 In autumn, they just re-absorb all their intestines

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.880
 into their body, and they just become a solid lump of flesh,

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.880
 basically.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.040
 So fishermen in the Caribbean, they harvest them in October,

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.840
 because they know they're not going to have to gut them,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.360
 because they have no guts anymore.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.200
 Oh, wow.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.200
 Yeah.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.040
 And then in spring, they regrow all their organs,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.040
 and they continue like that.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040
 That's insane.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.520
 They're so weird.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.280
 The one thing I know about the anus of a sea cucumber

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.920
 is that there's a fish that lives in there, isn't there?

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.000
 It's called a slender pearl fish.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.320
 It lives inside the anus of a sea cucumber.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.240
 And the funny thing about them is whenever

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.360
 they want to go into a sea cucumber's anus,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.200
 they kind of do a little knock on the anus,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.680
 and the anus opens up.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.520
 Oh, my god.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.320
 Like they're entering a German trench, you'll see.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.920
 Really?

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.120
 And is it a secret knock, or is it just a normal one?

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.360
 Oh, you think it's like, yeah.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.080
 It's the pearl fish again.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.720
 What a slang term for the anus, by the way,

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.200
 to German trench.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.160
 That we kind of just over there.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.280
 Guys, we need to wrap up.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.040
 Do you have anything before we do?

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.720
 There are a dragonfire larvae, each via its anus.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.080
 What they do, this is really cool.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.440
 They draw water in through the anus.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.960
 They clench, and then they compress the abdomen,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.840
 and their muscles in their thorax,

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.120
 against the water filled in their rectum.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.080
 And then they can raise the pressure in their body,

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.920
 and it fires out their mouth, and then they can eat.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.760
 What?

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.320
 And that call, you're drawing water in your squeezing,

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.080
 and then your mouth comes out and you eat.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.160
 Wow.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.520
 That's so awesome.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.120
 What?

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.360
 I'm glad I don't do that.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.880
 But I'm happy that someone else has found me better to do that.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.080
 Was that on blue planet?

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.520
 Or is it on brown planet, actually?

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:36.480
 OK, that's it.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.880
 That is all of our facts.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.280
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.320

 We have a link as well to our book, which is out now,

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.720
 and guys at the end of the show, we're going to be out there.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.560
 We've got a bunch of copies.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.960
 So if you want to buy a copy and say hi,

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.240
 we can sign it for you for Christmas or whatever.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.040
 And we have pre-signed copies as well.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.840
 If you can't be up, ask to line up, or if you don't want to speak to us.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.840
 Yeah.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840
 You actively dislike us.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840
 Or you can just go home.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.840
 Or you can just go home.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.840
 You don't need to.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.840
 We can't force you.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.840
 Yeah.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.440
 And we're going to end this show, aren't we?

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.440
 With a fact.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.440
 Yes.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.040
 We have a fact that you guys sent in at the beginning of this show.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.240
 And we're going to give away one of our books to one of you.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.240
 And Anna, you have that fact?

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.240
 Yep.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.240
 So this is our favorite fact that you guys sent in.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.040
 And it's from--

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.240
 I don't know if I can read my own writing.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.640
 But Victor, Jaganathan.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.640
 Are you in?

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.640
 You in?

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.640
 Yes.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640
 Starts a good fact.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.040
 So this fact is that guide runners for site-impaired runners

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.800
 can't use elasticated tethers at the Paralympics anymore.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.640
 After the Chinese started catapulting their runners across

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.240
 the finish line at the last minute.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.240
 [APPLAUSE]

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:07.240
 That's amazing.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.240
 [APPLAUSE]

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.040
 Awesome.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.040
 We'll be out the back, guys.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.440
 Thank you so much for coming.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.440
 We'll see you later, guys.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.440
 Thank you.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.440
 Bye.
