00:00:00,00:00:03,(playing in foreign language)
00:00:03,00:00:18,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:18,00:00:21,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:21,00:00:24,this week coming to you from Lester.
00:00:24,00:00:27,(audience cheering)
00:00:27,00:00:30,(audience cheering)
00:00:30,00:00:34,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:37,00:00:39,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:39,00:00:40,we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:40,00:00:43,with our fourth favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:43,00:00:45,and in no particular order.
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Here we go, starting with you, Chazinski."
00:00:48,00:00:52,"- My fact this week is that walkers, crisps,"
00:00:52,00:00:54,only source potatoes that are grown
00:00:54,00:00:56,"far away from golf courses,"
00:00:56,00:00:57,because their factory machines
00:00:57,00:01:01,can't distinguish between golf balls and potatoes.
00:01:01,00:01:04,(audience laughing)
00:01:04,00:01:06,- That's amazing.
00:01:06,00:01:08,- It's true.
00:01:08,00:01:11,"So this is a walkers, crisps, factory in Lester, obviously,"
00:01:11,00:01:15,"and red, well done guys,"
00:01:15,00:01:18,"a very good contribution to the country, I would say."
00:01:18,00:01:21,"And yeah, it's factory has this density-based sorting system."
00:01:21,00:01:23,"So what it is is, all the potatoes come in,"
00:01:23,00:01:27,and the machine automatically knows the stuff
00:01:27,00:01:29,that has the right density to be a potato
00:01:29,00:01:30,that can be turned into a crisp.
00:01:30,00:01:33,But it just turns out the density of golf balls
00:01:33,00:01:35,is exactly the same.
00:01:35,00:01:37,And so it used to be that there'll be a lot of golf courses
00:01:37,00:01:40,"next to the fields where farmers are growing their potatoes,"
00:01:40,00:01:41,"which would then be shipped to walkers,"
00:01:41,00:01:45,and lots of people got like hard bits of golf ball
00:01:45,00:01:45,in their crisp packets.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"- So would you sort of, you'd be on the green"
00:01:47,00:01:49,about to take your shot and a walkers machine
00:01:49,00:01:54,would just nab your golf ball and whisk it off to a factory?
00:01:54,00:01:55,"- I didn't read the details of it,"
00:01:55,00:01:58,"but I would assume it's more likely that you'd take your shot,"
00:01:58,00:02:01,"it would go over into the field as you're a golfer,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,"James, sometimes you miss hit things, right?"
00:02:03,00:02:04,"Not you, obviously."
00:02:04,00:02:05,"- Just very, very occasionally,"
00:02:05,00:02:07,"every single time I ever play, yeah."
00:02:07,00:02:08,- Yeah.
00:02:08,00:02:11,- And then it gets scooped up by the tractors.
00:02:11,00:02:12,- But I wouldn't have thought I'd be able to replace
00:02:12,00:02:15,"my golf ball with a potato, for instance."
00:02:15,00:02:16,"- I know, it's weird, isn't it?"
00:02:16,00:02:18,It doesn't feel like they're the same density.
00:02:18,00:02:19,- I'll give it a go.
00:02:19,00:02:20,- And so was this a problem?
00:02:20,00:02:23,Were there people sending packets back going?
00:02:23,00:02:27,I expected Salt and vinegar crisps and I got a golf ball.
00:02:27,00:02:29,- Like was that ever been a thing?
00:02:29,00:02:31,- People did mention it.
00:02:31,00:02:32,"I mentioned that they had hard crisps,"
00:02:32,00:02:36,"but if you're interested, each golf ball yields 18 crisps."
00:02:36,00:02:39,(laughing)
00:02:39,00:02:40,- That's incredible.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"- But no, the factory is really cool, isn't it?"
00:02:42,00:02:46,"- Yeah, so one of the things I really like about it is,"
00:02:46,00:02:48,basically a crisp goes from being a potato
00:02:48,00:02:51,to being in a bag in 20 minutes.
00:02:51,00:02:51,- Wow.
00:02:51,00:02:53,"- Which is extremely fast, I think."
00:02:53,00:02:56,And there's a man at the end of the whole potato line
00:02:56,00:02:58,who just said he's the potato overlord.
00:02:58,00:03:00,"And he just looks at the potatoes and he said,"
00:03:00,00:03:02,"they're all good, they're all good, they're all good."
00:03:02,00:03:03,That one's bad.
00:03:03,00:03:05,"- Yeah, it doesn't sound quite as exciting"
00:03:05,00:03:07,as you just made it look though.
00:03:07,00:03:09,'Cause I think maybe you read the same article
00:03:09,00:03:10,as I did in the Leicester Mercury.
00:03:10,00:03:13,(laughing)
00:03:13,00:03:13,- Wow.
00:03:13,00:03:15,- Another great contribution to the country.
00:03:15,00:03:17,(laughing)
00:03:17,00:03:19,They said about this guy who's checking
00:03:19,00:03:21,"that actual potatoes go through, they said,"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"he looks unsurprisingly, utterly bored."
00:03:24,00:03:27,(laughing)
00:03:27,00:03:30,"The worst thing is, they probably got permission"
00:03:30,00:03:32,"from walkers to go in and said,"
00:03:32,00:03:33,"oh, we'll write it up really nicely."
00:03:33,00:03:35,"They say, look, utterly bored."
00:03:35,00:03:39,"This is, surely, the worst job in the whole building."
00:03:39,00:03:40,- Whoa.
00:03:40,00:03:41,- Whoa.
00:03:41,00:03:42,"- In the whole building though,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,"maybe everyone else is a crisp tasteer,"
00:03:44,00:03:46,except that one guy.
00:03:46,00:03:48,There are crisp tasteers out there.
00:03:48,00:03:52,You have to be a super-taster if you wanna be a crisp tasteer.
00:03:52,00:03:52,"And when you're doing it,"
00:03:52,00:03:55,you're not allowed to drink tear or coffee
00:03:55,00:03:57,because it will interfere with your palate.
00:03:57,00:04:00,And they have to have 20 minute breaks between tests
00:04:00,00:04:03,where all they eat is fruit.
00:04:03,00:04:04,And they make it so that you're only allowed
00:04:04,00:04:06,to certain number of crisps every day
00:04:06,00:04:09,so you don't go over your salt limit for the day as well.
00:04:09,00:04:09,- Oh.
00:04:09,00:04:11,"- It doesn't sound quite as cool, does it?"
00:04:11,00:04:12,"- No, it doesn't."
00:04:12,00:04:13,"- I mean, it's better than the guy just looking"
00:04:13,00:04:15,at the potatoes all day.
00:04:15,00:04:18,- But what is that crisp once the guy's eaten it?
00:04:18,00:04:19,- No.
00:04:19,00:04:20,"- No, no."
00:04:20,00:04:22,- They don't retrieve it afterwards.
00:04:22,00:04:23,- Right.
00:04:23,00:04:25,- You have the assistant vomitter.
00:04:25,00:04:27,And I think actually that's the worst job.
00:04:27,00:04:28,And they shove their fingers down his throat
00:04:28,00:04:30,and they get the crisp back.
00:04:30,00:04:31,- It's just for like the general batch.
00:04:31,00:04:33,- Yeah. - It's like a sample.
00:04:33,00:04:34,- Okay.
00:04:34,00:04:36,- You should have said that because that makes sense.
00:04:36,00:04:39,You left us all hanging thinking.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"- I think when you say ""ozol,"""
00:04:41,00:04:43,I think my feeling is that the people
00:04:43,00:04:45,have lester got that.
00:04:45,00:04:48,- I'll talk about me and the voices in my head.
00:04:48,00:04:50,- I think you said that because you've seen wine tasters
00:04:50,00:04:53,and you've seen them taste the wine then spit it out again.
00:04:53,00:04:54,- Yes.
00:04:54,00:04:54,"- Like they do, don't they?"
00:04:54,00:04:57,And did you assume that other people then drunk that spot out?
00:04:57,00:05:00,"- Yeah, I thought they just popped that back in the bottle."
00:05:00,00:05:04,- I have a fact about the lester walkers factory.
00:05:04,00:05:07,They aim to extract so much water from the potatoes
00:05:07,00:05:09,that they don't need any water.
00:05:09,00:05:12,"Because potatoes are 80% water, okay?"
00:05:12,00:05:15,"So when the potato slices get sliced up and then they get boil,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,all the steam comes off and they condense it
00:05:17,00:05:19,and get water from that that they use
00:05:19,00:05:21,for the process of running their building.
00:05:21,00:05:23,"- Well, they also use water to peel the potatoes, don't they?"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"They fire it at it, so it must be for that."
00:05:26,00:05:26,- Yeah.
00:05:26,00:05:29,"So basically what I'm saying is in the event of a catastrophe,"
00:05:29,00:05:32,this is probably the safest place to be on the planet.
00:05:32,00:05:35,It's got self-sufficient supplies of water and potatoes.
00:05:35,00:05:36,- Yeah.
00:05:36,00:05:38,- As long as the potatoes keep being delivered.
00:05:38,00:05:40,(laughter)
00:05:40,00:05:45,They might relax the whole no-goal course kind of deliveries.
00:05:45,00:05:47,They also have a sort of what was described
00:05:47,00:05:51,in this amazing blog I read and I would really recommend this blog.
00:05:51,00:05:53,It was this girl who went to visit the factory
00:05:53,00:05:55,and gives a really detailed description of her tour of it.
00:05:55,00:05:57,And I can't remember what she's called or what the blog's called.
00:05:57,00:05:59,So just Google and Google until you find it.
00:05:59,00:06:01,(laughter)
00:06:01,00:06:04,"This is, she described how there's sort of a log flume"
00:06:04,00:06:06,for the potatoes where they're dropped in this water.
00:06:06,00:06:09,"And as the potatoes go through the factory,"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"all the starches, some of the starch comes out of it."
00:06:12,00:06:14,"So in the various processes, some of the starch comes out."
00:06:14,00:06:17,So when it goes into this log flume to get transferred
00:06:17,00:06:19,"through the factory, then the starch goes into the water"
00:06:19,00:06:21,and it goes a kind of milky color.
00:06:21,00:06:24,"And when she was being shown round, they reassured her."
00:06:24,00:06:26,"They said, don't worry, that starch doesn't get wasted."
00:06:26,00:06:30,"It goes to a starch recovery plant, which is just next door."
00:06:30,00:06:32,And then it gets turned into quavas.
00:06:32,00:06:34,- Oh.
00:06:34,00:06:35,- That's what quavas are.
00:06:35,00:06:36,- That's awesome.
00:06:36,00:06:37,- Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:38,- Did she work that out or did they work that?
00:06:38,00:06:40,- Would she told that for the blog?
00:06:40,00:06:41,- How would you deduce?
00:06:41,00:06:42,- How would she...
00:06:42,00:06:44,(laughter)
00:06:44,00:06:46,"- Would she have followed a secret door that said,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,"""No, no, don't go ahead."
00:06:47,00:06:48,"This is where we put the starch."""
00:06:48,00:06:50,"She goes, ""It's the quavas factory."
00:06:50,00:06:51,"Holy shit."""
00:06:51,00:06:52,(laughter)
00:06:52,00:06:54,- I just blown this thing wide open.
00:06:54,00:06:57,(laughter)
00:06:57,00:06:59,- Oh my god.
00:06:59,00:07:01,"Of all the things you could work out,"
00:07:01,00:07:03,that really is one you have to be told.
00:07:03,00:07:04,(laughter)
00:07:04,00:07:07,Just opened a bag of quavas three weeks later.
00:07:07,00:07:08,"Oh my god, I recognize this."
00:07:08,00:07:11,(laughter)
00:07:11,00:07:13,"- Hey, so you know how you're saying it takes 20 minutes"
00:07:13,00:07:16,from it going from the van into...
00:07:16,00:07:19,So that's the full potato into a crisp packet
00:07:19,00:07:20,in 20 minutes' time.
00:07:20,00:07:24,"The amount of potatoes that they use every single hour,"
00:07:24,00:07:27,if you went to the Lester Tiger Stadium.
00:07:27,00:07:30,"I haven't been to that, but I imagine some of you guys here have."
00:07:30,00:07:33,The amount of potatoes they use in a single hour
00:07:33,00:07:36,would carpet the entire floor of that stadium.
00:07:36,00:07:38,That's how many potatoes per hour.
00:07:38,00:07:40,That's every day that this happens.
00:07:40,00:07:43,So there's way more potatoes on earth than I realised.
00:07:43,00:07:45,- That's why I get from that.
00:07:45,00:07:46,- That's a lot of potatoes.
00:07:46,00:07:47,- That would make the sports matches
00:07:47,00:07:49,that get played at the Lester Tiger Stadium
00:07:49,00:07:51,extremely amusing.
00:07:51,00:07:54,(laughter)
00:07:54,00:07:56,What gets played there?
00:07:56,00:07:56,- Oh brilliant.
00:07:56,00:07:57,- Come on Andy.
00:07:57,00:07:58,I'm sorry.
00:07:58,00:08:01,- I've got to do your research before coming to these cities.
00:08:01,00:08:02,(laughter)
00:08:02,00:08:05,- Did you guys read about my favorite part
00:08:05,00:08:06,of the factory?
00:08:06,00:08:07,And then we can move on from it.
00:08:07,00:08:10,But it's a machine called the OptiSort.
00:08:10,00:08:14,And this is the last machine that the crisps are put through.
00:08:14,00:08:16,And this is to check for potatoes
00:08:16,00:08:18,that might have flaws in them.
00:08:18,00:08:19,So there's a machine at the beginning that looks at them
00:08:19,00:08:21,to check for green bits and shave the green bits off.
00:08:21,00:08:23,But there might still be some left.
00:08:23,00:08:26,And what the OptiSort does is it separates the crisps
00:08:26,00:08:27,individually onto this conveyor belt.
00:08:27,00:08:29,So they're one layer thick.
00:08:29,00:08:31,And then they get hurled.
00:08:31,00:08:32,Like catapulted really fast.
00:08:32,00:08:36,"At three meters per second passed this camera,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,really high speed camera that checks for flaws.
00:08:38,00:08:41,And if the camera sees any kind of little speck of green
00:08:41,00:08:43,"or any speck of black or something,"
00:08:43,00:08:46,then the crisps flies over a gap.
00:08:46,00:08:47,Still going really fast.
00:08:47,00:08:48,A 10 centimeter wide gap.
00:08:48,00:08:51,"And if it's a dodgy one, then there's a swift puff of air"
00:08:51,00:08:53,that blows down through the gap
00:08:53,00:08:55,and dismisses it from the production line.
00:08:55,00:08:55,- Wow.
00:08:55,00:08:56,Isn't that cool?
00:08:56,00:09:00,"- Yeah, but why all the drama of the speed and the tight?"
00:09:00,00:09:01,- Because you've just got to be incredibly quick.
00:09:01,00:09:04,Because you've got to make so many bloody crisps.
00:09:04,00:09:06,- That's actually the motto of Walker's crisps.
00:09:06,00:09:08,We've got to make so many bloody crisps.
00:09:08,00:09:11,(all laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:12,I suppose you think it's easy.
00:09:12,00:09:15,You bastard's a kettle hand manufacturing everyone.
00:09:15,00:09:17,We've got a proper company to run here.
00:09:17,00:09:20,(all laughing)
00:09:20,00:09:24,- We should move on.
00:09:24,00:09:25,We need to move on.
00:09:25,00:09:26,- I have so much stuff on golf.
00:09:26,00:09:27,"- No, we don't have time."
00:09:27,00:09:29,- We don't have time.
00:09:29,00:09:30,Why don't you try and crowbar a golf?
00:09:30,00:09:32,"- Oh yeah, I'll do a fact in one of these."
00:09:32,00:09:33,- Just wait for that later on.
00:09:33,00:09:34,- Yeah.
00:09:34,00:09:37,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is James."
00:09:37,00:09:39,"- Okay, my fact is about golf."
00:09:39,00:09:42,(all laughing)
00:09:42,00:09:44,"- It's not, it's not."
00:09:44,00:09:46,- I could make it about golf.
00:09:46,00:09:46,(all laughing)
00:09:46,00:09:48,That would really screw up the podcast with me.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"- In a word, yeah."
00:09:49,00:09:51,"- Okay, no, it's not about golf."
00:09:51,00:09:53,"My fact this week is that during World War One,"
00:09:53,00:09:56,"truces would occasionally be called in the trenches,"
00:09:56,00:09:59,so both sides could yell insults at one another.
00:09:59,00:10:02,(all laughing)
00:10:02,00:10:03,- So good.
00:10:03,00:10:04,"- That is really cool, isn't it?"
00:10:04,00:10:05,- Yeah.
00:10:05,00:10:07,- So this is the diaries of a guy called Sapa French.
00:10:07,00:10:10,"Sapa was his nickname and he said in one of his diaries,"
00:10:10,00:10:12,and this was been quite recently found.
00:10:12,00:10:15,"I saw a rather curious thing in the trenches this morning,"
00:10:15,00:10:17,"heard some shouting and laughing,"
00:10:17,00:10:19,and saw a German leaning over the parapet
00:10:19,00:10:21,and shouting across to our men.
00:10:21,00:10:23,The distance was about 75 yards.
00:10:23,00:10:27,"One of our men shouted, come on over Fritz."
00:10:27,00:10:29,Fritz shouted back in perfect English.
00:10:29,00:10:31,No bluing fear.
00:10:31,00:10:32,"In fact, they could all speak good English."
00:10:32,00:10:34,"This went on for half an hour,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"and then all the heads went down,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,and the war went on the same as usual.
00:10:38,00:10:39,(all laughing)
00:10:39,00:10:40,Wow.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- That's pretty cool, isn't it?"
00:10:41,00:10:42,- Yeah.
00:10:42,00:10:43,"- They just thought, let's just do a bit of insults,"
00:10:43,00:10:44,and then we'll carry on shooting.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- That's amazing.
00:10:45,00:10:47,- A lot of German people who had been in Britain
00:10:47,00:10:49,"before the war had been waiters,"
00:10:49,00:10:50,"and there was one instance,"
00:10:50,00:10:52,which was a bit of a nicer instance of how
00:10:52,00:10:54,they used to actually chat between the trenches
00:10:54,00:10:56,"when they weren't actually at war,"
00:10:56,00:11:00,and someone recorded how one Englishman had shouted
00:11:00,00:11:01,"""Good and Morgan"" at dawn,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"presumably the only two words he knew,"
00:11:03,00:11:08,and then the German guy on the other side had responded
00:11:08,00:11:09,"and said hello in English,"
00:11:09,00:11:12,"and then they started exchanging some kind of fun insults,"
00:11:12,00:11:14,"and they'd ended by saying the English guy said,"
00:11:14,00:11:15,"""Waiter!"""
00:11:15,00:11:17,"And the German guy said, coming sir."
00:11:17,00:11:18,So...
00:11:18,00:11:19,"- Ah, ah."
00:11:19,00:11:22,"- The war so nearly tipped over into banter,"
00:11:22,00:11:23,and it would have...
00:11:23,00:11:25,We could have avoided hundreds of thousands of deaths.
00:11:25,00:11:26,- Yeah.
00:11:26,00:11:28,- Yeah. - The trenches were really interesting
00:11:28,00:11:30,because the British ones were made
00:11:30,00:11:31,"as if it was gonna be quite temporary,"
00:11:31,00:11:32,"that's what they thought,"
00:11:32,00:11:35,and the Germans thought we might be here for a while.
00:11:35,00:11:38,"And so their trenches, they had doorbells?"
00:11:38,00:11:39,- No. - Yep.
00:11:39,00:11:42,"They had staircases, electric lights, steel doors,"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"real kitchens, and wallpaper."
00:11:44,00:11:46,- Wallpaper?
00:11:46,00:11:48,"- No, wallpaper on the trenches, yeah."
00:11:48,00:11:50,"- The doorbell is a especially impressive thing,"
00:11:50,00:11:51,'cause obviously when the British go over the top
00:11:51,00:11:54,"and arrive, they'll have to wait after ringing the doorbell."
00:11:54,00:11:56,- Very clever.
00:11:56,00:11:57,- But they were.
00:11:57,00:12:00,"I just recently read All Quiet on the Western Fund,"
00:12:00,00:12:03,"which is an uplifting read if you haven't been there yet,"
00:12:03,00:12:04,but about the First World War.
00:12:04,00:12:07,And the constant chat among the German troops
00:12:07,00:12:10,was how their stuff was better than the Allies.
00:12:10,00:12:11,- That's cool.
00:12:11,00:12:15,And there's kind of a history of yelling and shouting in wars.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"The Georgian hero, Tariel,"
00:12:18,00:12:20,was apparently able to drop opposing warriors
00:12:20,00:12:23,using only the force of his mighty war cry.
00:12:24,00:12:25,- Okay.
00:12:25,00:12:28,"And in Welsh mythology, their hero, Colhwook,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,he was said to be able to give a battle cry so loud
00:12:30,00:12:33,and violent that all women in the courts
00:12:33,00:12:34,would become sterile.
00:12:34,00:12:36,- Oh.
00:12:36,00:12:37,- Whoa.
00:12:37,00:12:40,- He must have been a really popular guy in party zone.
00:12:40,00:12:42,"I thought you were going, I was wondering where you were going."
00:12:42,00:12:45,And I thought you were going to say pregnant.
00:12:45,00:12:46,"- No, it sounds like it would be that, doesn't it?"
00:12:46,00:12:48,"- Yeah, exactly the opposite, actually."
00:12:48,00:12:49,- Yes.
00:12:49,00:12:51,- Really?
00:12:51,00:12:52,- Yes.
00:12:52,00:12:54,- A sobering thought.
00:12:54,00:12:59,I have another fact about life in the trenches.
00:12:59,00:13:00,- Okay.
00:13:00,00:13:02,- And sort of agreements between the two sides in the trenches.
00:13:02,00:13:05,"So there was a guy in the First World War, British officer,"
00:13:05,00:13:06,Captain Robert Campbell.
00:13:06,00:13:08,"He got captured by the Germans,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,I think after the Battle of Mons.
00:13:10,00:13:14,"And after nearly two years in prison,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,"in a German prisoner of war camp,"
00:13:16,00:13:18,"he heard his mother was dying and he wrote to the Kaiser,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,"you know, asking to be released to go and be with his dying mother."
00:13:21,00:13:24,"Incredibly, the request was granted."
00:13:24,00:13:27,He was given two weeks leave from a prisoner of war camp
00:13:27,00:13:29,"on the German side to go back to England,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,visit his mother on the understanding
00:13:31,00:13:34,that he would then go back and go to prison again.
00:13:34,00:13:35,And he did.
00:13:35,00:13:38,He visited his mother.
00:13:38,00:13:40,He spent time with her in the last days of her life.
00:13:40,00:13:43,And he then honored the agreement and returned.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"And then the next day, he's like,"
00:13:45,00:13:46,"""Oh, my dad's sick now."""
00:13:48,00:13:51,And that's the only time that happened in the whole of the war.
00:13:51,00:13:54,"Well, because didn't the Allies then..."
00:13:54,00:13:56,So there was a German prisoner of war
00:13:56,00:13:59,"with the Allies who tried it, I think, because that had happened."
00:13:59,00:14:00,I'm really.
00:14:00,00:14:02,And the Allies did not let him go.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"And then they said, ""No, we didn't trust you."""
00:14:04,00:14:05,And so then it was clamped down on.
00:14:05,00:14:06,"So yeah, he didn't, the only one."
00:14:06,00:14:07,"Wow, it's so weird, though."
00:14:07,00:14:11,I think these insults mean a lot to military
00:14:11,00:14:12,when they're doing it to each other.
00:14:12,00:14:14,Because it still goes on to this day.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"And a few years back, there was a big moment"
00:14:16,00:14:19,between North Korea and the Americans.
00:14:19,00:14:23,The North Korean soldiers were seeing American soldiers
00:14:23,00:14:26,"pointed them, make strange noises."
00:14:26,00:14:29,They were pulling disgusting facial expressions at them.
00:14:29,00:14:31,And this was their big problem with them.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"And the Americans said, ""We wouldn't do this."""
00:14:32,00:14:34,And this is how important that is
00:14:34,00:14:35,in the follow-up bit to the statement
00:14:35,00:14:37,"of them going, ""They're pulling faces at us."
00:14:37,00:14:40,"They're pointing at us really weirdly."""
00:14:40,00:14:43,"They said, ""Oh, also, they're aiming their guns at us."""
00:14:43,00:14:46,That's like the second thing on the list.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"And then just to prove how childish it is,"
00:14:49,00:14:52,the statement warned US troops to stop the hooliganism
00:14:52,00:14:57,"or face dogs' death anytime, any place."
00:14:57,00:14:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:58,00:15:01,"Like, it's all it is, it's like banter wars, isn't it?"
00:15:01,00:15:03,"That reminds me of, is it in that book,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,or did we cut it in Bhutan?
00:15:05,00:15:06,"It's in the book, yeah."
00:15:06,00:15:08,"So in Bhutan, there was a battle."
00:15:08,00:15:09,It wasn't a battle.
00:15:09,00:15:12,It was an argument between India and China.
00:15:12,00:15:15,And they went kind of arguing of this tiny bit of Bhutan.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"And if they went to war, it would have been something"
00:15:17,00:15:20,like a quarter of the world's population would have gone to war.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"And they all went to this tiny bit of Bhutan,"
00:15:23,00:15:26,but they decided they'd not have one really wanted to have a war.
00:15:26,00:15:28,And so no one brought any weapons.
00:15:28,00:15:29,And you can see videos of it.
00:15:29,00:15:31,And it's just basically some Chinese soldiers
00:15:31,00:15:35,and some Indian soldiers kind of just chest bump in each other.
00:15:35,00:15:36,Yeah.
00:15:36,00:15:36,It's incredible.
00:15:36,00:15:39,"Yeah, it's literally-- it's a whole line of army members"
00:15:39,00:15:41,"just not fighting, but sort of--"
00:15:41,00:15:42,It's giggling.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:47,I can now tell in Leicester.
00:15:47,00:15:50,Is that what it's like here?
00:15:50,00:15:52,"You don't know, just go home and have a nice pack of crisps."
00:15:52,00:15:57,There was a lot of friendliness.
00:15:57,00:15:58,There's a really good book about World War I
00:15:58,00:16:01,"called Meeting the Enemy, the Human Face of the Great War."
00:16:01,00:16:03,"And even more friendly than that, there"
00:16:03,00:16:06,was one instance where Brits arrived at the psalm.
00:16:06,00:16:07,"And they were expecting they were like,"
00:16:07,00:16:10,"we're fighting the enemy, you know, all geared up"
00:16:10,00:16:12,"from massive battle, and they arrived."
00:16:12,00:16:14,"And they just found, on a bit of barbed wire, a note."
00:16:14,00:16:16,"And it was from the Germans saying,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,why don't you send two or three of your guys with some stuff
00:16:18,00:16:20,"you want to trade, and we'll send two or three of ours,"
00:16:20,00:16:21,and we'll swap presents.
00:16:21,00:16:23,And they met up in the middle of No Man's
00:16:23,00:16:24,then that first day.
00:16:24,00:16:27,"And they exchanged kind of magazines, and souvenirs,"
00:16:27,00:16:29,and periodicals that they wanted to read.
00:16:29,00:16:29,And--
00:16:29,00:16:32,It's amazing having a book club in the middle of a total.
00:16:32,00:16:33,It really is.
00:16:33,00:16:34,It's so impressive.
00:16:34,00:16:37,"So we haven't even mentioned the Christmas truce,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,"which was a big thing, a sporadic thing,"
00:16:39,00:16:41,along a lot of the West and Front.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"So I didn't know, though."
00:16:43,00:16:44,"It's stretched not only in the army,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,it's stretched to the other services as well.
00:16:46,00:16:49,"So on Christmas Eve, 1914, the Royal Flying"
00:16:49,00:16:52,"Corps flew over a German airfield at Lille,"
00:16:52,00:16:56,and they dropped on the runway a plum pudding.
00:16:56,00:16:59,"And then on Christmas Day, the German Air Force flew over"
00:16:59,00:17:00,"a British airfield, and they dropped a bottle of rum"
00:17:00,00:17:02,to say thank you.
00:17:02,00:17:04,"The Christmas truce, there was one really lovely moment."
00:17:04,00:17:07,A lot of Germans had been living in the UK before the war.
00:17:07,00:17:09,"And during the Christmas truce, they all went up into No Man's"
00:17:09,00:17:11,"Land, and one of the English guides"
00:17:11,00:17:13,realized that one of the German guys was his barber
00:17:13,00:17:15,who used to cut his hair in Hoban.
00:17:15,00:17:16,"And he said, ""I need a haircut."""
00:17:16,00:17:19,And so his Hoban barber cut his hair for him.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"I mean, that was very trusting, isn't it?"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"You know, it didn't take part."
00:17:24,00:17:27,"It was an absolute killjoy at the Christmas truce, actually."
00:17:27,00:17:29,"Oh, was it the senior officers or the...?"
00:17:29,00:17:31,"Yeah, they didn't, but in particular,"
00:17:31,00:17:33,one soldier on the German side.
00:17:33,00:17:34,You might be able to guess it was.
00:17:34,00:17:35,"Oh, I can guess."
00:17:35,00:17:37,Is it the most famous one?
00:17:37,00:17:38,It's the most famous one.
00:17:38,00:17:39,Hitler.
00:17:39,00:17:40,He absolutely was not a fan.
00:17:40,00:17:41,He hated the Christmas truce.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"Yeah, refused to take part."
00:17:43,00:17:45,He sat in a strop on his own
00:17:45,00:17:47,and just said really disapproving things
00:17:47,00:17:48,like you guys have no sense of honor.
00:17:48,00:17:50,And this isn't what we should be doing in wartime.
00:17:50,00:17:51,Classic Hitler.
00:17:51,00:17:58,"Hey, we should move on to our next factor, right?"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:18:01,00:18:03,And that is my fact.
00:18:03,00:18:05,My fact this week is this.
00:18:05,00:18:07,And I find this so interesting.
00:18:07,00:18:12,14% of all California's firefighters are in prison.
00:18:12,00:18:13,Is that amazing?
00:18:13,00:18:15,What do you mean by that?
00:18:15,00:18:17,"They take people who are in prison, women who are in prison,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,"and they say, would you like to sign up for this?"
00:18:19,00:18:22,We'll relocate you to a program whereby you'll
00:18:22,00:18:24,be a firefighter under the confines.
00:18:24,00:18:26,But you won't be an actual prison.
00:18:26,00:18:29,And lots and lots of women have signed up to it.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"So as a result, 14% of their whole firefighting force"
00:18:32,00:18:34,are prisoners who are serving time.
00:18:34,00:18:38,"And then when they're needed, they go in either fight fires"
00:18:38,00:18:41,or they clear paths where fires might happen.
00:18:41,00:18:42,And--
00:18:42,00:18:43,Yeah.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"I mean, it's women on men, isn't it?"
00:18:44,00:18:45,It's women on men.
00:18:45,00:18:48,"At one point, it was 40%, it was 40%, but I think--"
00:18:48,00:18:50,"Yeah, no, it's both."
00:18:50,00:18:50,Lots of men.
00:18:50,00:18:54,"And I don't think they get to do the super fun stuff,"
00:18:54,00:18:55,like the hosing.
00:18:55,00:18:57,"They do a lot more clearing, like you said."
00:18:57,00:19:00,"Yeah, some of them do get chainsaws."
00:19:00,00:19:00,Ooh.
00:19:00,00:19:03,"Yeah, because obviously you need to clear a path in forest."
00:19:03,00:19:05,"Yeah, you can only need a chainsaw to do it."
00:19:05,00:19:05,Yeah.
00:19:05,00:19:06,So yeah.
00:19:06,00:19:11,And they get paid something like $1 an hour in America.
00:19:11,00:19:12,But the exchange bit is that they're not
00:19:12,00:19:15,in a classic prison system.
00:19:15,00:19:16,And they get days off.
00:19:16,00:19:20,They're sentenced every time they serve for what they're doing
00:19:20,00:19:21,with their job as a firefighter.
00:19:21,00:19:25,But it's only $1 an hour when you're actively fighting a fire.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"Normally, you get paid about $1 a day."
00:19:27,00:19:29,"But I think there is a certain economy in prisons,"
00:19:29,00:19:30,isn't there?
00:19:30,00:19:32,And there's a lot of trading that goes on.
00:19:32,00:19:35,And did you know that they have their own shopping catalogs?
00:19:35,00:19:36,"Well, in prison."
00:19:36,00:19:36,Yeah.
00:19:36,00:19:39,"So they're in shopping catalogs, at least in America."
00:19:39,00:19:42,"So Gizmodo, the really great website,"
00:19:42,00:19:45,did a series of articles called Lockdown.
00:19:45,00:19:47,And interview this guy who said that they have a shopping
00:19:47,00:19:49,catalog of approved items.
00:19:49,00:19:51,So is anything that you want?
00:19:51,00:19:54,"Really, from TVs to toothbrushes or whatever."
00:19:54,00:19:56,And what happens is you can pick what you want.
00:19:56,00:19:58,And you take it out of the small pay
00:19:58,00:20:00,that you might have got in prison or your family can buy it.
00:20:00,00:20:01,And then it gets delivered.
00:20:01,00:20:03,And then it gets engraved.
00:20:03,00:20:05,So you get automatically engraved items.
00:20:05,00:20:06,"Because otherwise, all the other prisoners have also"
00:20:06,00:20:08,got the same stuff.
00:20:08,00:20:09,And so you need to know that it's yours.
00:20:09,00:20:12,"And actually, weirdly, in the YouTube clip"
00:20:12,00:20:14,"I was watching of the guy being interviewed,"
00:20:14,00:20:15,"he was saying, and this is some of the stuff"
00:20:15,00:20:16,the prisoners have ordered this week.
00:20:16,00:20:18,And he was opening packages.
00:20:18,00:20:23,"And he opened up a DVD of the series Richie Rich, season 2."
00:20:23,00:20:26,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:20:26,00:20:28,I only know Richie Rich as a film.
00:20:28,00:20:30,I did too until I had to look into this.
00:20:30,00:20:32,You're saying they've made a TV series of Richie Rich?
00:20:32,00:20:35,"Yeah, it's the same general thesis."
00:20:35,00:20:37,"Oh, sure."
00:20:37,00:20:38,That is fantastic.
00:20:38,00:20:41,"Well, I mean, you heard a fact within a fact there."
00:20:41,00:20:44,It gets something like 22% on Ross and Tomatoes.
00:20:44,00:20:47,But you could certainly give it a go.
00:20:47,00:20:49,But so the thing that really amazed me about this fact
00:20:49,00:20:53,"was, A, that's an amazing percentage"
00:20:53,00:20:55,that are in prison that are working for the firefighters.
00:20:55,00:20:58,"But B, I thought that firefighting was largely"
00:20:58,00:20:59,about fighting fires.
00:20:59,00:21:01,And it turns out that it's not.
00:21:01,00:21:04,It turns out that most of the time that firefighters
00:21:04,00:21:07,spend is doing tasks that the public call for them to do.
00:21:07,00:21:10,And there was a report from the UK from a few years ago
00:21:10,00:21:12,"that said, we need to stop responding"
00:21:12,00:21:14,to these weird calls that we're getting
00:21:14,00:21:16,because we just keep wasting our time.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"Between 2009 and 2011, these are the stats."
00:21:20,00:21:24,"1,613 incidents where people were locked out,"
00:21:24,00:21:27,where firefighters had to go and let them back in.
00:21:27,00:21:30,276 adults called firefighters out
00:21:30,00:21:32,because they were locked in toilets.
00:21:32,00:21:36,14 people were locked in cupboards.
00:21:36,00:21:40,One woman was stuck in a fridge.
00:21:40,00:21:42,One man was stuck in a freezer.
00:21:42,00:21:44,And one person was stuck in a recycling bag.
00:21:44,00:21:48,There's so many ridiculous things that they get called out
00:21:48,00:21:49,on a day-to-day basis.
00:21:49,00:21:53,They used to shout as they ran to a fire.
00:21:53,00:21:55,And this was going on as late as 1901 in America.
00:21:55,00:22:00,"As they went to the fire, they would shout, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi."
00:22:00,00:22:02,"Well, they're doing the knee-nails themselves."
00:22:02,00:22:06,"Well, it seems that way, right?"
00:22:06,00:22:07,Yeah.
00:22:07,00:22:10,"I mean, I kind of worked out what I thought the tune might be."
00:22:10,00:22:11,It might not have been that.
00:22:11,00:22:12,OK.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"It might have been hi, hi, hi, hi."
00:22:13,00:22:15,I don't know.
00:22:15,00:22:17,But when they decided to replace the shouting
00:22:17,00:22:21,"with a gong, a gong, and they all hated it,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,"they were like, no, we like doing the hi, I think."
00:22:24,00:22:24,Who are you?
00:22:24,00:22:27,"And also, when automatic fire alarms came in,"
00:22:27,00:22:28,they all hated that as well.
00:22:28,00:22:31,At the reason being that they had lookouts who
00:22:31,00:22:32,would look out for the fire.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"And as soon as the automatic fire alarms came in,"
00:22:35,00:22:36,those guys lost their job.
00:22:36,00:22:38,"Is the robot's taking over the jobs, isn't it?"
00:22:38,00:22:39,That was the start of it.
00:22:39,00:22:40,It is pretty much.
00:22:40,00:22:42,And so then the firemen started doing fire alarm
00:22:42,00:22:45,pranks to set off these fire alarms.
00:22:45,00:22:46,No.
00:22:46,00:22:47,Did they?
00:22:47,00:22:48,"Oh, but that's a thing."
00:22:48,00:22:52,They used to be loads of rival gangs of fire fighters.
00:22:52,00:22:54,And there's a scene in New York where all the fire fighters
00:22:54,00:22:55,"get in the scrap outside of fire,"
00:22:55,00:23:00,because they all want to be the ones to solve the fire.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"So you know, in Japan firefighters,"
00:23:02,00:23:05,they bring water pumps to the fire.
00:23:05,00:23:07,But they don't aim the water at the fire.
00:23:07,00:23:08,They emit it themselves.
00:23:08,00:23:09,What?
00:23:09,00:23:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:10,00:23:12,So they wet themselves down so they're not flammable.
00:23:12,00:23:15,And then this was in the Edo period in the 17th century.
00:23:15,00:23:16,"Oh, right."
00:23:16,00:23:17,Not now.
00:23:17,00:23:18,Yeah.
00:23:18,00:23:19,No.
00:23:19,00:23:20,So they would wet themselves down.
00:23:20,00:23:21,They'd run into the house.
00:23:21,00:23:23,And then they pulled the house down.
00:23:23,00:23:24,And that's how they stopped the fires.
00:23:24,00:23:25,And they used to--
00:23:25,00:23:26,"Smother them, didn't they?"
00:23:26,00:23:28,"So they had deliberately very, very thick clothes"
00:23:28,00:23:31,"that would weigh, you know, as much as a person when they were wet."
00:23:31,00:23:34,And they would go up to a fire and just--
00:23:34,00:23:34,Smother it.
00:23:34,00:23:36,They'd go up to a smother it.
00:23:36,00:23:37,"They would just jump on it, basically."
00:23:37,00:23:39,They would be able to get close enough that they could
00:23:39,00:23:40,puffer it up.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"But amazingly, they were positions of real respect"
00:23:44,00:23:46,in Japan in the Edo period.
00:23:46,00:23:47,So up until 1868.
00:23:47,00:23:51,And they used to wear outfits that look like normal firemen
00:23:51,00:23:53,"as outfits on the outside, so they were quite plain."
00:23:53,00:23:56,"But then on the inside of their suits,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,they had unbelievable works of art stitched throughout them.
00:23:59,00:24:00,And they had stories and everything.
00:24:00,00:24:03,It was kind of like manga that kind of style.
00:24:03,00:24:05,And they became really famous.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"And if they were successful and they put out a fire,"
00:24:07,00:24:09,they all turn their coats inside out.
00:24:09,00:24:10,"And they paraded through the streets,"
00:24:10,00:24:11,victoriously.
00:24:11,00:24:12,Wow.
00:24:12,00:24:13,And they often had their bodies tattooed
00:24:13,00:24:16,"with the designs on their coats, because, you know,"
00:24:16,00:24:19,"it was such a mark of, you know, something special."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"And, yeah, and also the stories that were told on the inside"
00:24:22,00:24:24,of their jackets became bestsellers in Japan.
00:24:24,00:24:27,So the kind of cartoon strips that firefighters had
00:24:27,00:24:29,became well-known stories that you tell your children.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"There was another thing which, speaking of covering"
00:24:32,00:24:35,yourself completely in water to be going in.
00:24:35,00:24:37,"That was in the early days, one of the things"
00:24:37,00:24:40,with firefighters breathing was very hard.
00:24:40,00:24:43,And so in order to get into a fire and keep your own breath
00:24:43,00:24:44,and not suffocate was a hard thing.
00:24:44,00:24:47,So most firefighters used to have a massive beard.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"The male firefighters, I would go in."
00:24:48,00:24:50,And what they would do is they drenched their beard
00:24:50,00:24:52,into a bucket of water.
00:24:52,00:24:54,And then they would bite into their beard and hold it
00:24:54,00:24:55,over their mouth.
00:24:55,00:24:57,"And that's how they would survive the fires,"
00:24:57,00:25:00,because they would have this beard mask
00:25:00,00:25:02,that stopped the smoke coming through to them.
00:25:02,00:25:03,Is that true?
00:25:03,00:25:03,Yeah.
00:25:03,00:25:04,That's incredible.
00:25:04,00:25:07,Isn't it true that the guy with the longest beard ever
00:25:07,00:25:10,"died because there was a fire, and he ran out of his house,"
00:25:10,00:25:11,"and he forgot to put his beard in this pocket,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,and he tripped over it and fell down the stairs.
00:25:13,00:25:14,Yes.
00:25:14,00:25:17,"She just wiped it, she just dipped it in the bath before he left."
00:25:17,00:25:18,That doesn't stop you tripping over it.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"If anything, it makes it more rope-like,"
00:25:19,00:25:21,makes it likely that the fire went up.
00:25:21,00:25:22,Just lock it up.
00:25:22,00:25:26,Have you guys heard about the firefighting goats of San Francisco?
00:25:26,00:25:29,"No, but I get the feeling we're about to."
00:25:29,00:25:30,Sure thing.
00:25:30,00:25:32,San Francisco has firefighting goats.
00:25:32,00:25:32,That's great.
00:25:32,00:25:33,"Right, moving on."
00:25:33,00:25:35,Time for fact number four.
00:25:35,00:25:37,And...
00:25:37,00:25:38,Do you want to say it?
00:25:38,00:25:39,"Yes, sure."
00:25:39,00:25:42,"Well, they're kind of pre-firefighting goats."
00:25:42,00:25:45,So they're let loose around San Francisco to eat bits of dry scrublin
00:25:45,00:25:47,that would otherwise be a massive fire risk.
00:25:47,00:25:48,"Oh, that's clever."
00:25:48,00:25:50,"But they've been introduced, and it's helped massively"
00:25:50,00:25:52,with the problems of fire-breaking out in the summer.
00:25:52,00:25:54,That's really clever.
00:25:54,00:25:58,It's not as kind of rock 'n' roll when you explain it.
00:25:58,00:26:00,"When the goat goes home to his wife, and he's like,"
00:26:00,00:26:01,"""I'm a firefighter."""
00:26:01,00:26:02,"""What'd you do today, darling?"""
00:26:02,00:26:04,I just ate some more grass.
00:26:04,00:26:04,It was really nice.
00:26:04,00:26:07,Save some lives.
00:26:07,00:26:11,Should we move on to our final thoughts?
00:26:11,00:26:13,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:26:13,00:26:15,And that is Andy.
00:26:15,00:26:18,My fact is that mere cats can turn their bottoms inside out.
00:26:18,00:26:23,So do they do it on purpose?
00:26:23,00:26:25,They do do it on purpose.
00:26:25,00:26:27,They do it to socialise.
00:26:27,00:26:28,So...
00:26:28,00:26:30,"They've all got a party trick,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,and it's all turning their bottoms inside out.
00:26:32,00:26:36,So they have what's called an anal pouch.
00:26:36,00:26:38,And it's under their tails.
00:26:38,00:26:41,And they produce this kind of paste inside it.
00:26:41,00:26:43,And it's nature.
00:26:43,00:26:46,"You can't go, ""It's nature."""
00:26:46,00:26:48,And they smear it on plants and rocks
00:26:48,00:26:50,to mark territory as their own.
00:26:50,00:26:53,And they even sometimes smear it on other mere cats.
00:26:53,00:26:57,I read that this paste comes out of them a lot like
00:26:57,00:27:02,when Play Doe is extruded from one of those doll's heads.
00:27:02,00:27:03,"I believe so, yeah."
00:27:03,00:27:05,From a doll's head?
00:27:05,00:27:07,"Yeah, you know those things, you remember."
00:27:07,00:27:08,It was like an old kind of tie
00:27:08,00:27:11,"from there, probably you're too young, I guess."
00:27:11,00:27:13,"But you used to have Play Doe, and you used to squeeze it,"
00:27:13,00:27:14,"and then you had these little dolls,"
00:27:14,00:27:16,and it would come out their hair and their hair would end up looking like that.
00:27:16,00:27:17,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:17,00:27:19,"And scientists do squeeze it, didn't they?"
00:27:19,00:27:22,"So when they're trying to study the makeup of this paste,"
00:27:22,00:27:25,that's how they get it when they've extruded their pouches.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"The scientists literally grab it, and they squeeze it,"
00:27:27,00:27:30,and you can actually get it out like that.
00:27:30,00:27:34,"Yeah, that, I think, is a worse job than being the crisp."
00:27:34,00:27:37,A tester at walkers hanging outside a mere cat's nest
00:27:37,00:27:40,with a cotton bud just waiting.
00:27:40,00:27:43,"But this came to light, I think, probably,"
00:27:43,00:27:45,"and you read this, they've done a new study"
00:27:45,00:27:47,about the bacteria in myocard bottoms.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:50,And they've found that it's the bacteria that
00:27:50,00:27:54,"makes up this, the different smells, which"
00:27:54,00:27:59,means they can kind of say whose anal paste it is.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"Yeah, so the smell comes not from the myocard,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,it comes from the bacteria.
00:28:03,00:28:07,"But the myocards use the bacteria to judge what's going on,"
00:28:07,00:28:13,so they swapped these anal pouches to get the bacteria.
00:28:13,00:28:15,"And I read an article in popular science,"
00:28:15,00:28:17,and they were talking about these guys who
00:28:17,00:28:18,"were doing the swabbing, and they said,"
00:28:18,00:28:20,these pouches are wide open.
00:28:20,00:28:22,They're almost asking to be swabbed.
00:28:22,00:28:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:25,00:28:28,"So myocards are kind of bastards, aren't they?"
00:28:28,00:28:28,Sure.
00:28:28,00:28:29,"Yeah, mostly."
00:28:29,00:28:31,"Yeah, they really are."
00:28:31,00:28:33,They've actually did a study recently
00:28:33,00:28:35,looking at the most murderous mammals.
00:28:35,00:28:37,"And myocards came out on top, and they're"
00:28:37,00:28:40,looking at how many of their deaths are caused by members
00:28:40,00:28:41,of their own species.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"And with myocards, it's 20%."
00:28:43,00:28:47,So the 20% of myocard deaths are caused by other myocards.
00:28:47,00:28:48,Which is amazing.
00:28:48,00:28:49,They're always killing each other.
00:28:49,00:28:50,They kill their own babies.
00:28:50,00:28:52,They kill their mate's babies.
00:28:52,00:28:53,Wow.
00:28:53,00:28:54,I love killing babies.
00:28:54,00:28:55,And I read that study as well.
00:28:55,00:28:58,And it also said that sea lions are more murderous
00:28:58,00:29:00,than actual lions.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"Oh, wow."
00:29:01,00:29:02,"That's quite a good fact, isn't it?"
00:29:02,00:29:06,"And humans are not very murderous, how"
00:29:06,00:29:08,are we according to what we should be?
00:29:08,00:29:12,"Apparently, we should be about 200 times more murderous"
00:29:12,00:29:13,than we actually are.
00:29:13,00:29:16,"Should be going to the rules laid out 100 million years ago,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,pinned to a tree.
00:29:18,00:29:21,That's really nice that we've kind of mastered our worst
00:29:21,00:29:21,instincts.
00:29:21,00:29:24,"Yeah, it kind of goes off a few times when this wasn't shit."
00:29:24,00:29:29,"Sometimes they when they're fighting,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,they latch on to their enemy.
00:29:31,00:29:34,"So I think basically the tension in myocard colonies,"
00:29:34,00:29:35,it's caused by the fact that they'll
00:29:35,00:29:37,have colonies of 50 myocards.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"And there's basically one mating couple, isn't there?"
00:29:39,00:29:41,And no one else is really allowed to have kids.
00:29:41,00:29:44,"And if someone else has kids, then the lead couple"
00:29:44,00:29:45,kills those kids.
00:29:45,00:29:48,"And also, who's the dominant couple?"
00:29:48,00:29:52,It's all decided on based on the size and their weight
00:29:52,00:29:53,and their age.
00:29:53,00:29:56,And so everyone's always looking at each other
00:29:56,00:29:58,"and working out who's going to be bigger,"
00:29:58,00:30:00,who's going to be the next in line.
00:30:00,00:30:02,"And they are literally, as one article pointed out,"
00:30:02,00:30:05,all the myocards are comparing the myocards.
00:30:05,00:30:07,That's what they're doing.
00:30:07,00:30:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:09,00:30:09,That's very good.
00:30:09,00:30:11,Because of me.
00:30:11,00:30:13,Just on compare the myocard.
00:30:13,00:30:17,"Did you know that in 2010, remember the lead myocard?"
00:30:17,00:30:18,"Oh, love."
00:30:18,00:30:19,Sure.
00:30:19,00:30:22,He released an autobiography that year.
00:30:22,00:30:23,Do you remember?
00:30:23,00:30:24,"No, I don't remember."
00:30:24,00:30:25,"No, you should have."
00:30:25,00:30:28,Because it was one of the biggest selling books of that year.
00:30:28,00:30:31,That was the year that Tony Blair released his memoirs.
00:30:31,00:30:32,And they were more--
00:30:32,00:30:33,I do remember that one.
00:30:33,00:30:33,Yeah.
00:30:33,00:30:36,There were more pre-orders on the myocards book.
00:30:36,00:30:37,Then there were on Tony Blair's memoirs.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"Russell Brands' book on David Beckham's book,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,then Cheryl Coles' book.
00:30:42,00:30:43,This guy outsold everyone.
00:30:43,00:30:44,No way.
00:30:44,00:30:45,Yeah.
00:30:45,00:30:47,Did you have any big reveals?
00:30:47,00:30:48,No.
00:30:48,00:30:48,The fortune.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"Yeah, he started the Iraq war."
00:30:50,00:30:52,"Yes, yeah."
00:30:52,00:30:54,I knew it.
00:30:54,00:30:57,"But no, actually, I read, here's one odd reveal."
00:30:57,00:30:57,It's not in the book.
00:30:57,00:31:00,The voice of the myocards is--
00:31:00,00:31:01,"and this is very niche, but this is for anyone"
00:31:01,00:31:06,"who's watched Alan Partridge, the second series of Alan Partridge"
00:31:06,00:31:08,when he's staying in the hotel.
00:31:08,00:31:10,It's the guy who fixes everything.
00:31:10,00:31:11,You know that guy?
00:31:11,00:31:11,Michael?
00:31:11,00:31:12,Yeah.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Michael is the voice--
00:31:13,00:31:14,"Michael, the Jordy ex-soldier guy."
00:31:14,00:31:15,"Yes, yeah."
00:31:15,00:31:16,He's the voice of--
00:31:16,00:31:18,I was watching Alan Partridge this afternoon.
00:31:18,00:31:22,So this is an amazing fact for me.
00:31:22,00:31:24,You were saying about comparing the myocards.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"This study, I think, you were talking about."
00:31:26,00:31:28,It's a guy called Clutton Brock.
00:31:28,00:31:31,And he did these experiments where they fed extra food
00:31:31,00:31:34,to some of the myocards that were the main myocards.
00:31:34,00:31:38,"And when they got fatter, the main myocards got fatter as well."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"And so they found that basically, when"
00:31:40,00:31:41,"you're comparing with the other myocards,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,"if someone gets bigger than you, you immediately"
00:31:43,00:31:46,eat a load of pizza or whatever they eat
00:31:46,00:31:47,and then just try and get bigger than them.
00:31:47,00:31:49,Because you always want to be the biggest one.
00:31:49,00:31:51,Because it's the biggest one who's the most important.
00:31:51,00:31:52,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:52,00:31:53,So you're always looking around and it's
00:31:53,00:31:54,"going, oh, he's looking--"
00:31:54,00:31:55,Barry's looking a bit fat.
00:31:55,00:31:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:58,00:32:01,"I think someone compared it to something that gobyfish do,"
00:32:01,00:32:02,"which is almost the opposite, but it's quite interesting,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,is that gobyfish go on diets.
00:32:04,00:32:07,"And it's for the same kind of peer pressure reasons,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,like the biggest gobyfish is the one who's dominant.
00:32:09,00:32:12,And they don't want to cause conflict.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"And so if they see a big gobyfish,"
00:32:14,00:32:15,they make themselves less big.
00:32:15,00:32:16,They eat a bit less.
00:32:16,00:32:18,"Because they're like, oh, I don't want to start a fight with that guy."
00:32:18,00:32:20,I'll just go on a little diet.
00:32:20,00:32:21,Be small.
00:32:21,00:32:22,"Which is quite sweet, isn't it?"
00:32:22,00:32:23,That's good.
00:32:23,00:32:24,But meocards are much more up in your face.
00:32:24,00:32:26,"If you're going to get big, I'm going to get big."
00:32:26,00:32:28,I'll race you to the top kind of attitude.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"Yep, true."
00:32:30,00:32:33,"And meocats, when they sleep, it's quite interesting what they do."
00:32:33,00:32:36,They pile on top of one another to keep warm.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Adorable.
00:32:37,00:32:38,Yeah.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"So like, in summer, when it's hotter,"
00:32:40,00:32:41,they kind of spread out a lot.
00:32:41,00:32:44,"And in winter, when it's cold, they kind of grab another meocat"
00:32:44,00:32:46,on top that they kind of snuggle in.
00:32:46,00:32:47,Quickly murder them.
00:32:47,00:32:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:49,00:32:51,They all have meocat rugs in their homes.
00:32:51,00:32:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:55,00:32:58,"I had some stuff on anuses, if that's--"
00:32:58,00:32:59,Yes.
00:32:59,00:33:02,So this fact is about they can turn their bottoms inside out.
00:33:02,00:33:05,I didn't realize I was reading a BBC article apparently
00:33:05,00:33:09,to chart the evolution in history of anuses
00:33:09,00:33:13,is really hard because a lot of species have a bum.
00:33:13,00:33:15,And then they suddenly don't have a bum.
00:33:15,00:33:18,And then they have a bum again.
00:33:18,00:33:21,And so there's this like missing link of anuses that--
00:33:21,00:33:22,All right.
00:33:22,00:33:25,"Yes, you can't through the fossils chart it properly,"
00:33:25,00:33:28,"because suddenly it's just out of nowhere, no bum."
00:33:28,00:33:30,"And then thousands of years later,"
00:33:30,00:33:32,suddenly there's a bum again.
00:33:32,00:33:33,That's so odd.
00:33:33,00:33:35,Do we have examples of--
00:33:35,00:33:38,"Well, there's no bummed-then-unbummed creatures."
00:33:38,00:33:40,"I can't remember any, but there is a thing called having"
00:33:40,00:33:41,a transient anus.
00:33:41,00:33:42,A transient anus?
00:33:42,00:33:43,Yes.
00:33:43,00:33:44,Yeah.
00:33:44,00:33:46,But I think I might be in the lifetime of an individual.
00:33:46,00:33:48,"You have a bum, and then you don't have a bum."
00:33:48,00:33:48,Exactly.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"No, that's a very short-term example of the long-term thing."
00:33:51,00:33:52,That's what I was mentioning.
00:33:52,00:33:56,"So we've covered the sea cucumber before, which is a little--"
00:33:56,00:33:58,"It's not a cucumber, but it does live in the sea."
00:33:58,00:33:59,What is it?
00:33:59,00:34:02,It's a kind of fishy organism.
00:34:02,00:34:02,It's not a fish.
00:34:02,00:34:04,They're really weird.
00:34:04,00:34:06,They look like odd cucumbers underwater.
00:34:06,00:34:12,"But we've said before, they can self-avisorate"
00:34:12,00:34:13,when they're threatened by a predator.
00:34:13,00:34:16,They distract the predator by squirting their own intestines
00:34:16,00:34:19,"out of themselves, and that distracts the predator,"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"because he thinks, what's this?"
00:34:21,00:34:25,And then they slowly leave.
00:34:25,00:34:27,"But the other incredible thing is, they"
00:34:27,00:34:32,"can turn solid or mushy on command, on self-command."
00:34:32,00:34:35,"So they can turn their body into a mush,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,"and then climb through a tiny crack,"
00:34:37,00:34:40,"and then resellify into lumps, so they can't be got out"
00:34:40,00:34:42,through the crack by a predator.
00:34:42,00:34:42,Wow.
00:34:42,00:34:43,Then nuts.
00:34:43,00:34:44,They're so nuts.
00:34:44,00:34:46,And then it's not only for self-defense
00:34:46,00:34:49,"that they self-avisorate, it's a seasonal thing."
00:34:49,00:34:53,"In autumn, they just re-absorb all their intestines"
00:34:53,00:34:56,"into their body, and they just become a solid lump of flesh,"
00:34:56,00:34:57,basically.
00:34:57,00:35:01,"So fishermen in the Caribbean, they harvest them in October,"
00:35:01,00:35:02,"because they know they're not going to have to gut them,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,because they have no guts anymore.
00:35:04,00:35:05,"Oh, wow."
00:35:05,00:35:06,Yeah.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"And then in spring, they regrow all their organs,"
00:35:08,00:35:09,and they continue like that.
00:35:09,00:35:10,That's insane.
00:35:10,00:35:11,They're so weird.
00:35:11,00:35:16,The one thing I know about the anus of a sea cucumber
00:35:16,00:35:18,"is that there's a fish that lives in there, isn't there?"
00:35:18,00:35:21,It's called a slender pearl fish.
00:35:21,00:35:23,It lives inside the anus of a sea cucumber.
00:35:23,00:35:25,And the funny thing about them is whenever
00:35:25,00:35:27,"they want to go into a sea cucumber's anus,"
00:35:27,00:35:30,"they kind of do a little knock on the anus,"
00:35:30,00:35:31,and the anus opens up.
00:35:31,00:35:32,"Oh, my god."
00:35:32,00:35:36,"Like they're entering a German trench, you'll see."
00:35:36,00:35:36,Really?
00:35:36,00:35:40,"And is it a secret knock, or is it just a normal one?"
00:35:40,00:35:43,"Oh, you think it's like, yeah."
00:35:43,00:35:45,It's the pearl fish again.
00:35:45,00:35:46,"What a slang term for the anus, by the way,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,to German trench.
00:35:48,00:35:51,That we kind of just over there.
00:35:51,00:35:52,"Guys, we need to wrap up."
00:35:52,00:35:54,Do you have anything before we do?
00:35:54,00:35:58,"There are a dragonfire larvae, each via its anus."
00:35:58,00:36:00,"What they do, this is really cool."
00:36:00,00:36:02,They draw water in through the anus.
00:36:02,00:36:04,"They clench, and then they compress the abdomen,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"and their muscles in their thorax,"
00:36:06,00:36:09,against the water filled in their rectum.
00:36:09,00:36:11,"And then they can raise the pressure in their body,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,"and it fires out their mouth, and then they can eat."
00:36:13,00:36:14,What?
00:36:14,00:36:17,"And that call, you're drawing water in your squeezing,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,and then your mouth comes out and you eat.
00:36:19,00:36:20,Wow.
00:36:20,00:36:21,That's so awesome.
00:36:21,00:36:22,What?
00:36:22,00:36:25,I'm glad I don't do that.
00:36:25,00:36:27,But I'm happy that someone else has found me better to do that.
00:36:27,00:36:29,Was that on blue planet?
00:36:29,00:36:31,"Or is it on brown planet, actually?"
00:36:31,00:36:36,"OK, that's it."
00:36:36,00:36:37,That is all of our facts.
00:36:37,00:36:39,Thank you so much for listening.

00:37:22,00:37:23,We can't force you.
00:37:23,00:37:24,Yeah.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"And we're going to end this show, aren't we?"
00:37:26,00:37:27,With a fact.
00:37:27,00:37:28,Yes.
00:37:28,00:37:31,We have a fact that you guys sent in at the beginning of this show.
00:37:31,00:37:33,And we're going to give away one of our books to one of you.
00:37:33,00:37:35,"And Anna, you have that fact?"
00:37:35,00:37:36,Yep.
00:37:36,00:37:38,So this is our favorite fact that you guys sent in.
00:37:38,00:37:40,And it's from--
00:37:40,00:37:41,I don't know if I can read my own writing.
00:37:41,00:37:42,"But Victor, Jaganathan."
00:37:42,00:37:43,Are you in?
00:37:43,00:37:44,You in?
00:37:44,00:37:45,Yes.
00:37:45,00:37:46,Starts a good fact.
00:37:46,00:37:51,So this fact is that guide runners for site-impaired runners
00:37:51,00:37:54,can't use elasticated tethers at the Paralympics anymore.
00:37:54,00:37:57,After the Chinese started catapulting their runners across
