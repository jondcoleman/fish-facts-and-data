00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 (playing in foreign language)

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:18,520
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,640
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,120
 this week coming to you from Lester.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,120
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,840
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,200
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,160
 and James Harkin, and once again,

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,840
 we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,760
 with our fourth favorite facts from the last seven days

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,120
 and in no particular order.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,880
 Here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
 - My fact this week is that walkers, crisps,

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
 only source potatoes that are grown

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,280
 far away from golf courses,

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,640
 because their factory machines

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,040
 can't distinguish between golf balls and potatoes.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,040
 (audience laughing)

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,320
 - That's amazing.

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
 - It's true.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,840
 So this is a walkers, crisps, factory in Lester, obviously,

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,240
 and red, well done guys,

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,400
 a very good contribution to the country, I would say.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
 And yeah, it's factory has this density-based sorting system.

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,840
 So what it is is, all the potatoes come in,

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
 and the machine automatically knows the stuff

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,080
 that has the right density to be a potato

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,560
 that can be turned into a crisp.

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,840
 But it just turns out the density of golf balls

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,360
 is exactly the same.

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,640
 And so it used to be that there'll be a lot of golf courses

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,240
 next to the fields where farmers are growing their potatoes,

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,760
 which would then be shipped to walkers,

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,000
 and lots of people got like hard bits of golf ball

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
 in their crisp packets.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,880
 - So would you sort of, you'd be on the green

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,920
 about to take your shot and a walkers machine

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,080
 would just nab your golf ball and whisk it off to a factory?

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,720
 - I didn't read the details of it,

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,520
 but I would assume it's more likely that you'd take your shot,

42
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,760
 it would go over into the field as you're a golfer,

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,560
 James, sometimes you miss hit things, right?

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
 Not you, obviously.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
 - Just very, very occasionally,

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,680
 every single time I ever play, yeah.

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
 - Yeah.

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,040
 - And then it gets scooped up by the tractors.

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,720
 - But I wouldn't have thought I'd be able to replace

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,080
 my golf ball with a potato, for instance.

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,240
 - I know, it's weird, isn't it?

52
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,080
 It doesn't feel like they're the same density.

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,280
 - I'll give it a go.

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,640
 - And so was this a problem?

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,800
 Were there people sending packets back going?

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,880
 I expected Salt and vinegar crisps and I got a golf ball.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
 - Like was that ever been a thing?

58
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,360
 - People did mention it.

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
 I mentioned that they had hard crisps,

60
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,560
 but if you're interested, each golf ball yields 18 crisps.

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,400
 (laughing)

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,640
 - That's incredible.

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,480
 - But no, the factory is really cool, isn't it?

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,440
 - Yeah, so one of the things I really like about it is,

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,560
 basically a crisp goes from being a potato

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,120
 to being in a bag in 20 minutes.

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
 - Wow.

68
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
 - Which is extremely fast, I think.

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,120
 And there's a man at the end of the whole potato line

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,960
 who just said he's the potato overlord.

71
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,800
 And he just looks at the potatoes and he said,

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
 they're all good, they're all good, they're all good.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,640
 That one's bad.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,560
 - Yeah, it doesn't sound quite as exciting

75
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,400
 as you just made it look though.

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,200
 'Cause I think maybe you read the same article

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,960
 as I did in the Leicester Mercury.

78
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,040
 (laughing)

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,880
 - Wow.

80
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,600
 - Another great contribution to the country.

81
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,360
 (laughing)

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
 They said about this guy who's checking

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,720
 that actual potatoes go through, they said,

84
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,960
 he looks unsurprisingly, utterly bored.

85
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,280
 (laughing)

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,920
 The worst thing is, they probably got permission

87
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,160
 from walkers to go in and said,

88
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,920
 oh, we'll write it up really nicely.

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,640
 They say, look, utterly bored.

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,400
 This is, surely, the worst job in the whole building.

91
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
 - Whoa.

92
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,640
 - Whoa.

93
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
 - In the whole building though,

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,560
 maybe everyone else is a crisp tasteer,

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,240
 except that one guy.

96
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
 There are crisp tasteers out there.

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,040
 You have to be a super-taster if you wanna be a crisp tasteer.

98
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,960
 And when you're doing it,

99
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,360
 you're not allowed to drink tear or coffee

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,720
 because it will interfere with your palate.

101
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,920
 And they have to have 20 minute breaks between tests

102
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,160
 where all they eat is fruit.

103
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,840
 And they make it so that you're only allowed

104
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,000
 to certain number of crisps every day

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,080
 so you don't go over your salt limit for the day as well.

106
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
 - Oh.

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
 - It doesn't sound quite as cool, does it?

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
 - No, it doesn't.

109
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,840
 - I mean, it's better than the guy just looking

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,520
 at the potatoes all day.

111
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,400
 - But what is that crisp once the guy's eaten it?

112
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,240
 - No.

113
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,080
 - No, no.

114
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,960
 - They don't retrieve it afterwards.

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
 - Right.

116
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
 - You have the assistant vomitter.

117
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,000
 And I think actually that's the worst job.

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,720
 And they shove their fingers down his throat

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
 and they get the crisp back.

120
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
 - It's just for like the general batch.

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,640
 - Yeah. - It's like a sample.

122
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
 - Okay.

123
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,920
 - You should have said that because that makes sense.

124
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,400
 You left us all hanging thinking.

125
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,120
 - I think when you say "ozol,"

126
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,320
 I think my feeling is that the people

127
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
 have lester got that.

128
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,400
 - I'll talk about me and the voices in my head.

129
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,920
 - I think you said that because you've seen wine tasters

130
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,160
 and you've seen them taste the wine then spit it out again.

131
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,000
 - Yes.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
 - Like they do, don't they?

133
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,480
 And did you assume that other people then drunk that spot out?

134
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,960
 - Yeah, I thought they just popped that back in the bottle.

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,160
 - I have a fact about the lester walkers factory.

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,560
 They aim to extract so much water from the potatoes

137
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,840
 that they don't need any water.

138
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,120
 Because potatoes are 80% water, okay?

139
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,360
 So when the potato slices get sliced up and then they get boil,

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,480
 all the steam comes off and they condense it

141
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,440
 and get water from that that they use

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
 for the process of running their building.

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,880
 - Well, they also use water to peel the potatoes, don't they?

144
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,040
 They fire it at it, so it must be for that.

145
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
 - Yeah.

146
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,960
 So basically what I'm saying is in the event of a catastrophe,

147
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,200
 this is probably the safest place to be on the planet.

148
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,400
 It's got self-sufficient supplies of water and potatoes.

149
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,240
 - Yeah.

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
 - As long as the potatoes keep being delivered.

151
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,800
 (laughter)

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,200
 They might relax the whole no-goal course kind of deliveries.

153
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,840
 They also have a sort of what was described

154
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,120
 in this amazing blog I read and I would really recommend this blog.

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,000
 It was this girl who went to visit the factory

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,280
 and gives a really detailed description of her tour of it.

157
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,440
 And I can't remember what she's called or what the blog's called.

158
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
 So just Google and Google until you find it.

159
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
 (laughter)

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,360
 This is, she described how there's sort of a log flume

161
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,920
 for the potatoes where they're dropped in this water.

162
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,400
 And as the potatoes go through the factory,

163
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,720
 all the starches, some of the starch comes out of it.

164
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
 So in the various processes, some of the starch comes out.

165
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,000
 So when it goes into this log flume to get transferred

166
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,360
 through the factory, then the starch goes into the water

167
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,160
 and it goes a kind of milky color.

168
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,480
 And when she was being shown round, they reassured her.

169
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,840
 They said, don't worry, that starch doesn't get wasted.

170
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,400
 It goes to a starch recovery plant, which is just next door.

171
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,520
 And then it gets turned into quavas.

172
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,000
 - Oh.

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,480
 - That's what quavas are.

174
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,240
 - That's awesome.

175
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,080
 - Yeah.

176
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,680
 - Did she work that out or did they work that?

177
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,320
 - Would she told that for the blog?

178
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,520
 - How would you deduce?

179
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
 - How would she...

180
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,480
 (laughter)

181
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,960
 - Would she have followed a secret door that said,

182
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
 "No, no, don't go ahead.

183
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,840
 This is where we put the starch."

184
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,200
 She goes, "It's the quavas factory.

185
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,360
 Holy shit."

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,640
 (laughter)

187
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,600
 - I just blown this thing wide open.

188
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,840
 (laughter)

189
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,120
 - Oh my god.

190
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,040
 Of all the things you could work out,

191
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
 that really is one you have to be told.

192
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,720
 (laughter)

193
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,080
 Just opened a bag of quavas three weeks later.

194
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,760
 Oh my god, I recognize this.

195
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,360
 (laughter)

196
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,920
 - Hey, so you know how you're saying it takes 20 minutes

197
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,160
 from it going from the van into...

198
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,400
 So that's the full potato into a crisp packet

199
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,920
 in 20 minutes' time.

200
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,160
 The amount of potatoes that they use every single hour,

201
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,640
 if you went to the Lester Tiger Stadium.

202
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,840
 I haven't been to that, but I imagine some of you guys here have.

203
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,040
 The amount of potatoes they use in a single hour

204
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,520
 would carpet the entire floor of that stadium.

205
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,200
 That's how many potatoes per hour.

206
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,600
 That's every day that this happens.

207
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,320
 So there's way more potatoes on earth than I realised.

208
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,080
 - That's why I get from that.

209
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,200
 - That's a lot of potatoes.

210
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,880
 - That would make the sports matches

211
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,600
 that get played at the Lester Tiger Stadium

212
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
 extremely amusing.

213
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,240
 (laughter)

214
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,120
 What gets played there?

215
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
 - Oh brilliant.

216
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
 - Come on Andy.

217
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,800
 I'm sorry.

218
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,040
 - I've got to do your research before coming to these cities.

219
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,840
 (laughter)

220
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,920
 - Did you guys read about my favorite part

221
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
 of the factory?

222
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
 And then we can move on from it.

223
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,120
 But it's a machine called the OptiSort.

224
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,480
 And this is the last machine that the crisps are put through.

225
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,440
 And this is to check for potatoes

226
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,080
 that might have flaws in them.

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
 So there's a machine at the beginning that looks at them

228
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,680
 to check for green bits and shave the green bits off.

229
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,200
 But there might still be some left.

230
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,000
 And what the OptiSort does is it separates the crisps

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
 individually onto this conveyor belt.

232
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,360
 So they're one layer thick.

233
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
 And then they get hurled.

234
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,760
 Like catapulted really fast.

235
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,440
 At three meters per second passed this camera,

236
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
 really high speed camera that checks for flaws.

237
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,440
 And if the camera sees any kind of little speck of green

238
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
 or any speck of black or something,

239
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,200
 then the crisps flies over a gap.

240
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,160
 Still going really fast.

241
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
 A 10 centimeter wide gap.

242
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,840
 And if it's a dodgy one, then there's a swift puff of air

243
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,160
 that blows down through the gap

244
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,080
 and dismisses it from the production line.

245
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
 - Wow.

246
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,760
 Isn't that cool?

247
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,280
 - Yeah, but why all the drama of the speed and the tight?

248
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,600
 - Because you've just got to be incredibly quick.

249
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,440
 Because you've got to make so many bloody crisps.

250
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
 - That's actually the motto of Walker's crisps.

251
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,080
 We've got to make so many bloody crisps.

252
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,160
 (all laughing)

253
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,120
 I suppose you think it's easy.

254
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,680
 You bastard's a kettle hand manufacturing everyone.

255
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,560
 We've got a proper company to run here.

256
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,560
 (all laughing)

257
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,240
 - We should move on.

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,080
 We need to move on.

259
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,720
 - I have so much stuff on golf.

260
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,680
 - No, we don't have time.

261
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,200
 - We don't have time.

262
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,640
 Why don't you try and crowbar a golf?

263
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,520
 - Oh yeah, I'll do a fact in one of these.

264
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,680
 - Just wait for that later on.

265
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
 - Yeah.

266
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,680
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is James.

267
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,560
 - Okay, my fact is about golf.

268
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,400
 (all laughing)

269
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,040
 - It's not, it's not.

270
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,000
 - I could make it about golf.

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
 (all laughing)

272
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
 That would really screw up the podcast with me.

273
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
 - In a word, yeah.

274
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,280
 - Okay, no, it's not about golf.

275
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,640
 My fact this week is that during World War One,

276
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,640
 truces would occasionally be called in the trenches,

277
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,680
 so both sides could yell insults at one another.

278
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,520
 (all laughing)

279
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,360
 - So good.

280
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
 - That is really cool, isn't it?

281
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
 - Yeah.

282
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,840
 - So this is the diaries of a guy called Sapa French.

283
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,760
 Sapa was his nickname and he said in one of his diaries,

284
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,680
 and this was been quite recently found.

285
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,800
 I saw a rather curious thing in the trenches this morning,

286
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
 heard some shouting and laughing,

287
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,880
 and saw a German leaning over the parapet

288
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,680
 and shouting across to our men.

289
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
 The distance was about 75 yards.

290
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
 One of our men shouted, come on over Fritz.

291
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,480
 Fritz shouted back in perfect English.

292
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,000
 No bluing fear.

293
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,680
 In fact, they could all speak good English.

294
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,960
 This went on for half an hour,

295
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,400
 and then all the heads went down,

296
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,720
 and the war went on the same as usual.

297
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
 (all laughing)

298
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
 Wow.

299
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,400
 - That's pretty cool, isn't it?

300
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,240
 - Yeah.

301
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
 - They just thought, let's just do a bit of insults,

302
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,400
 and then we'll carry on shooting.

303
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,240
 - That's amazing.

304
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,280
 - A lot of German people who had been in Britain

305
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,160
 before the war had been waiters,

306
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,520
 and there was one instance,

307
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,440
 which was a bit of a nicer instance of how

308
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,960
 they used to actually chat between the trenches

309
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,440
 when they weren't actually at war,

310
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,200
 and someone recorded how one Englishman had shouted

311
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
 "Good and Morgan" at dawn,

312
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,720
 presumably the only two words he knew,

313
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,000
 and then the German guy on the other side had responded

314
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,320
 and said hello in English,

315
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,160
 and then they started exchanging some kind of fun insults,

316
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
 and they'd ended by saying the English guy said,

317
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,560
 "Waiter!"

318
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,600
 And the German guy said, coming sir.

319
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,440
 So...

320
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
 - Ah, ah.

321
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,160
 - The war so nearly tipped over into banter,

322
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,320
 and it would have...

323
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,600
 We could have avoided hundreds of thousands of deaths.

324
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
 - Yeah.

325
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,440
 - Yeah. - The trenches were really interesting

326
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
 because the British ones were made

327
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,560
 as if it was gonna be quite temporary,

328
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,760
 that's what they thought,

329
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,760
 and the Germans thought we might be here for a while.

330
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,680
 And so their trenches, they had doorbells?

331
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
 - No. - Yep.

332
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,560
 They had staircases, electric lights, steel doors,

333
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,840
 real kitchens, and wallpaper.

334
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,160
 - Wallpaper?

335
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,400
 - No, wallpaper on the trenches, yeah.

336
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,040
 - The doorbell is a especially impressive thing,

337
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,840
 'cause obviously when the British go over the top

338
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,160
 and arrive, they'll have to wait after ringing the doorbell.

339
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,040
 - Very clever.

340
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,840
 - But they were.

341
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,360
 I just recently read All Quiet on the Western Fund,

342
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,600
 which is an uplifting read if you haven't been there yet,

343
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,760
 but about the First World War.

344
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,800
 And the constant chat among the German troops

345
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,680
 was how their stuff was better than the Allies.

346
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
 - That's cool.

347
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,840
 And there's kind of a history of yelling and shouting in wars.

348
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,040
 The Georgian hero, Tariel,

349
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,640
 was apparently able to drop opposing warriors

350
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,480
 using only the force of his mighty war cry.

351
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,280
 - Okay.

352
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,280
 And in Welsh mythology, their hero, Colhwook,

353
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,720
 he was said to be able to give a battle cry so loud

354
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,160
 and violent that all women in the courts

355
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,760
 would become sterile.

356
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
 - Oh.

357
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
 - Whoa.

358
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,960
 - He must have been a really popular guy in party zone.

359
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,760
 I thought you were going, I was wondering where you were going.

360
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,320
 And I thought you were going to say pregnant.

361
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,800
 - No, it sounds like it would be that, doesn't it?

362
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
 - Yeah, exactly the opposite, actually.

363
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
 - Yes.

364
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,200
 - Really?

365
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,360
 - Yes.

366
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,560
 - A sobering thought.

367
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,200
 I have another fact about life in the trenches.

368
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,040
 - Okay.

369
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,600
 - And sort of agreements between the two sides in the trenches.

370
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,360
 So there was a guy in the First World War, British officer,

371
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,800
 Captain Robert Campbell.

372
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,640
 He got captured by the Germans,

373
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,320
 I think after the Battle of Mons.

374
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,520
 And after nearly two years in prison,

375
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,040
 in a German prisoner of war camp,

376
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,640
 he heard his mother was dying and he wrote to the Kaiser,

377
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,520
 you know, asking to be released to go and be with his dying mother.

378
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,280
 Incredibly, the request was granted.

379
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,160
 He was given two weeks leave from a prisoner of war camp

380
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,960
 on the German side to go back to England,

381
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,920
 visit his mother on the understanding

382
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,800
 that he would then go back and go to prison again.

383
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
 And he did.

384
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,920
 He visited his mother.

385
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,880
 He spent time with her in the last days of her life.

386
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,760
 And he then honored the agreement and returned.

387
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,360
 And then the next day, he's like,

388
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,720
 "Oh, my dad's sick now."

389
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,800
 And that's the only time that happened in the whole of the war.

390
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,880
 Well, because didn't the Allies then...

391
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
 So there was a German prisoner of war

392
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,000
 with the Allies who tried it, I think, because that had happened.

393
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I'm really.

394
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,080
 And the Allies did not let him go.

395
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,120
 And then they said, "No, we didn't trust you."

396
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,440
 And so then it was clamped down on.

397
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,880
 So yeah, he didn't, the only one.

398
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,960
 Wow, it's so weird, though.

399
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,600
 I think these insults mean a lot to military

400
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,520
 when they're doing it to each other.

401
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,160
 Because it still goes on to this day.

402
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,960
 And a few years back, there was a big moment

403
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,440
 between North Korea and the Americans.

404
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,240
 The North Korean soldiers were seeing American soldiers

405
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,680
 pointed them, make strange noises.

406
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,680
 They were pulling disgusting facial expressions at them.

407
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,000
 And this was their big problem with them.

408
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,720
 And the Americans said, "We wouldn't do this."

409
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
 And this is how important that is

410
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,800
 in the follow-up bit to the statement

411
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,400
 of them going, "They're pulling faces at us.

412
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,040
 They're pointing at us really weirdly."

413
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,080
 They said, "Oh, also, they're aiming their guns at us."

414
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,480
 That's like the second thing on the list.

415
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,000
 And then just to prove how childish it is,

416
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,520
 the statement warned US troops to stop the hooliganism

417
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,040
 or face dogs' death anytime, any place.

418
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,080
 [LAUGHTER]

419
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,520
 Like, it's all it is, it's like banter wars, isn't it?

420
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,240
 That reminds me of, is it in that book,

421
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,640
 or did we cut it in Bhutan?

422
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,560
 It's in the book, yeah.

423
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,880
 So in Bhutan, there was a battle.

424
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,720
 It wasn't a battle.

425
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,400
 It was an argument between India and China.

426
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,720
 And they went kind of arguing of this tiny bit of Bhutan.

427
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,680
 And if they went to war, it would have been something

428
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,600
 like a quarter of the world's population would have gone to war.

429
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,040
 And they all went to this tiny bit of Bhutan,

430
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
 but they decided they'd not have one really wanted to have a war.

431
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,360
 And so no one brought any weapons.

432
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,720
 And you can see videos of it.

433
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,840
 And it's just basically some Chinese soldiers

434
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,160
 and some Indian soldiers kind of just chest bump in each other.

435
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,000
 Yeah.

436
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,960
 It's incredible.

437
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,920
 Yeah, it's literally-- it's a whole line of army members

438
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,680
 just not fighting, but sort of--

439
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,440
 It's giggling.

440
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
 Yeah.

441
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,600
 I can now tell in Leicester.

442
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,480
 Is that what it's like here?

443
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,680
 You don't know, just go home and have a nice pack of crisps.

444
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,040
 There was a lot of friendliness.

445
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,880
 There's a really good book about World War I

446
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,320
 called Meeting the Enemy, the Human Face of the Great War.

447
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,480
 And even more friendly than that, there

448
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,120
 was one instance where Brits arrived at the psalm.

449
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,960
 And they were expecting they were like,

450
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,040
 we're fighting the enemy, you know, all geared up

451
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,120
 from massive battle, and they arrived.

452
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,840
 And they just found, on a bit of barbed wire, a note.

453
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,440
 And it was from the Germans saying,

454
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
 why don't you send two or three of your guys with some stuff

455
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,400
 you want to trade, and we'll send two or three of ours,

456
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,640
 and we'll swap presents.

457
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,360
 And they met up in the middle of No Man's

458
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,600
 then that first day.

459
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,080
 And they exchanged kind of magazines, and souvenirs,

460
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,040
 and periodicals that they wanted to read.

461
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,840
 And--

462
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,440
 It's amazing having a book club in the middle of a total.

463
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,480
 It really is.

464
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,680
 It's so impressive.

465
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,760
 So we haven't even mentioned the Christmas truce,

466
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,920
 which was a big thing, a sporadic thing,

467
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
 along a lot of the West and Front.

468
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,240
 So I didn't know, though.

469
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,680
 It's stretched not only in the army,

470
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,880
 it's stretched to the other services as well.

471
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,800
 So on Christmas Eve, 1914, the Royal Flying

472
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,840
 Corps flew over a German airfield at Lille,

473
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,040
 and they dropped on the runway a plum pudding.

474
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,000
 And then on Christmas Day, the German Air Force flew over

475
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
 a British airfield, and they dropped a bottle of rum

476
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,080
 to say thank you.

477
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,520
 The Christmas truce, there was one really lovely moment.

478
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,640
 A lot of Germans had been living in the UK before the war.

479
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,800
 And during the Christmas truce, they all went up into No Man's

480
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,480
 Land, and one of the English guides

481
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,720
 realized that one of the German guys was his barber

482
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,480
 who used to cut his hair in Hoban.

483
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,880
 And he said, "I need a haircut."

484
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,640
 And so his Hoban barber cut his hair for him.

485
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,720
 I mean, that was very trusting, isn't it?

486
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,920
 You know, it didn't take part.

487
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,240
 It was an absolute killjoy at the Christmas truce, actually.

488
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,960
 Oh, was it the senior officers or the...?

489
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,640
 Yeah, they didn't, but in particular,

490
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,320
 one soldier on the German side.

491
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,680
 You might be able to guess it was.

492
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,960
 Oh, I can guess.

493
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,280
 Is it the most famous one?

494
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,560
 It's the most famous one.

495
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,320
 Hitler.

496
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,680
 He absolutely was not a fan.

497
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,880
 He hated the Christmas truce.

498
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,080
 Yeah, refused to take part.

499
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,360
 He sat in a strop on his own

500
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,240
 and just said really disapproving things

501
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,760
 like you guys have no sense of honor.

502
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,880
 And this isn't what we should be doing in wartime.

503
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
 Classic Hitler.

504
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,720
 Hey, we should move on to our next factor, right?

505
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,960
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

506
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,480
 And that is my fact.

507
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,120
 My fact this week is this.

508
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
 And I find this so interesting.

509
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,800
 14% of all California's firefighters are in prison.

510
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,920
 Is that amazing?

511
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,080
 What do you mean by that?

512
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,720
 They take people who are in prison, women who are in prison,

513
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,920
 and they say, would you like to sign up for this?

514
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,600
 We'll relocate you to a program whereby you'll

515
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,680
 be a firefighter under the confines.

516
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,440
 But you won't be an actual prison.

517
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,240
 And lots and lots of women have signed up to it.

518
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,680
 So as a result, 14% of their whole firefighting force

519
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,800
 are prisoners who are serving time.

520
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,640
 And then when they're needed, they go in either fight fires

521
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,560
 or they clear paths where fires might happen.

522
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,400
 And--

523
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
 Yeah.

524
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,920
 I mean, it's women on men, isn't it?

525
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,560
 It's women on men.

526
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,540
 At one point, it was 40%, it was 40%, but I think--

527
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,000
 Yeah, no, it's both.

528
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,760
 Lots of men.

529
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,440
 And I don't think they get to do the super fun stuff,

530
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
 like the hosing.

531
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
 They do a lot more clearing, like you said.

532
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,040
 Yeah, some of them do get chainsaws.

533
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,800
 Ooh.

534
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,440
 Yeah, because obviously you need to clear a path in forest.

535
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,040
 Yeah, you can only need a chainsaw to do it.

536
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,520
 Yeah.

537
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
 So yeah.

538
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,360
 And they get paid something like $1 an hour in America.

539
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,880
 But the exchange bit is that they're not

540
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,120
 in a classic prison system.

541
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,520
 And they get days off.

542
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,280
 They're sentenced every time they serve for what they're doing

543
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,640
 with their job as a firefighter.

544
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,400
 But it's only $1 an hour when you're actively fighting a fire.

545
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,960
 Normally, you get paid about $1 a day.

546
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
 But I think there is a certain economy in prisons,

547
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,720
 isn't there?

548
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,760
 And there's a lot of trading that goes on.

549
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,800
 And did you know that they have their own shopping catalogs?

550
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,400
 Well, in prison.

551
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,880
 Yeah.

552
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,680
 So they're in shopping catalogs, at least in America.

553
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,280
 So Gizmodo, the really great website,

554
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,080
 did a series of articles called Lockdown.

555
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,920
 And interview this guy who said that they have a shopping

556
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,880
 catalog of approved items.

557
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,320
 So is anything that you want?

558
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,080
 Really, from TVs to toothbrushes or whatever.

559
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,600
 And what happens is you can pick what you want.

560
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
 And you take it out of the small pay

561
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,560
 that you might have got in prison or your family can buy it.

562
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,800
 And then it gets delivered.

563
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,280
 And then it gets engraved.

564
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,080
 So you get automatically engraved items.

565
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,760
 Because otherwise, all the other prisoners have also

566
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,280
 got the same stuff.

567
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,880
 And so you need to know that it's yours.

568
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,600
 And actually, weirdly, in the YouTube clip

569
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,280
 I was watching of the guy being interviewed,

570
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,720
 he was saying, and this is some of the stuff

571
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,960
 the prisoners have ordered this week.

572
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,440
 And he was opening packages.

573
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,680
 And he opened up a DVD of the series Richie Rich, season 2.

574
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,320
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

575
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,200
 I only know Richie Rich as a film.

576
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,240
 I did too until I had to look into this.

577
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,280
 You're saying they've made a TV series of Richie Rich?

578
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,240
 Yeah, it's the same general thesis.

579
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,320
 Oh, sure.

580
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,520
 That is fantastic.

581
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,600
 Well, I mean, you heard a fact within a fact there.

582
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
 It gets something like 22% on Ross and Tomatoes.

583
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,160
 But you could certainly give it a go.

584
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,520
 But so the thing that really amazed me about this fact

585
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,080
 was, A, that's an amazing percentage

586
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,760
 that are in prison that are working for the firefighters.

587
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,200
 But B, I thought that firefighting was largely

588
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,720
 about fighting fires.

589
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,440
 And it turns out that it's not.

590
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,320
 It turns out that most of the time that firefighters

591
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,800
 spend is doing tasks that the public call for them to do.

592
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,440
 And there was a report from the UK from a few years ago

593
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,280
 that said, we need to stop responding

594
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,400
 to these weird calls that we're getting

595
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,640
 because we just keep wasting our time.

596
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,320
 Between 2009 and 2011, these are the stats.

597
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,080
 1,613 incidents where people were locked out,

598
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,560
 where firefighters had to go and let them back in.

599
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,200
 276 adults called firefighters out

600
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,840
 because they were locked in toilets.

601
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,600
 14 people were locked in cupboards.

602
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,040
 One woman was stuck in a fridge.

603
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,800
 One man was stuck in a freezer.

604
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,920
 And one person was stuck in a recycling bag.

605
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,560
 There's so many ridiculous things that they get called out

606
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,920
 on a day-to-day basis.

607
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,040
 They used to shout as they ran to a fire.

608
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,720
 And this was going on as late as 1901 in America.

609
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,240
 As they went to the fire, they would shout, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

610
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
 Well, they're doing the knee-nails themselves.

611
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,920
 Well, it seems that way, right?

612
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
 Yeah.

613
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,440
 I mean, I kind of worked out what I thought the tune might be.

614
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,480
 It might not have been that.

615
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,000
 OK.

616
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,920
 It might have been hi, hi, hi, hi.

617
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,000
 I don't know.

618
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,320
 But when they decided to replace the shouting

619
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,480
 with a gong, a gong, and they all hated it,

620
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,040
 they were like, no, we like doing the hi, I think.

621
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,880
 Who are you?

622
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,200
 And also, when automatic fire alarms came in,

623
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
 they all hated that as well.

624
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,840
 At the reason being that they had lookouts who

625
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,960
 would look out for the fire.

626
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,080
 And as soon as the automatic fire alarms came in,

627
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,400
 those guys lost their job.

628
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
 Is the robot's taking over the jobs, isn't it?

629
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,440
 That was the start of it.

630
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,240
 It is pretty much.

631
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,800
 And so then the firemen started doing fire alarm

632
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,480
 pranks to set off these fire alarms.

633
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,080
 No.

634
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,120
 Did they?

635
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,600
 Oh, but that's a thing.

636
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,120
 They used to be loads of rival gangs of fire fighters.

637
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,200
 And there's a scene in New York where all the fire fighters

638
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,520
 get in the scrap outside of fire,

639
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,320
 because they all want to be the ones to solve the fire.

640
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,520
 So you know, in Japan firefighters,

641
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,320
 they bring water pumps to the fire.

642
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,280
 But they don't aim the water at the fire.

643
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,640
 They emit it themselves.

644
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,480
 What?

645
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,000
 Oh, yeah.

646
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,920
 So they wet themselves down so they're not flammable.

647
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,960
 And then this was in the Edo period in the 17th century.

648
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,480
 Oh, right.

649
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,000
 Not now.

650
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Yeah.

651
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 No.

652
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,800
 So they would wet themselves down.

653
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,680
 They'd run into the house.

654
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,240
 And then they pulled the house down.

655
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,800
 And that's how they stopped the fires.

656
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 And they used to--

657
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,600
 Smother them, didn't they?

658
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,920
 So they had deliberately very, very thick clothes

659
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,480
 that would weigh, you know, as much as a person when they were wet.

660
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,040
 And they would go up to a fire and just--

661
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,880
 Smother it.

662
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,200
 They'd go up to a smother it.

663
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,720
 They would just jump on it, basically.

664
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,680
 They would be able to get close enough that they could

665
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,640
 puffer it up.

666
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,960
 But amazingly, they were positions of real respect

667
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,160
 in Japan in the Edo period.

668
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,800
 So up until 1868.

669
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,640
 And they used to wear outfits that look like normal firemen

670
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,840
 as outfits on the outside, so they were quite plain.

671
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,760
 But then on the inside of their suits,

672
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,240
 they had unbelievable works of art stitched throughout them.

673
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,960
 And they had stories and everything.

674
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,800
 It was kind of like manga that kind of style.

675
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,040
 And they became really famous.

676
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,120
 And if they were successful and they put out a fire,

677
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
 they all turn their coats inside out.

678
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
 And they paraded through the streets,

679
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,480
 victoriously.

680
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,000
 Wow.

681
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,720
 And they often had their bodies tattooed

682
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,120
 with the designs on their coats, because, you know,

683
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,000
 it was such a mark of, you know, something special.

684
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,160
 And, yeah, and also the stories that were told on the inside

685
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,480
 of their jackets became bestsellers in Japan.

686
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,480
 So the kind of cartoon strips that firefighters had

687
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,760
 became well-known stories that you tell your children.

688
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,080
 There was another thing which, speaking of covering

689
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,160
 yourself completely in water to be going in.

690
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,320
 That was in the early days, one of the things

691
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,160
 with firefighters breathing was very hard.

692
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,200
 And so in order to get into a fire and keep your own breath

693
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,520
 and not suffocate was a hard thing.

694
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,240
 So most firefighters used to have a massive beard.

695
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,960
 The male firefighters, I would go in.

696
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
 And what they would do is they drenched their beard

697
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,120
 into a bucket of water.

698
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,960
 And then they would bite into their beard and hold it

699
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,840
 over their mouth.

700
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,560
 And that's how they would survive the fires,

701
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,080
 because they would have this beard mask

702
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,560
 that stopped the smoke coming through to them.

703
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,200
 Is that true?

704
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,560
 Yeah.

705
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,400
 That's incredible.

706
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,320
 Isn't it true that the guy with the longest beard ever

707
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,000
 died because there was a fire, and he ran out of his house,

708
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,680
 and he forgot to put his beard in this pocket,

709
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,240
 and he tripped over it and fell down the stairs.

710
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,040
 Yes.

711
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,400
 She just wiped it, she just dipped it in the bath before he left.

712
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640
 That doesn't stop you tripping over it.

713
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,920
 If anything, it makes it more rope-like,

714
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,800
 makes it likely that the fire went up.

715
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,840
 Just lock it up.

716
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,240
 Have you guys heard about the firefighting goats of San Francisco?

717
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,000
 No, but I get the feeling we're about to.

718
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,080
 Sure thing.

719
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,040
 San Francisco has firefighting goats.

720
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,800
 That's great.

721
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
 Right, moving on.

722
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,960
 Time for fact number four.

723
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,120
 And...

724
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,360
 Do you want to say it?

725
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,760
 Yes, sure.

726
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,080
 Well, they're kind of pre-firefighting goats.

727
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,760
 So they're let loose around San Francisco to eat bits of dry scrublin

728
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,320
 that would otherwise be a massive fire risk.

729
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,120
 Oh, that's clever.

730
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,280
 But they've been introduced, and it's helped massively

731
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,640
 with the problems of fire-breaking out in the summer.

732
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
 That's really clever.

733
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,800
 It's not as kind of rock 'n' roll when you explain it.

734
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,320
 When the goat goes home to his wife, and he's like,

735
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,560
 "I'm a firefighter."

736
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,880
 "What'd you do today, darling?"

737
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,000
 I just ate some more grass.

738
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,960
 It was really nice.

739
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
 Save some lives.

740
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,240
 Should we move on to our final thoughts?

741
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,640
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

742
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,240
 And that is Andy.

743
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,920
 My fact is that mere cats can turn their bottoms inside out.

744
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,680
 So do they do it on purpose?

745
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,520
 They do do it on purpose.

746
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,680
 They do it to socialise.

747
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,960
 So...

748
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,280
 They've all got a party trick,

749
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,240
 and it's all turning their bottoms inside out.

750
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,480
 So they have what's called an anal pouch.

751
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,040
 And it's under their tails.

752
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,000
 And they produce this kind of paste inside it.

753
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,160
 And it's nature.

754
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,360
 You can't go, "It's nature."

755
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,760
 And they smear it on plants and rocks

756
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,480
 to mark territory as their own.

757
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,000
 And they even sometimes smear it on other mere cats.

758
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,920
 I read that this paste comes out of them a lot like

759
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,160
 when Play Doe is extruded from one of those doll's heads.

760
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,840
 I believe so, yeah.

761
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,040
 From a doll's head?

762
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,480
 Yeah, you know those things, you remember.

763
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,960
 It was like an old kind of tie

764
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,000
 from there, probably you're too young, I guess.

765
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,040
 But you used to have Play Doe, and you used to squeeze it,

766
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,160
 and then you had these little dolls,

767
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,240
 and it would come out their hair and their hair would end up looking like that.

768
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,800
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

769
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,160
 And scientists do squeeze it, didn't they?

770
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,800
 So when they're trying to study the makeup of this paste,

771
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,520
 that's how they get it when they've extruded their pouches.

772
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,800
 The scientists literally grab it, and they squeeze it,

773
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,080
 and you can actually get it out like that.

774
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,000
 Yeah, that, I think, is a worse job than being the crisp.

775
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
 A tester at walkers hanging outside a mere cat's nest

776
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,560
 with a cotton bud just waiting.

777
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,080
 But this came to light, I think, probably,

778
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,400
 and you read this, they've done a new study

779
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,640
 about the bacteria in myocard bottoms.

780
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,400
 Yeah.

781
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,760
 And they've found that it's the bacteria that

782
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,040
 makes up this, the different smells, which

783
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,240
 means they can kind of say whose anal paste it is.

784
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,800
 Yeah, so the smell comes not from the myocard,

785
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,080
 it comes from the bacteria.

786
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,320
 But the myocards use the bacteria to judge what's going on,

787
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,160
 so they swapped these anal pouches to get the bacteria.

788
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,600
 And I read an article in popular science,

789
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,040
 and they were talking about these guys who

790
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,720
 were doing the swabbing, and they said,

791
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,600
 these pouches are wide open.

792
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,280
 They're almost asking to be swabbed.

793
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,360
 [LAUGHTER]

794
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,200
 So myocards are kind of bastards, aren't they?

795
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,720
 Sure.

796
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
 Yeah, mostly.

797
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,240
 Yeah, they really are.

798
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,000
 They've actually did a study recently

799
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,720
 looking at the most murderous mammals.

800
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,680
 And myocards came out on top, and they're

801
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,520
 looking at how many of their deaths are caused by members

802
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
 of their own species.

803
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,640
 And with myocards, it's 20%.

804
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,640
 So the 20% of myocard deaths are caused by other myocards.

805
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,320
 Which is amazing.

806
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,480
 They're always killing each other.

807
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,960
 They kill their own babies.

808
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,800
 They kill their mate's babies.

809
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,640
 Wow.

810
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,560
 I love killing babies.

811
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,760
 And I read that study as well.

812
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,840
 And it also said that sea lions are more murderous

813
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
 than actual lions.

814
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,440
 Oh, wow.

815
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,840
 That's quite a good fact, isn't it?

816
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,120
 And humans are not very murderous, how

817
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,560
 are we according to what we should be?

818
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,000
 Apparently, we should be about 200 times more murderous

819
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,320
 than we actually are.

820
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,880
 Should be going to the rules laid out 100 million years ago,

821
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,280
 pinned to a tree.

822
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,240
 That's really nice that we've kind of mastered our worst

823
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,760
 instincts.

824
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,560
 Yeah, it kind of goes off a few times when this wasn't shit.

825
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,120
 Sometimes they when they're fighting,

826
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,400
 they latch on to their enemy.

827
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,160
 So I think basically the tension in myocard colonies,

828
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,600
 it's caused by the fact that they'll

829
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,280
 have colonies of 50 myocards.

830
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,720
 And there's basically one mating couple, isn't there?

831
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,400
 And no one else is really allowed to have kids.

832
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,320
 And if someone else has kids, then the lead couple

833
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
 kills those kids.

834
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,440
 And also, who's the dominant couple?

835
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,000
 It's all decided on based on the size and their weight

836
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,120
 and their age.

837
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,400
 And so everyone's always looking at each other

838
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,440
 and working out who's going to be bigger,

839
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,040
 who's going to be the next in line.

840
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,480
 And they are literally, as one article pointed out,

841
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,320
 all the myocards are comparing the myocards.

842
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,240
 That's what they're doing.

843
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,320
 [LAUGHTER]

844
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:09,960
 That's very good.

845
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,320
 Because of me.

846
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,480
 Just on compare the myocard.

847
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,360
 Did you know that in 2010, remember the lead myocard?

848
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,680
 Oh, love.

849
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,520
 Sure.

850
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,000
 He released an autobiography that year.

851
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,120
 Do you remember?

852
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,200
 No, I don't remember.

853
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,920
 No, you should have.

854
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,360
 Because it was one of the biggest selling books of that year.

855
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,760
 That was the year that Tony Blair released his memoirs.

856
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,280
 And they were more--

857
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,160
 I do remember that one.

858
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,680
 Yeah.

859
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,040
 There were more pre-orders on the myocards book.

860
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,760
 Then there were on Tony Blair's memoirs.

861
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,520
 Russell Brands' book on David Beckham's book,

862
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,000
 then Cheryl Coles' book.

863
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,760
 This guy outsold everyone.

864
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,560
 No way.

865
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,360
 Yeah.

866
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
 Did you have any big reveals?

867
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,280
 No.

868
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,880
 The fortune.

869
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,640
 Yeah, he started the Iraq war.

870
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,240
 Yes, yeah.

871
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,320
 I knew it.

872
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,000
 But no, actually, I read, here's one odd reveal.

873
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,840
 It's not in the book.

874
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
 The voice of the myocards is--

875
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,880
 and this is very niche, but this is for anyone

876
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,400
 who's watched Alan Partridge, the second series of Alan Partridge

877
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,440
 when he's staying in the hotel.

878
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,200
 It's the guy who fixes everything.

879
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,080
 You know that guy?

880
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,600
 Michael?

881
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,120
 Yeah.

882
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
 Michael is the voice--

883
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,360
 Michael, the Jordy ex-soldier guy.

884
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,600
 Yes, yeah.

885
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,880
 He's the voice of--

886
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,600
 I was watching Alan Partridge this afternoon.

887
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,240
 So this is an amazing fact for me.

888
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,560
 You were saying about comparing the myocards.

889
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,640
 This study, I think, you were talking about.

890
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,360
 It's a guy called Clutton Brock.

891
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,480
 And he did these experiments where they fed extra food

892
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,200
 to some of the myocards that were the main myocards.

893
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,480
 And when they got fatter, the main myocards got fatter as well.

894
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,160
 And so they found that basically, when

895
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,720
 you're comparing with the other myocards,

896
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,960
 if someone gets bigger than you, you immediately

897
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,200
 eat a load of pizza or whatever they eat

898
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,720
 and then just try and get bigger than them.

899
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,480
 Because you always want to be the biggest one.

900
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,680
 Because it's the biggest one who's the most important.

901
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,180
 Oh, yeah.

902
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,520
 So you're always looking around and it's

903
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,720
 going, oh, he's looking--

904
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,840
 Barry's looking a bit fat.

905
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,040
 [LAUGHTER]

906
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,200
 I think someone compared it to something that gobyfish do,

907
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,920
 which is almost the opposite, but it's quite interesting,

908
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
 is that gobyfish go on diets.

909
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,000
 And it's for the same kind of peer pressure reasons,

910
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,440
 like the biggest gobyfish is the one who's dominant.

911
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,160
 And they don't want to cause conflict.

912
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,360
 And so if they see a big gobyfish,

913
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,440
 they make themselves less big.

914
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,400
 They eat a bit less.

915
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,760
 Because they're like, oh, I don't want to start a fight with that guy.

916
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,200
 I'll just go on a little diet.

917
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,440
 Be small.

918
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
 Which is quite sweet, isn't it?

919
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,380
 That's good.

920
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,960
 But meocards are much more up in your face.

921
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,720
 If you're going to get big, I'm going to get big.

922
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,960
 I'll race you to the top kind of attitude.

923
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,240
 Yep, true.

924
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,320
 And meocats, when they sleep, it's quite interesting what they do.

925
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,520
 They pile on top of one another to keep warm.

926
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
 Adorable.

927
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,020
 Yeah.

928
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,040
 So like, in summer, when it's hotter,

929
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,400
 they kind of spread out a lot.

930
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,480
 And in winter, when it's cold, they kind of grab another meocat

931
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,040
 on top that they kind of snuggle in.

932
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,240
 Quickly murder them.

933
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,680
 [LAUGHTER]

934
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,840
 They all have meocat rugs in their homes.

935
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,360
 [LAUGHTER]

936
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,040
 I had some stuff on anuses, if that's--

937
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,440
 Yes.

938
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,840
 So this fact is about they can turn their bottoms inside out.

939
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,600
 I didn't realize I was reading a BBC article apparently

940
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,080
 to chart the evolution in history of anuses

941
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,680
 is really hard because a lot of species have a bum.

942
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,840
 And then they suddenly don't have a bum.

943
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,000
 And then they have a bum again.

944
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,440
 And so there's this like missing link of anuses that--

945
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
 All right.

946
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,720
 Yes, you can't through the fossils chart it properly,

947
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,440
 because suddenly it's just out of nowhere, no bum.

948
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,960
 And then thousands of years later,

949
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,440
 suddenly there's a bum again.

950
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,600
 That's so odd.

951
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,120
 Do we have examples of--

952
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,400
 Well, there's no bummed-then-unbummed creatures.

953
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,560
 I can't remember any, but there is a thing called having

954
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,680
 a transient anus.

955
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,840
 A transient anus?

956
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
 Yes.

957
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,340
 Yeah.

958
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,440
 But I think I might be in the lifetime of an individual.

959
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,120
 You have a bum, and then you don't have a bum.

960
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,600
 Exactly.

961
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,800
 No, that's a very short-term example of the long-term thing.

962
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
 That's what I was mentioning.

963
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,240
 So we've covered the sea cucumber before, which is a little--

964
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,480
 It's not a cucumber, but it does live in the sea.

965
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,320
 What is it?

966
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,040
 It's a kind of fishy organism.

967
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,960
 It's not a fish.

968
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,400
 They're really weird.

969
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,720
 They look like odd cucumbers underwater.

970
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,280
 But we've said before, they can self-avisorate

971
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,960
 when they're threatened by a predator.

972
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,920
 They distract the predator by squirting their own intestines

973
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,760
 out of themselves, and that distracts the predator,

974
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,480
 because he thinks, what's this?

975
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,280
 And then they slowly leave.

976
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,600
 But the other incredible thing is, they

977
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,200
 can turn solid or mushy on command, on self-command.

978
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,280
 So they can turn their body into a mush,

979
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,400
 and then climb through a tiny crack,

980
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,840
 and then resellify into lumps, so they can't be got out

981
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,320
 through the crack by a predator.

982
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,840
 Wow.

983
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,920
 Then nuts.

984
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,520
 They're so nuts.

985
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,600
 And then it's not only for self-defense

986
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,840
 that they self-avisorate, it's a seasonal thing.

987
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,520
 In autumn, they just re-absorb all their intestines

988
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,880
 into their body, and they just become a solid lump of flesh,

989
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 basically.

990
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,040
 So fishermen in the Caribbean, they harvest them in October,

991
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,840
 because they know they're not going to have to gut them,

992
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,360
 because they have no guts anymore.

993
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,200
 Oh, wow.

994
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
 Yeah.

995
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,040
 And then in spring, they regrow all their organs,

996
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
 and they continue like that.

997
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
 That's insane.

998
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,520
 They're so weird.

999
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,280
 The one thing I know about the anus of a sea cucumber

1000
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,920
 is that there's a fish that lives in there, isn't there?

1001
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,000
 It's called a slender pearl fish.

1002
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,320
 It lives inside the anus of a sea cucumber.

1003
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,240
 And the funny thing about them is whenever

1004
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,360
 they want to go into a sea cucumber's anus,

1005
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,200
 they kind of do a little knock on the anus,

1006
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,680
 and the anus opens up.

1007
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,520
 Oh, my god.

1008
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,320
 Like they're entering a German trench, you'll see.

1009
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,920
 Really?

1010
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,120
 And is it a secret knock, or is it just a normal one?

1011
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,360
 Oh, you think it's like, yeah.

1012
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,080
 It's the pearl fish again.

1013
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,720
 What a slang term for the anus, by the way,

1014
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,200
 to German trench.

1015
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,160
 That we kind of just over there.

1016
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,280
 Guys, we need to wrap up.

1017
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,040
 Do you have anything before we do?

1018
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,720
 There are a dragonfire larvae, each via its anus.

1019
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,080
 What they do, this is really cool.

1020
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,440
 They draw water in through the anus.

1021
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,960
 They clench, and then they compress the abdomen,

1022
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,840
 and their muscles in their thorax,

1023
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,120
 against the water filled in their rectum.

1024
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,080
 And then they can raise the pressure in their body,

1025
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,920
 and it fires out their mouth, and then they can eat.

1026
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,760
 What?

1027
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,320
 And that call, you're drawing water in your squeezing,

1028
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,080
 and then your mouth comes out and you eat.

1029
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,160
 Wow.

1030
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,520
 That's so awesome.

1031
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,120
 What?

1032
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,360
 I'm glad I don't do that.

1033
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,880
 But I'm happy that someone else has found me better to do that.

1034
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,080
 Was that on blue planet?

1035
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,520
 Or is it on brown planet, actually?

1036
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,480
 OK, that's it.

1037
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,880
 That is all of our facts.

1038
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,280
 Thank you so much for listening.

1039
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,320

1043
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,520
 I'm on @Sribeland, Andy.

1044
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,040
 @AndruhondaM, James.

1045
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,120
 @JamesHarkin, and Chazinski.

 You can email podcast@QI.com.

1047
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,440
 Yep, or you can go to our group account, which is @nosuchthing,

1048
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,880
 or you can go to our website.

1049
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,480
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com, where we have all of our previous episodes.

1050
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,560
 We have a link as well to our book, which is out now,

1051
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,720
 and guys at the end of the show, we're going to be out there.

1052
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,560
 We've got a bunch of copies.

1053
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,960
 So if you want to buy a copy and say hi,

1054
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,240
 we can sign it for you for Christmas or whatever.

1055
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,040
 And we have pre-signed copies as well.

1056
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,840
 If you can't be up, ask to line up, or if you don't want to speak to us.

1057
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
 Yeah.

1058
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
 You actively dislike us.

1059
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
 Or you can just go home.

1060
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
 Or you can just go home.

1061
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
 You don't need to.

1062
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
 We can't force you.

1063
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
 Yeah.

1064
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,440
 And we're going to end this show, aren't we?

1065
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
 With a fact.

1066
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
 Yes.

1067
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,040
 We have a fact that you guys sent in at the beginning of this show.

1068
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,240
 And we're going to give away one of our books to one of you.

1069
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
 And Anna, you have that fact?

1070
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
 Yep.

1071
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
 So this is our favorite fact that you guys sent in.

1072
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,040
 And it's from--

1073
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,240
 I don't know if I can read my own writing.

1074
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,640
 But Victor, Jaganathan.

1075
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,640
 Are you in?

1076
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
 You in?

1077
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
 Yes.

1078
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
 Starts a good fact.

1079
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,040
 So this fact is that guide runners for site-impaired runners

1080
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,800
 can't use elasticated tethers at the Paralympics anymore.

1081
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,640
 After the Chinese started catapulting their runners across

1082
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,240
 the finish line at the last minute.

1083
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
 [APPLAUSE]

1084
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 That's amazing.

1085
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,240
 [APPLAUSE]

1086
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,040
 Awesome.

1087
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
 We'll be out the back, guys.

1088
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,440
 Thank you so much for coming.

1089
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
 We'll see you later, guys.

1090
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
 Thank you.

1091
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
 Bye.
