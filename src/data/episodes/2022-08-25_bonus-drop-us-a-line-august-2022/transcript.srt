00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,380
 Hello you lovely club fish members, welcome to your bi-weekly piece of bonus material.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,120
 Now does bi-weekly mean twice a week?

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,440
 If it does, maybe I should have said fortnightly.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,600
 Anyway, it is another episode of Andrew Hunter Murray's Drop As Align.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,880
 He spent days reading a backlog of emails and he has found a whole load of correspondence

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,520
 which he would like us to comment on.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,880
 I really hope you enjoy this.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,620
 We really do enjoy making these.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,480
 It's so much fun to hear all of your amazing facts and corrections.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,380
 Anyway, for the time being, on with the Drop As Align!

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:54,040
 Hi everybody, welcome back to Drop As Align.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,320
 The bit of fish, the bit of club fish specifically, where we talk about all the correspondence

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,560
 you've sent in, all the emails, the letters, the scrolls, the rolled up papyri, all of

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 it.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
 Everything you guys have sent in.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,240
 Guys, what would you like, first of all, I'm going to say...

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
 Perhaps has anyone sent us in a better name for the show?

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,640
 No, we've had a few complaints about the name where people have said club fish sounds like

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,960
 an instruction or it sounds like a club seal thing.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,680
 Yeah, yeah, it does remind me of that's why I liked it.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,240
 Yeah, no concrete better suggestions.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,280
 Okay, well we've got plenty of weeks.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
 Keep them coming.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,320
 Can I quickly ask, you just said papyri, is that the, are we in a Panino-Panini situation

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
 without any controversy?

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
 I don't know.

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
 Is that multiple papyrus?

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,080
 I don't think people say papyrus is often enough for it to be a hot button topic.

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,840
 I think that when people are pluralizing papyrus, I would say the vast majority say papyri because

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,000
 I think they're usually sort of Egyptologists or the like who are going to do it the proper

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 way.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 That's fair enough.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Good.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 New word I'd never heard before, so that's exciting.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,880
 Papyrus, maybe I would have said.

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,360
 Any Egyptologist listening, we know there probably are one or two of you.

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,720
 There's only one village left in Egypt that makes papyri in the correct way.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
 That's just a fact.

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
 Really?

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,360
 It's not a funny fact, which is why I've never suggested it for the show.

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
 No, it's good.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
 I think usually when you say a non-funny fact, you always end it by saying that's just a

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
 fact.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
 Yeah.

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
 You let us know straight away.

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
 Yeah.

47
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
 It's getting your defense in early, isn't it?

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 Yeah, it really is.

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,320
 I like that awkward pause at the end of the fact where people just go, "Ah."

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
 Yeah.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,000
 And it's good because you're allowing me to know that I don't have to fake laugh, which

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,880
 I'll often do to make it seem like I understood the joke when I did.

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
 Papyrus.

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
 Yeah.

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
 Thank you.

56
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,200
 Well, we could start off with a brilliant bit of correspondence that we had, which was

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,160
 actually George Eliot based.

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
 Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
 Yeah.

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,520
 This is from Hannah Stopple, who writes this, "Hello, love the podcast.

61
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,680
 I work at a company that makes handmade wigs.

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,280
 We were listening to the most recent episode of your podcast, and we all burst out laughing

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,560
 when you said the measurement of George Eliot's large head, 22.25 inches is an extremely average

64
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,520
 size head, very average for a woman, somewhat, but not unusually small for a man.

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,280
 In our experience, women's heads tend to run 25 to 23 inches, men's more commonly 22 to

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
 25."

67
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
 Interesting.

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 "I don't pretend to be an expert on historical head sizes," Hannah goes on, "and average

69
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,920
 is certainly may have changed over the past 150 years, but I thought you might be interested

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,440
 to know that you caused a moment of unintended and very specific extra hilarity over here

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
 on the other side of the pond."

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,040
 God, life at a wigmaker's place is a laugh of a minute, isn't it?

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 It was hell to pay.

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
 Oh, gosh.

75
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
 Oh, nice.

76
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
 Nice.

77
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,840
 I think in our defense, Hannah, we all thought that was a completely ridiculous fact at the

78
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
 time.

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
 What?

80
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,240
 A courtesy of Dan just trying to call back to the large hand issue.

81
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
 Untrue.

82
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
 How dare you?

83
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,680
 I think in the podcast, we might have said it wasn't that big, was it?

84
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,520
 I think we said that it was two and a half inches smaller than my head.

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
 Yeah.

86
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
 Yeah.

87
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,480
 The point, though, is that it was seen as big to the point where he took her to London.

88
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,040
 Like, it's not like she just randomly in a diary said, "Oh, I'm in my big head."

89
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,820
 Like, he got her on a train, he brought her to London.

90
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,820
 They measured it.

91
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,820
 They had her molded.

92
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
 They had to get an extra seat.

93
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,160
 They had to take the carriage door off its hinges, actually, they had to get in.

94
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
 Yeah.

95
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,320
 Isn't it true that everyone in those days had a much smaller head?

96
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 There we go.

97
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
 Half the size.

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
 That's what Hannah said.

99
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
 Yeah.

100
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
 Yeah.

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
 I don't pretend to be an expert on historical head sizes.

102
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,960
 But anyway, Hannah is the build manager at the Custom Wig Company.

103
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,920
 So if you want to go to the customwigcompany.com for all your wig needs.

104
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
 Great.

105
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
 You know.

106
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
 We'll take some wigs.

107
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
 If Hannah wants to send us some wigs.

108
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
 Yeah.

109
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,720
 Well, I was actually trying to get the firm more custom rather than actively soak up

110
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
 their resources.

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,400
 I was just reading the other day about hairdressers who double up as archaeologists and they look

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
 at hairstyles.

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
 Yeah.

114
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
 Not many of them are.

115
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,920
 Well, we, James and I know Joanne Fletcher, who comes from a family of hairdressers and

116
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,800
 then she discovered the oldest headlice, like literally on a mummy.

117
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
 She found the oldest.

118
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
 But isn't she an archaeologist?

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
 She is an archaeologist.

120
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 She's not a hairdresser.

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,960
 My point is that there's a lady who I was reading about who's a hairdresser, but she

122
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,200
 looks into the hairstyles of history and she recreates them to show because in a lot

123
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,040
 of cases we thought they were wearing wigs in certain cultures because how can you hold

124
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,000
 your hair in such positions?

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
 She works out how they did it.

126
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
 She works out the styling.

127
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,080
 So she uncovers the sort of hidden mysteries of, of hairstyles and she's a hairdresser

128
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
 by day.

129
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,640
 I'm going to say Indiana Bangs.

130
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
 Are you going to say that?

131
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,480
 Because Bangs is a, is a, it's a friend, isn't it?

132
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,280
 But it doesn't sound like Indiana Jones.

133
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,440
 Friends, Indiana Jones would be, that's great.

134
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 There we go.

135
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,120
 Well, by iteration, we've made our way to a good joke, haven't we?

136
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
 You were the bridge.

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
 You laid yourself down.

138
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,360
 We wouldn't have made it there if I hadn't, you know, said mine.

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
 Yeah.

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
 True.

141
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
 Yeah.

142
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,200
 Were you, were you thinking, were you thinking of saying for Indiana Jones?

143
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 No, I wasn't.

144
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
 No, I wasn't.

145
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
 No, I wasn't.

146
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,880
 You always need one person in any meeting to just talk utter, utter nonsense.

147
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,240
 There are no bad ideas.

148
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
 Yeah.

149
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,360
 I'm not even happy we ended up at Fringiana Jones.

150
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,280
 I wouldn't say that it's a particularly good place.

151
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,480
 You're welcome to go straight further, Anna.

152
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,240
 I'm reversing back over Indiana Bangs and getting out of the forest.

153
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
 Do you want to hear from someone else?

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
 I think.

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
 I'll be better.

156
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
 People of true did.

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
 It can't be just that.

158
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
 I think what happened here, I mean, I might be wrong about this.

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,840
 But are you aware of, I think it's a cartoon about a dog archaeologist called Indiana

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
 Bones?

161
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
 Indiana Bones.

162
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
 And you are.

163
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
 And what you thought is that Bones sounds a bit like Bangs because it's got a B and

164
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
 an S and an N effect.

165
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,760
 And you've made that leap, but didn't tell anyone that you'd used the cartoon as part

166
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
 of your leap.

167
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,560
 It's like, that is exactly what I was thinking, Indiana Bones.

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,440
 And it's kind of how a joke is like a, they always say a joke is like a horse jumping

169
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,200
 over a gap, like a canyon or whatever.

170
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,140
 And if the canyon is too narrow, no one is impressed by the leap.

171
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,320
 But if the canyon is too wide, the horse falls in and your jokes are pretty much the Grand

172
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 Canyon of jokes.

173
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,320
 There are corpses littering.

174
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
 Horses everywhere.

175
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
 Anyway.

176
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 Okay.

177
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
 Let's plow on.

178
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 Let's plow on.

179
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
 So who do you want to hear from next?

180
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,760
 Kate Matthews or Elizabeth Vison?

181
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
 There's not much to go off.

182
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
 Yeah.

183
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
 Give us a bit more.

184
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
 That's just.

185
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
 No, that's all I'm giving you.

186
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
 Okay.

187
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,160
 I've not heard Vison as a name before.

188
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
 Okay.

189
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
 He's did that on purpose.

190
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,540
 He gave you one relatively normal name and one unusual name and you, you would go for

191
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,540
 that.

192
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,540
 Who's the other one?

193
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
 Kate Matthews.

194
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
 Yeah.

195
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
 Kate, please.

196
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
 Okay.

197
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,620
 So easily changed.

198
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
 This was a fact we did.

199
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,180
 Oh, it was about radioactivity in some way.

200
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,300
 Kate Matthews writes following on from the urine fact from Friday show, that was it.

201
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,860
 I thought you might be interested to know after patients have had an isotope bone scan in

202
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,400
 the radiology department, their urine and feces is radioactive and they have to use a designated

203
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,960
 radioactive materials toilet in the department.

204
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,800
 And if they're an inpatient, the ward have to collect their waste and dispose of it in

205
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
 a special bin.

206
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,240
 So when you walk out, you go, I'd give that another couple of hundred thousand years if

207
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
 I knew.

208
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
 This is amazing.

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:05,280
 She goes on, I used to work in radiology and a patient once used one of the regular toilets

210
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,140
 and had terrible aim because there was radioactive pee everywhere, the toilet had to be closed

211
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,700
 off and quarantined and then tested daily with a Geiger counter until it was safe again.

212
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
 That's really funny.

213
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
 That's incredible.

214
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
 That's great.

215
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
 That's really cool.

216
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,700
 Thank you so much, Kate.

217
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
 So do all hospitals have this?

218
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,540
 Or no, like most of them don't have this kind of.

219
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,860
 I guess if you've got this kind of treatment happening, an isotope bone scan, she says

220
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,560
 the injector radioactive isotope intravenously that makes any cells that are suspicious glow

221
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,720
 and the body excretes the isotopes, but they remain radioactive for a while.

222
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 That's the incredible fact.

223
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,420
 It's the one that makes you feel like you've wet yourself when you have it injected with

224
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
 you.

225
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,120
 You know, there's one that like lots of people have it whenever you've had cancer, you get

226
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,840
 it injected and then it makes cells glow if they've got cancer and it makes you and

227
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,120
 you feel when they inject it, you feel like you've wet yourself and they always say beforehand

228
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,840
 you'll feel like you've wet yourself and then I was looking to someone, I know recently

229
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 she was like, yeah, it was really weird.

230
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
 You feel like you've wet yourself.

231
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,080
 But I think that's that.

232
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,120
 But this person I know definitely didn't go and use a toilet and a bunker after that.

233
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,040
 So I'm a bit worried for my health.

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,420
 I got a bit of correspondence this week.

235
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
 Wow.

236
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,420
 I see.

237
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
 Well, the 30, the five already.

238
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
 Yeah.

239
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
 The steering wheel.

240
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,760
 I feel it's been rested from my grasp.

241
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,860
 This was from a fact on the show.

242
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,980
 I love it when facts get in contact with us.

243
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,360
 So I got a message saying, hey, Shriverland, would you be interested in retweeting this?

244
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,760
 It's another charity auction for the Samsung Apple business card.

245
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,880
 Now we did a fact on the show, which is that Apple used to have an employee called Sam

246
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,760
 Sung and he had a business card and he was auctioning it.

247
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,800
 Well, Sam Sung worked in two different places and he's just found his other Samsung card

248
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,440
 with his t-shirt from it.

249
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,680
 And this tweet is from Sam Sung.

250
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
 Wow.

251
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,820
 He's got in contact directly saying, I'm now auctioning it.

252
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,060
 Here's the auction and it's up on eBay if anyone wants to get involved in it.

253
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,420
 It ends in five days and seven hours.

254
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
 So after this has gone out?

255
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,420
 Yep.

256
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,820
 So after this has gone out, it's currently on 24 bids, $485 at the moment.

257
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,260
 So anyone who wants to get involved, you can't.

258
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,260
 Cool.

259
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,380
 Did you retweet it or have you just done this quite useless service to paroled Sam?

260
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,700
 I thought I'd save it for the show.

261
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
 Yeah.

262
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
 Okay.

263
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
 I might give a retweet.

264
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,640
 But that's quite cool.

265
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,600
 Sam Sung is now in contact with us.

266
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
 He's changed his name.

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 Which is weird.

268
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 What?

269
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 Are you sure it's him?

270
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,520
 His Twitter is Sam Struan, S-T-R-U-A-N, brackets, formerly Sam Sung.

271
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
 Oh, interesting.

272
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
 Yeah.

273
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
 He's changed his name.

274
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
 He's changed his name.

275
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
 I've got a friend of a friend called Struan.

276
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
 It's an unusual name.

277
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
 Hmm.

278
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
 First name.

279
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
 Did he change it?

280
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
 Because he was getting so much bullying for the Samsung thing.

281
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
 Possibly.

282
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
 Yeah.

283
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
 Possibly.

284
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
 Well, I'll tweet him.

285
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
 He's changed his name to Sam Struan.

286
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
 Yeah.

287
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,520
 I thought you were going to say he changed his name to Sam Blackberry or something.

288
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
 Yeah.

289
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,520
 Well, that was a roller.

290
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
 That's really good.

291
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
 That's really good.

292
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
 Yeah.

293
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
 I saw someone else wrote to me.

294
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
 Oh, no, no, no.

295
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
 Great, great, great.

296
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
 It's really good.

297
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
 You want to take over hosting this show, actually?

298
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,520
 It's really good that you're sort of getting into the hosting thing down.

299
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
 I like it.

300
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
 What did someone else write to you?

301
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
 Well, I mentioned the thing about ducks.

302
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
 I didn't think you'd actually take us off on it.

303
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
 Yeah, yeah.

304
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,520
 You know, remember I said that ducks were used as pesticide, anti-pesticide.

305
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
 Oh, yeah.

306
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
 Army's of ducks were coming in.

307
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
 But not for tea.

308
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
 But not for tea.

309
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
 Exactly.

310
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
 Farmers around the world.

311
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
 So they troop over.

312
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
 They troop over and they start eating all of the worms.

313
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
 They live like five miles away.

314
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
 They take some hours to get there.

315
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
 They have holiday leave.

316
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
 They have certain work hours.

317
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
 We all know that.

318
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
 Yeah.

319
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
 And a goose comes as their protector, as their bodyguard.

320
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
 An owl comes.

321
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
 An owl.

322
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
 And we've got the goose for it, because, yeah.

323
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
 Anyway, farmers around the world have gone in contact,

324
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,520
 sending me videos of their ducks parading through on the way into...

325
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
 Nice.

326
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
 Yeah.

327
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
 It's a real thing.

328
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 So, yeah.

329
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
 Okay, my correspondent section of the show is done now.

330
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
 Thank you, Andy.

331
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
 Well, that was great.

332
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
 Dan's Corner.

333
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
 I'm only going to come for Dan's Corner next time.

334
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
 Can you tell me when that's scheduled in?

335
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
 Yeah, well, I can't tell you when it's scheduled in,

336
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
 because it'll just be whenever Dan takes over.

337
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,520
 Probably after two e-mails, I would imagine.

338
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
 So, are we not allowed to bring anything to the table?

339
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
 No, you absolutely are.

340
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 And you're encouraged to.

341
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
 Cool, because I've got a third.

342
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
 No, you've got a third.

343
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,520
 I'm not even sure you make the rules of this.

344
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
 Oh, really?

345
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
 I always thought this was Andy's thing.

346
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
 I think this is just evolving constantly, isn't it?

347
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,520
 What is drive-by, but from the other side of the table?

348
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
 James, if you'd like to chip in and say,

349
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
 "Maybe you think the whole thing doesn't work," or, you know...

350
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
 Well, it's more you.

351
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,520
 I think the rest of us are doing quite well.

352
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
 Yeah, yeah.

353
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
 We'll wait till you hear what Elizabeth Vison's got to say.

354
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

355
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,520
 She says, "Hello, Anna and the Fish Podcast team."

356
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,520
 I think that's because Anna says who to e-mail,

357
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
 but I think we're all included in this.

358
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,520
 It's a long-time listener from Connecticut.

359
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
 And she says, "I live in Connecticut in the U.S.

360
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
 "And my fact that I learned this week

361
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,520
 "is that there is a town called Myanus,

362
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
 "pronounced just as one might hope,

363
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
 "located along Connecticut's coast

364
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
 "in one of the richest parts of the state."

365
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
 Nice.

366
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
 What do we know about Myanus?

367
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
 Well, she goes on, actually.

368
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
 She says, "Disclaimer, it's probably pronounced

369
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,520
 "myanus, but it didn't stop the Jackass team

370
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
 "from visiting and partaking in the Obvious.

371
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
 "And because July 4th is a thing over here,

372
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
 "there are likely fireworks happening

373
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
 "in Myanus this weekend."

374
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
 (all laughing)

375
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,520
 So, Hang on, she's just said a fact,

376
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
 said it's pronounced exactly as you hope,

377
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,520
 and then immediately said it's not pronounced

378
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 as you hope, though.

379
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
 I'm afraid so, yeah.

380
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
 Right, welcome to the podcast.

381
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
 You should replace Dan when he's next away.

382
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,520
 Anyway, do you want a fireworks fact?

383
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
 Oh, yeah.

384
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
 The laughing Buddha, when he died,

385
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
 he knew he was gonna die,

386
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,520
 and so he stuffed all of his pockets with fireworks

387
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
 'cause he knew he'd be cremated.

388
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
 And then when he was cremated,

389
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
 there was a massive fireworks.

390
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
 Oh, that's hilarious.

391
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
 Is that prank?

392
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
 Or is it?

393
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
 Oh, okay.

394
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
 It's not a vengeance thing.

395
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
 Yeah, it's just a fact.

396
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
 (all laughing)

397
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
 That's why they're laughing.

398
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
 Yeah, 'cause it was funny.

399
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
 That's mean.

400
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
 That was funny.

401
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
 (all laughing)

402
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,520
 Yeah, Mayanus reminds me of Uranus.

403
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
 Remember for one of the--

404
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
 They're all very similar.

405
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
 (all laughing)

406
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
 It's like the Spanish say, isn't it?

407
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
 Uranus is Mayanus.

408
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
 (all laughing)

409
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
 No, Mayanus is Uranus.

410
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
 That has a very different meaning, actually.

411
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,520
 (all laughing)

412
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
 We, in the last book of the year that we did,

413
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
 I interviewed the mayor of Uranus in America,

414
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,520
 and he had all sorts of weird novelty things,

415
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
 but this sounds like it's got similar,

416
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,520
 what's going on in Mayanus this week.

417
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
 You can play with that.

418
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
 You can see the connection.

419
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
 Do you remember that article?

420
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
 I think I sent it to you guys,

421
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
 and they reckon that there's not as much science

422
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,520
 being done on Uranus because the scientists

423
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
 are all worried that it will just get

424
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,520
 jocular headlines on the internet.

425
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,520
 So they tend to study Neptune instead of Uranus.

426
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
 It's brilliant.

427
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
 (all laughing)

428
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
 It's really funny.

429
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 Is that definitely, do you reckon that's true?

430
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
 There were some real scientists who said it.

431
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
 They said that this was a problem.

432
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
 That's so funny.

433
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
 That's so good.

434
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
 Any publicity, I would have thought.

435
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
 Come on, jocular headlines better than no headline at all,

436
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
 which I reckon those Neptune lads aren't getting.

437
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
 (all laughing)

438
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
 He just says they're a Neptune headline, the front page.

439
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
 Yeah.

440
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
 Do you guys want one more?

441
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
 Yeah, absolutely.

442
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
 All right, this is from Charlie Langdale.

443
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
 Yep.

444
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
 He says, "Hi, guys.

445
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
 Long time fan of the podcast.

446
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 Very nice.

447
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
 A fact for us from the veterinary world.

448
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
 I am a podcast producer."

449
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
 I thought you was a vet.

450
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
 Oh, interesting.

451
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
 Completing sentences.

452
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
 People go, "What is it?"

453
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 You must have a vet podcast.

454
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,520
 I am a podcast producer, and we had an interesting fact pop up on one of our shows recently,

455
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
 which instantly made me think of you guys.

456
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
 One of our guests was working with a tortoise.

457
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
 Brackets.

458
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
 We're a veterinary podcast.

459
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
 Right.

460
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
 I called it.

461
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
 Yep.

462
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,520
 One of our guests was working with a tortoise who had swallowed lots of stones,

463
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 and the ideal treatment is to effectively shake them out.

464
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,520
 There's an official study which refers to a similar case,

465
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,520
 and the tool in question is referred to as an improvised vibrating massager.

466
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
 It was a sex toy.

467
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,520
 So the official cure for tortoises being constipated with stones is to use a vibrator on it.

468
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,520
 Our guest had to tell his client to strap a dildo to their tortoise as an official treatment plan.

469
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
 Are you strapping it to their underside?

470
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
 Their underside.

471
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
 Yeah.

472
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,520
 And he sent a photo as well, and it's amazing the image of this tortoise with a dildo on it.

473
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
 That's incredible.

474
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
 Do you think because if you had to go home for the day,

475
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
 and then something happened, and then someone else came into your lab,

476
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,520
 they'd just see this tortoise with an enormous penis,

477
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,520
 and momentarily be quite confused.

478
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
 Huge discovery.

479
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,520
 I will say that Charlie has cleverly managed to advertise his own podcast in the private bit of our podcast.

480
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
 Yeah.

481
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
 So I'm not going to mention that the name is Veterinary Ramblings.

482
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
 Great.

483
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,520
 And it looks really fun, and I recommend you go and give it a listen.

484
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,520
 Well, let's switch off this and go and do that.

485
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
 That's much better.

486
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
 There's a correction.

487
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
 There is a bollocking.

488
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
 Okay, let's do that.

489
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
 Let's finish on that.

490
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
 This is a short one.

491
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
 It's from Kim Ray.

492
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 In your last episode, it's a recent telling after two,

493
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,520
 you mentioned how Jay-Z has said that the bitch in his song "99 Problems" is a dog.

494
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
 I know.

495
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
 I remember this at the time.

496
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
 I think, but I didn't say anything because I was so unsure.

497
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
 Yeah.

498
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,520
 I think each verse is about a different meaning of that word.

499
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
 Oh, yeah.

500
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
 Did he not say that in an interview once?

501
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
 Well, that's not what Kim says.

502
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
 Okay.

503
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
 Kim will know.

504
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,280
 Kim says this extraordinary law review article, which Kim links to, does a line by line analysis

505
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,080
 of all the Fourth Amendment and criminal law points mentioned in this song, including

506
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,960
 how the bitch is a drug dog, and it's a drug dog that isn't on the scene.

507
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
 So it's a problem.

508
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,680
 The force of it is the officer pulls him over.

509
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,800
 He has drugs in the car, but the officer doesn't have a right to search without probable cause.

510
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,880
 And the officer doesn't have a drug dog on him.

511
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,040
 And Jay-Z knows he only has to wait a reasonable time for the officer to get a drug dog on

512
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
 the scene.

513
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,280
 So he's saying no drug dog here, no problem.

514
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,400
 So that's what I said.

515
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,720
 I said it wasn't about women.

516
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
 It was about a dog.

517
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,560
 Oh, but I thought you were saying it was ridiculous to claim that it was not about women.

518
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,440
 And I'm still with Dan.

519
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
 And here's why.

520
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
 Look at the logic.

521
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,760
 Look at the grammar of the previous sentences.

522
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,440
 If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son.

523
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,040
 I've got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one.

524
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,320
 Well, girl is actually slang for a type of drug that this drug dog looks for.

525
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
 Of course.

526
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
 Yeah.

527
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
 Sorry.

528
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
 I just don't know the lingo.

529
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
 Yeah.

530
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,800
 Well, if you want to check out Jay-Z's 99 Problems verse two, a close reading with Fourth

531
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,600
 Amendment guidance for cops and perps.

532
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,400
 That's in the St. Louis University Law Journal, 2012.

533
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
 That's great.

534
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
 Yeah.

535
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
 Thank you, Kim.

536
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
 Law is time well spent.

537
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 Bye.

538
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,920
 I quite like that being up.

539
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,080
 I think that should just be how I could buy for this every time, which is a surprise.

540
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
 You never know when it's coming.

541
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
 Yeah.

542
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
 Mic drop.

543
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 Okay.

544
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
 That's it.

545
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,440
 I hope you enjoyed that episode of Drop Us a Line.

546
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,500
 Very interesting for Dan to get involved in the hosting there.

547
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,440
 We'll see how that goes in the next few months.

548
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's almost like a soap opera, isn't it, as well as a correspondence bag.

549
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,120
 If you have any correspondence to send us, then please do email us podcast@qi.com.

550
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,440
 You can also tweet us on all of our normal Twitter accounts, which I'm sure you know

551
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
 by now.

552
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,120
 We'll be back in two weeks' time with some more bonus content.

553
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,520
 Who knows what it'll be?

554
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,440
 It's a lucky dip, and I really hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend or week, whenever

555
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,160
 you're listening to this bonus content, and to steal one of Andrew Hunter Murray's catch

556
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:50,360
 raises. Bye.

557
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,940
 (upbeat music)
