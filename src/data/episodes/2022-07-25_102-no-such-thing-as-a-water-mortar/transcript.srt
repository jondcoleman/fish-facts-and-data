00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 Hi everyone, tiny thing. The sound quality on this podcast is terrible. Really sorry about that.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,120
 We had a few issues in the venue on the night. Hope you can tolerate it nonetheless.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,160
 Okay, on with the show.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Weekly Podcast. This week

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,040
 coming to you from Canterbury. My name is Dan Schreiber and please welcome to the stage

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,120
 of the three regulars, Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:55,760
 This is great and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,360
 and in no particular order here we go starting with you, James Harkin.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,400
 Okay, my fact this week is that the first water balloons were made out of socks.

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,880
 Sort of cotton. Oh, no cotton made out of rubber, rubber socks.

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,240
 Your socks have not made out of rubber.

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,960
 This was, it was invented by a guy called Edgar Ellington and he was trying to come up with a thing

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,520
 that could kind of treat trenchfoot. So the idea that you would get your feet very wet and it could

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,840
 cause problems. He wanted to stop that and so he wanted to make socks that were made out of rubber,

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,880
 out of latex. The main problem he had was putting the socks on because they were so kind of latexy

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,960
 and you shouldn't get them on. And then once he even managed to sort that out, he thought,

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,240
 well, I'll just make sure the water proves. So he put a lot of water in there.

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,240
 There was a little bit of a leak and he was like a little bit of a leak and he threw it and then

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,640
 it smashed on the floor. Water went everywhere and he thought, ah-ha. He called them water grenades.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,440
 Yes, he did. He made them for water or to keep. Well, people still call them water buns, I think,

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,480
 sometimes they're there, yeah. But yes, still not used for water. Water pistols, not used for

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,240
 holding up banks. Because why my crime syndicate has not done so well. It's a shame nobody's invented

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:20,320
 the water mortar. It's a guy in America who did a Kickstarter campaign, he's called Josh Malone,

24
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,520
 he created a device that can blow up 100 water balloons in one minute, I think. So it feels

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
 like about 36 at a time. It's very impressive. The worst thing about water balloons is when you have

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,880
 to tie them up at the end. That's always really fiddly. But they have invented some self-tying water

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,160
 balloons. Wow. Yeah, they sound great, right? I saw an article in the Wall Street Journal of

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,360
 All Places about these things. And it said, works really well, you kind of fill it up and then you put

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,520
 it back together and it kind of self-seals. But the problem is that the balloons are so well-made

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,960
 that when you throw them at people, they just bounce off. That's not well-made at all then.

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,240
 But that's what that is, how water balloons work. If you want to get someone you throw it at the ground,

32
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,840
 you never throw it at a person because it just ricochets off their head. You need to chuck it on

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
 the ground. Oh, yeah, go on. Well, I was going to, I wonder if I've got the same idea, throw it

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,480
 at a person, but then chase after it with a pin and then smash it as it hits the person. Is that

35
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,240
 your thoughts? It's not exactly my thoughts to make everyone in a water balloon fight wear a suit

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:30,080
 made of nails. So, the Boy Scouts. Water weapons are slightly illegal in the Boy Scouts. You're not

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,960
 allowed to have water pistol fights in the Boy Scouts. You are allowed to have water balloon fights,

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,000
 but I was reading through it. There's a really odd tiny stipulation. You can only use water balloons,

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,640
 no bigger than a ping-pong ball. What has anyone seen a water balloon that size? They have made ping-pong balls

40
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,600
 bigger recently, because they wanted to make ping-pong better. Our table tennis better on television,

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,800
 so they made the ball bigger so you'd be able to see it better. That's not why we need to make

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,320
 this full of pressure on television. We need suits made of nails. I was reading this blog by a guy

43
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,360
 who works for the Scouts and he was saying here is a list of things and these are like official

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,520
 things that you're not allowed to do as Scouts or use when you're fighting with each other or playing

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,800
 with each other out in the field at Scout Camp. So it makes sense. You know, bottle rockets, crossbows,

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 guns, guns, big guns, tanks, anvil shooting in a lot of sheep anvil's and people. That's on the list.

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,480
 Twice girls have just gone completely hell than safety. Boomerangs on a laugh, ninja weapons.

48
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:41,120
 How do you get your ninja badge there? There's a university. I think it's just Texas University where

49
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,120
 you are not allowed to have water guns on campus, but you are allowed to have actual guns.

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,840
 Yeah, water balls have been banned this year on a campus where everyone's got actual guns in their

51
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,440
 lockers. Because water, you can drown in water, that's the thing. There were drowns in a bullet.

52
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:10,640
 So I was reading about balloons generally and sales of helium balloons have gone down recently

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,040
 because people have worried about the environmental impact of the plastic around them, which actually,

54
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,880
 if it's just an ordinary latex helium balloon, it's not that bad because it goes about five miles

55
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,800
 up into the atmosphere, I think, and then it freezes and it breaks into little slivers and it takes

56
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,840
 about as long to buy a grade as like a leaf or something. So it's not that bad for the environment,

57
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,720
 but it is very wasteful for helium. And so it's really an article that because helium is a precious

58
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,320
 commodity and we're using it up very faster than we're finding it. So this article was saying,

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,600
 "As an alternative to releasing helium balloons, environmentalists have suggested dropping non-helium

60
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,880
 balloons from a tall building." "Bloing bubbles or planting a tree."

61
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:06,480
 It's amazing. We are running out of helium, aren't we? I read the prices have doubled in the last 10

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,280
 years and do you know who owns 35% of the world's helium? They use most of it for MRI scans and stuff,

63
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,240
 don't they? Yeah, it's the USA. They've got a national helium reserve. They stockpile the huge

64
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,880
 amount of it because it's the second most abundant element in the universe, but on Earth it's really

65
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,040
 right because it just keeps floating away, basically. It's very useful for making

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:39,680
 as you said, "Am I right? Am I right?" Is that why we invented balloons then? To cage it.

67
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:48,400
 But then people have said that's quite cruel, and campaigners go around popping it and setting it up.

68
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:57,200
 There is a certain truth to that, I think, because one of the first people who might not have

69
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,520
 invented it, but one of the first people to make balloons like we know was Michael Faraday, and he was

70
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,320
 using it for his experiments, and it was experiments with gases and whatever, and he needed a place to keep

71
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,720
 the gases, so he did balloons that way. Anyway, we're going to run out of helium in 40 years if we

72
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,840
 keep consuming it at the right we are. Really? So, enjoy it, guys. Go nuts, while it's still cheap.

73
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:26,080
 I was reading about toys that were invented for other purposes, so silly string was invented by

74
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,840
 two guys called Robert Cox and Leonard Fish, and they were not trying to create silly string. They were

75
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,080
 trying to create a spray-on cast for broken bones or for sprays, then when they were trying the

76
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,320
 different nozzles that they would apply it with, they sort of created one that made it really fun,

77
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,320
 basically, made it move like silly string, and they thought this could be a toy, so they made an

78
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,560
 appointment with this company in California called WAMO, and this is from the account on Wikipedia,

79
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
 it seems very detailed on what written. Fish describes how, during that meeting, he sprayed the

80
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,920
 can all over the person he was meeting there, and all over his office. This person became very upset.

81
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:10,320
 And that's to believe the premises. One of the bosses of the company walked into this guy's office

82
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,520
 a day later, and there was a bit of it still stuck on a lampshade, and he said, "What is that?"

83
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,880
 and he explained, and they immediately said, "Get them back here. We have to make that into a toy."

84
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,640
 The use silly string in, I think, in the Iraq war to kind of find tripwires as well.

85
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,240
 Any, I don't know, is that drunk? Yeah, no, it does, because it's just so you can see it, it's just like,

86
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
 you're not sure where they asked you to spray the silly string, and then if it lays on something,

87
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,520
 you know, not to walk there. Oh, I thought, "Emen, we used the silly string."

88
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:44,560
 Because it's all just started writing home to a relative saying, can you send out some silly string?

89
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,720
 So, supposedly, the Army realised this would be, the American Army realised this would be a really

90
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,080
 good idea, and they wanted to transport it out to the troops, but apparently it can't be officially

91
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,160
 shipped, because it's an aerosol, and that's dangerous, which maybe, yeah, but they transport bombs

92
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:05,200
 around the place. There were 80,000 cans stockpiled in New Jersey, because apparently they just couldn't

93
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,040
 get it over. They've actually found someone who could ship it. Sorry, go on. I've got a test question

94
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:20,400
 actually, so you might prefer Dan's, but I'm talking now. My question is, if you line up a row of water

95
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:28,080
 balloons and you get a gun, it's a magnum, and it's a magnum where the bullets leave it a thousand miles

96
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,280
 an hour, and you place the magnum, nose first against the first water balloon in this long row of

97
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,680
 water balloons, how many balloons do you think it'll burst before the balloons stop the bullet?

98
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,520
 Oh wow, are we including that resist? I've just been doing the calculation here, is it?

99
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,200
 But it's four balloons. Oh wow. So yeah, just every time you're someone shooting at you,

100
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,760
 you just stand behind four water balloons. Oh yeah, exactly. That's the best armor. Why aren't police

101
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:00,640
 going into… Just dressed as giant water balloons? Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is

102
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,120
 my fact. My fact this week is that you can't write in French on French computer keyboards.

103
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,920
 You cannot type in proper French on French computer keyboards, and the French government

104
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,720
 are now changing. They've said we need to change all French computer keyboards.

105
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
 It's missing the accents. It's missing very basic stuff that you would need in order to write a

106
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,320
 normal sentence in French, and as a result, they think that the French language is really losing

107
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
 its way amongst the younger generation who are exclusively doing it through typing.

108
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,840
 Well, those are all keyboards. This is actually going to be really tense from here on in,

109
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,160
 because I think James and I disagree on this, but our keyboards are not ideal. Some people are so…

110
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:48,960
 Right, the Quarty keyboard became the standard keyboard mistakenly. It was an accident.

111
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,600
 So in a normal working day for someone who's a secretary who's typing all day, for instance,

112
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,400
 on a Quarty keyboard, your fingers will cover 20 miles, which is amazing anyway. Very good exercise

113
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,280
 for your fingers. On a Quarty keyboard, they'll cover that, and on a Dvorak keyboard,

114
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,840
 which is the suggested replacement, they'll cover one mile typing the same stuff,

115
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,600
 because it's just much better laid out. So on a Quarty keyboard, all the most commonly used

116
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,920
 bows and consonants either on the top row or the bottom row, there's hardly any on the middle row,

117
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,280
 so I think 52% of strokes are on the top row, which is absurd. It's exhausting.

118
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,080
 If your fingers are only walking one mile a day, won't we all get fat fingers?

119
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,200
 And isn't that a good thing? No, it's pretty much.

120
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,880
 August Dvorak, who invented this keyboard that you seem to be so keen on, he died actually in 1975,

121
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,000
 just before he died, he said, "I'm tired of trying to do something worthwhile for the human race.

122
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 They simply don't want to change."

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:55,040
 Yeah, it's people like you who wouldn't accept, for instance, the fact that the vows on a Quarty

124
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,600
 keyboard are distributed on both sides, which doesn't make any sense, because mostly in the English

125
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,160
 language, vows are followed by consonants and vice versa, so it makes a lot more sense for the vows

126
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,520
 or to be on one side and the consonants or to be on the other side, otherwise...

127
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,000
 So I'll give you some evidence.

128
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,600
 The highest typing speed in history was 216 words per minute, and that was done on the Quarty

129
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,040
 keyboard. And yet the vast majority of typing speed records have been broken by Dvorak.

130
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,040
 That absolute fastest was on the Quarty.

131
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,040
 Don't, don't you want to go for a drink or something?

132
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,440
 No, I'm over it, I'm over it. You don't want to change, fine.

133
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,720
 So 216 words per minute, that's the fastest typing speed in history.

134
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,000
 The fastest handwriting speed is 350 words per minute. That's done a short hand.

135
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,840
 Only the person who wrote it, I guess.

136
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:57,040
 And the fastest talking is 637 words per minute, and this is a British guy called Steve Woodmore,

137
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,200
 who you can go on YouTube and see him talking and not the standard word he's saying.

138
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,760
 But he kind of reads like to be on not to be that, it's a question and stuff like that and reads it

139
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,480
 really, really fast. If you look on his Wikipedia page, which he has, it says that he once read the

140
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,680
 entire United Kingdom tax code, and it took him five days to do it, and that's the fastest

141
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,360
 reader of all time. The gripping video, you have five days to spare.

142
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,040
 I know, but also on Wikipedia it says fast talking aside, Woodmore also acts as an electronic

143
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,480
 salesman for curries. The original Quarty keyboard, the guy who created it, Christopher

144
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,640
 Latham Sholes, this was in 1867, and so this was before he thought of Quarty, it only had two rows,

145
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,360
 and it was compared to a piano keyboard, and it only had eight numbers on it because he said,

146
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,360
 you should use the O and the I to be the zero and the one, so it's trying for maximum efficiency.

147
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,080
 So there's a thing called the Quarty effect. Have you guys seen this?

148
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,840
 It's where two people on either side of you have an enormous point that's around.

149
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:13,280
 The Quarty effect is much more positive than that. The Quarty effect, this is weird,

150
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,760
 and so people have tested this, and apparently it seems to be true, that letters types with

151
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,640
 your right hand are considered to be more positive than those types with your left hand.

152
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,480
 When they've looked into it and they found that, you know, since like keyboards have become

153
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,600
 regular, people with names with letters on the right hand have become more common and things

154
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,240
 like that, so it does seem to be in effect that people feel more positive about things

155
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,480
 with their right hand than with their left hand. The J for James is with the right hand,

156
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,400
 and the A for Anna and Andy and the D for Dan for all for the limited time.

157
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,920
 And the first study I saw published on this is a few years ago said that typing sad makes you miserable

158
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,080
 because it's left hand and typing jolly makes you happy because it's the right hand.

159
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,600
 Maybe it just makes you miserable because the kind of people who are typing sad and typing emails

160
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,920
 saying, I'm very sad. It's true because it also means that writing ace breasts,

161
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,040
 carefree or sex would make you sad whereas writing pooing would make you happy.

162
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,440
 We need to move on to the next fact. You guys go anything else? Nope.

163
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that Archer's at the Battle of

164
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,160
 Azure Core had three arrows in the air at any given moment. This was in an interview with a guy

165
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,680
 who's a senior Archer, and it sounds kind of impossible, but it's sort of a reflection of how

166
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,040
 fast the rate of fire was for a medieval longbowman. Longbow's were the things which really clenched

167
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,440
 the Battle of Azure Core about six feet tall, a longbow, there's taller than a lot of the people

168
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,560
 who would have been carrying them, and they were just incredibly powerful. So, for example,

169
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,760
 a medieval archer could fire at least ten arrows in a minute. Maybe even more, we're not sure,

170
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,400
 we're not sure, but there were 5,000 archers on the English side of the Battle of Azure Core,

171
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,840
 and that is, even at six arrows a minute, that's 30,000 arrows moving towards the French

172
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,040
 Minotowns a minute, and the big thing was, the French had to move across a very short distance,

173
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,840
 it was about 200 paces to get to the English line, but during that time, what has taken them about

174
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,920
 four minutes at least, at least 120,000 arrows would have been fired at them, maybe up to 200,000.

175
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,560
 They were so heavy duty to use though, weren't they, longbow's. So, they were, they were

176
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,440
 unbelievably effective, and it is why, at the Battle of Azure Core, the British, the English,

177
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:41,120
 with far, far fewer forces were able to defeat the French, but so heavy duty, so the draw weight,

178
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,920
 which is the weight equivalent of what you have to hold when you're pulling back the arrow,

179
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,360
 was up to 200 pounds, which is 14 stone. So, is the equivalent of lifting up a 14 stone person,

180
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,480
 just with your right hand, as you draw the bow and arrow. Wow. And when you look at skeleton

181
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,680
 of archers, you can identify them because they have elongated bones and like swollen bones in

182
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,240
 that arrow arm, and they have marks where they would have had the bow. So, on their wrist and their shoulder.

183
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,040
 So, lots of these guys, the archers, the Battle of Azure Core, who all English and Welsh,

184
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:23,600
 they were naked from the waist down. No, like Donald Duck, it's all seen. Interesting,

185
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:32,000
 Donald Duck and Fire, ten arrows in there, huge draw strength. No way. They had terrible diarrhea,

186
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,440
 they had dysentery. Oh yeah. It was a huge problem. They were completely exhausted before the battle.

187
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,600
 They'd been marching many miles a day for about a fortnight, they were in enemy territory,

188
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,560
 they'd won one battle, and Henry just really wanted to get them home, but he had to march around

189
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,160
 France a bit, so it wasn't a completely wasted journey. As in, they won the siege of Half-Flaur,

190
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,520
 and then he said, "Well, we could go just home immediately," but he spent a lot of time

191
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,920
 and money raising the funds for this war, so he sort of was embarrassed, and all the men had dysentery,

192
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,160
 and so they just sort of cut off their trousers and... Why didn't they just pull them down?

193
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,880
 I have ridden the guns like they cut them off. That's why it's bad.

194
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:18,880
 I actually read the main opponent who would have been, so obviously Henry the fifth was fighting

195
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,320
 on the English side, and it would have been Charles the sixth who was fighting on the French side,

196
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,440
 but he couldn't fight because he was a severely mentally ill, people think now he has schizophrenia,

197
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,520
 and he also had this thing called glass delusion where he thought he was made of glass,

198
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,360
 so he couldn't really move or walk very much. But one of the things that his servants had to do

199
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,240
 was cut his clothes off him, because he never washed, and so his clothes had hit him so much

200
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,880
 that eventually they kept on having to cut off his clothes. Yeah, so he, in a way, suffered an

201
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,920
 exactly the same way those guys in battle did without having to be there. So the place actually

202
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,040
 is called Azzincor, not Azzincor, isn't it? Yeah. It's a French town called Azzincor,

203
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,880
 and we've just kind of anglicised it. There is a battlefield museum there. It's shaped like a

204
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,440
 longbow, which is quite cool. It's not the first museum that was there. There was one before,

205
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,640
 which was quite a lot cheaper actually, and they had a model of the battle where the knights were

206
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,560
 made out of action-man figures. Was they naked from the waist down?

207
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:30,960
 I was looking on Wikipedia for a list of famous archers, Geoffrey.

208
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:45,360
 It's a great list of Robin Hood's honours, citation-needed, and I read a familiar name,

209
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,880
 so I quickly clicked into it. It's a guy called Mad Jack Churchill, who, if you don't know him,

210
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,960
 is the greatest World War II eccentric hero you could ever learn about. So he used to go into

211
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:06,800
 war with a longbow, sometimes a sword, and most times bagpipes. He was just an eccentric,

212
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,440
 and so he's, yeah, he's credited as the only person in World War II to take the longbow, amazing.

213
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,520
 Do you know how Henry V funded his war? In Urgent Court, the 100th his war. He crowd-funded.

214
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,800
 He wrote begging letters to lots of his friends and to towns, and then he also lent them royal

215
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,400
 jewellery and stuff, and one of the people who lent them money was Dick Wittington.

216
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,080
 Isn't that weird? Yeah, it was a real person Dick Wittington. He was a rich cloth merchant,

217
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,360
 and he'd fund it. Oh no, he wasn't.

218
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,800
 All right, Jen, he's behind you.

219
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:53,360
 I don't see. Yeah. So in America a couple of years ago, they had a debate in a university about whether

220
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,760
 Henry V should be on guilty of war crimes, because after the Battle of Aging Corps, he did, I think,

221
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,400
 kill a load of French prisoners, didn't he? So former US solicitor General Gregory Garry,

222
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,880
 who was arguing against Henry V said that he didn't have a legitimate claim to the French

223
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,120
 throne because he traced his claim back only six generations. And Canon Shen Mungam,

224
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,080
 who was arguing on the other side, just said war against France is inherently lawful.

225
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:36,000
 Okay. All right, well, let's move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski.

226
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,280
 Yeah, my fact this week is that right-handed marmosets are braver than left-handed marmosets.

227
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:52,000
 This is true. How? Well, various ways. So they can tell how, if marmosets are right or left-handed,

228
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,560
 based on what objects, what hand they choose to pick up their objects with. So you put an object

229
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,080
 in front of them, and if they pick up with the right hand, they're right-handed, et cetera.

230
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,400
 And it's about 50/50 split right and left-handed in marmosets. And it turns out the left-handed ones

231
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,440
 when they're faced with a predator, they freeze for longer, so they take longer to move and run away.

232
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,640
 They are much more cautious about sniffing out or tasting kind of new food. They have a more

233
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:30,880
 negative outlook. I don't think about the Chinese economy. So the way we know this is that they were

234
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,880
 trained to, they were given white bowls and black bowls, and in one colour there would be a reward,

235
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,920
 and in the other colour there wouldn't. And they were trained to choose the bowls with the reward,

236
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,920
 and to not choose the ones without the reward. And then they started giving the marmosets grey bowls.

237
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,040
 And the right-handed marmosets took the grey bowl. They were like, it's a lot like the white bowl.

238
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,560
 I'm just going to have it. It's probably got the food in it. And the left-handed marmosets didn't

239
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,320
 tell you, because I thought, so it looks a lot like the black bowl to me. I'm not going to. I bet it

240
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,880
 hasn't been in the industry. It's all self-empty and glass all full thing. Exactly! Are we all

241
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,240
 right-handers around this table? Oh, I'm left-handed. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm terrified.

242
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,600
 So you are, so humans are more fearful as well if they're left-handed. Really? There's a

243
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,960
 higher correlation. So for instance, the way they tested this, one of the ways a bunch of studies

244
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,760
 have shown it, but they've showed people, silence the lambs, the film. And then they questioned

245
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,840
 them afterwards about certain scenes and asked them to recount certain scenes. And the left-handed

246
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,160
 people stammered and started and freaked out and screamed as they were recounting scenes.

247
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
 You've seen that movie, aren't you? No, I've heard scenes.

248
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,760
 The sound of music was on the other side.

249
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,160
 But you say, I'm biscuit of that. It's not music.

250
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,000
 Isn't it the case that the world is just better equipped in sort of our technology and so on

251
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,760
 for right-handed people? Yeah. So anyone in a situation volunteering, who will play this guitar?

252
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,760
 Most likely it's a right-handed guitar. Who might want to play this guitar? Where's Andrew?

253
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,600
 He might like, I just can't play this guitar. Who will cut this paper with these scissors?

254
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,600
 I'll cut this paper with these because they will be right-handed scissors. Like, surely, we

255
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,280
 volunteer for more stuff as right-handed people. That's very good theory. You should take it to

256
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:26,720
 the theorizers. So the Roman poet Horace, when he made a mistake, he wrote "Ego Liveus", which we

257
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,920
 translate as silly me, it actually means "left-handed me". Oh, really? Yeah, there's a long history of this

258
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,120
 stuff. Yeah, people don't like left-handed people. We don't have a stand for it in that way, well.

259
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:43,520
 It's terrifying. That's amazing about Mama Says. Yeah, it's really cool. I mean, and we think it

260
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,840
 extrapolates to humans. But Mama Says are great. So one thing they've learned to do is learn from

261
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,360
 instructional videos. A Mama Says was taught how to extract an object that it wanted from a box,

262
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,640
 though, you know, a well-loct box. And then it was filmed extracting that object once it had been

263
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,120
 taught to do that. And then the film of the Mama Says doing that was placed in a room or a case,

264
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,480
 or whatever, with other Mama Says. And the Mama Says watched the film, and then they were given

265
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,680
 the box, and they imitated what happened in the film. Which is quite cool. Given that my cats don't

266
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:24,000
 know their own reflection. So, I'm just thinking, I bet there's people listening at home who didn't

267
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,520
 know what Mama Says are. And you've just got 10 minutes talking about them. Are they mamas or are they

268
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,920
 mamas? I don't know, but they're mamas. Yeah, mamas says, you love them when you hate them, yeah. Yeah. We've got

269
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:46,560
 prejudices to this for earlier, actually. The little tiny monkeys that live in South America aren't they?

270
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,080
 They don't have wisdom teeth. That's one thing about them. They're the only primates with like tactile

271
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,920
 hairs that can kind of feel things. They have them on the wrists. They go into topper every day when

272
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,640
 the sun is hotter, so they kind of fall asleep, like have a siesta every day when it gets really hot,

273
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,000
 like Spanish people. Oh, cool. And they're the only primates apart from humans where you can stare

274
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,120
 into their eyes, and they won't think you'll be in aggressive. They also, I read a new report about

275
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,920
 finding about them, is that their parents teach them not to interrupt them when they're talking. Yeah,

276
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,480
 it's a thing. So, basically, if you ever hear Mama Says talking to each other, they don't interrupt

277
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:35,280
 each other. Well, actually, this is an interesting thing. Yeah, they do a thing, and they actually train

278
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,000
 their children to not talk over them. If the child talks over them, they'll give them the silent

279
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,600
 treatment. So, every Mama said conversation is really civilised. Although, they are, so they've

280
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,520
 been compared to humans, because they are like that with conversation. They do what humans do,

281
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,080
 which is if one of them starts talking faster or making, and it's cool a bit quicker,

282
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,320
 then the other one will imitate, as we do in conversation. But they don't interrupt each other.

283
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,720
 They do leave five to six second pauses after one Mama said has spoken before they speak,

284
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,200
 which I think is not as sophisticated as humans, where we are capable of when I stop talking,

285
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,120
 presumably, it will not be an awkward six second pause before somebody else speaks.

286
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,040
 No, certainly not. All right, let's wrap it up on that. Thank you so much, guys, for listening. That's

287
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,960
 all of our facts. If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things we've said
