00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, tiny thing. The sound quality on this podcast is terrible. Really sorry about that."
00:00:06,00:00:11,We had a few issues in the venue on the night. Hope you can tolerate it nonetheless.
00:00:11,00:00:14,"Okay, on with the show."
00:00:26,00:00:32,Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Weekly Podcast. This week
00:00:32,00:00:37,coming to you from Canterbury. My name is Dan Schreiber and please welcome to the stage
00:00:37,00:00:41,"of the three regulars, Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray."
00:00:41,00:00:55,This is great and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:55,00:01:01,"and in no particular order here we go starting with you, James Harkin."
00:01:01,00:01:06,"Okay, my fact this week is that the first water balloons were made out of socks."
00:01:06,00:01:12,"Sort of cotton. Oh, no cotton made out of rubber, rubber socks."
00:01:12,00:01:16,Your socks have not made out of rubber.
00:01:16,00:01:22,"This was, it was invented by a guy called Edgar Ellington and he was trying to come up with a thing"
00:01:22,00:01:27,that could kind of treat trenchfoot. So the idea that you would get your feet very wet and it could
00:01:27,00:01:31,"cause problems. He wanted to stop that and so he wanted to make socks that were made out of rubber,"
00:01:31,00:01:36,out of latex. The main problem he had was putting the socks on because they were so kind of latexy
00:01:36,00:01:40,"and you shouldn't get them on. And then once he even managed to sort that out, he thought,"
00:01:40,00:01:44,"well, I'll just make sure the water proves. So he put a lot of water in there."
00:01:44,00:01:48,There was a little bit of a leak and he was like a little bit of a leak and he threw it and then
00:01:48,00:01:54,"it smashed on the floor. Water went everywhere and he thought, ah-ha. He called them water grenades."
00:01:54,00:02:01,"Yes, he did. He made them for water or to keep. Well, people still call them water buns, I think,"
00:02:01,00:02:06,"sometimes they're there, yeah. But yes, still not used for water. Water pistols, not used for"
00:02:06,00:02:12,holding up banks. Because why my crime syndicate has not done so well. It's a shame nobody's invented
00:02:12,00:02:20,"the water mortar. It's a guy in America who did a Kickstarter campaign, he's called Josh Malone,"
00:02:20,00:02:25,"he created a device that can blow up 100 water balloons in one minute, I think. So it feels"
00:02:25,00:02:30,like about 36 at a time. It's very impressive. The worst thing about water balloons is when you have
00:02:30,00:02:34,to tie them up at the end. That's always really fiddly. But they have invented some self-tying water
00:02:34,00:02:40,"balloons. Wow. Yeah, they sound great, right? I saw an article in the Wall Street Journal of"
00:02:40,00:02:45,"All Places about these things. And it said, works really well, you kind of fill it up and then you put"
00:02:45,00:02:49,it back together and it kind of self-seals. But the problem is that the balloons are so well-made
00:02:49,00:02:54,"that when you throw them at people, they just bounce off. That's not well-made at all then."
00:02:54,00:03:00,"But that's what that is, how water balloons work. If you want to get someone you throw it at the ground,"
00:03:00,00:03:03,you never throw it at a person because it just ricochets off their head. You need to chuck it on
00:03:03,00:03:08,"the ground. Oh, yeah, go on. Well, I was going to, I wonder if I've got the same idea, throw it"
00:03:08,00:03:14,"at a person, but then chase after it with a pin and then smash it as it hits the person. Is that"
00:03:14,00:03:18,your thoughts? It's not exactly my thoughts to make everyone in a water balloon fight wear a suit
00:03:18,00:03:30,"made of nails. So, the Boy Scouts. Water weapons are slightly illegal in the Boy Scouts. You're not"
00:03:30,00:03:34,"allowed to have water pistol fights in the Boy Scouts. You are allowed to have water balloon fights,"
00:03:34,00:03:40,"but I was reading through it. There's a really odd tiny stipulation. You can only use water balloons,"
00:03:40,00:03:46,no bigger than a ping-pong ball. What has anyone seen a water balloon that size? They have made ping-pong balls
00:03:46,00:03:51,"bigger recently, because they wanted to make ping-pong better. Our table tennis better on television,"
00:03:51,00:03:54,so they made the ball bigger so you'd be able to see it better. That's not why we need to make
00:03:54,00:04:02,this full of pressure on television. We need suits made of nails. I was reading this blog by a guy
00:04:02,00:04:07,who works for the Scouts and he was saying here is a list of things and these are like official
00:04:07,00:04:11,things that you're not allowed to do as Scouts or use when you're fighting with each other or playing
00:04:11,00:04:16,"with each other out in the field at Scout Camp. So it makes sense. You know, bottle rockets, crossbows,"
00:04:16,00:04:26,"guns, guns, big guns, tanks, anvil shooting in a lot of sheep anvil's and people. That's on the list."
00:04:26,00:04:32,"Twice girls have just gone completely hell than safety. Boomerangs on a laugh, ninja weapons."
00:04:32,00:04:41,How do you get your ninja badge there? There's a university. I think it's just Texas University where
00:04:41,00:04:47,"you are not allowed to have water guns on campus, but you are allowed to have actual guns."
00:04:47,00:04:53,"Yeah, water balls have been banned this year on a campus where everyone's got actual guns in their"
00:04:53,00:05:01,"lockers. Because water, you can drown in water, that's the thing. There were drowns in a bullet."
00:05:01,00:05:10,So I was reading about balloons generally and sales of helium balloons have gone down recently
00:05:10,00:05:15,"because people have worried about the environmental impact of the plastic around them, which actually,"
00:05:15,00:05:20,"if it's just an ordinary latex helium balloon, it's not that bad because it goes about five miles"
00:05:20,00:05:26,"up into the atmosphere, I think, and then it freezes and it breaks into little slivers and it takes"
00:05:26,00:05:31,"about as long to buy a grade as like a leaf or something. So it's not that bad for the environment,"
00:05:31,00:05:36,but it is very wasteful for helium. And so it's really an article that because helium is a precious
00:05:36,00:05:42,"commodity and we're using it up very faster than we're finding it. So this article was saying,"
00:05:42,00:05:47,"""As an alternative to releasing helium balloons, environmentalists have suggested dropping non-helium"
00:05:47,00:05:54,"balloons from a tall building."" ""Bloing bubbles or planting a tree."""
00:05:54,00:06:06,"It's amazing. We are running out of helium, aren't we? I read the prices have doubled in the last 10"
00:06:06,00:06:13,"years and do you know who owns 35% of the world's helium? They use most of it for MRI scans and stuff,"
00:06:13,00:06:20,"don't they? Yeah, it's the USA. They've got a national helium reserve. They stockpile the huge"
00:06:20,00:06:24,"amount of it because it's the second most abundant element in the universe, but on Earth it's really"
00:06:24,00:06:31,"right because it just keeps floating away, basically. It's very useful for making"
00:06:31,00:06:39,"as you said, ""Am I right? Am I right?"" Is that why we invented balloons then? To cage it."
00:06:39,00:06:48,"But then people have said that's quite cruel, and campaigners go around popping it and setting it up."
00:06:48,00:06:57,"There is a certain truth to that, I think, because one of the first people who might not have"
00:06:57,00:07:01,"invented it, but one of the first people to make balloons like we know was Michael Faraday, and he was"
00:07:01,00:07:06,"using it for his experiments, and it was experiments with gases and whatever, and he needed a place to keep"
00:07:06,00:07:12,"the gases, so he did balloons that way. Anyway, we're going to run out of helium in 40 years if we"
00:07:12,00:07:17,"keep consuming it at the right we are. Really? So, enjoy it, guys. Go nuts, while it's still cheap."
00:07:17,00:07:26,"I was reading about toys that were invented for other purposes, so silly string was invented by"
00:07:26,00:07:29,"two guys called Robert Cox and Leonard Fish, and they were not trying to create silly string. They were"
00:07:29,00:07:36,"trying to create a spray-on cast for broken bones or for sprays, then when they were trying the"
00:07:36,00:07:40,"different nozzles that they would apply it with, they sort of created one that made it really fun,"
00:07:40,00:07:44,"basically, made it move like silly string, and they thought this could be a toy, so they made an"
00:07:44,00:07:50,"appointment with this company in California called WAMO, and this is from the account on Wikipedia,"
00:07:50,00:07:55,"it seems very detailed on what written. Fish describes how, during that meeting, he sprayed the"
00:07:55,00:08:01,"can all over the person he was meeting there, and all over his office. This person became very upset."
00:08:01,00:08:10,And that's to believe the premises. One of the bosses of the company walked into this guy's office
00:08:10,00:08:13,"a day later, and there was a bit of it still stuck on a lampshade, and he said, ""What is that?"""
00:08:13,00:08:16,"and he explained, and they immediately said, ""Get them back here. We have to make that into a toy."""
00:08:16,00:08:22,"The use silly string in, I think, in the Iraq war to kind of find tripwires as well."
00:08:22,00:08:28,"Any, I don't know, is that drunk? Yeah, no, it does, because it's just so you can see it, it's just like,"
00:08:28,00:08:31,"you're not sure where they asked you to spray the silly string, and then if it lays on something,"
00:08:31,00:08:35,"you know, not to walk there. Oh, I thought, ""Emen, we used the silly string."""
00:08:35,00:08:44,"Because it's all just started writing home to a relative saying, can you send out some silly string?"
00:08:44,00:08:48,"So, supposedly, the Army realised this would be, the American Army realised this would be a really"
00:08:48,00:08:54,"good idea, and they wanted to transport it out to the troops, but apparently it can't be officially"
00:08:54,00:08:58,"shipped, because it's an aerosol, and that's dangerous, which maybe, yeah, but they transport bombs"
00:08:58,00:09:05,"around the place. There were 80,000 cans stockpiled in New Jersey, because apparently they just couldn't"
00:09:05,00:09:11,"get it over. They've actually found someone who could ship it. Sorry, go on. I've got a test question"
00:09:11,00:09:20,"actually, so you might prefer Dan's, but I'm talking now. My question is, if you line up a row of water"
00:09:20,00:09:28,"balloons and you get a gun, it's a magnum, and it's a magnum where the bullets leave it a thousand miles"
00:09:28,00:09:33,"an hour, and you place the magnum, nose first against the first water balloon in this long row of"
00:09:33,00:09:37,"water balloons, how many balloons do you think it'll burst before the balloons stop the bullet?"
00:09:37,00:09:41,"Oh wow, are we including that resist? I've just been doing the calculation here, is it?"
00:09:41,00:09:47,"But it's four balloons. Oh wow. So yeah, just every time you're someone shooting at you,"
00:09:47,00:09:51,"you just stand behind four water balloons. Oh yeah, exactly. That's the best armor. Why aren't police"
00:09:51,00:10:00,"going into… Just dressed as giant water balloons? Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is"
00:10:00,00:10:07,my fact. My fact this week is that you can't write in French on French computer keyboards.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"You cannot type in proper French on French computer keyboards, and the French government"
00:10:11,00:10:16,are now changing. They've said we need to change all French computer keyboards.
00:10:16,00:10:20,It's missing the accents. It's missing very basic stuff that you would need in order to write a
00:10:20,00:10:26,"normal sentence in French, and as a result, they think that the French language is really losing"
00:10:26,00:10:29,its way amongst the younger generation who are exclusively doing it through typing.
00:10:29,00:10:33,"Well, those are all keyboards. This is actually going to be really tense from here on in,"
00:10:34,00:10:40,"because I think James and I disagree on this, but our keyboards are not ideal. Some people are so…"
00:10:40,00:10:48,"Right, the Quarty keyboard became the standard keyboard mistakenly. It was an accident."
00:10:48,00:10:53,"So in a normal working day for someone who's a secretary who's typing all day, for instance,"
00:10:53,00:10:58,"on a Quarty keyboard, your fingers will cover 20 miles, which is amazing anyway. Very good exercise"
00:10:58,00:11:03,"for your fingers. On a Quarty keyboard, they'll cover that, and on a Dvorak keyboard,"
00:11:03,00:11:07,"which is the suggested replacement, they'll cover one mile typing the same stuff,"
00:11:07,00:11:11,"because it's just much better laid out. So on a Quarty keyboard, all the most commonly used"
00:11:11,00:11:15,"bows and consonants either on the top row or the bottom row, there's hardly any on the middle row,"
00:11:15,00:11:21,"so I think 52% of strokes are on the top row, which is absurd. It's exhausting."
00:11:21,00:11:24,"If your fingers are only walking one mile a day, won't we all get fat fingers?"
00:11:24,00:11:29,"And isn't that a good thing? No, it's pretty much."
00:11:29,00:11:36,"August Dvorak, who invented this keyboard that you seem to be so keen on, he died actually in 1975,"
00:11:36,00:11:42,"just before he died, he said, ""I'm tired of trying to do something worthwhile for the human race."
00:11:42,00:11:44,"They simply don't want to change."""
00:11:44,00:11:55,"Yeah, it's people like you who wouldn't accept, for instance, the fact that the vows on a Quarty"
00:11:55,00:12:01,"keyboard are distributed on both sides, which doesn't make any sense, because mostly in the English"
00:12:01,00:12:06,"language, vows are followed by consonants and vice versa, so it makes a lot more sense for the vows"
00:12:06,00:12:09,"or to be on one side and the consonants or to be on the other side, otherwise..."
00:12:09,00:12:12,So I'll give you some evidence.
00:12:12,00:12:17,"The highest typing speed in history was 216 words per minute, and that was done on the Quarty"
00:12:17,00:12:23,keyboard. And yet the vast majority of typing speed records have been broken by Dvorak.
00:12:23,00:12:27,That absolute fastest was on the Quarty.
00:12:27,00:12:31,"Don't, don't you want to go for a drink or something?"
00:12:31,00:12:33,"No, I'm over it, I'm over it. You don't want to change, fine."
00:12:33,00:12:38,"So 216 words per minute, that's the fastest typing speed in history."
00:12:38,00:12:44,The fastest handwriting speed is 350 words per minute. That's done a short hand.
00:12:44,00:12:47,"Only the person who wrote it, I guess."
00:12:48,00:12:57,"And the fastest talking is 637 words per minute, and this is a British guy called Steve Woodmore,"
00:12:57,00:13:01,who you can go on YouTube and see him talking and not the standard word he's saying.
00:13:01,00:13:05,"But he kind of reads like to be on not to be that, it's a question and stuff like that and reads it"
00:13:05,00:13:12,"really, really fast. If you look on his Wikipedia page, which he has, it says that he once read the"
00:13:12,00:13:17,"entire United Kingdom tax code, and it took him five days to do it, and that's the fastest"
00:13:17,00:13:23,"reader of all time. The gripping video, you have five days to spare."
00:13:23,00:13:29,"I know, but also on Wikipedia it says fast talking aside, Woodmore also acts as an electronic"
00:13:29,00:13:36,"salesman for curries. The original Quarty keyboard, the guy who created it, Christopher"
00:13:36,00:13:42,"Latham Sholes, this was in 1867, and so this was before he thought of Quarty, it only had two rows,"
00:13:42,00:13:47,"and it was compared to a piano keyboard, and it only had eight numbers on it because he said,"
00:13:47,00:13:53,"you should use the O and the I to be the zero and the one, so it's trying for maximum efficiency."
00:13:53,00:13:58,So there's a thing called the Quarty effect. Have you guys seen this?
00:13:58,00:14:01,It's where two people on either side of you have an enormous point that's around.
00:14:01,00:14:13,"The Quarty effect is much more positive than that. The Quarty effect, this is weird,"
00:14:13,00:14:17,"and so people have tested this, and apparently it seems to be true, that letters types with"
00:14:17,00:14:22,your right hand are considered to be more positive than those types with your left hand.
00:14:22,00:14:26,"When they've looked into it and they found that, you know, since like keyboards have become"
00:14:26,00:14:31,"regular, people with names with letters on the right hand have become more common and things"
00:14:31,00:14:36,"like that, so it does seem to be in effect that people feel more positive about things"
00:14:36,00:14:40,"with their right hand than with their left hand. The J for James is with the right hand,"
00:14:40,00:14:44,and the A for Anna and Andy and the D for Dan for all for the limited time.
00:14:44,00:14:51,And the first study I saw published on this is a few years ago said that typing sad makes you miserable
00:14:51,00:14:56,because it's left hand and typing jolly makes you happy because it's the right hand.
00:14:56,00:14:59,Maybe it just makes you miserable because the kind of people who are typing sad and typing emails
00:14:59,00:15:05,"saying, I'm very sad. It's true because it also means that writing ace breasts,"
00:15:05,00:15:11,carefree or sex would make you sad whereas writing pooing would make you happy.
00:15:11,00:15:17,We need to move on to the next fact. You guys go anything else? Nope.
00:15:17,00:15:24,"Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Andy. My fact is that Archer's at the Battle of"
00:15:24,00:15:30,Azure Core had three arrows in the air at any given moment. This was in an interview with a guy
00:15:30,00:15:35,"who's a senior Archer, and it sounds kind of impossible, but it's sort of a reflection of how"
00:15:36,00:15:43,fast the rate of fire was for a medieval longbowman. Longbow's were the things which really clenched
00:15:43,00:15:47,"the Battle of Azure Core about six feet tall, a longbow, there's taller than a lot of the people"
00:15:47,00:15:52,"who would have been carrying them, and they were just incredibly powerful. So, for example,"
00:15:52,00:15:57,"a medieval archer could fire at least ten arrows in a minute. Maybe even more, we're not sure,"
00:15:57,00:16:02,"we're not sure, but there were 5,000 archers on the English side of the Battle of Azure Core,"
00:16:02,00:16:07,"and that is, even at six arrows a minute, that's 30,000 arrows moving towards the French"
00:16:07,00:16:13,"Minotowns a minute, and the big thing was, the French had to move across a very short distance,"
00:16:13,00:16:17,"it was about 200 paces to get to the English line, but during that time, what has taken them about"
00:16:17,00:16:23,"four minutes at least, at least 120,000 arrows would have been fired at them, maybe up to 200,000."
00:16:23,00:16:28,"They were so heavy duty to use though, weren't they, longbow's. So, they were, they were"
00:16:28,00:16:33,"unbelievably effective, and it is why, at the Battle of Azure Core, the British, the English,"
00:16:33,00:16:41,"with far, far fewer forces were able to defeat the French, but so heavy duty, so the draw weight,"
00:16:41,00:16:45,"which is the weight equivalent of what you have to hold when you're pulling back the arrow,"
00:16:45,00:16:53,"was up to 200 pounds, which is 14 stone. So, is the equivalent of lifting up a 14 stone person,"
00:16:53,00:16:58,"just with your right hand, as you draw the bow and arrow. Wow. And when you look at skeleton"
00:16:58,00:17:03,"of archers, you can identify them because they have elongated bones and like swollen bones in"
00:17:03,00:17:10,"that arrow arm, and they have marks where they would have had the bow. So, on their wrist and their shoulder."
00:17:10,00:17:15,"So, lots of these guys, the archers, the Battle of Azure Core, who all English and Welsh,"
00:17:15,00:17:23,"they were naked from the waist down. No, like Donald Duck, it's all seen. Interesting,"
00:17:23,00:17:32,"Donald Duck and Fire, ten arrows in there, huge draw strength. No way. They had terrible diarrhea,"
00:17:32,00:17:37,they had dysentery. Oh yeah. It was a huge problem. They were completely exhausted before the battle.
00:17:37,00:17:41,"They'd been marching many miles a day for about a fortnight, they were in enemy territory,"
00:17:41,00:17:46,"they'd won one battle, and Henry just really wanted to get them home, but he had to march around"
00:17:46,00:17:52,"France a bit, so it wasn't a completely wasted journey. As in, they won the siege of Half-Flaur,"
00:17:52,00:17:55,"and then he said, ""Well, we could go just home immediately,"" but he spent a lot of time"
00:17:55,00:17:59,"and money raising the funds for this war, so he sort of was embarrassed, and all the men had dysentery,"
00:17:59,00:18:04,and so they just sort of cut off their trousers and... Why didn't they just pull them down?
00:18:04,00:18:08,I have ridden the guns like they cut them off. That's why it's bad.
00:18:08,00:18:18,"I actually read the main opponent who would have been, so obviously Henry the fifth was fighting"
00:18:18,00:18:22,"on the English side, and it would have been Charles the sixth who was fighting on the French side,"
00:18:22,00:18:27,"but he couldn't fight because he was a severely mentally ill, people think now he has schizophrenia,"
00:18:27,00:18:31,"and he also had this thing called glass delusion where he thought he was made of glass,"
00:18:31,00:18:37,so he couldn't really move or walk very much. But one of the things that his servants had to do
00:18:37,00:18:42,"was cut his clothes off him, because he never washed, and so his clothes had hit him so much"
00:18:42,00:18:46,"that eventually they kept on having to cut off his clothes. Yeah, so he, in a way, suffered an"
00:18:46,00:18:53,exactly the same way those guys in battle did without having to be there. So the place actually
00:18:53,00:18:59,"is called Azzincor, not Azzincor, isn't it? Yeah. It's a French town called Azzincor,"
00:18:59,00:19:04,and we've just kind of anglicised it. There is a battlefield museum there. It's shaped like a
00:19:04,00:19:09,"longbow, which is quite cool. It's not the first museum that was there. There was one before,"
00:19:09,00:19:16,"which was quite a lot cheaper actually, and they had a model of the battle where the knights were"
00:19:16,00:19:22,made out of action-man figures. Was they naked from the waist down?
00:19:22,00:19:30,"I was looking on Wikipedia for a list of famous archers, Geoffrey."
00:19:30,00:19:45,"It's a great list of Robin Hood's honours, citation-needed, and I read a familiar name,"
00:19:45,00:19:50,"so I quickly clicked into it. It's a guy called Mad Jack Churchill, who, if you don't know him,"
00:19:50,00:19:56,is the greatest World War II eccentric hero you could ever learn about. So he used to go into
00:19:56,00:20:06,"war with a longbow, sometimes a sword, and most times bagpipes. He was just an eccentric,"
00:20:06,00:20:11,"and so he's, yeah, he's credited as the only person in World War II to take the longbow, amazing."
00:20:11,00:20:17,"Do you know how Henry V funded his war? In Urgent Court, the 100th his war. He crowd-funded."
00:20:17,00:20:24,"He wrote begging letters to lots of his friends and to towns, and then he also lent them royal"
00:20:24,00:20:28,"jewellery and stuff, and one of the people who lent them money was Dick Wittington."
00:20:28,00:20:34,"Isn't that weird? Yeah, it was a real person Dick Wittington. He was a rich cloth merchant,"
00:20:34,00:20:35,"and he'd fund it. Oh no, he wasn't."
00:20:41,00:20:42,"All right, Jen, he's behind you."
00:20:42,00:20:53,"I don't see. Yeah. So in America a couple of years ago, they had a debate in a university about whether"
00:20:53,00:20:59,"Henry V should be on guilty of war crimes, because after the Battle of Aging Corps, he did, I think,"
00:20:59,00:21:06,"kill a load of French prisoners, didn't he? So former US solicitor General Gregory Garry,"
00:21:06,00:21:10,who was arguing against Henry V said that he didn't have a legitimate claim to the French
00:21:10,00:21:17,"throne because he traced his claim back only six generations. And Canon Shen Mungam,"
00:21:17,00:21:22,"who was arguing on the other side, just said war against France is inherently lawful."
00:21:22,00:21:36,"Okay. All right, well, let's move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski."
00:21:36,00:21:41,"Yeah, my fact this week is that right-handed marmosets are braver than left-handed marmosets."
00:21:41,00:21:52,"This is true. How? Well, various ways. So they can tell how, if marmosets are right or left-handed,"
00:21:52,00:21:56,"based on what objects, what hand they choose to pick up their objects with. So you put an object"
00:21:56,00:22:00,"in front of them, and if they pick up with the right hand, they're right-handed, et cetera."
00:22:00,00:22:06,And it's about 50/50 split right and left-handed in marmosets. And it turns out the left-handed ones
00:22:06,00:22:11,"when they're faced with a predator, they freeze for longer, so they take longer to move and run away."
00:22:11,00:22:18,They are much more cautious about sniffing out or tasting kind of new food. They have a more
00:22:18,00:22:30,negative outlook. I don't think about the Chinese economy. So the way we know this is that they were
00:22:30,00:22:36,"trained to, they were given white bowls and black bowls, and in one colour there would be a reward,"
00:22:36,00:22:41,"and in the other colour there wouldn't. And they were trained to choose the bowls with the reward,"
00:22:41,00:22:47,and to not choose the ones without the reward. And then they started giving the marmosets grey bowls.
00:22:47,00:22:53,"And the right-handed marmosets took the grey bowl. They were like, it's a lot like the white bowl."
00:22:53,00:22:56,I'm just going to have it. It's probably got the food in it. And the left-handed marmosets didn't
00:22:56,00:23:00,"tell you, because I thought, so it looks a lot like the black bowl to me. I'm not going to. I bet it"
00:23:00,00:23:04,hasn't been in the industry. It's all self-empty and glass all full thing. Exactly! Are we all
00:23:04,00:23:10,"right-handers around this table? Oh, I'm left-handed. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm terrified."
00:23:10,00:23:17,"So you are, so humans are more fearful as well if they're left-handed. Really? There's a"
00:23:17,00:23:22,"higher correlation. So for instance, the way they tested this, one of the ways a bunch of studies"
00:23:22,00:23:27,"have shown it, but they've showed people, silence the lambs, the film. And then they questioned"
00:23:27,00:23:31,them afterwards about certain scenes and asked them to recount certain scenes. And the left-handed
00:23:31,00:23:36,people stammered and started and freaked out and screamed as they were recounting scenes.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"You've seen that movie, aren't you? No, I've heard scenes."
00:23:38,00:23:41,The sound of music was on the other side.
00:23:41,00:23:46,"But you say, I'm biscuit of that. It's not music."
00:23:49,00:23:54,Isn't it the case that the world is just better equipped in sort of our technology and so on
00:23:54,00:23:59,"for right-handed people? Yeah. So anyone in a situation volunteering, who will play this guitar?"
00:23:59,00:24:03,Most likely it's a right-handed guitar. Who might want to play this guitar? Where's Andrew?
00:24:03,00:24:07,"He might like, I just can't play this guitar. Who will cut this paper with these scissors?"
00:24:07,00:24:13,"I'll cut this paper with these because they will be right-handed scissors. Like, surely, we"
00:24:13,00:24:17,volunteer for more stuff as right-handed people. That's very good theory. You should take it to
00:24:17,00:24:26,"the theorizers. So the Roman poet Horace, when he made a mistake, he wrote ""Ego Liveus"", which we"
00:24:26,00:24:31,"translate as silly me, it actually means ""left-handed me"". Oh, really? Yeah, there's a long history of this"
00:24:31,00:24:35,"stuff. Yeah, people don't like left-handed people. We don't have a stand for it in that way, well."
00:24:35,00:24:43,"It's terrifying. That's amazing about Mama Says. Yeah, it's really cool. I mean, and we think it"
00:24:43,00:24:49,extrapolates to humans. But Mama Says are great. So one thing they've learned to do is learn from
00:24:49,00:24:55,"instructional videos. A Mama Says was taught how to extract an object that it wanted from a box,"
00:24:55,00:25:00,"though, you know, a well-loct box. And then it was filmed extracting that object once it had been"
00:25:00,00:25:05,"taught to do that. And then the film of the Mama Says doing that was placed in a room or a case,"
00:25:05,00:25:10,"or whatever, with other Mama Says. And the Mama Says watched the film, and then they were given"
00:25:10,00:25:15,"the box, and they imitated what happened in the film. Which is quite cool. Given that my cats don't"
00:25:15,00:25:24,"know their own reflection. So, I'm just thinking, I bet there's people listening at home who didn't"
00:25:24,00:25:29,know what Mama Says are. And you've just got 10 minutes talking about them. Are they mamas or are they
00:25:29,00:25:35,"mamas? I don't know, but they're mamas. Yeah, mamas says, you love them when you hate them, yeah. Yeah. We've got"
00:25:35,00:25:46,"prejudices to this for earlier, actually. The little tiny monkeys that live in South America aren't they?"
00:25:46,00:25:52,They don't have wisdom teeth. That's one thing about them. They're the only primates with like tactile
00:25:52,00:25:57,hairs that can kind of feel things. They have them on the wrists. They go into topper every day when
00:25:57,00:26:02,"the sun is hotter, so they kind of fall asleep, like have a siesta every day when it gets really hot,"
00:26:02,00:26:08,"like Spanish people. Oh, cool. And they're the only primates apart from humans where you can stare"
00:26:08,00:26:17,"into their eyes, and they won't think you'll be in aggressive. They also, I read a new report about"
00:26:17,00:26:21,"finding about them, is that their parents teach them not to interrupt them when they're talking. Yeah,"
00:26:21,00:26:26,"it's a thing. So, basically, if you ever hear Mama Says talking to each other, they don't interrupt"
00:26:26,00:26:35,"each other. Well, actually, this is an interesting thing. Yeah, they do a thing, and they actually train"
00:26:35,00:26:40,"their children to not talk over them. If the child talks over them, they'll give them the silent"
00:26:40,00:26:45,"treatment. So, every Mama said conversation is really civilised. Although, they are, so they've"
00:26:45,00:26:49,"been compared to humans, because they are like that with conversation. They do what humans do,"
00:26:49,00:26:54,"which is if one of them starts talking faster or making, and it's cool a bit quicker,"
00:26:54,00:26:58,"then the other one will imitate, as we do in conversation. But they don't interrupt each other."
00:26:58,00:27:04,"They do leave five to six second pauses after one Mama said has spoken before they speak,"
00:27:04,00:27:09,"which I think is not as sophisticated as humans, where we are capable of when I stop talking,"
00:27:09,00:27:13,"presumably, it will not be an awkward six second pause before somebody else speaks."
00:27:20,00:27:27,"No, certainly not. All right, let's wrap it up on that. Thank you so much, guys, for listening. That's"
