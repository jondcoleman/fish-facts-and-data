00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.840
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.720
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.400
 and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.720
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.920
 My fact is that it's very hard for scientists to spot Armadillo's having sex because Armadillo's

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.600
 have sex while running. How fast do they run? Too fast to see them.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.120
 They would show up on film and in photos, but it's just a mating habit that they have,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.520
 so whenever the Armadillo female is in heat, she may also start chasing her, but then she

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.560
 starts running away, so it's all the matter of the fastest Armadillo who can catch up

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.240
 with her, but she doesn't stop running when he's caught up.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.880
 So they engage in sex, mid-like passing a baton on to her, it's baton, disgusting baton.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.160
 Dan, in relays, did you support onto the baton all the way around?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.560
 No, but he used to hold onto the penis of the guy in front of him.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.200
 Well, we got there quite quickly, didn't we?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.000
 Yeah, it's amazing because they look like little battery-operated toys because the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 female is just running along and you can't really see their legs moving and the male

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.360
 mounts the female, but he then has to run along only on his hind legs while he's mounted

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 her.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.000
 Wow. Like a wheelbarrow race, I don't think so.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.400
 Your spot's day must have been awful.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.200
 It's this all Armadillo's because there's quite a lot of different types in there.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.960
 I'm not sure. This was only observed in one species, so I don't think we can say for sure.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.360
 Or I certainly can't.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.240
 Do you know, is it the nine, which one?

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.560
 I think it's the nine.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 The nine.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 Oh, the nine.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 It's amazing.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:18.080
 I mean, it's the full name is the nine-banded Armadillo, to be fair, I'm not sure anyone's

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.920
 ever called it the nine before, but I'm sorry.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
 Oh, I really hope it's not.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920
 I'm going to check though.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
 Sure.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.680
 But yeah, presumably they don't massively like it because they generally don't like each

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 other to the Armadillos.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.680
 They're very solitary.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.680
 That's true.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.560
 Yeah, because the women, the female Armadillos are always kind of, I was going to say, beating

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.880
 off, but they're trying to get the male away, aren't they?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 Yeah.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.600
 Most of the time, until they're on heat and then they kind of accept it a little better.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600
 Yeah.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 They're running away.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 That's true.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 It is a bit like the Benny Hill show.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 Yes.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.600
 Yeah.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.960
 So the nine-banded Armadillo, if that's who we are talking about.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960
 The nine.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960
 The nine.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960
 Yeah.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960
 Don't always have nine.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960
 Did I know?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.960
 Sometimes have seven or eleven.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.960
 Yeah.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960
 Yeah.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.440
 I think that's just a mean average that they have.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.440
 That's a mean average you got there.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440
 It's the six.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440
 No.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440
 I'm sorry.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440
 This is the six-banded Armadillo.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440
 Okay.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.280
 Is that because the one you generally hear about is the nine-banded, isn't it, which is

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280
 the one that lives in...

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.080
 Like, that's the one when people talk about Armadillos.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.840
 It tends to be the nine-banded Armadillo, because that's the only one that lives in North

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840
 America.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 It's true, although...

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.920
 Maybe we could talk about nine-banded Armadillos.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 The one that kind of goes into a ball is the three-banded Armadillo.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 Yeah.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920
 All the three, as we call it.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.920
 All three.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.920
 Yeah.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.520
 There are 20 species of Armadillo, and only two can roll themselves up.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520
 Yeah.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.520
 Who swizzed?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520
 Indeed.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.960
 The favorite Armadillo, and this is the Armadillo I'm mainly read into, is the...

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.280
 Which one is it, guys?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.280
 Who is it?

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
 The three?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280
 The 29.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.240
 No, my favorite Armadillo is the Pink Fairy Armadillo, and they are so amazing.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.560
 Get up a picture of a Pink Fairy Armadillo while you're listening to the rest of this.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 I'm for the rest of your life.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.680
 They're the cutest thing I've ever seen, so they're the smallest kind.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.200
 They're six inches long.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200
 They've got pink shell.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.480
 This little pink shell, like baby pink, a fluffy white belly.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.120
 And they're just so cute, and they've got these massive front claws, which are almost a

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.480
 bit grotesque, because they're only for digging, so they can't really walk properly.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.440
 They can only dig, but yeah, they can bury themselves in a couple of seconds, so if something

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.240
 comes along, their shells are actually useless.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.320
 In most Armadillos, they're not very good protection of the shells, but they just bury

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.320
 themselves immediately.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.320
 And yeah, they are so cute.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320
 And they're really fluffy.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.320
 They sound like Pokemon.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320
 Yeah.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.320
 They've got fluffy belly.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320
 They are a bit like Pokemon.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.840
 They're very soft-shelled, and their shell is pink because they use it for thermoregulation,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.360
 so they can pump loads of blood to it, and that just gets rid of all the excess heat in

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 their body.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.360
 Right.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.400
 And they've got a bump plate when they're digging, when they're digging through the earth.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.760
 They have a little bump plate, which just compacts all the earth behind them.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.880
 So that means that it creates like a really strong burrow, doesn't it?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.960
 And also it means that they get the earth out of their face, so they can breathe.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.560
 It's got a square bump, basically, and it bumps up against the earth to compact it, like

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.560
 you would with a spade if you batched a spade on it.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.160
 And the opposite of that, have we ever talked about the glypsodon, which was the prehistoric

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.160
 Armadillo?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.280
 Which was so big that humans used its shells for shelters.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.280
 Whoa!

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.280
 What?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280
 So we lived inside the shell.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.280
 Oh my God.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280
 This is pretty amazing.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.080
 And it had like a, it was about the size of a car.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080
 What?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.480
 And it had like a club tail that it would bash humans with.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.480
 My Lord.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.440
 Yeah, no, I would do that, as well as when I was living inside my shell.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.440
 I think that-

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.640
 Do you think they took the Armadillo out first?

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640
 Okay.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.640
 I think death took it out first, and then it was just-

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640
 I don't know, actually.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640
 That is incredible.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.240
 Okay, today living inside your car is seen as a sign of someone who's down in your luck.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.600
 Do you think in the old days living inside an Armadillo shell was the same thing?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 Oh, he's living inside his Armadillo shell.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600
 He's had a rough time.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600
 I like it.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.920
 Have we ever lived in a shell outside of that?

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.920
 I can't think of an example of another animal where-

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.920
 That's so cool.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.920
 That's good.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920
 Yeah.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.920
 You always find the most weird angles on the except-

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.920
 I mean, probably not.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920
 Wow.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.920
 The first instance of humans living in shells-

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
 It's so cool.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.920
 Yeah.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.160
 Can I take us back to the nine for a second?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160
 Yeah.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
 So they have a really interesting-

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.480
 This is just- I was looking into the sex life of the Armadillo off the back of your fact,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.480
 Andy.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.240
 So nine, the nine, has quadruplets every single time.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240
 Every single time they have a baby.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 So the baby basically splits a single fertilized egg, but it splits it so that they're effectively

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.200
 clones of each other.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 Yeah.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.320
 Those of them do it, but I think most Armadillos might have quadruplets every time.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.320
 Wow.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320
 Yeah.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.840
 But because they're identical, it's to prevent, inbreeding, is that right?

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.920
 Or prevent, incest?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920
 An accidental.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.920
 But how would that prevent it if they're all-

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.360
 Well, if all four quads that you have are males, then they would be able to agree with each

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360
 other at least.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.360
 Got it.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 Yeah.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.360
 And the nine band did is the state small mammal of Texas-

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.360
 Is it?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360
 Was it a large one?

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360
 It's-

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.680
 I didn't write it down.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.680
 It does have one.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.200
 It's a kind of deer or something.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200
 Okay.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 So there's a state small mammal of Texas.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200
 There's a state large mammal.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.040
 There's a state flying mammal, which is a kind of bat.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.040
 And there's also a state welk.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.160
 I didn't even know there was more than one kind of welk.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.480
 Everyone's state welk is the same.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.280
 Something that's very cool about Armadillos is that they have two ways of crossing water

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.400
 and both are equally groovy.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400
 So they-

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.920
 They try more, Nana.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.920
 They inflate their stomach and intestines with air if they want to float.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.560
 So they fancy looking at the view and then they just float across the water or they can deflate

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.920
 themselves and sink right down to the bottom and then they just walk along the bottom using

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.920
 their claws.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.920
 And they can hold their breath a bit of fantastic menace.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.920
 So cool.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920
 That's amazing.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920
 Do you think they have races like where one-

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.920
 Of course they do.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.920
 Yeah.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.920
 It's like when there's two escalators in the tube going up, you always go one on each so

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920
 that you can see who goes quickest.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920
 Do you?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920
 No.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.480
 I thought there was usually one up and one down otherwise how does everyone get down the

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480
 stairs?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.680
 So there's often three in tubes and there's always two going up and one going down and that's

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.760
 because people coming down they come at a regular amount of time but people going up they

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.960
 all come off the train at the same time so there's more people at the same time.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 That's really interesting.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960
 Well.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.440
 I think that's really interesting.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440
 That makes more sense.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.760
 I thought it was for rush hour when you know if there are loads of people going into

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.160
 the station, like at the end of the day you'll have two, mate you might have two going down

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.040
 because you would occasionally do that but almost always they have two going up.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.040
 A whole lot of sense.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.040
 Have we talked about the leprosy thing?

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040
 No.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.680
 No, but you should get that checked out.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.680
 So they got the disease from humans.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.680
 We know that.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.480
 So this is Hansen's disease as you're supposed to call it but most people call it leprosy.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.480
 Exactly.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.240
 So they're native to the new world, the Americas.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.880
 So when humans first arrived we know that they brought over leprosy, Hansen's disease with

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:57.480
 them at some point but as a result they're really good at carrying it because their body temperature

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.080
 is 34 degrees Celsius on the inside and the leprosy bacterium loves that temperature.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.520
 It's ideal for it.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.400
 We're actually not ideal for the 37 or something now but for some reason, they live in our skin

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.200
 the bacteria which is a bit cooler so they can survive there.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.940
 So a lot of people eat armadillo in Brazil but unfortunately 60% of the armadillos in the

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.940
 forest have it and it's okay as long as you cook it all the way through but some people

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.140
 have the liver raw so you can get leprosy that way or some people keep them in their homes

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.540
 to fathom them up and obviously the more close contact you have with an armadillo the

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.540
 more likely you are.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.220
 And actually most humans are immune to leprosy.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.220
 That's true.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.220
 But the ones that aren't.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.220
 You're bugging.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.220
 You're bugging.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.220
 Yeah.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.420
 So I think the lesson is I mean I was always taught you can eat rare steak and rare lamb

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.820
 but don't eat rare chicken and rare armadillo.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.500
 I think that's what you have to take away from this isn't it?

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.980
 Armadillo shells can rebound bullets.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.660
 People have found out in America to their detriment which I find.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.820
 It seems like most people are basically okay but yeah in 2015 a man was taken to hospital

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.900
 with injuries when he was working up by armadillos and a bit of a pest in America because they

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.900
 destroyed gardens.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.860
 He was working up at 3am so he went and shot the armadillo and the bullet rebounded in

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.860
 him in the face.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.860
 He was okay.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.860
 He survived.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.860
 He was okay.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.860
 Yeah.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.860
 How was the armadillo?

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.860
 They don't know about the armadillo.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.860
 They don't know afterwards.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.860
 Oh.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.740
 Well that implies it survived at least.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.740
 It walked away.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.500
 No it could have ricocheted away into another garden.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500
 That's true.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.460
 I don't know if that's how armadillos work.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.020
 You're thinking when you jump on a turtle in Super Mario and they go skating away.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.300
 I was thinking of that.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.300
 Yeah.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.540
 I thought so.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.660
 The walking underwater thing with the armadillo feels a bit risky to me.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.660
 I would.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.660
 Would you?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.020
 Would you do the floating though because it feels like with the floating you're kind

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.020
 of at the risk of currents and stuff like that.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.020
 And predators.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.020
 You're much more exposed.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.700
 Well they can only hold their breath for six minutes.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.380
 So I guess if you want to escape a predator you could quickly deflate and sink to the bottom.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.980
 But as long as you're never more than three minutes away from the edge of the river.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.580
 I guess you just have to know though.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.580
 That's the problem.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.580
 That's the river.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.580
 And you get to a big rock underwater.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.860
 And you got to take a detour to see.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.060
 There is a scene just like a submission of possible five.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.060
 It's them.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.060
 Yeah there is.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.060
 So.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.060
 Are you sure that's the five?

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.060
 I thought that was the nine.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.060
 Okay.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:25.220
 It is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.580
 Okay my fat this week is that the car why people of New Guinea put grubs in their ears to

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.580
 eat their earwax.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.580
 So great.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.580
 So great.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.100
 And then what do they put in their ear to eat the grubs?

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.100
 A cow.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.100
 Do they put it in?

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.100
 That's going right to the end.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.100
 Yeah.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.620
 So yeah this is a thing.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.220
 These are a tribe from New Guinea.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.820
 There's lots of interesting stuff about them but one thing that a lot of people learned in

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.500
 the last year or so was there was a TV show on BBC2 called My Year with the Tribe.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.020
 presenter Will Millard.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.180
 Let a grub crawl into his ear and eat his earwax in this documentary which everyone thought

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.180
 was a bit weird.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.180
 Yeah.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.580
 But didn't the tribe have the courage to say at the time that the elders used to do this?

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.940
 We don't really do it anymore so we've forgotten how it's done but shove it in and see what

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.940
 happens.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.460
 Maybe it's one of those things that you just get foreigners in and you just make the

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.620
 do stuff and say that it's traditional.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.980
 Is there a way of getting it out though?

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.820
 It just slivers out itself apparently and it's slightly darker in colour having eaten

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.820
 all your earwax.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.820
 Wow.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.820
 That's quite cool.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.220
 And he said he could hear it eating it inside his ear couldn't he?

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.420
 It was like I can hear it munching away and that would be the spot that you would get the

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.420
 very access to hearing.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.220
 I mean that doesn't surprise me.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.860
 Yeah he's a, I've really like Will Millard I realise of course researching this.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.940
 He's a lot of very cool stuff but yeah he went to Papua and lived with those people for

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.860
 a few months I think but he had an extremely bad time he seems to have very bad luck and

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.500
 he's actually got PTSD now from being basically doing all these documentaries in these extreme

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.500
 places.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.620
 And one of the points in Papua he said I made a serious error of judgement that saw me

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.300
 not on an ancient intertribal trade route but trapped deep within a 400 mile square of uninhabited

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.940
 snake infested and extremely hostile forest.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.020
 We crawled out a month later elacerated and covered in infections but yet he's had cerebral

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:22.740
 malaria, he's been you know assaulted, he's been robbed at Bowen Arrow Point.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.740
 Yeah.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.980
 Which is kind of a cool life experience.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.980
 Yeah.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.980
 It's become the trauma.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.660
 I thought it was a different programme wasn't it but the beef got in a bit of trouble because

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.180
 the worldwide traditionally live in tree houses and the beef made a show program all about

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.740
 the building the tree houses and then it turned out that they'd sort of said can you build

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.740
 as a tree house for this programme?

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.460
 Well that was Will Millard who discovered it.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.460
 Oh really?

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.740
 That was when he went back and did this programme and they said when those last BBC see guys

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:51.140
 came they told us to build that tree house and he was the one who said well that's not

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.140
 on.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.140
 I'm going to mention the trade.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.140
 Wow right.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.460
 But so is it a myth?

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.300
 It's not a myth that they'd live in tree houses.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.300
 No they do.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.300
 No they do.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.820
 So I don't think that's that bad to ask them to build the tree house.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.820
 Some of them, no.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.300
 Those ones did not live in tree houses like that.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.100
 They said we would never build tree houses that high.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.100
 Right.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.100
 Got it.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.100
 Some of them live on the ground but some of them I think still live in tree houses.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.940
 There are about 4,000 worldwide people alive.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.940
 Yeah.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.940
 There aren't very many of them.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.940
 Yeah.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:25.060
 So there were rumours that the worldwide people sometimes engaged in cannibalism but they

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.300
 got asked about it and they said no we would never eat a person.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:33.220
 What we would eat is a cacqua which is a witch who takes the form of a person.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.220
 Yeah.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.020
 And this doesn't happen anymore but 10 years ago it was in living memory so it happened

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.220
 a few decades ago.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.220
 And the basically...

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.220
 A decade in fact.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.220
 Oh.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.220
 Yeah.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.780
 But the cacqua is basically their version of germ theory.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.900
 So they like when someone dies they say what's this because germ theory is not very well

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.180
 known they assumed it was a witch.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.460
 So when a clan member was dying he would whisper to his relatives the name of who he thought

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.860
 was the witch who had killed him.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.100
 It's such a good way to take out someone who just kind of been pissing you out for a while.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.940
 I think this is a great deathbed practice we should adopt but then it's very much open

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.540
 to abuse isn't it from the person who heard the whisper, the only person who heard

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.540
 the whisper.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.540
 Yeah.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.540
 That's true.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.740
 But this is, I mean I think there were quite a lot of worldwide spread around in different

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.060
 groups of worldwide and there was a guy Paul Raphael who famously went there in 2006 and

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:32.340
 he went very deep in and he met one who was still a famous cacqua killer who showed him

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:38.540
 a skull and stuff and ate the skull in front of him and yeah so who knows apparently it

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.780
 tastes like, he asked what it, what human flesh tastes like and it tastes like cassowari.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.700
 Okay so everyone wanted it so now you can picture it.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.820
 I've got something on earwax but I don't know if you guys have heard of it or a way stuff.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.100
 In the middle ages earwax was used to colour manuscript in.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.100
 Cool.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.860
 Yeah or to colour the ink used for manuscript in part.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.860
 I was going to say for the ink yeah.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.340
 Yeah it was partly earwax.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.340
 Wow.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.340
 Partly stale beer.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.180
 What do you mean they mix the ink up with an earwax as one of the ingredients?

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.180
 Yeah.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.180
 Cool.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.100
 Yeah so some of those ancient beautiful documents will be partly earwax, monk earwax

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.100
 probably.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.100
 Yeah.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.100
 Yeah.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.100
 That's the worst.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.700
 Interesting you say about beer and earwax.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.620
 We read once when we were researching for QI that if you put earwax in someone's beer then

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.940
 all the froth will disappear from the top of the beer and we tried to do it as an experiment

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.020
 on the show but it didn't work.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.340
 But it did enhance the taste.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.140
 I don't think anyone actually drank it in the end.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.140
 Who's earwax did you go?

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.140
 I can't remember.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.140
 Yeah.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.340
 I probably produce a pair of fletcher's earwax.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.780
 But yeah we did try it but the idea is because it's got oil in, isn't it?

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.300
 And the idea is that oil would kind of pop the bubbles a little bit.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.300
 I think so.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.820
 I think that monks did too.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.820
 I don't think they did.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.820
 Did they?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.820
 I thought they were dead beer.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.420
 They sort of, well when they were painting the manuscripts it was the way they prevented bubbles

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.500
 from forming in the liquid was called was called it was called glare which was these

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500
 to make the paints.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500
 Right.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.460
 Supposedly to stop the froth forming on the glare they put their earwax out of that.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:15.300
 So was earwax sort of a lucrative business to be in if you generated a lot.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.300
 It's huge.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.820
 It must be a traded thing right?

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.340
 You know I'm writing a book at the moment.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.340
 I'm not sure it must be.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.340
 I think everyone has already supplied up.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.180
 Well some people, you can't corner the market in earwax though.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.740
 No you could even most productive earwax.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.180
 I guess you could go house to house collecting people's earwax.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.180
 Yeah.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.900
 I've been selling a jar of it because they had gong farmers didn't they who would collect

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.820
 people's poo for you know for fertiliser and stuff and everyone has a plentiful supply

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.820
 of that.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.820
 Yeah.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.820
 You might as well get earwax at the same time you're saying.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.820
 Yeah.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.060
 I wonder where socially the gong farmer done collector and the earwax collector are next

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.060
 to each other.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.260
 I think they have Christmas parties together.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.260
 Yeah.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.140
 There's no one else invites them.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.560
 We could have traded earwax though with the far east because they've got different earwax

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560
 to us, don't they?

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560
 I don't know.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:10.940
 But East Asian countries, so in China and Japan, Korea, the gene has changed so their earwax

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.640
 is kind of powdery and I think doesn't taste as gross.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.920
 So well because it's like powder in it doesn't have the bitterness that arse hasn't.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.520
 It's not as gloopy with vast majority.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.520
 But who's taste?

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.520
 Is that a thing?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.360
 No I've actually just assumed that because I've read about it and it doesn't contain the

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360
 stuff that makes arse.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.360
 It makes sense, isn't it?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.360
 No it makes sense.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.900
 I've found it like that was a thing that people taste.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.680
 You know how like some people eat their buggers?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.040
 No but you know sometimes when you put your finger in your ear and you accidentally put

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.160
 your finger in your mouth and it's absolutely right.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.360
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.360
 They don't have that.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.080
 You know when you accidentally put your finger in someone from East Asia's earwax, we put

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.080
 that in your mouth, yes.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.080
 Where will these?

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.600
 I'm not allowed back to Korea.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.640
 Well there were people who tasted your earwax.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.560
 There were doctors in ancient Greece.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.840
 That was the whole theory because it was all about the theory of the humours, you know the

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.840
 different substances that made up your body.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.400
 So Hippocrates said there were particular tastes for bodily fluids.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.760
 So he would taste your earwax, your doctor, and he might lick your vomit or run his fingers

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.840
 through your flim to check the consistency.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.040
 So he probably got up close.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.040
 That's so cool.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.040
 It's so unromantic.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.240
 He ran his fingers through her flim.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:32.080
 Do you know what's the most common thing, the most common living thing to get in your ear?

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.080
 Earwig.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.040
 You would have thought, but they don't seem to do it as much.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.040
 An ant.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.040
 Larger in fact.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.040
 A spider.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040
 Spider.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.520
 No, I'm going to let you know.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.520
 A spider.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.520
 Giant armadillo.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520
 Please don't.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.520
 Is it a nine?

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.520
 It's a three.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.520
 It's got me three.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.720
 The very little, the pink fairy.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.720
 The pink fairy.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.720
 I love banded cockroaches.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.960
 It's just a cockroach.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.960
 Cockroaches love ears.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.960
 Oh my god.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.560
 And yeah, and that's by far the most common creature to go in your ear.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.240
 And it's because they've got this thing, and I'd never heard of this word.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.520
 They've got positive thigmataxis.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.360
 And thigmataxis describes how much you like the stimulus of touch.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.800
 So some animals will have negative thigmataxis, so they don't want to be touched.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.800
 And cockroaches want their whole body to be touched all the time.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.640
 So they're so needy, aren't they?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.640
 They're so clingy.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.720
 They love a massage.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.040
 Full body massage every single time, never just the shoulders.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.160
 But that's where they love ears.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.280
 So they go in because they like being in tiny little nooks and crannies.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.480
 And that's why they'll always squeeze into little cracks in your house.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.680
 And also they quite like the fatty acids.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.640
 Do any of us know someone who's found the cockroach in there?

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.640
 I don't.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.840
 And none of my friends has told me.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.720
 Does anyone know anyone who's found anything in there yet?

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.160
 It's still not as common as the common cold.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.920
 And also we don't really have cockroaches in this country very much.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920
 Do you not?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.920
 Not as much.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.120
 No, we don't, Dan, person who's lived here for about 14 years.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.360
 I thought I had reported turvites the other day, and my house turns out they're not in

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.360
 England.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.360
 What?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.600
 The guy in the photo was like, that's fascinating.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.600
 I'll be over as soon as possible.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.880
 I was like, wow, he was keen.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.200
 They were flying ants.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200
 Oh my God.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200
 He just says.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.080
 I read on a BBC source that some of the earliest lit bombs were made of earwax.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.240
 Like, I don't believe it.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.240
 I regret mentioning it now.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.600
 Oh, thanks for bringing it to me.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.840
 Are they saying ancient Egyptians and stuff like that?

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840
 Yeah.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840
 But I just, it would taste better.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.440
 But what if they were Asian earwax?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.440
 Doesn't that taste fantastic?

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.840
 No, that's dry and crumbly.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.600
 So that does taste fantastic.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.080
 You've taken the wrong thing from out there.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.480
 It does feel like someone's open to tub of calmex.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.120
 Thought that looks a lot like earwax.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120
 Here's a room out.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.920
 I don't need to know.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.760
 I read that in bits of Asia, so India and China.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.480
 Your picking is seen as a nice pampering thing to do, really enjoyable.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.680
 So so much to the point where you can have it done on the side of streets.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680
 There's vendors.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.680
 And so luxurious.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.680
 You can get it done on the side.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680
 Yeah.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.680
 And so there's such demand.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.680
 It's a career.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.680
 Yeah.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.680
 It's a dying career, though.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.680
 Because young people are more attractive.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680
 Or they're on their phones.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.680
 They don't want to have their ears picked by a stranger.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.680
 In the public.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.240
 You can be on your phone and have your earpicks at the same time.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240
 Yeah.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.240
 That's right.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.240
 It's one of the few things you can do.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.160
 People at once on two different phones.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.160
 Sure.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.960
 I forgot you could use phones to phone people.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.040
 But it's true that they have this whole set of picks, don't they?

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040
 Yeah.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.040
 Is there a cleaning guy on their spoon at home?

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.040
 Do you?

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.040
 And it lights up.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.040
 So you can see inside the ear when you're picking stuff.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040
 But you can't.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040
 What does ever mirror?

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.040
 No, no, you do it for other people.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.080
 Like you've said, it's like, yeah, yeah.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.560
 But I don't use it, by the way.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.560
 It's a spot.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.560
 It's a career.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.760
 But the thing is that cotton buds are being banned in the UK.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.840
 So there's every chance of the year spoon or the roving ear cleaner could make a comeback.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840
 Post Brexit.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.080
 No smart phones, but here's your roving ear cleaner.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.080
 Thanks Boris.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:07.560
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.800
 And that is my fact.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.520
 My fact this week is that the biggest single biomedical laboratory in Europe designed to

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.880
 encourage scientists to chat more to each other is so noisy that scientists are actually

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.640
 complaining it's too hard to concentrate.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.760
 This is an amazing building that's up in London.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.720
 It's in the Houston area.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.480
 And it is it's ginormous.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.080
 It's it's 1,250 people work there.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.280
 They're collaborating from different fields of medicine.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.160
 And it's the Francis Quick Institute, isn't it?

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160
 That's right.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.840
 It's called the Francis Quick Institute or it's nickname.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.640
 So it's run the head of it is Sir Paul Nurse who is a Nobel Prize winning scientist.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.920
 So it's nickname is Sir Paul's Cathedral, which is quite a cool name.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.920
 Yeah.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.400
 And he had influence over the design, didn't he?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.080
 And he said that he wanted the atmosphere to encourage a gentle sort of anarchy.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.240
 So yeah, you don't necessarily want the scientists to talk to each other all the time, I suppose

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240
 is what we're saying.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.440
 Sometimes you just need to be quiet in a test tube, right?

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440
 Yeah.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.200
 I suppose the problem is it's not in a test tube, sorry, unless you're a test tube, baby.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200
 Yes.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200
 Then stay in your test tube.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.200
 I think there's a difference between creating an atmosphere where people are there to work

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.440
 and collaborate as well as creating a sort of cafe like atmosphere where people just come

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.520
 because they know that that's where their buddies are going to be.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.680
 So I think a lot of people are distracted when they're trying to do quiet work on an idea

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:34.360
 by PhD students coming in who've just graduated or so on and having parties without

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.320
 groups, not without actually having the party but effectively grouped.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.320
 Yeah.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320
 Yeah.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.320
 And this is not everyone who's complaining.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.320
 It's working incredibly well.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.320
 Yeah.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.320
 It's not.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.320
 It's not failed.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.560
 It's literally one dude.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.800
 Do you know what's underneath it?

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.800
 Underneath the...

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:57.360
 Underneath the France's Cric building, it's around about where Boudica was buried, supposedly.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.640
 Oh, well, she's been joined, actually.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.440
 Is it plague?

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.240
 The Boudica plague, probably some plague, sure.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.800
 And also, so it's obviously named after Francis Cric and his son, Mike, is still alive.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.360
 And he donated Cric's California license plate into a time capsule which is buried underneath

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.360
 the building.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.360
 So the ceremony, they buried it.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.360
 Yeah.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.360
 Is there a reason for that?

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360
 I don't know.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.360
 The license plate number was ATGC.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.360
 Yeah.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.600
 So those are the four letters that make up DNA.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600
 So that's what that is.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.600
 Ah.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.600
 That's so clever.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600
 Ah.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.600
 ATGNC.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 Yeah.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.600
 That's cool.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.560
 So that's underneath there.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.560
 Which is what Cric did.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.560
 Which...

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.560
 Ah!

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.560
 Ah!

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.560
 This is all coming together.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.560
 Was it golden?

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.560
 No.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.560
 What's in Cric?

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.560
 What's in Cric?

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560
 What's in Cric?

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.440
 Cric and Watson, as we tend to say, for some reason, Rosalind Franklin.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:54.920
 Rosalind Franklin, who's been left out of the history, but for Pete Best of the DNA.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920
 Yeah.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.920
 If Pete Best had secretly written all the Beatles songs.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.920
 Yeah.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.320
 It's coming to my theory, Pete Best.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.960
 So this thing, is it all about open plan, basically?

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960
 Yeah.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.480
 It's an open plan office.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.080
 To an extent, if you look inside, it's obviously got levels.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.680
 But it's one of those ones where it all looks down into a big courtyard of desks and everything

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680
 seems to be open.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.680
 Yeah.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.680
 Because open plan is very...

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.200
 It's kind of controversial now, right?

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.800
 In fact, I think most studies show that it's a negative thing, has a negative impact

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.800
 on work.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.800
 Really?

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.720
 And it's very trendy, but I get really confused because people talk about open plan as if it's

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.720
 like a trendy cool thing.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.040
 And it seems so obvious to me, surely, the reason we have open plan, and it's generally

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.760
 in Britain and America, is just a hell of a lot cheaper.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.760
 Saves money on walls.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.920
 It just saves a hell of a lot of money.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.200
 You can squash way more people in.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.040
 I think we should stop pretending we're doing it for the good of our employees, for bonding

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.080
 and stuff, and be like, "Sorry, guys, we're cheap."

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.080
 Yeah, we have...

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.880
 How many rooms do we have in this building?

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.880
 We have four.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.480
 We should have a maximum of four members of staff here.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.640
 At any one time, we should all get a room each.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.920
 That's what they have in places like Germany and Scandinavia.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.920
 Everyone will have a room.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.920
 Really?

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.840
 Because that's a better way to work.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.520
 Well, the person who invented cubicles, he was called Robert Props, and he thought that

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.360
 it would be like a dynamic.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.320
 Everyone would have that area, and it would be really dynamic, and you could move around

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.800
 it, and it would be really good for work.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.720
 But of course, what happened was, companies just made them smaller and smaller and smaller

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.800
 until it was the smallest amount that one person could work in, and then obviously it had

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.800
 the upset effect.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800
 Yeah.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.720
 A friend of mine, their office is being relocated completely to a new place that is going to be this

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.000
 open plan layout, but they're taking it a step further now, where no one will have an

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 assigned desk.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 It will be...

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 A hot desk.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.160
 And the theory behind that is that the idea is that's going to encourage more work, because

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.840
 you want to get to work as early as possible to find a good seat next to an influential person,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.920
 because everyone of every level is going to be sitting around this same desk.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.920
 So if you want to get next to the boss, close to them, you arrive at 830 in the morning.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.640
 But what if the boss doesn't come until 10?

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640
 It's the whole thing's a risk.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.120
 You've got to work out the rhythm, see when they arrive, all that sort of stuff.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120
 But in theory, that's...

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.280
 Why we just hide in the toilets, watching the office, and waiting for the boss to arrive.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.400
 But then lots of people hide in the toilets.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400
 More toilets.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:21.240
 Everyone's just going to be following the boss in a way, like a holly out of Delo.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.720
 I'd never heard that as a justification for hot desking, because everyone always claims

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.040
 that's a good thing, hot desking, and you don't have too much your own.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.040
 It is more efficient.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.280
 Because you always do have a couple of people in a big office.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.040
 You'll have ex-people who don't turn up or who are ill or who are travelling for business

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040
 or whatever.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.040
 So, you know, there is a...

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.560
 But it's risky because people leave food on their desk or people leave mugs.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.080
 Leave books, don't they?

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080
 Yeah.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080
 Personal items.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.080
 Yeah.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.080
 Why are you looking at Dan?

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.080
 Why are you looking at me?

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.080
 No reason.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.160
 So, Anna, you know how you stand up at your desk quite a lot?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160
 Yeah.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.600
 That, according to a study, office workers could lose half a stone a year by standing up

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600
 at their desks.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.720
 That's what I'm actually in minus weight now.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.720
 I'm in minus two's turn.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.200
 If I just stood up for the last 12 years that I'd been working at QI, I would now weigh

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.200
 about eight stone.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.680
 I imagine that's how that works.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.680
 Yeah.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.160
 So, I was looking up distraction and concentration and things like that.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.160
 Yeah.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.040
 So, when you're concentrating or when you think you're concentrating, it turns out

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.880
 that if you look at your brain activity, you're actually distracted quite a lot.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:30.560
 So, in between bursts of attention, attention is the study described as a search light that

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.680
 sort of shines on the thing you're reading or the thing you're studying and then shines

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.800
 away again just to see if there's anything more important or dangerous going on that you

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800
 need to know about.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.080
 So, how often do you guess that happens that the brain sort of scans the area and see?

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.080
 Every three minutes.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.080
 Okay.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:51.960
 Okay, 45 seconds.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.520
 It's four times a second.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.520
 Four times a second.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.040
 Is that one of the, you're not getting the elephant done?

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.520
 I'm not like, I totally phased out while you were explaining, brilliant, brilliant, genuinely.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.520
 Yeah.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.520
 To be fair, he was scanning for danger.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520
 Four times a second, no.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.520
 No.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.400
 Yes, and your brain, basically, alters your perception to make you think it's a constant

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.960
 movie of you just focusing on one thing.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.880
 Four times a second, your brain sort of temporarily takes its attention away its scan.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.760
 This wouldn't get any further.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.680
 This is, it happens.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.160
 Yeah, it's cool, right?

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160
 It's weird.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.920
 Okay, so each of these scanaways, they must be an absolute micro-millionaire.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.920
 Yeah, it's short.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.080
 It's not, it doesn't take a quarter of a second, four times a second, but it's just like

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.080
 breathe, blink.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.600
 No, it's not like that.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.120
 I wish you hadn't zoned out while I was just saying the thing.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.840
 I'm not going to go back and say it.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.840
 I'll go with it.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840
 I'll go with it.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840
 I'll go with it.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840
 I'll go with it.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840
 I'll go with it.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.840
 Yeah.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840
 Yeah.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.840
 That I had never heard.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.840
 I thought it was super cool.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.840
 Have we mentioned this before?

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.880
 We mentioned the special feces studying lab in the Soviet Union.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.880
 Hello.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:31:00.320
 So this is, in the 1940s, the USSR developed a secret lab, a studying world leaders poo.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.320
 What?

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.760
 It was to find out stuff about them.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.480
 And the justification that people have made, have backdated to it, is that we didn't really

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.040
 have CCTV or other ways of watching people, so we collected their poo instead.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.680
 And this is genuinely someone found this out a couple of years ago, going through these old

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.680
 archives.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.080
 And Beria, Stalin, sort of right-hand man, Beria was in charge of it.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.880
 And it was a special department.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:28.440
 And for instance, in 1949, they had special toilets installed for mal when he came and visited.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.680
 And they weren't connected to the sewers.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.640
 They were connected to boxes underneath his loo, which they then collected and they went

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.640
 through it.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.400
 And it was like, if you found certain things like apparently, if you found amino acid,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.240
 a trip to fan, it meant they were calm and approachable.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.240
 And perhaps you could do a deal with them.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.240
 And the theory was, if there wasn't very much potassium in their poo, then they had a lack

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.520
 of sleep and might be a bit stressed, a bit techy.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520
 Give them a banana.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.600
 Give them a bloody banana, and they won't impress the red button.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.120
 But we know now that people are still doing this, right?

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.960
 So Kim Jong-un did that during the Singapore summit this year, brought his own Tyler.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.960
 To eat.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960
 For exactly the same reason.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.680
 Was that so they couldn't steal his poo and study it, yeah?

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.680
 Yes, yes.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.200
 So he would have taken all of that back to North Korea when he left.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.200
 Lucky them.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.200
 Because bizarre.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.200
 Yeah.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.640
 But then we now know that there's a historical justification for it.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.640
 Yeah.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.440
 I always thought it was them just being paranoid, but I think it is them being paranoid.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.440
 Is it?

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440
 Oh, no.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.440
 Although, no, you're right.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.440
 We know that they were doing it.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.440
 And we know, now I bet you can learn way more from someone's work.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440
 Yeah.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.440
 If there's a house guest visiting my place, I'm not ashamed to say, oh, I'll analyse.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.440
 Yeah.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.440
 I do think you should be ashamed to say that.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.440
 Why do you keep giving me bananas whenever I come around?

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:47.640
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.320
 My fact this week is that the largest sunflower farm in Ontario has been forced to shut because

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.600
 so many people were taking selfies there.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.600
 And this is a really funny story.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600
 It's from this summer.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.120
 The farm is called Bogle Seeds Farm.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.960
 It's in a place called Hamilton.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.280
 And it's absolutely massive.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.760
 They were 1.6 million sunflower plants over 68 acres.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.080
 They thought it would be quite a good idea to make a bit of extra cash.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.760
 Changed people some dollars by saying, you can come here, park up in this little car park.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.840
 We've got, take a selfie, here you go.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.720
 And it went mad.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.720
 They were completely swamped.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.440
 Thousands and thousands of people came.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:27.720
 There was four kilometres of stationary traffic backed up on the road leading there.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.400
 There was a 300 car parking lot.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.200
 And at any one time, there were 7,000 cars trying to park in it.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.960
 And it just turned into complete chaos.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.320
 They trashed the place.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.320
 And so they had to shut it.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.320
 People were cutting off the tops of sunflowers.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.040
 Someone said that one person urinated on one of the neighbor's bushes.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.040
 It was bad.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.040
 The pictures did look quite cool.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.040
 Didn't they?

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040
 The pictures look really nice.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.040
 Sunflowers are still pretty.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.040
 They are.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.040
 Yeah.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.360
 Lovely photos of people weeing and fighting and smashing their cars.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.360
 On Instagram, that's not what the photos were.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.360
 They were just nice pictures of people with sunflowers.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.360
 That's true.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.360
 And it's your single weir.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.400
 Apparently, people brought ladders to this place.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.720
 So you can go into the field and then climb up a ladder.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.040
 So you can be poking out above the top of the sunflowers, which I think is quite clever.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.840
 And also, maybe just because they're so tall sunflowers, I can't believe how high they

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.840
 can get.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.240
 They just want to get to the top.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.680
 The largest that we have on record, this is a Guinness World Record, it's 30 feet in

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680
 one inch.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.680
 I can't.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.640
 That can't have been a happy sunflower, though.

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640
 Why?

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.520
 Because it would be quite stressed, wouldn't it?

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.520
 Self-conscious.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520
 Yeah.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.520
 Every time I hand it, it's much shorter.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.520
 Think about that.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.520
 But you're sure you would...

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.720
 They must grow to get more light.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.360
 And if they need more light, they must be stressed, right?

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.360
 That's in...

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.360
 Yeah.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.440
 So, for instance, forleaf clovers, they only grow if they're stressed forleaves, because they

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.760
 need an extra leaf to get more light and more energy.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.760
 No.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.760
 Did not.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.360
 So usually when a plant does something weird, it's because they're stressed out.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.960
 So now, whenever we find a forleaf clover, we have to go, "Oh, that's so sad."

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.680
 Rather than thinking it's good enough.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.680
 That's what I always do.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.680
 Oh, God.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.680
 It's such a killjoy.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680
 30 feet.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.680
 Yeah.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.680
 Yeah, I mean, that's...

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.680
 It's so difficult.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.680
 How did you grow?

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.280
 You planted at the bottom of a well.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.040
 Well, this is a guy who's managed to top his own record a few years in a row.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.040
 So he's...

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040
 It's just a girl.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.840
 I mean, do you have to have it trellis to something?

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840
 They're quite strong.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840
 Yeah, really strong.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840
 They're really strong.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.520
 Well, he's got some flowers that were super tall and they didn't have any.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520
 Really?

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.520
 But not 30 feet tall.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:26.240
 I should just say that the, sorry, the reaction of the bogal seed farmers was negative

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.240
 to this chaos.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.400
 So just to conclude the story, because you should really go on their website.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400
 So they closed down the farm.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.360
 They said, we're not having anyone else here this year, although they are still selling

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.360
 seeds.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.560
 But no one can come anymore.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.640
 And you should go to the website because it's so aggressive.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:44.600
 They've got about seven different notices saying, so they say, unfortunately, with the police

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.600
 involved, you know, all lots of capitals.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.000
 They have to call the police.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.440
 We've had to close the photo opportunities due to traffic jams, et cetera.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.680
 There's a big one of those running banners that you get on slightly mad people's websites

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.920
 that's, like, in capital letters, closed for the season.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.920
 Wow.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.640
 I mean, they sort of ask people to come.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.640
 Yeah.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.640
 And then lots of people came.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.640
 They didn't know how popular they'd be.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.280
 It's not the people's fault for coming.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.680
 It's not any individual person's fault.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.680
 It's the individual urinator in the bushes.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.680
 Yeah.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.680
 Yeah.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.680
 Or the people who are cutting tops off.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680
 Yeah.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.680
 I think I can blame those people.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.480
 And they do say, now they've still got people coming who will, like, swear and abuse them

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.160
 and say, no, I've driven four hours to get here.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.520
 Oh, you've got to let me check the website before you go.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.480
 Check the website, guys.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.840
 So, some flowers are massive in Russia, in every sense of the word.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:36.360
 So they're from America originally, some flowers, and then they were brought over to Europe.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.420
 And in the 18th century, they were really popular in Russia, because you were banned from

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:46.280
 consuming oil during Lent, but you weren't banned from consuming sunflower oil, loophole.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.280
 Because they didn't know it existed back in the day when they wrote the rules.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.280
 Yeah.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.440
 So, it's just an absolute get-around, and you could, you know, use the oil for food or

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.000
 for light, or for whatever it might be.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Yeah.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.520
 So the Russians used to have massive sunflower fields.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.800
 Well, they still do.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:06.200
 The two biggest producers of sunflower oil are Russia and Ukraine, which means that tensions

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.200
 between those two countries have affected the world's supply of sunflower oil.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.200
 Oh, wow, really?

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.200
 Yeah.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.240
 God, I didn't know how I felt about that battle, but now I'm really anti, because sunflower

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.120
 oils are useful, I think, to have around, isn't it?

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.120
 Yeah.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:27.600
 And about the fact that sunflowers are used in nuclear, apocalyptic sites, basically.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:34.680
 So Fukushima, for example, part of the process of trying to clear a radiation was to plant

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.880
 millions and millions of sunflowers, because they soak up the radiation.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.720
 And this was a thing that was employed in Chernobyl as well.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.720
 Oh, really?

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720
 Yeah.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720
 Yeah.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720
 Lots of planting.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.040
 And it's many, it's many different flowers and field mustard.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.880
 I must admit, I read that, and I thought it probably wasn't true, because it's the obvious

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880
 thing to put in, isn't it?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:01.520
 Sunflowers, it's light, it's energy, it feels like a kind of a folk remedy to that, doesn't

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520
 it?

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.520
 Yes.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.520
 But then it's 100% free, isn't it?

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520
 No, they have.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520
 Yeah, they have studied it.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.280
 They have hyperacumulators, which take up heavy metals from soil.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.280
 Do you know who's a big fan of sunflowers?

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.280
 Huge fan.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.280
 Oh, it gives a clue.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280
 My wife.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.280
 Really?

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.280
 Yeah.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280
 That wasn't going to...

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.280
 Well, it's someone very similar to your wife, actually.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.080
 Oh, um, I've got a lot of people here.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.560
 No, it's a summer bin Laden.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.160
 I thought she reminds me a bit.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.160
 She's tall.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160
 She's not big.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.160
 She's not big.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160
 She's an American.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:38.200
 Yeah, he had a passion for them, apparently, going to his wife, he loved growing, he always

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.360
 grew them, he loved growing the biggest sunflowers in his village.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.360
 Do you know what's ironic about sunflowers?

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.120
 A summer bin Laden loved them.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.200
 Is it that they come out at night?

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.720
 Oh, that's good.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.720
 What?

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720
 Where do they hide?

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.720
 No, I'm guessing.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720
 Oh, right.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.720
 That would be ironic.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.720
 If there's sunflowers in the bin Laden.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720
 They hate the sun.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.720
 They love the sun.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.400
 They fall around all over the place.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.400
 None of that.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.400
 No.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.720
 It's that they're the only flower with the word flower in their name, but they're not a

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.720
 flower.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.200
 They're not a flower.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.200
 No.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.200
 What?

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.120
 They are thousands of flowers.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.400
 So each sunflower is actually thousands of little flowers.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.120
 The definition of a flower is obviously like, you know, the bit that has the reproductive

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120
 organs.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.360
 And on the sunflower, the bits that are the, called the disc florets.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.760
 So if you follow the big yellow petals down, you then get all these little circular bits.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760
 A bit more brown.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.760
 Yes, exactly.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760
 The bit more brown bits.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.800
 They have male and female reproductive organs, each one of those.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.920
 So each little petal with a disparate attached is a flower.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.920
 Wow.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.400
 So every time we see a sunflower now, we should call it a sunflowers.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.400
 Exactly.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.400
 Yeah, I will do that from now on.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.400
 I know.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.400
 You actually will, aren't you?

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.400
 I won't.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.400
 As you're eating your penino.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.040
 What technically then is it?

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040
 It's a group of flowers.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040
 A group of flowers.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 It's a group of flowers.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.040
 That is going to be absolutely.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040
 That's going to save me a lot of money.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.040
 It's going to be able to say darling, I've got you two thousand sunflowers.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.760
 Hey, I've got another ironic thing about something.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.760
 Sunflowers.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.760
 Yeah.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.680
 This is about Van Gogh or Van Ruch.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.960
 So he never sold any of his sunflower portraits.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.680
 I think he painted about 11 and he never sold a single one in his lifetime.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.320
 And yet now, the one that the National Gallery in London has won, and they sell more postcards

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.520
 of that than of any other picture they've got.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:34.360
 When you go to the National Gallery, they say no taking photos, but actually since 2014,

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.680
 they've lifted the ban on selfies and taking photos because they realized they just couldn't

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.680
 regulate it.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.680
 So if they saw someone with a phone out, most people, they couldn't tell if they were googling

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:48.600
 something, texting or whether or not they were about to use it to take a sneaky photo.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.960
 So they do know that certain flashes and so on do actually affect paintings, but they've

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.740
 only with a few specific paintings said now that is illegal to take a selfie with.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:03.200
 But that's also ironic that a place with hundreds of self-portraits stops you from taking

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200
 a self-portrait.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200
 Yeah.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.200
 Apart from they don't anyone.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.200
 They don't.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.600
 They use to the irony used to exist and it now does not.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.780
 That's the right thing about the sunflowers.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:21.120
 The painting is wilting, all the Van Gogh's sunflowers are going brown, very slowly.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.700
 As in, because the ink is, yeah, because he used paint which degrades under light.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:30.360
 Although great news is not yet visible to the human eye, so I'm pretty stopped panicking.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360
 Wow.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.120
 So the painting of sunflowers doesn't like the light.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120
 Brilliant.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120
 Love it.

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.600
 He's special.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.000
 Past and present irony, especially, yeah.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Yeah.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.800
 But they've analysed the chemicals and they know which, because they use different pigments

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.560
 for different bits of the painting and one of the pigments is going to steadily get brown.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.560
 Hey.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.560
 Yeah.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.560
 Well, that's fitting, isn't it?

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.560
 Because they all die eventually.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.560
 As do we all.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.560
 And I think that's the point you were trying to make when he used that chemical.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.560
 Yep.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.560
 He was another man with great foresight.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.680
 Do you know the optimal distance that was to take a photo of your face?

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.680
 Is it arm's length?

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.680
 Sadly, it's not.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.280
 So that's why everyone looks hideous and selfies and they should all stop doing them.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.920
 So five feet is the best distance for a portrait.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.400
 That's the one that's the length that doesn't distort your facial features.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.920
 Well, you know what that is about the length of an arm's length and the selfie stick.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.920
 Yeah.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.920
 It's about the length of a giant armadillo.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.040
 Yeah, but selfie sticks are more easily gotten.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.680
 Well, I wouldn't hate someone carrying around a giant armadillo quite as much as that.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680
 Hang on.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:35.920
 All the tourists in Covet Garden were walking around with giant armadillos, you would soon get sick of it.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.040
 But no, selfies make your face look 30% faster, 30% wider than it is, don't they?

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.040
 Because they're too close up.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.040
 Right.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.080
 So Kim Kardashian, she takes love selfies.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.080
 Yeah.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.840
 And she seems to look normal in them.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.080
 Does she have an extremely thin face in me?

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.080
 Yeah.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.080
 I don't know.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.080
 It's like a freak.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.600
 Actually, weirdly, Finella was showing me last night a picture of Kim Kardashian when she was 14

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.320
 versus now to show the facial difference and her note, she looks like she's had a lot of

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.600
 the work done that would make her selfie look right.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.200
 Well, she's the professional person who needs to look good, I'm not surprised.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.400
 Suggesting that Kim Kardashian has had work done.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.640
 I can't tell you how thrilled I am.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.600
 This podcast is ended up with us discussing Kim Kardashian's percential plastic surgery.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.840
 And so I got another Kim Kardashian factor.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.240
 And that is that she's been warned by doctors to stop taking selfies after a painful wrist

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.240
 injury.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.840
 Oh, he genuinely had one.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.960
 Apparently, she's got RSI because she's taken so many selfies.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.960
 Really?

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.920
 Doesn't she have any mates who will take a photo of her?

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.920
 It's a selfie.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920
 You got to do a...

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.920
 Well, you can just call it a photograph.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.920
 I've got a word for the other one.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.880
 It's all about the angles.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.360
 She released a book called Selfie, which was literally 500 selfies.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.360
 That was the whole book.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.360
 You loved it.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.360
 Absolutely loved it.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:58.300
 I've got a selfie factor, which is that in Ohio, there was a man who was wanted by the police.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.360
 And his name was Donald A. Chip Pugh.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.320
 He was wanted by the Lima police in Ohio.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.320
 And so they put a picture...

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.320
 Hang on.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.320
 Hang on.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320
 Hey, they're looking at the wrong place.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.320
 Yeah.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.320
 There's a county called Lima.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.320
 How do I remember?

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.320
 The animal, the Lima police.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.320
 The most adorable police in the whole country.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:25.960
 Yeah, so they released a photo of him, which they said, "Have you seen this guy please

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.280
 get in contact?"

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.080
 And someone who got in contact was Donald himself, who did not like the photo that they

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.080
 were using.

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:37.480
 So he sent him an updated selfie of him sitting in a car with sunglasses on, looking like

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.880
 he's cool.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.720
 And they ended up using that photo as well, sending a message saying, "This photo was

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.960
 sent to us by Mr. Pugh himself.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.520
 We thank him for being helpful, but now we'd appreciate it if he would come to speak to us

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.520
 about his charges."

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.520
 But yeah, they actually use his...

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.520
 Do we know what happened at the end?

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.000
 No, I haven't found an update.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.420
 Are we sure you didn't just send him a picture of somebody else and think, "Oh, he's

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.420
 gone away with that one."

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:07.260
 Okay, that's it.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.260
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.640
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.560

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.480
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.400
 So on there, we have all of our previous episodes.
