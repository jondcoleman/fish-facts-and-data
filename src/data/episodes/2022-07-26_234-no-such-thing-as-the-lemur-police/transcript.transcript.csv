00:00:00,00:00:21,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:21,00:00:24,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:29,00:00:34,"and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:34,00:00:39,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:41,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:41,00:00:46,My fact is that it's very hard for scientists to spot Armadillo's having sex because Armadillo's
00:00:46,00:00:54,have sex while running. How fast do they run? Too fast to see them.
00:00:54,00:01:00,"They would show up on film and in photos, but it's just a mating habit that they have,"
00:01:00,00:01:05,"so whenever the Armadillo female is in heat, she may also start chasing her, but then she"
00:01:05,00:01:09,"starts running away, so it's all the matter of the fastest Armadillo who can catch up"
00:01:09,00:01:12,"with her, but she doesn't stop running when he's caught up."
00:01:12,00:01:20,"So they engage in sex, mid-like passing a baton on to her, it's baton, disgusting baton."
00:01:20,00:01:24,"Dan, in relays, did you support onto the baton all the way around?"
00:01:24,00:01:27,"No, but he used to hold onto the penis of the guy in front of him."
00:01:27,00:01:32,"Well, we got there quite quickly, didn't we?"
00:01:32,00:01:37,"Yeah, it's amazing because they look like little battery-operated toys because the"
00:01:37,00:01:40,female is just running along and you can't really see their legs moving and the male
00:01:40,00:01:44,"mounts the female, but he then has to run along only on his hind legs while he's mounted"
00:01:44,00:01:45,her.
00:01:45,00:01:49,"Wow. Like a wheelbarrow race, I don't think so."
00:01:49,00:01:53,Your spot's day must have been awful.
00:01:53,00:01:56,It's this all Armadillo's because there's quite a lot of different types in there.
00:01:56,00:02:00,"I'm not sure. This was only observed in one species, so I don't think we can say for sure."
00:02:00,00:02:02,Or I certainly can't.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"Do you know, is it the nine, which one?"
00:02:04,00:02:05,I think it's the nine.
00:02:05,00:02:06,The nine.
00:02:06,00:02:07,"Oh, the nine."
00:02:07,00:02:08,It's amazing.
00:02:08,00:02:18,"I mean, it's the full name is the nine-banded Armadillo, to be fair, I'm not sure anyone's"
00:02:18,00:02:21,"ever called it the nine before, but I'm sorry."
00:02:21,00:02:22,"Oh, I really hope it's not."
00:02:22,00:02:23,I'm going to check though.
00:02:23,00:02:24,Sure.
00:02:24,00:02:28,"But yeah, presumably they don't massively like it because they generally don't like each"
00:02:28,00:02:29,other to the Armadillos.
00:02:29,00:02:30,They're very solitary.
00:02:30,00:02:31,That's true.
00:02:31,00:02:35,"Yeah, because the women, the female Armadillos are always kind of, I was going to say, beating"
00:02:35,00:02:37,"off, but they're trying to get the male away, aren't they?"
00:02:37,00:02:38,Yeah.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"Most of the time, until they're on heat and then they kind of accept it a little better."
00:02:41,00:02:42,Yeah.
00:02:42,00:02:43,They're running away.
00:02:43,00:02:44,That's true.
00:02:44,00:02:45,It is a bit like the Benny Hill show.
00:02:45,00:02:46,Yes.
00:02:46,00:02:47,Yeah.
00:02:47,00:02:49,"So the nine-banded Armadillo, if that's who we are talking about."
00:02:49,00:02:50,The nine.
00:02:50,00:02:51,The nine.
00:02:51,00:02:52,Yeah.
00:02:52,00:02:53,Don't always have nine.
00:02:53,00:02:54,Did I know?
00:02:54,00:02:55,Sometimes have seven or eleven.
00:02:55,00:02:56,Yeah.
00:02:56,00:02:57,Yeah.
00:02:57,00:02:59,I think that's just a mean average that they have.
00:02:59,00:03:03,That's a mean average you got there.
00:03:03,00:03:04,It's the six.
00:03:04,00:03:05,No.
00:03:05,00:03:06,I'm sorry.
00:03:06,00:03:07,This is the six-banded Armadillo.
00:03:07,00:03:08,Okay.
00:03:08,00:03:12,"Is that because the one you generally hear about is the nine-banded, isn't it, which is"
00:03:12,00:03:13,the one that lives in...
00:03:13,00:03:15,"Like, that's the one when people talk about Armadillos."
00:03:15,00:03:17,"It tends to be the nine-banded Armadillo, because that's the only one that lives in North"
00:03:17,00:03:18,America.
00:03:18,00:03:19,"It's true, although..."
00:03:19,00:03:20,Maybe we could talk about nine-banded Armadillos.
00:03:20,00:03:23,The one that kind of goes into a ball is the three-banded Armadillo.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Yeah.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"All the three, as we call it."
00:03:25,00:03:26,All three.
00:03:26,00:03:27,Yeah.
00:03:27,00:03:30,"There are 20 species of Armadillo, and only two can roll themselves up."
00:03:30,00:03:31,Yeah.
00:03:31,00:03:32,Who swizzed?
00:03:32,00:03:33,Indeed.
00:03:33,00:03:38,"The favorite Armadillo, and this is the Armadillo I'm mainly read into, is the..."
00:03:38,00:03:40,"Which one is it, guys?"
00:03:40,00:03:41,Who is it?
00:03:41,00:03:42,The three?
00:03:42,00:03:43,The 29.
00:03:43,00:03:49,"No, my favorite Armadillo is the Pink Fairy Armadillo, and they are so amazing."
00:03:49,00:03:52,Get up a picture of a Pink Fairy Armadillo while you're listening to the rest of this.
00:03:52,00:03:53,I'm for the rest of your life.
00:03:53,00:03:56,"They're the cutest thing I've ever seen, so they're the smallest kind."
00:03:56,00:03:58,They're six inches long.
00:03:58,00:03:59,They've got pink shell.
00:03:59,00:04:03,"This little pink shell, like baby pink, a fluffy white belly."
00:04:03,00:04:07,"And they're just so cute, and they've got these massive front claws, which are almost a"
00:04:07,00:04:11,"bit grotesque, because they're only for digging, so they can't really walk properly."
00:04:11,00:04:15,"They can only dig, but yeah, they can bury themselves in a couple of seconds, so if something"
00:04:15,00:04:17,"comes along, their shells are actually useless."
00:04:17,00:04:20,"In most Armadillos, they're not very good protection of the shells, but they just bury"
00:04:20,00:04:22,themselves immediately.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"And yeah, they are so cute."
00:04:24,00:04:25,And they're really fluffy.
00:04:25,00:04:26,They sound like Pokemon.
00:04:26,00:04:27,Yeah.
00:04:27,00:04:28,They've got fluffy belly.
00:04:28,00:04:29,They are a bit like Pokemon.
00:04:29,00:04:32,"They're very soft-shelled, and their shell is pink because they use it for thermoregulation,"
00:04:32,00:04:36,"so they can pump loads of blood to it, and that just gets rid of all the excess heat in"
00:04:36,00:04:37,their body.
00:04:37,00:04:38,Right.
00:04:38,00:04:41,"And they've got a bump plate when they're digging, when they're digging through the earth."
00:04:41,00:04:44,"They have a little bump plate, which just compacts all the earth behind them."
00:04:44,00:04:47,"So that means that it creates like a really strong burrow, doesn't it?"
00:04:47,00:04:50,"And also it means that they get the earth out of their face, so they can breathe."
00:04:50,00:04:54,"It's got a square bump, basically, and it bumps up against the earth to compact it, like"
00:04:54,00:04:56,you would with a spade if you batched a spade on it.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:57,00:05:01,"And the opposite of that, have we ever talked about the glypsodon, which was the prehistoric"
00:05:01,00:05:02,Armadillo?
00:05:02,00:05:05,Which was so big that humans used its shells for shelters.
00:05:05,00:05:06,Whoa!
00:05:06,00:05:07,What?
00:05:07,00:05:08,So we lived inside the shell.
00:05:08,00:05:09,Oh my God.
00:05:09,00:05:10,This is pretty amazing.
00:05:10,00:05:12,"And it had like a, it was about the size of a car."
00:05:12,00:05:13,What?
00:05:13,00:05:16,And it had like a club tail that it would bash humans with.
00:05:16,00:05:17,My Lord.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"Yeah, no, I would do that, as well as when I was living inside my shell."
00:05:20,00:05:21,I think that-
00:05:21,00:05:22,Do you think they took the Armadillo out first?
00:05:22,00:05:23,Okay.
00:05:23,00:05:26,"I think death took it out first, and then it was just-"
00:05:26,00:05:27,"I don't know, actually."
00:05:27,00:05:28,That is incredible.
00:05:28,00:05:32,"Okay, today living inside your car is seen as a sign of someone who's down in your luck."
00:05:32,00:05:35,Do you think in the old days living inside an Armadillo shell was the same thing?
00:05:35,00:05:37,"Oh, he's living inside his Armadillo shell."
00:05:37,00:05:38,He's had a rough time.
00:05:38,00:05:39,I like it.
00:05:39,00:05:41,Have we ever lived in a shell outside of that?
00:05:41,00:05:44,I can't think of an example of another animal where-
00:05:44,00:05:45,That's so cool.
00:05:45,00:05:46,That's good.
00:05:46,00:05:47,Yeah.
00:05:47,00:05:50,You always find the most weird angles on the except-
00:05:50,00:05:52,"I mean, probably not."
00:05:52,00:05:53,Wow.
00:05:53,00:05:55,The first instance of humans living in shells-
00:05:55,00:05:56,It's so cool.
00:05:56,00:05:57,Yeah.
00:05:57,00:06:00,Can I take us back to the nine for a second?
00:06:00,00:06:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:01,00:06:02,Yeah.
00:06:02,00:06:04,So they have a really interesting-
00:06:04,00:06:08,"This is just- I was looking into the sex life of the Armadillo off the back of your fact,"
00:06:08,00:06:09,Andy.
00:06:09,00:06:15,"So nine, the nine, has quadruplets every single time."
00:06:15,00:06:16,Every single time they have a baby.
00:06:16,00:06:23,"So the baby basically splits a single fertilized egg, but it splits it so that they're effectively"
00:06:23,00:06:25,clones of each other.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Yeah.
00:06:26,00:06:30,"Those of them do it, but I think most Armadillos might have quadruplets every time."
00:06:30,00:06:31,Wow.
00:06:31,00:06:32,Yeah.
00:06:32,00:06:35,"But because they're identical, it's to prevent, inbreeding, is that right?"
00:06:35,00:06:36,"Or prevent, incest?"
00:06:36,00:06:37,An accidental.
00:06:37,00:06:39,But how would that prevent it if they're all-
00:06:39,00:06:44,"Well, if all four quads that you have are males, then they would be able to agree with each"
00:06:44,00:06:45,other at least.
00:06:45,00:06:46,Got it.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Yeah.
00:06:47,00:06:50,And the nine band did is the state small mammal of Texas-
00:06:50,00:06:51,Is it?
00:06:51,00:06:52,Was it a large one?
00:06:52,00:06:53,It's-
00:06:53,00:06:54,I didn't write it down.
00:06:54,00:06:55,It does have one.
00:06:55,00:06:57,It's a kind of deer or something.
00:06:57,00:06:58,Okay.
00:06:58,00:06:59,So there's a state small mammal of Texas.
00:06:59,00:07:00,There's a state large mammal.
00:07:00,00:07:03,"There's a state flying mammal, which is a kind of bat."
00:07:03,00:07:05,And there's also a state welk.
00:07:05,00:07:11,I didn't even know there was more than one kind of welk.
00:07:11,00:07:13,Everyone's state welk is the same.
00:07:13,00:07:18,Something that's very cool about Armadillos is that they have two ways of crossing water
00:07:18,00:07:20,and both are equally groovy.
00:07:20,00:07:21,So they-
00:07:21,00:07:25,"They try more, Nana."
00:07:25,00:07:28,They inflate their stomach and intestines with air if they want to float.
00:07:28,00:07:33,So they fancy looking at the view and then they just float across the water or they can deflate
00:07:33,00:07:36,themselves and sink right down to the bottom and then they just walk along the bottom using
00:07:36,00:07:37,their claws.
00:07:37,00:07:39,And they can hold their breath a bit of fantastic menace.
00:07:39,00:07:40,So cool.
00:07:40,00:07:41,That's amazing.
00:07:41,00:07:42,Do you think they have races like where one-
00:07:42,00:07:43,Of course they do.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Yeah.
00:07:44,00:07:47,"It's like when there's two escalators in the tube going up, you always go one on each so"
00:07:47,00:07:48,that you can see who goes quickest.
00:07:48,00:07:49,Do you?
00:07:49,00:07:50,No.
00:07:50,00:07:56,I thought there was usually one up and one down otherwise how does everyone get down the
00:07:56,00:07:57,stairs?
00:07:57,00:08:01,So there's often three in tubes and there's always two going up and one going down and that's
00:08:01,00:08:05,because people coming down they come at a regular amount of time but people going up they
00:08:05,00:08:08,all come off the train at the same time so there's more people at the same time.
00:08:08,00:08:09,That's really interesting.
00:08:09,00:08:10,Well.
00:08:10,00:08:12,I think that's really interesting.
00:08:12,00:08:13,That makes more sense.
00:08:13,00:08:17,I thought it was for rush hour when you know if there are loads of people going into
00:08:17,00:08:21,"the station, like at the end of the day you'll have two, mate you might have two going down"
00:08:21,00:08:25,because you would occasionally do that but almost always they have two going up.
00:08:25,00:08:26,A whole lot of sense.
00:08:26,00:08:28,Have we talked about the leprosy thing?
00:08:28,00:08:29,No.
00:08:29,00:08:34,"No, but you should get that checked out."
00:08:34,00:08:37,So they got the disease from humans.
00:08:37,00:08:38,We know that.
00:08:38,00:08:42,So this is Hansen's disease as you're supposed to call it but most people call it leprosy.
00:08:42,00:08:44,Exactly.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"So they're native to the new world, the Americas."
00:08:47,00:08:51,"So when humans first arrived we know that they brought over leprosy, Hansen's disease with"
00:08:51,00:08:57,them at some point but as a result they're really good at carrying it because their body temperature
00:08:57,00:09:02,is 34 degrees Celsius on the inside and the leprosy bacterium loves that temperature.
00:09:02,00:09:03,It's ideal for it.
00:09:03,00:09:08,"We're actually not ideal for the 37 or something now but for some reason, they live in our skin"
00:09:08,00:09:11,the bacteria which is a bit cooler so they can survive there.
00:09:11,00:09:16,So a lot of people eat armadillo in Brazil but unfortunately 60% of the armadillos in the
00:09:16,00:09:20,forest have it and it's okay as long as you cook it all the way through but some people
00:09:20,00:09:26,have the liver raw so you can get leprosy that way or some people keep them in their homes
00:09:26,00:09:29,to fathom them up and obviously the more close contact you have with an armadillo the
00:09:29,00:09:30,more likely you are.
00:09:30,00:09:33,And actually most humans are immune to leprosy.
00:09:33,00:09:34,That's true.
00:09:34,00:09:35,But the ones that aren't.
00:09:35,00:09:36,You're bugging.
00:09:36,00:09:37,You're bugging.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Yeah.
00:09:38,00:09:41,So I think the lesson is I mean I was always taught you can eat rare steak and rare lamb
00:09:41,00:09:43,but don't eat rare chicken and rare armadillo.
00:09:43,00:09:46,I think that's what you have to take away from this isn't it?
00:09:46,00:09:49,Armadillo shells can rebound bullets.
00:09:49,00:09:55,People have found out in America to their detriment which I find.
00:09:55,00:09:59,It seems like most people are basically okay but yeah in 2015 a man was taken to hospital
00:09:59,00:10:03,with injuries when he was working up by armadillos and a bit of a pest in America because they
00:10:03,00:10:04,destroyed gardens.
00:10:04,00:10:08,He was working up at 3am so he went and shot the armadillo and the bullet rebounded in
00:10:08,00:10:09,him in the face.
00:10:09,00:10:10,He was okay.
00:10:10,00:10:11,He survived.
00:10:11,00:10:12,He was okay.
00:10:12,00:10:13,Yeah.
00:10:13,00:10:14,How was the armadillo?
00:10:14,00:10:15,They don't know about the armadillo.
00:10:15,00:10:16,They don't know afterwards.
00:10:16,00:10:17,Oh.
00:10:17,00:10:19,Well that implies it survived at least.
00:10:19,00:10:20,It walked away.
00:10:20,00:10:23,No it could have ricocheted away into another garden.
00:10:23,00:10:24,That's true.
00:10:24,00:10:26,I don't know if that's how armadillos work.
00:10:26,00:10:30,You're thinking when you jump on a turtle in Super Mario and they go skating away.
00:10:30,00:10:32,I was thinking of that.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Yeah.
00:10:33,00:10:35,I thought so.
00:10:35,00:10:39,The walking underwater thing with the armadillo feels a bit risky to me.
00:10:39,00:10:40,I would.
00:10:40,00:10:41,Would you?
00:10:41,00:10:44,Would you do the floating though because it feels like with the floating you're kind
00:10:44,00:10:46,of at the risk of currents and stuff like that.
00:10:46,00:10:47,And predators.
00:10:47,00:10:48,You're much more exposed.
00:10:48,00:10:49,Well they can only hold their breath for six minutes.
00:10:49,00:10:54,So I guess if you want to escape a predator you could quickly deflate and sink to the bottom.
00:10:54,00:10:57,But as long as you're never more than three minutes away from the edge of the river.
00:10:57,00:10:59,I guess you just have to know though.
00:10:59,00:11:00,That's the problem.
00:11:00,00:11:01,That's the river.
00:11:01,00:11:02,And you get to a big rock underwater.
00:11:02,00:11:04,And you got to take a detour to see.
00:11:04,00:11:08,There is a scene just like a submission of possible five.
00:11:08,00:11:09,It's them.
00:11:09,00:11:10,Yeah there is.
00:11:10,00:11:11,So.
00:11:11,00:11:12,Are you sure that's the five?
00:11:12,00:11:13,I thought that was the nine.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Okay.
00:11:14,00:11:25,It is time for fact number two and that is James.
00:11:25,00:11:30,Okay my fat this week is that the car why people of New Guinea put grubs in their ears to
00:11:30,00:11:31,eat their earwax.
00:11:31,00:11:32,So great.
00:11:32,00:11:33,So great.
00:11:33,00:11:35,And then what do they put in their ear to eat the grubs?
00:11:35,00:11:36,A cow.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Do they put it in?
00:11:37,00:11:39,That's going right to the end.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Yeah.
00:11:40,00:11:45,So yeah this is a thing.
00:11:45,00:11:47,These are a tribe from New Guinea.
00:11:47,00:11:50,There's lots of interesting stuff about them but one thing that a lot of people learned in
00:11:50,00:11:56,the last year or so was there was a TV show on BBC2 called My Year with the Tribe.
00:11:56,00:11:58,presenter Will Millard.
00:11:58,00:12:03,Let a grub crawl into his ear and eat his earwax in this documentary which everyone thought
00:12:03,00:12:04,was a bit weird.
00:12:04,00:12:05,Yeah.
00:12:05,00:12:10,But didn't the tribe have the courage to say at the time that the elders used to do this?
00:12:10,00:12:13,We don't really do it anymore so we've forgotten how it's done but shove it in and see what
00:12:13,00:12:14,happens.
00:12:14,00:12:18,Maybe it's one of those things that you just get foreigners in and you just make the
00:12:18,00:12:20,do stuff and say that it's traditional.
00:12:20,00:12:22,Is there a way of getting it out though?
00:12:22,00:12:27,It just slivers out itself apparently and it's slightly darker in colour having eaten
00:12:27,00:12:28,all your earwax.
00:12:28,00:12:29,Wow.
00:12:29,00:12:30,That's quite cool.
00:12:30,00:12:33,And he said he could hear it eating it inside his ear couldn't he?
00:12:33,00:12:37,It was like I can hear it munching away and that would be the spot that you would get the
00:12:37,00:12:38,very access to hearing.
00:12:38,00:12:42,I mean that doesn't surprise me.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"Yeah he's a, I've really like Will Millard I realise of course researching this."
00:12:46,00:12:50,He's a lot of very cool stuff but yeah he went to Papua and lived with those people for
00:12:50,00:12:55,a few months I think but he had an extremely bad time he seems to have very bad luck and
00:12:55,00:13:00,he's actually got PTSD now from being basically doing all these documentaries in these extreme
00:13:00,00:13:01,places.
00:13:01,00:13:05,And one of the points in Papua he said I made a serious error of judgement that saw me
00:13:05,00:13:10,not on an ancient intertribal trade route but trapped deep within a 400 mile square of uninhabited
00:13:10,00:13:12,snake infested and extremely hostile forest.
00:13:12,00:13:17,We crawled out a month later elacerated and covered in infections but yet he's had cerebral
00:13:17,00:13:22,"malaria, he's been you know assaulted, he's been robbed at Bowen Arrow Point."
00:13:22,00:13:23,Yeah.
00:13:23,00:13:25,Which is kind of a cool life experience.
00:13:25,00:13:26,Yeah.
00:13:26,00:13:27,It's become the trauma.
00:13:27,00:13:31,I thought it was a different programme wasn't it but the beef got in a bit of trouble because
00:13:31,00:13:36,the worldwide traditionally live in tree houses and the beef made a show program all about
00:13:36,00:13:39,the building the tree houses and then it turned out that they'd sort of said can you build
00:13:39,00:13:40,as a tree house for this programme?
00:13:40,00:13:42,Well that was Will Millard who discovered it.
00:13:42,00:13:43,Oh really?
00:13:43,00:13:46,That was when he went back and did this programme and they said when those last BBC see guys
00:13:46,00:13:51,came they told us to build that tree house and he was the one who said well that's not
00:13:51,00:13:52,on.
00:13:52,00:13:53,I'm going to mention the trade.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Wow right.
00:13:54,00:13:55,But so is it a myth?
00:13:55,00:13:57,It's not a myth that they'd live in tree houses.
00:13:57,00:13:58,No they do.
00:13:58,00:13:59,No they do.
00:13:59,00:14:02,So I don't think that's that bad to ask them to build the tree house.
00:14:02,00:14:03,"Some of them, no."
00:14:03,00:14:06,Those ones did not live in tree houses like that.
00:14:06,00:14:09,They said we would never build tree houses that high.
00:14:09,00:14:10,Right.
00:14:10,00:14:11,Got it.
00:14:11,00:14:13,Some of them live on the ground but some of them I think still live in tree houses.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"There are about 4,000 worldwide people alive."
00:14:15,00:14:16,Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:17,There aren't very many of them.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Yeah.
00:14:18,00:14:25,So there were rumours that the worldwide people sometimes engaged in cannibalism but they
00:14:25,00:14:28,got asked about it and they said no we would never eat a person.
00:14:28,00:14:33,What we would eat is a cacqua which is a witch who takes the form of a person.
00:14:33,00:14:34,Yeah.
00:14:34,00:14:38,And this doesn't happen anymore but 10 years ago it was in living memory so it happened
00:14:38,00:14:40,a few decades ago.
00:14:40,00:14:41,And the basically...
00:14:41,00:14:42,A decade in fact.
00:14:42,00:14:43,Oh.
00:14:43,00:14:44,Yeah.
00:14:44,00:14:47,But the cacqua is basically their version of germ theory.
00:14:47,00:14:52,So they like when someone dies they say what's this because germ theory is not very well
00:14:52,00:14:55,known they assumed it was a witch.
00:14:55,00:15:00,So when a clan member was dying he would whisper to his relatives the name of who he thought
00:15:00,00:15:02,was the witch who had killed him.
00:15:02,00:15:07,It's such a good way to take out someone who just kind of been pissing you out for a while.
00:15:07,00:15:10,I think this is a great deathbed practice we should adopt but then it's very much open
00:15:10,00:15:14,"to abuse isn't it from the person who heard the whisper, the only person who heard"
00:15:14,00:15:15,the whisper.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Yeah.
00:15:16,00:15:17,That's true.
00:15:17,00:15:21,"But this is, I mean I think there were quite a lot of worldwide spread around in different"
00:15:21,00:15:26,groups of worldwide and there was a guy Paul Raphael who famously went there in 2006 and
00:15:26,00:15:32,he went very deep in and he met one who was still a famous cacqua killer who showed him
00:15:32,00:15:38,a skull and stuff and ate the skull in front of him and yeah so who knows apparently it
00:15:38,00:15:42,"tastes like, he asked what it, what human flesh tastes like and it tastes like cassowari."
00:15:42,00:15:46,Okay so everyone wanted it so now you can picture it.
00:15:46,00:15:50,I've got something on earwax but I don't know if you guys have heard of it or a way stuff.
00:15:50,00:15:54,In the middle ages earwax was used to colour manuscript in.
00:15:54,00:15:55,Cool.
00:15:55,00:15:57,Yeah or to colour the ink used for manuscript in part.
00:15:57,00:15:58,I was going to say for the ink yeah.
00:15:58,00:16:00,Yeah it was partly earwax.
00:16:00,00:16:01,Wow.
00:16:01,00:16:02,Partly stale beer.
00:16:02,00:16:05,What do you mean they mix the ink up with an earwax as one of the ingredients?
00:16:05,00:16:06,Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:07,Cool.
00:16:07,00:16:11,"Yeah so some of those ancient beautiful documents will be partly earwax, monk earwax"
00:16:11,00:16:12,probably.
00:16:12,00:16:13,Yeah.
00:16:13,00:16:14,Yeah.
00:16:14,00:16:15,That's the worst.
00:16:15,00:16:17,Interesting you say about beer and earwax.
00:16:17,00:16:22,We read once when we were researching for QI that if you put earwax in someone's beer then
00:16:22,00:16:26,all the froth will disappear from the top of the beer and we tried to do it as an experiment
00:16:26,00:16:30,on the show but it didn't work.
00:16:30,00:16:31,But it did enhance the taste.
00:16:31,00:16:34,I don't think anyone actually drank it in the end.
00:16:34,00:16:35,Who's earwax did you go?
00:16:35,00:16:36,I can't remember.
00:16:36,00:16:37,Yeah.
00:16:37,00:16:41,I probably produce a pair of fletcher's earwax.
00:16:41,00:16:44,"But yeah we did try it but the idea is because it's got oil in, isn't it?"
00:16:44,00:16:48,And the idea is that oil would kind of pop the bubbles a little bit.
00:16:48,00:16:49,I think so.
00:16:49,00:16:50,I think that monks did too.
00:16:50,00:16:51,I don't think they did.
00:16:51,00:16:52,Did they?
00:16:52,00:16:53,I thought they were dead beer.
00:16:53,00:16:58,"They sort of, well when they were painting the manuscripts it was the way they prevented bubbles"
00:16:58,00:17:03,from forming in the liquid was called was called it was called glare which was these
00:17:03,00:17:04,to make the paints.
00:17:04,00:17:05,Right.
00:17:05,00:17:09,Supposedly to stop the froth forming on the glare they put their earwax out of that.
00:17:09,00:17:15,So was earwax sort of a lucrative business to be in if you generated a lot.
00:17:15,00:17:16,It's huge.
00:17:16,00:17:17,It must be a traded thing right?
00:17:17,00:17:19,You know I'm writing a book at the moment.
00:17:19,00:17:20,I'm not sure it must be.
00:17:20,00:17:22,I think everyone has already supplied up.
00:17:22,00:17:26,"Well some people, you can't corner the market in earwax though."
00:17:26,00:17:30,No you could even most productive earwax.
00:17:30,00:17:33,I guess you could go house to house collecting people's earwax.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Yeah.
00:17:34,00:17:36,I've been selling a jar of it because they had gong farmers didn't they who would collect
00:17:36,00:17:41,people's poo for you know for fertiliser and stuff and everyone has a plentiful supply
00:17:41,00:17:42,of that.
00:17:42,00:17:43,Yeah.
00:17:43,00:17:45,You might as well get earwax at the same time you're saying.
00:17:45,00:17:46,Yeah.
00:17:46,00:17:51,I wonder where socially the gong farmer done collector and the earwax collector are next
00:17:51,00:17:52,to each other.
00:17:52,00:17:54,I think they have Christmas parties together.
00:17:54,00:17:55,Yeah.
00:17:55,00:17:57,There's no one else invites them.
00:17:57,00:18:01,We could have traded earwax though with the far east because they've got different earwax
00:18:01,00:18:02,"to us, don't they?"
00:18:02,00:18:03,I don't know.
00:18:03,00:18:10,"But East Asian countries, so in China and Japan, Korea, the gene has changed so their earwax"
00:18:10,00:18:14,is kind of powdery and I think doesn't taste as gross.
00:18:14,00:18:19,So well because it's like powder in it doesn't have the bitterness that arse hasn't.
00:18:19,00:18:22,It's not as gloopy with vast majority.
00:18:22,00:18:23,But who's taste?
00:18:23,00:18:24,Is that a thing?
00:18:24,00:18:28,No I've actually just assumed that because I've read about it and it doesn't contain the
00:18:28,00:18:29,stuff that makes arse.
00:18:29,00:18:30,"It makes sense, isn't it?"
00:18:30,00:18:31,No it makes sense.
00:18:31,00:18:33,I've found it like that was a thing that people taste.
00:18:33,00:18:35,You know how like some people eat their buggers?
00:18:35,00:18:39,No but you know sometimes when you put your finger in your ear and you accidentally put
00:18:39,00:18:41,your finger in your mouth and it's absolutely right.
00:18:41,00:18:43,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:43,00:18:45,They don't have that.
00:18:45,00:18:51,"You know when you accidentally put your finger in someone from East Asia's earwax, we put"
00:18:51,00:18:52,"that in your mouth, yes."
00:18:52,00:18:53,Where will these?
00:18:53,00:18:55,I'm not allowed back to Korea.
00:18:55,00:18:57,Well there were people who tasted your earwax.
00:18:57,00:18:59,There were doctors in ancient Greece.
00:18:59,00:19:02,"That was the whole theory because it was all about the theory of the humours, you know the"
00:19:02,00:19:05,different substances that made up your body.
00:19:05,00:19:09,So Hippocrates said there were particular tastes for bodily fluids.
00:19:09,00:19:14,"So he would taste your earwax, your doctor, and he might lick your vomit or run his fingers"
00:19:14,00:19:16,through your flim to check the consistency.
00:19:16,00:19:19,So he probably got up close.
00:19:19,00:19:20,That's so cool.
00:19:20,00:19:21,It's so unromantic.
00:19:21,00:19:24,He ran his fingers through her flim.
00:19:24,00:19:32,"Do you know what's the most common thing, the most common living thing to get in your ear?"
00:19:32,00:19:33,Earwig.
00:19:33,00:19:36,"You would have thought, but they don't seem to do it as much."
00:19:36,00:19:38,An ant.
00:19:38,00:19:39,Larger in fact.
00:19:39,00:19:40,A spider.
00:19:40,00:19:41,Spider.
00:19:41,00:19:42,"No, I'm going to let you know."
00:19:42,00:19:43,A spider.
00:19:43,00:19:44,Giant armadillo.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Please don't.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Is it a nine?
00:19:46,00:19:47,It's a three.
00:19:47,00:19:48,It's got me three.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"The very little, the pink fairy."
00:19:50,00:19:51,The pink fairy.
00:19:51,00:19:53,I love banded cockroaches.
00:19:53,00:19:54,It's just a cockroach.
00:19:54,00:19:56,Cockroaches love ears.
00:19:56,00:19:57,Oh my god.
00:19:57,00:20:01,"And yeah, and that's by far the most common creature to go in your ear."
00:20:01,00:20:04,"And it's because they've got this thing, and I'd never heard of this word."
00:20:04,00:20:06,They've got positive thigmataxis.
00:20:06,00:20:10,And thigmataxis describes how much you like the stimulus of touch.
00:20:10,00:20:14,"So some animals will have negative thigmataxis, so they don't want to be touched."
00:20:14,00:20:17,And cockroaches want their whole body to be touched all the time.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"So they're so needy, aren't they?"
00:20:20,00:20:21,They're so clingy.
00:20:21,00:20:23,They love a massage.
00:20:23,00:20:27,"Full body massage every single time, never just the shoulders."
00:20:27,00:20:29,But that's where they love ears.
00:20:29,00:20:32,So they go in because they like being in tiny little nooks and crannies.
00:20:32,00:20:35,And that's why they'll always squeeze into little cracks in your house.
00:20:35,00:20:37,And also they quite like the fatty acids.
00:20:37,00:20:40,Do any of us know someone who's found the cockroach in there?
00:20:40,00:20:41,I don't.
00:20:41,00:20:43,And none of my friends has told me.
00:20:43,00:20:46,Does anyone know anyone who's found anything in there yet?
00:20:46,00:20:49,It's still not as common as the common cold.
00:20:49,00:20:51,And also we don't really have cockroaches in this country very much.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Do you not?
00:20:52,00:20:53,Not as much.
00:20:53,00:20:57,"No, we don't, Dan, person who's lived here for about 14 years."
00:20:57,00:21:00,"I thought I had reported turvites the other day, and my house turns out they're not in"
00:21:00,00:21:01,England.
00:21:01,00:21:02,What?
00:21:02,00:21:05,"The guy in the photo was like, that's fascinating."
00:21:05,00:21:06,I'll be over as soon as possible.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"I was like, wow, he was keen."
00:21:08,00:21:10,They were flying ants.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Oh my God.
00:21:11,00:21:12,He just says.
00:21:12,00:21:17,I read on a BBC source that some of the earliest lit bombs were made of earwax.
00:21:17,00:21:19,"Like, I don't believe it."
00:21:19,00:21:20,I regret mentioning it now.
00:21:20,00:21:22,"Oh, thanks for bringing it to me."
00:21:22,00:21:25,Are they saying ancient Egyptians and stuff like that?
00:21:25,00:21:26,Yeah.
00:21:26,00:21:27,"But I just, it would taste better."
00:21:27,00:21:29,But what if they were Asian earwax?
00:21:29,00:21:30,Doesn't that taste fantastic?
00:21:30,00:21:31,"No, that's dry and crumbly."
00:21:31,00:21:33,So that does taste fantastic.
00:21:33,00:21:36,You've taken the wrong thing from out there.
00:21:36,00:21:38,It does feel like someone's open to tub of calmex.
00:21:38,00:21:40,Thought that looks a lot like earwax.
00:21:40,00:21:41,Here's a room out.
00:21:41,00:21:42,I don't need to know.
00:21:42,00:21:46,"I read that in bits of Asia, so India and China."
00:21:46,00:21:52,"Your picking is seen as a nice pampering thing to do, really enjoyable."
00:21:52,00:21:55,So so much to the point where you can have it done on the side of streets.
00:21:55,00:21:56,There's vendors.
00:21:56,00:21:57,And so luxurious.
00:21:57,00:21:58,You can get it done on the side.
00:21:58,00:21:59,Yeah.
00:21:59,00:22:00,And so there's such demand.
00:22:00,00:22:01,It's a career.
00:22:01,00:22:02,Yeah.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"It's a dying career, though."
00:22:03,00:22:04,Because young people are more attractive.
00:22:04,00:22:05,Or they're on their phones.
00:22:05,00:22:08,They don't want to have their ears picked by a stranger.
00:22:08,00:22:09,In the public.
00:22:09,00:22:12,You can be on your phone and have your earpicks at the same time.
00:22:12,00:22:13,Yeah.
00:22:13,00:22:14,That's right.
00:22:14,00:22:15,It's one of the few things you can do.
00:22:15,00:22:17,People at once on two different phones.
00:22:17,00:22:18,Sure.
00:22:18,00:22:21,I forgot you could use phones to phone people.
00:22:21,00:22:24,"But it's true that they have this whole set of picks, don't they?"
00:22:24,00:22:25,Yeah.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Is there a cleaning guy on their spoon at home?
00:22:26,00:22:27,Do you?
00:22:27,00:22:28,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:28,00:22:29,And it lights up.
00:22:29,00:22:31,So you can see inside the ear when you're picking stuff.
00:22:31,00:22:32,But you can't.
00:22:32,00:22:33,What does ever mirror?
00:22:33,00:22:34,"No, no, you do it for other people."
00:22:34,00:22:36,"Like you've said, it's like, yeah, yeah."
00:22:36,00:22:37,"But I don't use it, by the way."
00:22:37,00:22:38,It's a spot.
00:22:38,00:22:39,It's a career.
00:22:39,00:22:42,But the thing is that cotton buds are being banned in the UK.
00:22:42,00:22:47,So there's every chance of the year spoon or the roving ear cleaner could make a comeback.
00:22:47,00:22:48,Post Brexit.
00:22:48,00:22:54,"No smart phones, but here's your roving ear cleaner."
00:22:54,00:22:57,Thanks Boris.
00:22:57,00:23:07,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:23:07,00:23:08,And that is my fact.
00:23:08,00:23:13,My fact this week is that the biggest single biomedical laboratory in Europe designed to
00:23:13,00:23:17,encourage scientists to chat more to each other is so noisy that scientists are actually
00:23:17,00:23:21,complaining it's too hard to concentrate.
00:23:21,00:23:25,This is an amazing building that's up in London.
00:23:25,00:23:27,It's in the Houston area.
00:23:27,00:23:30,And it is it's ginormous.
00:23:30,00:23:33,"It's it's 1,250 people work there."
00:23:33,00:23:36,They're collaborating from different fields of medicine.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"And it's the Francis Quick Institute, isn't it?"
00:23:38,00:23:39,That's right.
00:23:39,00:23:40,It's called the Francis Quick Institute or it's nickname.
00:23:40,00:23:46,So it's run the head of it is Sir Paul Nurse who is a Nobel Prize winning scientist.
00:23:46,00:23:50,"So it's nickname is Sir Paul's Cathedral, which is quite a cool name."
00:23:50,00:23:51,Yeah.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"And he had influence over the design, didn't he?"
00:23:53,00:23:58,And he said that he wanted the atmosphere to encourage a gentle sort of anarchy.
00:23:58,00:24:01,"So yeah, you don't necessarily want the scientists to talk to each other all the time, I suppose"
00:24:01,00:24:02,is what we're saying.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"Sometimes you just need to be quiet in a test tube, right?"
00:24:04,00:24:05,Yeah.
00:24:05,00:24:10,"I suppose the problem is it's not in a test tube, sorry, unless you're a test tube, baby."
00:24:10,00:24:11,Yes.
00:24:11,00:24:12,Then stay in your test tube.
00:24:12,00:24:16,I think there's a difference between creating an atmosphere where people are there to work
00:24:16,00:24:21,and collaborate as well as creating a sort of cafe like atmosphere where people just come
00:24:21,00:24:23,because they know that that's where their buddies are going to be.
00:24:23,00:24:27,So I think a lot of people are distracted when they're trying to do quiet work on an idea
00:24:27,00:24:34,by PhD students coming in who've just graduated or so on and having parties without
00:24:34,00:24:38,"groups, not without actually having the party but effectively grouped."
00:24:38,00:24:39,Yeah.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Yeah.
00:24:40,00:24:41,And this is not everyone who's complaining.
00:24:41,00:24:42,It's working incredibly well.
00:24:42,00:24:43,Yeah.
00:24:43,00:24:44,It's not.
00:24:44,00:24:45,It's not failed.
00:24:45,00:24:46,It's literally one dude.
00:24:46,00:24:50,Do you know what's underneath it?
00:24:50,00:24:51,Underneath the...
00:24:51,00:24:57,"Underneath the France's Cric building, it's around about where Boudica was buried, supposedly."
00:24:57,00:24:59,"Oh, well, she's been joined, actually."
00:24:59,00:25:01,Is it plague?
00:25:01,00:25:04,"The Boudica plague, probably some plague, sure."
00:25:04,00:25:08,"And also, so it's obviously named after Francis Cric and his son, Mike, is still alive."
00:25:08,00:25:13,And he donated Cric's California license plate into a time capsule which is buried underneath
00:25:13,00:25:14,the building.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"So the ceremony, they buried it."
00:25:15,00:25:16,Yeah.
00:25:16,00:25:17,Is there a reason for that?
00:25:17,00:25:18,I don't know.
00:25:18,00:25:19,The license plate number was ATGC.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Yeah.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:21,00:25:23,So those are the four letters that make up DNA.
00:25:23,00:25:24,So that's what that is.
00:25:24,00:25:25,Ah.
00:25:25,00:25:26,That's so clever.
00:25:26,00:25:27,Ah.
00:25:27,00:25:28,ATGNC.
00:25:28,00:25:29,Yeah.
00:25:29,00:25:30,That's cool.
00:25:30,00:25:32,So that's underneath there.
00:25:32,00:25:34,Which is what Cric did.
00:25:34,00:25:35,Which...
00:25:35,00:25:36,Ah!
00:25:36,00:25:37,Ah!
00:25:37,00:25:39,This is all coming together.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Was it golden?
00:25:40,00:25:41,No.
00:25:41,00:25:42,What's in Cric?
00:25:42,00:25:43,What's in Cric?
00:25:43,00:25:44,What's in Cric?
00:25:44,00:25:47,"Cric and Watson, as we tend to say, for some reason, Rosalind Franklin."
00:25:47,00:25:54,"Rosalind Franklin, who's been left out of the history, but for Pete Best of the DNA."
00:25:54,00:25:55,Yeah.
00:25:55,00:25:57,If Pete Best had secretly written all the Beatles songs.
00:25:57,00:25:58,Yeah.
00:25:58,00:26:03,"It's coming to my theory, Pete Best."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"So this thing, is it all about open plan, basically?"
00:26:05,00:26:06,Yeah.
00:26:06,00:26:08,It's an open plan office.
00:26:08,00:26:12,"To an extent, if you look inside, it's obviously got levels."
00:26:12,00:26:18,But it's one of those ones where it all looks down into a big courtyard of desks and everything
00:26:18,00:26:19,seems to be open.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Yeah.
00:26:20,00:26:22,Because open plan is very...
00:26:22,00:26:25,"It's kind of controversial now, right?"
00:26:25,00:26:28,"In fact, I think most studies show that it's a negative thing, has a negative impact"
00:26:28,00:26:29,on work.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Really?
00:26:30,00:26:33,"And it's very trendy, but I get really confused because people talk about open plan as if it's"
00:26:33,00:26:34,like a trendy cool thing.
00:26:34,00:26:39,"And it seems so obvious to me, surely, the reason we have open plan, and it's generally"
00:26:39,00:26:42,"in Britain and America, is just a hell of a lot cheaper."
00:26:42,00:26:43,Saves money on walls.
00:26:43,00:26:44,It just saves a hell of a lot of money.
00:26:44,00:26:46,You can squash way more people in.
00:26:46,00:26:50,"I think we should stop pretending we're doing it for the good of our employees, for bonding"
00:26:50,00:26:52,"and stuff, and be like, ""Sorry, guys, we're cheap."""
00:26:52,00:26:53,"Yeah, we have..."
00:26:53,00:26:54,How many rooms do we have in this building?
00:26:54,00:26:55,We have four.
00:26:55,00:26:58,We should have a maximum of four members of staff here.
00:26:58,00:27:01,"At any one time, we should all get a room each."
00:27:01,00:27:04,That's what they have in places like Germany and Scandinavia.
00:27:04,00:27:05,Everyone will have a room.
00:27:05,00:27:06,Really?
00:27:06,00:27:08,Because that's a better way to work.
00:27:08,00:27:13,"Well, the person who invented cubicles, he was called Robert Props, and he thought that"
00:27:13,00:27:15,it would be like a dynamic.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"Everyone would have that area, and it would be really dynamic, and you could move around"
00:27:18,00:27:20,"it, and it would be really good for work."
00:27:20,00:27:23,"But of course, what happened was, companies just made them smaller and smaller and smaller"
00:27:23,00:27:27,"until it was the smallest amount that one person could work in, and then obviously it had"
00:27:27,00:27:28,the upset effect.
00:27:28,00:27:29,Yeah.
00:27:29,00:27:34,"A friend of mine, their office is being relocated completely to a new place that is going to be this"
00:27:34,00:27:39,"open plan layout, but they're taking it a step further now, where no one will have an"
00:27:39,00:27:40,assigned desk.
00:27:40,00:27:41,It will be...
00:27:41,00:27:42,A hot desk.
00:27:42,00:27:48,"And the theory behind that is that the idea is that's going to encourage more work, because"
00:27:48,00:27:52,"you want to get to work as early as possible to find a good seat next to an influential person,"
00:27:52,00:27:56,because everyone of every level is going to be sitting around this same desk.
00:27:56,00:28:00,"So if you want to get next to the boss, close to them, you arrive at 830 in the morning."
00:28:00,00:28:03,But what if the boss doesn't come until 10?
00:28:03,00:28:04,It's the whole thing's a risk.
00:28:04,00:28:07,"You've got to work out the rhythm, see when they arrive, all that sort of stuff."
00:28:07,00:28:08,"But in theory, that's..."
00:28:08,00:28:11,"Why we just hide in the toilets, watching the office, and waiting for the boss to arrive."
00:28:11,00:28:13,But then lots of people hide in the toilets.
00:28:13,00:28:14,More toilets.
00:28:14,00:28:21,"Everyone's just going to be following the boss in a way, like a holly out of Delo."
00:28:21,00:28:25,"I'd never heard that as a justification for hot desking, because everyone always claims"
00:28:25,00:28:28,"that's a good thing, hot desking, and you don't have too much your own."
00:28:28,00:28:29,It is more efficient.
00:28:29,00:28:31,Because you always do have a couple of people in a big office.
00:28:31,00:28:35,You'll have ex-people who don't turn up or who are ill or who are travelling for business
00:28:35,00:28:36,or whatever.
00:28:36,00:28:37,"So, you know, there is a..."
00:28:37,00:28:41,But it's risky because people leave food on their desk or people leave mugs.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"Leave books, don't they?"
00:28:43,00:28:44,Yeah.
00:28:44,00:28:45,Personal items.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Why are you looking at Dan?
00:28:47,00:28:48,Why are you looking at me?
00:28:48,00:28:49,No reason.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"So, Anna, you know how you stand up at your desk quite a lot?"
00:28:51,00:28:52,Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:56,"That, according to a study, office workers could lose half a stone a year by standing up"
00:28:56,00:28:57,at their desks.
00:28:57,00:28:59,That's what I'm actually in minus weight now.
00:28:59,00:29:01,I'm in minus two's turn.
00:29:01,00:29:06,"If I just stood up for the last 12 years that I'd been working at QI, I would now weigh"
00:29:06,00:29:09,about eight stone.
00:29:09,00:29:10,I imagine that's how that works.
00:29:10,00:29:11,Yeah.
00:29:11,00:29:15,"So, I was looking up distraction and concentration and things like that."
00:29:15,00:29:16,Yeah.
00:29:16,00:29:20,"So, when you're concentrating or when you think you're concentrating, it turns out"
00:29:20,00:29:23,"that if you look at your brain activity, you're actually distracted quite a lot."
00:29:23,00:29:30,"So, in between bursts of attention, attention is the study described as a search light that"
00:29:30,00:29:33,sort of shines on the thing you're reading or the thing you're studying and then shines
00:29:33,00:29:37,away again just to see if there's anything more important or dangerous going on that you
00:29:37,00:29:38,need to know about.
00:29:38,00:29:43,"So, how often do you guess that happens that the brain sort of scans the area and see?"
00:29:43,00:29:44,Every three minutes.
00:29:44,00:29:45,Okay.
00:29:45,00:29:51,"Okay, 45 seconds."
00:29:51,00:29:55,It's four times a second.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Four times a second.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"Is that one of the, you're not getting the elephant done?"
00:29:59,00:30:00,"I'm not like, I totally phased out while you were explaining, brilliant, brilliant, genuinely."
00:30:00,00:30:01,Yeah.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"To be fair, he was scanning for danger."
00:30:02,00:30:03,"Four times a second, no."
00:30:03,00:30:04,No.
00:30:04,00:30:08,"Yes, and your brain, basically, alters your perception to make you think it's a constant"
00:30:08,00:30:10,movie of you just focusing on one thing.
00:30:10,00:30:14,"Four times a second, your brain sort of temporarily takes its attention away its scan."
00:30:14,00:30:16,This wouldn't get any further.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"This is, it happens."
00:30:18,00:30:20,"Yeah, it's cool, right?"
00:30:20,00:30:21,It's weird.
00:30:21,00:30:25,"Okay, so each of these scanaways, they must be an absolute micro-millionaire."
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Yeah, it's short."
00:30:26,00:30:31,"It's not, it doesn't take a quarter of a second, four times a second, but it's just like"
00:30:31,00:30:32,"breathe, blink."
00:30:32,00:30:33,"No, it's not like that."
00:30:33,00:30:36,I wish you hadn't zoned out while I was just saying the thing.
00:30:36,00:30:37,I'm not going to go back and say it.
00:30:37,00:30:38,I'll go with it.
00:30:38,00:30:39,I'll go with it.
00:30:39,00:30:40,I'll go with it.
00:30:40,00:30:41,I'll go with it.
00:30:41,00:30:42,I'll go with it.
00:30:42,00:30:43,Yeah.
00:30:43,00:30:44,Yeah.
00:30:44,00:30:45,That I had never heard.
00:30:45,00:30:46,I thought it was super cool.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Have we mentioned this before?
00:30:47,00:30:51,We mentioned the special feces studying lab in the Soviet Union.
00:30:51,00:30:52,Hello.
00:30:52,00:31:00,"So this is, in the 1940s, the USSR developed a secret lab, a studying world leaders poo."
00:31:00,00:31:01,What?
00:31:01,00:31:02,It was to find out stuff about them.
00:31:02,00:31:07,"And the justification that people have made, have backdated to it, is that we didn't really"
00:31:07,00:31:12,"have CCTV or other ways of watching people, so we collected their poo instead."
00:31:12,00:31:14,"And this is genuinely someone found this out a couple of years ago, going through these old"
00:31:14,00:31:15,archives.
00:31:15,00:31:20,"And Beria, Stalin, sort of right-hand man, Beria was in charge of it."
00:31:20,00:31:21,And it was a special department.
00:31:21,00:31:28,"And for instance, in 1949, they had special toilets installed for mal when he came and visited."
00:31:28,00:31:29,And they weren't connected to the sewers.
00:31:29,00:31:33,"They were connected to boxes underneath his loo, which they then collected and they went"
00:31:33,00:31:34,through it.
00:31:34,00:31:38,"And it was like, if you found certain things like apparently, if you found amino acid,"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"a trip to fan, it meant they were calm and approachable."
00:31:41,00:31:43,And perhaps you could do a deal with them.
00:31:43,00:31:47,"And the theory was, if there wasn't very much potassium in their poo, then they had a lack"
00:31:47,00:31:49,"of sleep and might be a bit stressed, a bit techy."
00:31:49,00:31:50,Give them a banana.
00:31:50,00:31:52,"Give them a bloody banana, and they won't impress the red button."
00:31:52,00:31:55,"But we know now that people are still doing this, right?"
00:31:55,00:31:58,"So Kim Jong-un did that during the Singapore summit this year, brought his own Tyler."
00:31:58,00:31:59,To eat.
00:31:59,00:32:00,For exactly the same reason.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"Was that so they couldn't steal his poo and study it, yeah?"
00:32:02,00:32:03,"Yes, yes."
00:32:03,00:32:07,So he would have taken all of that back to North Korea when he left.
00:32:07,00:32:08,Lucky them.
00:32:08,00:32:09,Because bizarre.
00:32:09,00:32:10,Yeah.
00:32:10,00:32:13,But then we now know that there's a historical justification for it.
00:32:13,00:32:14,Yeah.
00:32:14,00:32:18,"I always thought it was them just being paranoid, but I think it is them being paranoid."
00:32:18,00:32:19,Is it?
00:32:19,00:32:20,"Oh, no."
00:32:20,00:32:21,"Although, no, you're right."
00:32:21,00:32:22,We know that they were doing it.
00:32:22,00:32:24,"And we know, now I bet you can learn way more from someone's work."
00:32:24,00:32:25,Yeah.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"If there's a house guest visiting my place, I'm not ashamed to say, oh, I'll analyse."
00:32:28,00:32:29,Yeah.
00:32:29,00:32:31,I do think you should be ashamed to say that.
00:32:31,00:32:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:32,00:32:35,Why do you keep giving me bananas whenever I come around?
00:32:35,00:32:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:37,00:32:47,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski."
00:32:47,00:32:52,My fact this week is that the largest sunflower farm in Ontario has been forced to shut because
00:32:52,00:32:55,so many people were taking selfies there.
00:32:55,00:32:57,And this is a really funny story.
00:32:57,00:32:58,It's from this summer.
00:32:58,00:33:00,The farm is called Bogle Seeds Farm.
00:33:00,00:33:01,It's in a place called Hamilton.
00:33:01,00:33:03,And it's absolutely massive.
00:33:03,00:33:06,They were 1.6 million sunflower plants over 68 acres.
00:33:06,00:33:09,They thought it would be quite a good idea to make a bit of extra cash.
00:33:09,00:33:13,"Changed people some dollars by saying, you can come here, park up in this little car park."
00:33:13,00:33:15,"We've got, take a selfie, here you go."
00:33:15,00:33:17,And it went mad.
00:33:17,00:33:19,They were completely swamped.
00:33:19,00:33:22,Thousands and thousands of people came.
00:33:22,00:33:27,There was four kilometres of stationary traffic backed up on the road leading there.
00:33:27,00:33:29,There was a 300 car parking lot.
00:33:29,00:33:33,"And at any one time, there were 7,000 cars trying to park in it."
00:33:33,00:33:34,And it just turned into complete chaos.
00:33:34,00:33:36,They trashed the place.
00:33:36,00:33:37,And so they had to shut it.
00:33:37,00:33:39,People were cutting off the tops of sunflowers.
00:33:39,00:33:44,Someone said that one person urinated on one of the neighbor's bushes.
00:33:44,00:33:45,It was bad.
00:33:45,00:33:46,The pictures did look quite cool.
00:33:46,00:33:47,Didn't they?
00:33:47,00:33:48,The pictures look really nice.
00:33:48,00:33:49,Sunflowers are still pretty.
00:33:49,00:33:50,They are.
00:33:50,00:33:51,Yeah.
00:33:51,00:33:53,Lovely photos of people weeing and fighting and smashing their cars.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"On Instagram, that's not what the photos were."
00:33:55,00:33:57,They were just nice pictures of people with sunflowers.
00:33:57,00:33:58,That's true.
00:33:58,00:34:00,And it's your single weir.
00:34:00,00:34:02,"Apparently, people brought ladders to this place."
00:34:02,00:34:04,So you can go into the field and then climb up a ladder.
00:34:04,00:34:08,"So you can be poking out above the top of the sunflowers, which I think is quite clever."
00:34:08,00:34:11,"And also, maybe just because they're so tall sunflowers, I can't believe how high they"
00:34:11,00:34:12,can get.
00:34:12,00:34:14,They just want to get to the top.
00:34:14,00:34:17,"The largest that we have on record, this is a Guinness World Record, it's 30 feet in"
00:34:17,00:34:18,one inch.
00:34:18,00:34:19,I can't.
00:34:19,00:34:21,"That can't have been a happy sunflower, though."
00:34:21,00:34:22,Why?
00:34:22,00:34:24,"Because it would be quite stressed, wouldn't it?"
00:34:24,00:34:25,Self-conscious.
00:34:25,00:34:26,Yeah.
00:34:26,00:34:27,"Every time I hand it, it's much shorter."
00:34:27,00:34:28,Think about that.
00:34:28,00:34:29,But you're sure you would...
00:34:29,00:34:31,They must grow to get more light.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"And if they need more light, they must be stressed, right?"
00:34:34,00:34:35,That's in...
00:34:35,00:34:36,Yeah.
00:34:36,00:34:40,"So, for instance, forleaf clovers, they only grow if they're stressed forleaves, because they"
00:34:40,00:34:43,need an extra leaf to get more light and more energy.
00:34:43,00:34:44,No.
00:34:44,00:34:45,Did not.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"So usually when a plant does something weird, it's because they're stressed out."
00:34:48,00:34:51,"So now, whenever we find a forleaf clover, we have to go, ""Oh, that's so sad."""
00:34:51,00:34:53,Rather than thinking it's good enough.
00:34:53,00:34:54,That's what I always do.
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Oh, God."
00:34:55,00:34:56,It's such a killjoy.
00:34:56,00:34:57,30 feet.
00:34:57,00:34:58,Yeah.
00:34:58,00:34:59,"Yeah, I mean, that's..."
00:34:59,00:35:00,It's so difficult.
00:35:00,00:35:01,How did you grow?
00:35:01,00:35:03,You planted at the bottom of a well.
00:35:03,00:35:08,"Well, this is a guy who's managed to top his own record a few years in a row."
00:35:08,00:35:09,So he's...
00:35:09,00:35:10,It's just a girl.
00:35:10,00:35:11,"I mean, do you have to have it trellis to something?"
00:35:11,00:35:12,They're quite strong.
00:35:12,00:35:13,"Yeah, really strong."
00:35:13,00:35:14,They're really strong.
00:35:14,00:35:17,"Well, he's got some flowers that were super tall and they didn't have any."
00:35:17,00:35:18,Really?
00:35:18,00:35:19,But not 30 feet tall.
00:35:19,00:35:26,"I should just say that the, sorry, the reaction of the bogal seed farmers was negative"
00:35:26,00:35:27,to this chaos.
00:35:27,00:35:30,"So just to conclude the story, because you should really go on their website."
00:35:30,00:35:31,So they closed down the farm.
00:35:31,00:35:34,"They said, we're not having anyone else here this year, although they are still selling"
00:35:34,00:35:35,seeds.
00:35:35,00:35:36,But no one can come anymore.
00:35:36,00:35:39,And you should go to the website because it's so aggressive.
00:35:39,00:35:44,"They've got about seven different notices saying, so they say, unfortunately, with the police"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"involved, you know, all lots of capitals."
00:35:46,00:35:48,They have to call the police.
00:35:48,00:35:51,"We've had to close the photo opportunities due to traffic jams, et cetera."
00:35:51,00:35:55,There's a big one of those running banners that you get on slightly mad people's websites
00:35:55,00:35:58,"that's, like, in capital letters, closed for the season."
00:35:58,00:35:59,Wow.
00:35:59,00:36:02,"I mean, they sort of ask people to come."
00:36:02,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:04,And then lots of people came.
00:36:04,00:36:05,They didn't know how popular they'd be.
00:36:05,00:36:07,It's not the people's fault for coming.
00:36:07,00:36:08,It's not any individual person's fault.
00:36:08,00:36:10,It's the individual urinator in the bushes.
00:36:10,00:36:11,Yeah.
00:36:11,00:36:12,Yeah.
00:36:12,00:36:13,Or the people who are cutting tops off.
00:36:13,00:36:14,Yeah.
00:36:14,00:36:15,I think I can blame those people.
00:36:15,00:36:18,"And they do say, now they've still got people coming who will, like, swear and abuse them"
00:36:18,00:36:21,"and say, no, I've driven four hours to get here."
00:36:21,00:36:23,"Oh, you've got to let me check the website before you go."
00:36:23,00:36:25,"Check the website, guys."
00:36:25,00:36:30,"So, some flowers are massive in Russia, in every sense of the word."
00:36:30,00:36:36,"So they're from America originally, some flowers, and then they were brought over to Europe."
00:36:36,00:36:41,"And in the 18th century, they were really popular in Russia, because you were banned from"
00:36:41,00:36:46,"consuming oil during Lent, but you weren't banned from consuming sunflower oil, loophole."
00:36:46,00:36:50,Because they didn't know it existed back in the day when they wrote the rules.
00:36:50,00:36:51,Yeah.
00:36:51,00:36:55,"So, it's just an absolute get-around, and you could, you know, use the oil for food or"
00:36:55,00:36:57,"for light, or for whatever it might be."
00:36:57,00:36:58,Yeah.
00:36:58,00:36:59,So the Russians used to have massive sunflower fields.
00:36:59,00:37:00,"Well, they still do."
00:37:00,00:37:06,"The two biggest producers of sunflower oil are Russia and Ukraine, which means that tensions"
00:37:06,00:37:10,between those two countries have affected the world's supply of sunflower oil.
00:37:10,00:37:11,"Oh, wow, really?"
00:37:11,00:37:12,Yeah.
00:37:12,00:37:17,"God, I didn't know how I felt about that battle, but now I'm really anti, because sunflower"
00:37:17,00:37:19,"oils are useful, I think, to have around, isn't it?"
00:37:19,00:37:20,Yeah.
00:37:20,00:37:27,"And about the fact that sunflowers are used in nuclear, apocalyptic sites, basically."
00:37:27,00:37:34,"So Fukushima, for example, part of the process of trying to clear a radiation was to plant"
00:37:34,00:37:38,"millions and millions of sunflowers, because they soak up the radiation."
00:37:38,00:37:41,And this was a thing that was employed in Chernobyl as well.
00:37:41,00:37:42,"Oh, really?"
00:37:42,00:37:43,Yeah.
00:37:43,00:37:44,Yeah.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Lots of planting.
00:37:45,00:37:49,"And it's many, it's many different flowers and field mustard."
00:37:49,00:37:53,"I must admit, I read that, and I thought it probably wasn't true, because it's the obvious"
00:37:53,00:37:54,"thing to put in, isn't it?"
00:37:54,00:38:01,"Sunflowers, it's light, it's energy, it feels like a kind of a folk remedy to that, doesn't"
00:38:01,00:38:02,it?
00:38:02,00:38:03,Yes.
00:38:03,00:38:04,"But then it's 100% free, isn't it?"
00:38:04,00:38:05,"No, they have."
00:38:05,00:38:06,"Yeah, they have studied it."
00:38:06,00:38:08,"They have hyperacumulators, which take up heavy metals from soil."
00:38:08,00:38:10,Do you know who's a big fan of sunflowers?
00:38:10,00:38:11,Huge fan.
00:38:11,00:38:12,"Oh, it gives a clue."
00:38:12,00:38:13,My wife.
00:38:13,00:38:14,Really?
00:38:14,00:38:15,Yeah.
00:38:15,00:38:16,That wasn't going to...
00:38:16,00:38:17,"Well, it's someone very similar to your wife, actually."
00:38:17,00:38:22,"Oh, um, I've got a lot of people here."
00:38:22,00:38:24,"No, it's a summer bin Laden."
00:38:24,00:38:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:25,00:38:27,I thought she reminds me a bit.
00:38:27,00:38:28,She's tall.
00:38:28,00:38:29,"Yeah, exactly."
00:38:29,00:38:30,She's not big.
00:38:30,00:38:31,She's not big.
00:38:31,00:38:32,She's an American.
00:38:32,00:38:38,"Yeah, he had a passion for them, apparently, going to his wife, he loved growing, he always"
00:38:38,00:38:41,"grew them, he loved growing the biggest sunflowers in his village."
00:38:41,00:38:43,Do you know what's ironic about sunflowers?
00:38:43,00:38:48,A summer bin Laden loved them.
00:38:48,00:38:51,Is it that they come out at night?
00:38:51,00:38:52,"Oh, that's good."
00:38:52,00:38:53,What?
00:38:53,00:38:54,Where do they hide?
00:38:54,00:38:55,"No, I'm guessing."
00:38:55,00:38:56,"Oh, right."
00:38:56,00:38:57,That would be ironic.
00:38:57,00:38:59,If there's sunflowers in the bin Laden.
00:38:59,00:39:00,They hate the sun.
00:39:00,00:39:01,They love the sun.
00:39:01,00:39:03,They fall around all over the place.
00:39:03,00:39:04,None of that.
00:39:04,00:39:05,No.
00:39:05,00:39:08,"It's that they're the only flower with the word flower in their name, but they're not a"
00:39:08,00:39:09,flower.
00:39:09,00:39:12,They're not a flower.
00:39:12,00:39:13,No.
00:39:13,00:39:14,What?
00:39:14,00:39:17,They are thousands of flowers.
00:39:17,00:39:21,So each sunflower is actually thousands of little flowers.
00:39:21,00:39:25,"The definition of a flower is obviously like, you know, the bit that has the reproductive"
00:39:25,00:39:26,organs.
00:39:26,00:39:30,"And on the sunflower, the bits that are the, called the disc florets."
00:39:30,00:39:34,"So if you follow the big yellow petals down, you then get all these little circular bits."
00:39:34,00:39:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:35,00:39:36,A bit more brown.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"Yes, exactly."
00:39:37,00:39:38,The bit more brown bits.
00:39:38,00:39:40,"They have male and female reproductive organs, each one of those."
00:39:40,00:39:43,So each little petal with a disparate attached is a flower.
00:39:43,00:39:44,Wow.
00:39:44,00:39:47,"So every time we see a sunflower now, we should call it a sunflowers."
00:39:47,00:39:48,Exactly.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"Yeah, I will do that from now on."
00:39:49,00:39:50,I know.
00:39:50,00:39:51,"You actually will, aren't you?"
00:39:51,00:39:52,I won't.
00:39:52,00:39:55,As you're eating your penino.
00:39:55,00:39:58,What technically then is it?
00:39:58,00:39:59,It's a group of flowers.
00:39:59,00:40:00,A group of flowers.
00:40:00,00:40:01,It's a group of flowers.
00:40:01,00:40:02,That is going to be absolutely.
00:40:02,00:40:03,That's going to save me a lot of money.
00:40:03,00:40:06,"It's going to be able to say darling, I've got you two thousand sunflowers."
00:40:06,00:40:10,"Hey, I've got another ironic thing about something."
00:40:10,00:40:11,Sunflowers.
00:40:11,00:40:12,Yeah.
00:40:12,00:40:15,This is about Van Gogh or Van Ruch.
00:40:15,00:40:17,So he never sold any of his sunflower portraits.
00:40:17,00:40:22,I think he painted about 11 and he never sold a single one in his lifetime.
00:40:22,00:40:27,"And yet now, the one that the National Gallery in London has won, and they sell more postcards"
00:40:27,00:40:29,of that than of any other picture they've got.
00:40:29,00:40:34,"When you go to the National Gallery, they say no taking photos, but actually since 2014,"
00:40:34,00:40:38,they've lifted the ban on selfies and taking photos because they realized they just couldn't
00:40:38,00:40:39,regulate it.
00:40:39,00:40:43,"So if they saw someone with a phone out, most people, they couldn't tell if they were googling"
00:40:43,00:40:48,"something, texting or whether or not they were about to use it to take a sneaky photo."
00:40:48,00:40:53,"So they do know that certain flashes and so on do actually affect paintings, but they've"
00:40:53,00:40:58,only with a few specific paintings said now that is illegal to take a selfie with.
00:40:58,00:41:03,But that's also ironic that a place with hundreds of self-portraits stops you from taking
00:41:03,00:41:04,a self-portrait.
00:41:04,00:41:05,Yeah.
00:41:05,00:41:06,Apart from they don't anyone.
00:41:06,00:41:07,They don't.
00:41:07,00:41:12,They use to the irony used to exist and it now does not.
00:41:12,00:41:14,That's the right thing about the sunflowers.
00:41:14,00:41:21,"The painting is wilting, all the Van Gogh's sunflowers are going brown, very slowly."
00:41:21,00:41:25,"As in, because the ink is, yeah, because he used paint which degrades under light."
00:41:25,00:41:30,"Although great news is not yet visible to the human eye, so I'm pretty stopped panicking."
00:41:30,00:41:31,Wow.
00:41:31,00:41:34,So the painting of sunflowers doesn't like the light.
00:41:34,00:41:35,Brilliant.
00:41:35,00:41:36,Love it.
00:41:36,00:41:37,He's special.
00:41:37,00:41:41,"Past and present irony, especially, yeah."
00:41:41,00:41:42,Yeah.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"But they've analysed the chemicals and they know which, because they use different pigments"
00:41:44,00:41:48,for different bits of the painting and one of the pigments is going to steadily get brown.
00:41:48,00:41:49,Hey.
00:41:49,00:41:50,Yeah.
00:41:50,00:41:51,"Well, that's fitting, isn't it?"
00:41:51,00:41:52,Because they all die eventually.
00:41:52,00:41:53,As do we all.
00:41:53,00:41:54,And I think that's the point you were trying to make when he used that chemical.
00:41:54,00:41:55,Yep.
00:41:55,00:41:58,He was another man with great foresight.
00:41:58,00:42:01,Do you know the optimal distance that was to take a photo of your face?
00:42:01,00:42:02,Is it arm's length?
00:42:02,00:42:03,"Sadly, it's not."
00:42:03,00:42:08,So that's why everyone looks hideous and selfies and they should all stop doing them.
00:42:08,00:42:10,So five feet is the best distance for a portrait.
00:42:10,00:42:13,That's the one that's the length that doesn't distort your facial features.
00:42:13,00:42:17,"Well, you know what that is about the length of an arm's length and the selfie stick."
00:42:17,00:42:18,Yeah.
00:42:18,00:42:20,It's about the length of a giant armadillo.
00:42:20,00:42:23,"Yeah, but selfie sticks are more easily gotten."
00:42:23,00:42:27,"Well, I wouldn't hate someone carrying around a giant armadillo quite as much as that."
00:42:27,00:42:28,Hang on.
00:42:28,00:42:35,"All the tourists in Covet Garden were walking around with giant armadillos, you would soon get sick of it."
00:42:35,00:42:40,"But no, selfies make your face look 30% faster, 30% wider than it is, don't they?"
00:42:40,00:42:42,Because they're too close up.
00:42:42,00:42:43,Right.
00:42:43,00:42:45,"So Kim Kardashian, she takes love selfies."
00:42:45,00:42:46,Yeah.
00:42:46,00:42:48,And she seems to look normal in them.
00:42:48,00:42:51,Does she have an extremely thin face in me?
00:42:51,00:42:52,Yeah.
00:42:52,00:42:53,I don't know.
00:42:53,00:42:54,It's like a freak.
00:42:54,00:42:59,"Actually, weirdly, Finella was showing me last night a picture of Kim Kardashian when she was 14"
00:42:59,00:43:04,"versus now to show the facial difference and her note, she looks like she's had a lot of"
00:43:04,00:43:06,the work done that would make her selfie look right.
00:43:06,00:43:09,"Well, she's the professional person who needs to look good, I'm not surprised."
00:43:09,00:43:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:10,00:43:12,Suggesting that Kim Kardashian has had work done.
00:43:12,00:43:13,I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
00:43:13,00:43:17,This podcast is ended up with us discussing Kim Kardashian's percential plastic surgery.
00:43:17,00:43:21,And so I got another Kim Kardashian factor.
00:43:21,00:43:26,And that is that she's been warned by doctors to stop taking selfies after a painful wrist
00:43:26,00:43:27,injury.
00:43:27,00:43:29,"Oh, he genuinely had one."
00:43:29,00:43:33,"Apparently, she's got RSI because she's taken so many selfies."
00:43:33,00:43:34,Really?
00:43:34,00:43:36,Doesn't she have any mates who will take a photo of her?
00:43:36,00:43:37,It's a selfie.
00:43:37,00:43:38,You got to do a...
00:43:38,00:43:39,"Well, you can just call it a photograph."
00:43:39,00:43:41,I've got a word for the other one.
00:43:41,00:43:43,It's all about the angles.
00:43:43,00:43:48,"She released a book called Selfie, which was literally 500 selfies."
00:43:48,00:43:49,That was the whole book.
00:43:49,00:43:50,You loved it.
00:43:50,00:43:51,Absolutely loved it.
00:43:51,00:43:58,"I've got a selfie factor, which is that in Ohio, there was a man who was wanted by the police."
00:43:58,00:44:01,And his name was Donald A. Chip Pugh.
00:44:01,00:44:04,He was wanted by the Lima police in Ohio.
00:44:04,00:44:05,And so they put a picture...
00:44:05,00:44:06,Hang on.
00:44:06,00:44:07,Hang on.
00:44:07,00:44:08,"Hey, they're looking at the wrong place."
00:44:08,00:44:09,Yeah.
00:44:09,00:44:10,There's a county called Lima.
00:44:10,00:44:11,How do I remember?
00:44:11,00:44:12,"The animal, the Lima police."
00:44:12,00:44:16,The most adorable police in the whole country.
00:44:16,00:44:25,"Yeah, so they released a photo of him, which they said, ""Have you seen this guy please"
00:44:25,00:44:27,"get in contact?"""
00:44:27,00:44:31,"And someone who got in contact was Donald himself, who did not like the photo that they"
00:44:31,00:44:32,were using.
00:44:32,00:44:37,"So he sent him an updated selfie of him sitting in a car with sunglasses on, looking like"
00:44:37,00:44:38,he's cool.
00:44:38,00:44:42,"And they ended up using that photo as well, sending a message saying, ""This photo was"
00:44:42,00:44:45,sent to us by Mr. Pugh himself.
00:44:45,00:44:49,"We thank him for being helpful, but now we'd appreciate it if he would come to speak to us"
00:44:49,00:44:50,"about his charges."""
00:44:50,00:44:52,"But yeah, they actually use his..."
00:44:52,00:44:53,Do we know what happened at the end?
00:44:53,00:44:55,"No, I haven't found an update."
00:44:55,00:44:58,"Are we sure you didn't just send him a picture of somebody else and think, ""Oh, he's"
00:44:58,00:45:00,"gone away with that one."""
00:45:00,00:45:07,"Okay, that's it."
00:45:07,00:45:08,That is all of our facts.
00:45:08,00:45:09,Thank you so much for listening.
