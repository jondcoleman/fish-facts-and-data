00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.260
 Hello everyone and welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.560
 Now why am I talking to you before the show starts?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.080
 Well, of course it is because one of us is away this week and it is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.880
 So in his place we have gotten the most Dan Schreiber person we can.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.280
 In fact, the most Dan Schreiber person in the entirety of the world.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.200
 Arguably more Dan Schreiber than Dan Schreiber himself.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.680
 It is the wonderful, incredible, you'll know him from Flight of the Concords, Tumanji,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.600
 our flag means death, of course it is Rhys Darby.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.240
 Now we always love to see Rhys when he's in town and we are so lucky that he is currently

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.640
 on tour in the UK and that means that as well as enjoying him on our podcast, you can go

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 and see his show.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.440
 So if you are listening to this on the day it goes out, then quick go to the internet

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.280
 and get tickets to his show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.040
 And if you live in Brighton Sheffield, St Albans Leeds, Swindon, Exeter, Bristol, Newcastle,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.720
 Glasgow, Manchester or Edinburgh, then you are also in luck because he is yet to do your

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 cities.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 If you want to get tickets for that, you must go to RhysDarby.com, that's R-H-Y-S-D-A-R-B-Y

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.120
 .com, all of the information, all of the tickets are available on there.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.640
 But for now, please enjoy the fabulous Tour de Force, that is Rhys Darby.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.240
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:42.480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.480
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.980
 My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.400
 and the inimitable Rhys Darby, who has joined us in place of Dan Shriver today.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.920
 So without further ado, we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.900
 from the last seven days in no particular order.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.900
 Here we go.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.400
 Rhys, what's your fact?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.560
 Well, and thank you for having me.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.560
 Hi everyone.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.440
 How are you?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.160
 Good.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.200
 The most highly decorated Soviet Air Unit of World War II didn't take part in the victory

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.620
 parade because their planes were too slow.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.620
 Wow.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.460
 Can you tell us more, why would a slow plane be useful in a war anyway?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.660
 Well, funny you should ask.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.100
 Do I now dive into the...

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.100
 Dive in.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.100
 [Music]

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.100
 Mosquito.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.100
 Yes.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.100
 But what type?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.100
 The plane.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100
 The plane, the Mosquito.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 No, no, no.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:55.640
 It was, in fact, a South Pacific Mosquito and that was its last flight before I killed

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640
 it.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.140
 Right, but back to the...

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.140
 Cool.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.160
 So basically, this is the story of a unit that was in Russia during World War II, the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.080
 Night Bomber Regiment, entirely made up of females, with ground crew and the air crew,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.500
 and they flew very old biplanes called the Polikropov or the Po-2, very old planes made

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 of wood.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 Wow.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.500
 And they were super slow.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.700
 They were slow, I think, because they were old planes.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.100
 They were old crop dusters, weren't they?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.180
 Yes, that's right.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.660
 They were amazingly slow, like top speed 90 miles an hour.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.660
 Yeah.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.660
 That is slow.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.360
 I drove faster than that, and my way's a nursery today.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360
 Okay.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.160
 It is a 20-mile-an-hour zone.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.080
 Yeah, but the idea was, because they were so old and made of wood, they were really

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.080
 quiet, and so they could kind of get under the radar a little bit and do lots of bombing

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080
 raids one after the other.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.920
 And they were known as the witches, right?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.920
 Yes.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.920
 And do we know why they were called witches?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920
 Night witches.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920
 They were witches.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.920
 They were witches.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.920
 It was no two ways about it.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.220
 They've got some great pictures here of them.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.220
 Yeah.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.220
 Poetry hearts.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.220
 Yeah.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.260
 They had spells and all sorts of stuff, so it was quite amazing.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.460
 But yeah, but because they turned their engines off from their planes, and they did this so

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.420
 that they would come in silently, and so just to give you an impression of that one coming

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.420
 in.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:46.280
 And then they would literally just drop bombs, and I don't know when they started their planes

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.280
 up again.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:57.380
 Like they just passed the bombing zone, you know, and then sort of back they fly.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.900
 So yeah, so just to reiterate, I think the Germans felt that they sounded like witches

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.940
 on broomsticks coming in and just, you know, dropping bombs.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.940
 Swishing away.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.640
 And let's not forget Marina Ruskova, Ruskova, the lead person in this group.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.160
 She had to really campaign to get it all happening.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.880
 Obviously, it was mainly men involved in the battles back then.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.140
 And you know, this is when Operation Barbarossa was on.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.440
 So this was the entire German army literally trying to take over Russia.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.760
 A very bold move, as we all know.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760
 How to play out.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.420
 It didn't quite work, but it did look good at the beginning.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.640
 So there was like over three million German troops.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.360
 They had, I think, three brigades, they had so many armoured divisions.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.800
 And there was really no opposition for a while.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.960
 They really were making a lot of ground.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.080
 And then it was a massive call up for the Russians to defend their land.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.320
 And the women as well were like, well, we want to help, you know, we're strong.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320
 Let's grab guns.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320
 Let's go.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.200
 It was the whole family, all family in, you know.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.680
 And then so this particular woman, Marina Roscova, she ended up really sort of...

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680
 She recruited, didn't she?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.680
 She recruited a lot.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.160
 I think over a thousand women and did the training and, you know, sort of formulate.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.000
 But she also persuaded Stalin, and an element that's often smooth though, for I feel, in

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.960
 the great stories of how heroic they were, which they were, is the fact that she was

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.720
 quite good mates with Stalin, which is how she managed to make happen.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720
 But it's OK.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.720
 We didn't know a lot of what we knew now.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720
 It's the foot in the door.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720
 You've got to get your foot in the door, right?

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.080
 She knew Stalin because she was one of the most famous women in Russia.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080
 Yeah.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.440
 She was an aviatrix, and she and her team had the world record for the longest continuous

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440
 flight.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.680
 And she was like a hero of the whole country.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.940
 And so when she came to say, I want my women to take part in the war, Stalin was not going

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.520
 to say no to her because she was so big.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.160
 But did say no to the equipment, like you're not having our planes.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.520
 These modern vehicles are not for you guys, ladies.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.240
 And so this is how it all sort of came together, is that they got the planes that were left

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240
 that no one wanted.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240
 By planes?

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240
 Yeah.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240
 It's crazy.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.240
 I didn't think by planes flew in the Second World War.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240
 I'm certainly not in combat.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.080
 But just can we quickly say about her earlier flight, where she was the navigator for this

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.800
 cross Soviet Union journey, right?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.360
 And it was 4,000 miles.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.320
 And as they were getting towards the end, there are two versions of the story.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.920
 One is that the plane was icing up and they threw everything out to try and maintain height.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.680
 And then she decided, it's not going to be enough, I'm going to have to throw myself

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.800
 out of the plane.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800
 Wow.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800
 And she did.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800
 That's the final straw.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.200
 There are two pilots in her, the navigator.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.700
 Surely they had clothing first.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.640
 These hippie boots have got to go.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.880
 But I don't think she was naked when she jumped out.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.720
 She wasn't naked because it was so cold, so she wanted a bit of protection.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.640
 But they'd thrown everything else out, like up to and including the compass, I think, as

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.120
 then she thought, my navigating job is done, so like we're very nearly there.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.120
 But so that's one version.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.080
 The other story is that they couldn't find the airfield and the navigator's cockpit

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.080
 had no protection.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.880
 Either way, she did jump out of the plane shortly before the end and she had no food

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.880
 or water for 10 days.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.000
 Eventually a hunter discovered her and that sort of cemented her heroics.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.280
 Can we just go back a little bit to her jumping out of the plane?

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280
 Did she have a parachute?

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.280
 Yes, she did.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280
 Did she?

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280
 She parachuted, yes.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.720
 Because actually the night witches didn't have parachutes, did they?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.840
 No, they didn't.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.160
 Just on this, another thing, sorry, I'm telling you, the oft reported negative spin of the

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.240
 night witches, but you don't get very often.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.280
 But you know in that thing where these three women crash landed basically.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280
 Right.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280
 So they were all lost.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.360
 She was lost for 10 days, the other two were lost for a couple of days.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.240
 I think she had a bar and a half of chocolate to survive on for 10 days, which I really want

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.000
 to know why I'm in the other half.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.640
 Well, if you also, if you've ever had to sell be a chocolate, it is utterly disgusting.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.640
 Wow.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.640
 Maybe it was better in the 1940s.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.640
 I suspect not.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.520
 All I'm saying is you don't scoff it in the first moment, like if it was a Mars bar, you'd

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520
 be like, oh, delicious.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.520
 Yeah.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.520
 No, you wouldn't.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.520
 I see.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.520
 Maybe that's part of the ploy.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.520
 You can survive longer.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.520
 The opposite of savoring it.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.520
 Yeah.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:12.360
 But there was a rescue mission sent out to save these three women and 16 men died.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.360
 Yeah.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.320
 But there were huge celebrations afterwards because they'd broken this record.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.720
 And I think Stalin thought, you know what, it's going to dampen the vibe if we mention

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.040
 the fact that 16 men have been killed.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.240
 Can I just also say it wasn't like one man would go and look for them.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.240
 He would die.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.760
 And then another person would go out.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.040
 They all died in the plane crash.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.040
 Yeah.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.040
 It wasn't like a scream.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.960
 Shall I go and see what he's doing back there?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.960
 Someone's knocking them all off.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.440
 I'm not going to go and have a look.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440
 You're next.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440
 Well, yeah.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.800
 And then Raskova, she got the first ever state funeral, I think, in any country in World

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800
 War II.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 Definitely the first one in Moscow.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.680
 There'd been none in Britain, none in Germany, none in America, obviously at that stage.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.800
 Well, yeah, when she died, her ashes were placed in the Kremlin walls and they're still there

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800
 today.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.800
 Wow.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800
 Cool.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.680
 It's mad thinking about these incredibly old slow planes that were being flown into combat

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.600
 because they had to go at night because, not because they were loud, because they were

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600
 slow.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600
 That's it.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.400
 But the advantage was, I think, if the Luftwaffe were chasing them or trying to shoot them down,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.880
 if the Luftwaffe flew at 90 miles an hour, they would stall.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.480
 Because their planes were too good to catch.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.480
 So in a sense, they had an unfair advantage to the night, which is all I'm saying.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.000
 And they did it at night because that was the time to do the bombing.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.560
 So there was no rest for the Germans because during the night, they would fix their stuff

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.080
 and they'd be being bombed so they couldn't.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.080
 So it was relentless.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.080
 Yeah.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.360
 They weren't the only female pilots in the war, though, because I think in Britain there

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.280
 was the ATA, the Air Transport Auxiliary, and that was mostly male pilots, but there

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.440
 was a sizable chunk of them who were women.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.720
 And their job was to get planes from factories to airfields and things like that.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.720
 Right.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.720
 By flying them.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.720
 By flying them, exactly.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.240
 And it would test them at the same time, I guess.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.440
 Well, they had to know so many different kinds of planes, basically.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.760
 I think these women were amazing.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.560
 So for example, Dolores Mogridge, an incredible name of the kind I think you don't really

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.600
 get anymore, she flew 83 different types of plane during the war.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.720
 And she was once the subject of a complaint by a male RAF officer.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.920
 He complained, "It was dreadful weather and I can't believe not only was a woman flying

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.320
 me here, but she was reading a book."

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.320
 Wow.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.600
 And when he wasn't reading a novel, those are my notes, "I hadn't flown this type

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600
 of plane before."

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.920
 And he nearly threw up when he read it.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920
 Amazing.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.920
 Just lovely.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.280
 The other thing they had to do was, as well as flying planes too, at the airfield from

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.120
 which they'd fly into combat, they had to fly the planes back when they were damaged.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.120
 So they'd have an attack plane, no undercarriage, wing missing, and then the men would be like,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120
 "Fly there, Peck!

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120
 Will you love?"

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120
 Yes.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120
 It's got no wings.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.120
 You'll be right.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120
 You'll figure it out.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.120
 That's amazing.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.480
 Yeah, that's so cool.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.480
 The last of them only died in 2022.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.480
 It's crazy.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.480
 I mean, a lot of them lived really long lives.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.240
 Yeah, Stella Edwards, I think, was the last surviving ATA girl, as they got called.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:01.160
 Well, you know, the night witches are all still alive, even the one who had the state

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160
 funeral.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.160
 Yeah, I think so.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.880
 She was the first to come back to life.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.520
 Do you know the country which has the highest proportion of female pilots?

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.520
 Russia.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.520
 No.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.520
 Oh, I'm not talking about the...

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.520
 No, sorry.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.640
 These days, commercial pilots.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.440
 I don't think it's very guessable.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.440
 Oh, okay.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440
 I'm going to have a go.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.440
 Rwanda.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440
 It's not Rwanda.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.440
 Ireland.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440
 It's not Ireland.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.440
 That's close, though.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.440
 Oh.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.440
 Northern Ireland.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.440
 No, India.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.440
 Oh.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.440
 Sorry.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.440
 When I say close, I mean close alphabetically.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.440
 That's very close alphabetically, isn't it?

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.440
 Yeah.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440
 That's almost bulls-eye-eye.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440
 Well done.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440
 Thank you.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.440
 My bad for not thinking alphabetically, too.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.440
 Silly me.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.760
 I remember when we flew to Australia, and we'd only be going for an hour or so, and

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.760
 I said, "Are we close?"

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.760
 And you said, "Yeah, we're over Austria."

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.560
 We got railier to go.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.560
 India.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.640
 That's amazing.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.200
 13% of pilots are women, isn't it?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.200
 That's interesting.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.560
 Global average is about 5%.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.200
 You know Douglas Bader, Bader?

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 No legs.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600
 Pilot.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.600
 But dreamy guy.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600
 Dreamy trying ace.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600
 Oh, yes.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.080
 He's famous, because he had no legs.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:15.840
 So there was a guy called Alexi Mariseev, who was a Russian guy, and he was in a crash.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.560
 And like this woman, Raskova, he had to walk around Siberia, living on a handful of ants

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.320
 and half a lizard, he said.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.680
 It's still better than this Soviet chocolate bar.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.720
 Yeah, when they found him, he had 10 chocolate bars in his pocket.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.600
 He was desperately hunting for another ant.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.600
 But he had really bad frostbitten legs, and he had to have them chopped off.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.920
 He then went on and carried on fighting in dog fights and became a national hero.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.680
 So Russia had its own Douglas Bader.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.000
 And Germany, Hans Ulrich Rudl, he was a German pilot.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.800
 He was one of the most decorated pilots of the war.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.160
 And he got shot, wounded in one of his legs, had to lose his leg, and then carried on and

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.920
 shot down 26 more fights with only one leg.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.920
 So they had one.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920
 One.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.520
 To be fair, he got one leg, but that would be on the throttle.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.840
 So, you know, he's got the advantage, he was faster to keep away.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.560
 He couldn't slam the brakes on.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.560
 No brakes.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.080
 Did they have to modify the planes or anything?

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.320
 Because I think Douglas Bader's plane was somehow rigged up so he could keep flying

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.320
 with no legs.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.320
 I think that's true.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.160
 But do you think it's interesting that all three of those countries had their own legless

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160
 feelings?

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160
 That's really interesting.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160
 That's kind of amazing.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.160
 We can move on.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160
 Yeah.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.640
 You were in the Kiwi Army, weren't you?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.640
 Yes, that's right.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.640
 You were in the Kiwi Army, weren't you, flying?

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.640
 No, that would be the air force.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640
 Got it.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.160
 Guys, I'm a thicker snake.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.760
 Which one do you fancy today, the boats, to play on the on foot?

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.320
 Just get in the garage and have fun, guys.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.840
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.080
 That is my fact.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.600
 My fact this week is that if you drop a wallet containing cash in Tokyo, you're three times

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.080
 more likely to get it back than if you drop it in New York.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.000
 I was furious when I first read about this in a BBC article which reported that 88% of

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.960
 phones that were lost deliberately by a researcher during the study in Tokyo were returned, but

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.120
 only 6% of those lost in New York were returned.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.000
 Actually, it turned out that wasn't true.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.640
 I looked at the study and 95% were returned in Tokyo, but 88% were returned to the police

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.840
 and only 7% were returned to the person whose phone number was on the phone.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.720
 So he deliberately left contact details like, you know, call me if you find my stuff.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.620
 And the Japanese are like, no, I'm not going to ring you.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.620
 Official channels only, right?

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.620
 Official channels only.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.800
 Whereas in New York, like 75% or something gave them back, but they just called the person.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.280
 Who writes their phone number on their phone?

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.280
 It's quite weird, isn't it?

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.280
 I'm thinking about doing that now.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.280
 Yeah.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.280
 It's quite a genius idea.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280
 I don't know if it is.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280
 That genius.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280
 But how would you, when you pick it up, you go, how am I going to call it?

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280
 Yeah.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.280
 Yeah.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.240
 You can write your best friend's phone number on it, maybe, or your mum's number, your house

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240
 phone.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.360
 But basically Japanese culture is such that they're so set up for lost property.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.880
 Japan is basically a large lost property office masquerading as a country.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.120
 As in, people in Japan are so culturally wired into handing lost things, it's just absolutely

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120
 the rules.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120
 It's just what you do.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.560
 So last year, people in Japan handed in four and a half billion yen in cash.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.280
 It's still a very cash-based society.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.440
 Yeah, but we don't know whether that was just a lot of 100 yen kind.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.840
 So whether it was just one, it was a huge suitcase.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.280
 Well, they have a thing where you can hand in a coin, and if you had it into the authorities,

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.240
 they would then give you that coin back as a gift.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.400
 It's an honor thing.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.040
 So yeah, it's about kind of, rather than the older, if you see a penny, pick it up, and

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.600
 all day long, you'll have good luck.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600
 That classic one.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.600
 They don't have that.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.000
 If they find something, I'm speaking for all Japanese people right now, I have been there,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.960
 and I remember having a conversation with one chap about it, and he said, "Make sure

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.360
 you talk about this on a podcast down the line."

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.600
 "Oh, I will, I will."

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.240
 But anyway, long story short, they give it back to you, and it's a gift, and so therefore

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.400
 you have received the coin that you've found as a gift, and then, honorably, you can then

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.400
 hold on to it.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400
 Brilliant.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400
 That's really cool.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400
 Worthy extra love.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.400
 I have actually done this in London.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.880
 I found a wallet with some money in it, handed it into the police.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.960
 You did skim a bit off the top, though, didn't you?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960
 Hey, hey.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.200
 Well, this was the thing about...

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.320
 I think it had cash in, and I didn't...

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.120
 I think it then got claimed, because I was at the police station every day for the next

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.120
 six months.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.360
 Anyone turn up to claim that cash yet?

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.840
 But I think in the UK, genuinely, in the UK, if it's been three months or some period

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.080
 of time, and the money is not claimed, you can go and, as the finder, claim it.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.280
 I didn't mean to say, "Yeah, did you take the money out?"

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.840
 Because in New York, one of the interesting things about, well, yeah, whatever, you would

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.840
 say that, wouldn't you?

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.640
 It wasn't that one day that you bought a round in when we went to the pub, was it?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.160
 I remember that so clearly that day.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.680
 You were waving a 20-quid note.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.680
 It was 2014, wasn't it?

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680
 Yeah, it was a great day.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.680
 Very proud.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.680
 It wasn't me.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.280
 Just to save it for Randy, he's too proud of himself for handing this in.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.520
 Most people in pretty much any country will hand it in.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.240
 This is the thing that you don't get reported on much.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.940
 Even in New York, 80% of people are handing in wallets, but of the wallets in New York,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.840
 the researcher dropped them with $20 in each, which is the amount you legally have to return

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.200
 if you find it in New York.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.280
 And eight of the wallets were returned, but only six still have the money in.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.080
 So I'm counting that in my percentages as...

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.440
 How high were the drops, too?

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.440
 Were they...

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.440
 The skyscrapers.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.440
 Were they?

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440
 People died, actually.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440
 People died.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440
 Disconcussion.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440
 The wallet dropped!

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440
 No!

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.000
 Returning the wallet is just embedded in the head of someone who was standing under the

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.400
 Empire State Building, yeah, yeah.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400
 That's really interesting.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.140
 Do you think the person who takes the money is in their head, they think, you'd find

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.140
 us fee?

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.140
 Maybe.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.140
 Maybe.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.620
 Or was it a different person who took the money and then a new person found the empty

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.620
 wallet?

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.620
 If I was going to take the money, I might just take the money because it's not as identifiable.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.100
 But you don't want to take someone's driving license, that's a huge faff for them, you

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.100
 know.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.100
 Yeah.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.900
 So in Tokyo, they have these things called Corbans and they're tiny police stations and

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.500
 a city like Tokyo will have dozens of them, but in the countryside, there'll be just one

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.100
 or two in each village.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.720
 And the idea is, you hand your stuff in there and it's kept there for about a month and

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.200
 that's in case someone sort of retraces their steps and goes back to the area where they

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.960
 were, they find the nearest Corban and they say, "It's my 50p there."

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960
 Or whatever.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960
 So good.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.440
 And then after a certain amount of time, they're given to the big sort of lost and found in

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.120
 the middle of Tokyo or wherever.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.120
 Yeah.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.120
 Okay.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.120
 Here's the thing that's lost in Japan.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.120
 This is nuts.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.960
 A big chunk of Japan has been lost.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.960
 Okay.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:48.500
 So in Japan, a big chunk has no easily contactable owner and the property law is crazy there

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.320
 as in it's very difficult, like property is distributed among heirs, sometimes if there's

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.560
 no will, so it's kind of divvied up equally.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.600
 There was a case where the government, they wanted to build a road, like really big road

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.840
 going into/out of Tokyo.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.420
 So important project for them.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.360
 They had to track down 148 heirs of one patch of land.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.360
 They sent 200 letters out, a lot of people had emigrated, some of them had died, like

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.120
 just nightmare situation.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.080
 The unowned bit of Japan is bigger than which country, I'd like you all to guess.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.080
 Is it close to Japan?

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080
 No.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.080
 Oh.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080
 Not alphabetically.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080
 I'm going to...

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.080
 Not Jamaica then.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.080
 Okay.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.280
 I'm going to go with Russia.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.280
 Yeah.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.280
 That's okay.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.360
 20% of Japan, I'm going to say Wales.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.360
 Not far off.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.360
 Belgium.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360
 Far off.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360
 Denmark, very close to Belgium.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.360
 Okay.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.480
 The unowned bit of Japan or the bit where they just have no idea who owns it and it's

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.480
 a nightmare legally is bigger than Denmark.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.480
 Wow.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480
 Crazy.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480
 It's just demographics.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480
 You don't have to register when you own land.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480
 It's not compulsory.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.040
 You know this big building in Tokyo where all the lost and found stuff goes?

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.200
 The huge lost property office.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.200
 Yeah.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:21:01.720
 In 2016, they processed 3.67 billion yen of cash and 74% of it was retrieved.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.800
 But then compared to that, the percentage of umbrellas that were returned was 90 times

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.800
 less.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.800
 Yeah.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.600
 This is the thing umbrellas never give them back because you wouldn't, would you?

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.400
 You wouldn't go and get claim your umbrella.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400
 You'd drop it on the tube.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400
 No.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400
 Because they're really the sort of a few quid to buy.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400
 You just buy not one.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400
 Yeah.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400
 And they all look the same.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400
 Apparently they've got like a see-through...

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.400
 Oh yeah.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.400
 They have that self...

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.400
 Yeah.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400
 Yeah.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400
 Yeah.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400
 And so and really it's an open game for umbrellas.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400
 So if you lose it, you can...

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.600
 And you find one, you don't have to hand that and you're not going to get a special gift

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.600
 or anything like that.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.600
 Is that right?

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600
 It's like The Purge, that film.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.600
 Yeah.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.600
 It's very similar to The Purge.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.600
 Yeah.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600
 Yeah.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 Well, umbrella crime is legal.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.600
 Wow.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:44.100
 And I don't know if they have the opening up of the umbrella inside being bad luck as

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.100
 well.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.100
 I'm not sure where that came from.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.100
 Oh, interesting.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.100
 You guys heard of that one?

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.100
 Yeah.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.100
 Yeah, of course.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.100
 Do you know where that came from?

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.100
 No.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.000
 So we've been told by the big umbrella shop in London that the reason that it's bad luck

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.360
 is it was invented by umbrella salesmen and they didn't want people opening their umbrellas

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.120
 inside so that they would get all rotted and horrible and people would have to buy new

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.120
 umbrellas.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.120
 Oh.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.120
 That's what we were told.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120
 That makes total sense.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.940
 When you buy an umbrella from that shop, it's because it's in the centre, it's only about

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.940
 a 10 minute walk from here.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.940
 Yeah.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.940
 It's amazing as well.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.940
 Like, they're beautiful.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.940
 It's like the oldest umbrella shop in the world.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.940
 They're so, they're so classy.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:18.940
 The umbrella's in there.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.940
 I bought one from there once as a real treat to myself.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.940
 It was just after you found that money in the street, wasn't it?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.740
 And I've lost it now and I'm so gutted because it was this beautiful thing, but they give

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.820
 you a tutorial on how to open and close it.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.820
 Like, they get special.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.820
 Really?

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.380
 It's a bit embarrassing to go through it.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.200
 And does that umbrella shop have lots of little umbrella shops throughout the world?

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.200
 I think it's one of a kind.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.200
 Oh, it's not an umbrella organisation.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.200
 Oh gosh.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.200
 Oh gosh.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.200
 What?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.200
 What?

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200
 What?

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.200
 You had to wonder where he was going with the questions.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.700
 I just love the way you walk straight into that.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:57.120
 Well, these guys are being dex as usual, but I'm glad Rhys is interested in umbrella shop

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120
 logistics.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.760
 Guys, if you found a wallet on the street, then would you be more likely to hand it in

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.960
 if it had money in?

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.240
 If it's got other forms of ID, I hope I would just hand it in anyway.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.240
 Regardless.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.680
 Even if it had a million pounds in it.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.680
 How big is this wallet?

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.680
 What is it?

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.680
 What is it?

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.840
 What denomination and currency are we talking about?

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.840
 Is it in crypto?

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.840
 What are you talking about?

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.440
 No, I think I would hand it in no matter what, actually.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440
 Yeah.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440
 I'm sure we're all honest people.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.640
 Rhys, you haven't piped up, but we're just going to assume.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.120
 Well, it depends on your circumstances, isn't it?

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.240
 We're all sitting here in a nice building where we've got money, but I think if you

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.080
 have anything, I think, you know, got to pick up a door too.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.080
 Very good point.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.880
 You've shamed us all into having a bit of perspective, but the truth is that if you

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.520
 drop a wallet with money in it, that's better than dropping one without because you're more

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.120
 likely to get it back.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:57.880
 And this really surprised people. This is a study in 2019 which planted 17,303 wallets

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880
 around the world.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.880
 Wow.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.880
 It's got a big study.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.880
 Did they need to do it?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.880
 Did they need to do the last three?

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880
 No.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880
 We're doing 17,300.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.160
 I don't think that's a good sample size.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.400
 Maybe there was three researchers.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.760
 They dropped the 17,000 and they realized it accidentally dropped their own wallets as

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760
 well.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.760
 I think that was it.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.760
 You're not going to believe this.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760
 I lost my own.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.960
 Just grab one from the collection.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.960
 How the hell do they get them?

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.840
 Anyway, they dropped them in 355 cities all over the world.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.960
 So this is completely cross-cultural and half of them had no money in them.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:36.560
 Half of them had $13.45 in them and 40% were returned when they had no cash, but 51% were

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.760
 returned when they had cash.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.760
 Wow.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.560
 And they thought this is about weird, isn't it?

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.080
 So they did a follow-up study where they put another load with $94 in and the ones

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:53.560
 with $94, 72% were returned compared to only $60 for the $13, because I guess the thinking

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.640
 being that someone might really need it.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.800
 It feels a bit more like stealing if you've stole the $90 compared to $13.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.800
 Mo money, mo guilt.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.800
 Exactly.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.800
 Yeah.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.800
 So.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.800
 Can I do one test on you guys?

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800
 Yeah, go on.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.760
 I'm going to give you three words and I want to tell you which two words go together instinctively

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.760
 for you.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.360
 This is related to this fact.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.040
 So the three words are train, bus, track.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040
 Okay.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.400
 Train and track alphabetically.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400
 Very close together.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400
 Sorry.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.080
 Well, these were in the game.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.080
 What's the challenge?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.080
 Train, track and bus.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.080
 Yeah.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.080
 Well, trains go on tracks.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.080
 Do we pick?

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.080
 Do we pick two words?

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.080
 Which two go together for you?

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080
 Train, track, bus?

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.080
 Well, I normally track my wife as she travels around on the bus every day, so I'd say bus

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080
 and track.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.080
 There you go.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.080
 Yeah.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080
 Okay.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.080
 I feel like that's something that's seriously either.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.080
 There is.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.360
 Well, like when I joined the Army with the aptitude tests, just a lucky dip for me.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.360
 Train and bus.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.360
 Thank you for no good reason.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360
 You've given me the answer.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.360
 I wanted.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.360
 Bombs of transport.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.360
 Yeah.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.440
 So this is a difference between Eastern and Western cultures and this is so part of this

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.160
 thing about Japanese people handing stuff in, like very different culturally, collective

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.440
 cultures dominate the East, individualist cultures dominate the West quite broadly.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.440
 And there are these huge differences.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.280
 And then one of them is that given those three words, most Westerners say train and bus because

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.560
 we think of things in categories, but most people from China or Japan or Korea will say

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.240
 train and track because everything is relational.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.800
 So for instance, if you ask someone to describe themselves in the West, they'll say, oh, I'm

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.800
 a QI researcher.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.800
 Tall and handsome.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.800
 Exactly.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.720
 We also lie a lot in our culture, don't we?

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720
 We do.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.280
 Anna, which culture do people say bus and track in, please?

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.280
 I'm here to rule myself out of East and West.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.120
 Have you heard of the Andaman Islands?

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.120
 Oh, come on.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120
 Uncontacted tribes.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120
 They're my people.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.520
 This is a slightly different, forget the buses and the tracks.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.880
 If you're Japanese or Chinese, you would more likely say, I'm so-and-so sister, I'm so-and-so

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.680
 daughter, I'm employed by so-and-so, I'm the friend of so-and-so that it's all about like

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680
 in relations.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.440
 Anyway, we've thought that this is a difference between spiritual cultures and collectivism

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.120
 and things like that.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.040
 And then there was an amazing study done in the border of China and Russia, which looked

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.320
 at rice farming versus grain farming, and it's completely split on those grounds.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:20.760
 And people with these more communal, collective responses to things are rice farmers, whereas

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.720
 grain farmers are more individualist.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.340
 And we think now it's just because rice farming involves way more cooperation.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.340
 That's really interesting.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.480
 I read another study which I think is related to this, which is, if you're in Starbucks,

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.940
 because I think it was done in Starbucks, and you need to get from one place to another,

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.160
 so from your seat to the place where you buy your coffee.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.760
 If there's chairs in the way, Western people will sort of dodge around the chairs and get

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.600
 to the place where they're supposed to go, whereas Eastern people will move the chairs

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.420
 out of the way and put them where they're supposed to be so that the next person can

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.420
 get there as well.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.420
 That's nice.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.420
 Wait, are there people on the chairs?

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.420
 No.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.920
 And Andy, of course, turns all the chairs upside down and pours coffee on them.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.040
 What's your Starbucks coffee name?

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.880
 Oh, I use my actual name.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.880
 Oh, really?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880
 Yeah.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880
 What do you use, Rhys?

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.880
 Chris Nibble.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880
 Do you, actually?

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.880
 Mmm.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.880
 But I always say the nibble.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.880
 Yeah.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880
 Yeah.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.880
 Do you tell them to definitely say the nibble?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880
 Nice.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880
 If you say Chris, you don't respond.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880
 Yeah.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.880
 They need to say Chris Nibble.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.120
 And then one time I got like something that was edible, and I was in the corner and I was

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:31.040
 just having really tiny nibbles on it for about half an hour, and I left most of it behind.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.000
 And I wondered whether they thought, "Oh, yeah, that'll be him."

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Nibble by name.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Nibble by name.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.480
 They'll be thinking, "That's Rhys Stalpey."

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:47.800
 There's also a test to see whether they know who I am or not, you know?

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:54.160
 And then as I leave, I knew you didn't know who I am, as if I was Chris Nibble, and you

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.560
 couldn't keep the rest of this panini.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:07.680
 Okay, time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.040
 My fact is that when trains were new in New Zealand, an elderly lady flagged one down

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.360
 by standing on the tracks to see if anyone could give her change for a £1 note.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360
 Oh.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.360
 Wow.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.360
 That's...

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360
 Nice.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.360
 This is a story of something that really happened.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.360
 Wow.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.200
 It's related in a book called Our Iron Roads by F.S. Williams, and I'm doing a little bit

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.120
 of prop comedy here because I brought in a copy.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.120
 Oh, look at that.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120
 It is stunning.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.120
 This was printed in 1883.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.320
 Sorry, you said prop comedy?

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.320
 Hmm.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.640
 It's a very bland, hard-backed book.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.640
 It's...

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.880
 Wait for the comedy.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.200
 I'm happy that New Zealand is mentioned in one of these old books.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.880
 Yeah, because trains were not very late in New Zealand, not much after the rest of the

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.280
 world, but it's quite a hard country to navigate around, isn't it, by train, just because

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.360
 there's a lot of valleys and canyons and things.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.360
 Yes.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.360
 Yeah, I imagine.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.680
 But there's this anecdote, it's paid £402 if you're reading along at home.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.920
 The eccentricities of English travellers, however, if dangerous are not so odd as some

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.680
 in foreign parts, that's in quotes, it is said, so big tongs there, that not long ago

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.520
 an engine driver in New Zealand noticed a lady energetically waving her hand at a siding

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.080
 where he was not time to stop.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.400
 On pulling up his train, she was asked if she wished to come on board, also in quotes,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.640
 when she stated that her object in stopping the train was to ascertain whether any passenger

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.800
 could give her change for a £1 note.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.800
 There you go.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.800
 Wow.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.800
 So she wanted change.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.760
 She just flagged it down, like presumably there was a coin operator machine that she

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.720
 was sending the next day and like...

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.320
 Did they give the year there?

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.400
 It's no, not long ago, and this was printed in 1883, so...

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.400
 Okay.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.880
 Well, I think the first trains were what, in the 1870s, so...

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.040
 Oh no, 1830, well, in the UK, 1830s.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040
 And sorry, in New Zealand.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040
 How were they?

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.040
 Oh, that's quite late.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.040
 I think they were in the late '70s, 1870s.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.040
 That's really late.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.040
 I think so.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.720
 And the first ones were in various different cities, and it was usually to get from the

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.360
 ports to the city.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.520
 So in Vicargo, there was loads of swamps.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.560
 You had to get past, so they put a railway line there.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.160
 In Dunedin, you had to go over some difficult land to get there.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.840
 In Christchurch, you had to go over some hills, and so they all put these different railways

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.000
 in, but they all used different gauges.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Oh God.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.720
 And so when they decided to put the whole country together, so the gauge is the width

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.720
 of the railway line.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720
 Right.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.240
 And when they decided to put the whole country together, they were like, OK, this is going

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.400
 to be a problem.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.120
 And in the end, they went for this thing, which is three foot six inch gauge, which was kind

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.120
 of the smallest.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.120
 That's narrow gauge.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.120
 It's really narrow.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.640
 And the reason was because it was kind of cheaper.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.640
 But apparently...

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.640
 Typical Kiwis.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.640
 That's such a false economy.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.640
 Go with the cheap gauge.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.640
 Go with the cheap one!

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.320
 But apparently, if you ride on modern railways even, it's like riding the Piccadilly line

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.640
 in London, which is very sort of jerky and...

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.640
 Rickety.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.640
 Rickety.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.640
 Oh, really?

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.640
 Because of that gauge?

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.640
 Yeah.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.600
 The gauge system that I've always been entertained by, the most, is the oddest.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.600
 And everyone's got one.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.600
 Oh, God.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.440
 Save it for your spinoff podcast, Anna.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.200
 My favourite gauge, that's a good seed.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.160
 We ask a global megastar what their favourite gauge is.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.760
 This week, Tom Cruise.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760
 Next week, Chris Dibble.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.920
 Guys, it's going to run and run, I'm telling you.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.600
 You can keep the rest of that panini!

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.320
 My favourite gauge is the Australian gauge system, which I'm sure you're very familiar

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.640
 with, which is mad.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.680
 So they basically did what New Zealand did, but then they never put their country together

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.640
 properly train-wise.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.160
 So it's also a joke involving an Irishman, a Scotsman and an Englishman.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.160
 Perfect.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.320
 Because basically, we're in the 1850s, there was an Irish guy, Francis Shields, who's in

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.440
 charge of a rail company in New South Wales.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.280
 He likes a broad gauge, the Irish gauge.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:46.080
 Then, Scottish James Wallace came along, took over shortly afterwards, converted New South

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.120
 Wales and some of South Australia to a standard gauge.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.440
 And then an English bloke came along, rocked up in Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.880
 and made them all do the cheap, cheap-ass narrow gauge.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.480
 And then some other bloke said, "Let's do a completely different gauge to transport

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.480
 sugarcane."

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.000
 The four different gauges never fixed.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.140
 Still to this day, if you go on forums about it, the kind of forums that I like to go on

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.800
 sometime late at night, there are quite a lot of Australians going, "What's wrong with

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.800
 our rail system?"

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.800
 Are there bits where everyone has to get off and get on a train with a different gauge?

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800
 Yes.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.000
 You'll have to transport your freight across the country and you'll have to transfer your

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.840
 goods to new trains four different times.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840
 Oh, God!

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.200
 It really explains where that saying comes from with New Zealand and Australia, and that's

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.880
 the saying, "It's difficult to gauge."

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.880
 That's what it is.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.360
 It comes from where I live.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.360
 Isn't that satisfying?

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360
 Now you know that.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360
 Yeah.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.360
 Yeah.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:40.600
 Are you auditioning for a part in a children's transport show or something?

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.600
 Always.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.000
 Rhys, have you ever been on the New Zealand love trade?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 The love trade?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Yeah.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Not since the '80s.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Okay.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.400
 Well, it's been going, I think, since then.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.920
 This is, have you heard of a town on the South Island called Middlemarch?

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920
 It's small.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.080
 Very vaguely.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.520
 Population 186 is small, right?

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.760
 But every two years, the population absolutely blooms for one night, which is when they have

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:10.320
 the Middlemarch Ball and it's a singles ball, because often, you know, if you're on the

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.000
 apps and the nearest match is 100 miles away, this is a problem.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.880
 So every two years, they have a night where everyone gets the train down to Middlemarch

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:22.780
 and there is a special love train put on full of, you know, excited young people wanting

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.760
 to find love or certainly get off with someone that night, basically.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.960
 And it's really, it sounds lovely, actually.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.320
 And then the day after the ball, there's a shame train to take people home who didn't

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.680
 get the train home the night before.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.560
 I want to see this movie.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560
 Yeah.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.560
 It sounds charming.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.840
 Can I just written The Guardian did a lovely report about it.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.960
 So this is the actual ball itself.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:47.000
 On the dance floor, heels are cast aside as the heady crowd grind against one another.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.280
 Sliced hot meats and buttered bread are served in the makeshift kitchen and two worn sofas

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.320
 placed beside the bain-marie grown under the weight of courting lovers.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.320
 Oh my goodness.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.880
 It's so disgusting as well as being innocent.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.720
 It's really charming, I think.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.720
 It is.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.040
 Although I think we all thought when you said sliced hot meats and buttered bread, that

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.040
 was there.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.040
 You've missed us for the men of the world.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.040
 We were thinking of sexual things there, but I thought it was just me.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.160
 How could you know it wasn't?

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160
 That's amazing.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.200
 Please write in to tell us if you've ever met the love of your life or if you've had

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.480
 an embarrassing failure to meet the love of your life, buddy yet.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.760
 So the main railway in New Zealand was built thanks to Julius Vogel, who's prime minister.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.760
 Oh, yes.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.760
 I know the bread.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.760
 It's delicious.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.760
 Vogel's bread.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.760
 I've never heard of that.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.760
 Oh my goodness.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.760
 It's the best bread.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.760
 And they don't do it anymore in Waitrose.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.600
 I'll talk after the podcast, but it's going off the market here.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600
 You can still get it in New Zealand.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.600
 I'm going to move back here too.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.280
 Is it named after this Kiwi Prime Minister?

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.280
 Must be.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.280
 One can only assume.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.320
 Well, he also, as well as his bread reputation, he has a reputation as being the first New

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.680
 Zealand to write a science fiction novel.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.680
 Hey.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.760
 Yeah, it was called Anno Domini 2000 or Woman's Destiny, and it was published in 1889, and

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.520
 it anticipated a utopian world where women held many positions of authority.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.320
 Well, that is New Zealand.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.400
 Yeah, because he also introduced the first women's suffrage bill to the New Zealand

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.400
 parliament.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.800
 I was going to say they were the first country in the world, weren't they?

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.120
 Now, he introduced a bill, and the bill didn't pass, and then he left parliament, and then

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.840
 it passed a few years later.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.240
 So he kind of started the ball roll.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.240
 That is cool.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:27.440
 And had he written the sci-fi as a means of political change, saying this would be a good

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.520
 society to build?

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.280
 He introduced the bill in 1887.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:38.440
 The science fiction novel was published in 1889, and suffrage was granted in 1893.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.440
 So it was all happening around the system.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.840
 So it's like he tried the political method, and if that had failed, so he thought, "Right,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.040
 what other tool do I have?

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.040
 Sci-fi."

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.440
 Sounds like he introduced the bill as a publicity stunt to sell more books than he knew he was

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440
 going to write.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.440
 It's very clever.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.280
 And that's the story of the first-ever women's suffrage.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.760
 Some bloke trying to flog some books.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.640
 That is really cool.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:02.240
 The reason trains were needed in New Zealand was transport logs around, and it was mostly

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.240
 these cow-ree trees, which are...

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.240
 How do you say it?

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.240
 Cow-ree?

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.240
 Cow-ree.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.240
 Yeah, cow-ree.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.240
 Cow-ree.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.240
 Yeah.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.240
 It's hard to roll my arse, but if you can, you can.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.240
 Yeah.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.240
 I have difficulty with it.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.240
 Well, it was for cow-ree.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.240
 I felt like I was back in people's march for a second.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.240
 All the more!

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.240
 Looks like sliced meat.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:34.240
 Logging industry was huge.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.240
 The cow-ree trees used to cover basically all of New Zealand, now they cover almost none

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.240
 because they chop them all down.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.240
 Very sad.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.240
 But they did this amazing thing, their way of transporting them before they got all the

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.240
 trains up and running, were these things called cow-ree dams.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.240
 So normally, you dump logs in a river and they could float downstream.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.240
 They can't when they're these tiny little weak streams.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.240
 And so...

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.240
 We've got a lot of weak streams in New Zealand.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.240
 It's a shame.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.240
 Okay.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240
 Yeah.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:07.240
 They would build dams and they'd leave the dams for a year or more, a year, two years,

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.240
 and they'd just pile logs up behind the dam.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:14.240
 And then one day, they'd come back and they could have up to 30,000 logs behind this dam

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:20.240
 and they'd whip up this drawbridge and suddenly 30,000 logs will descend from the mountains

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.240
 in this giant waterfall.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.240
 Get out.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240
 To the beach.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240
 Isn't that amazing?

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.240
 The beaches just transform.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.240
 Suddenly, you've gone for a day out on the beach.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.240
 Oh, my God.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.240
 You're frantically flogging the donkey or riding faster.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.240
 He's very old.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.240
 He goes slowly.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.240
 Look at the ice cream.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.240
 The Punch and Judy man is frantically rolling the canvas tight.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.240
 That is amazing.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.240
 Wow.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.240
 It's really cool.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.240
 That is stunning.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240
 Yeah.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.240
 Your fact, Andy, was about someone getting changed for a one-pound note.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.240
 Yes.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.240
 And they didn't know where their currency is, the dollar.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.240
 Right.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.240
 Not in those days.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240
 Well, yes, exactly.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.240
 So it's interesting that they did have the pound.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240
 Yeah.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.240
 Until the dollar came in relatively recently, I think.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.240
 That was one of the moments, I think, when they were right,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.240
 "Well, we're going to have our own currency."

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.240
 We'll still have the Queen on it.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.240
 Which, you know.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.240
 So when they decided to go for the dollar,

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.240
 it wasn't obvious that they would call it a New Zealand dollar.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.240
 They could call anything because they're getting their own currency, right?

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.240
 They didn't want to be a pound anymore.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.240
 And so they sent it to the public, basically,

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.240
 and had a public discussion of what should we call our coin.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.240
 A lot of people thought they'd call it the Kiwi.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.240
 Oh, brilliant.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.240
 The Zeal, as in New Zealand.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.240
 Nice.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.240
 I like the Zeal.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.240
 The NZ, E-M-Z-E-D.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.240
 They almost called it the NZ.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240
 Oh, I like that as well.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.240
 The Moa, the Zac, the Tui.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.240
 Those were all ideas to call it.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.240
 And then because I think Australia had just gone to the dollar

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.240
 relatively recently, they decided, "Oh, yeah, we should probably do the same."

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.240
 You could have had the Tui.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.240
 Tui?

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.240
 Tui, T-U-I.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.240
 Is that a bird as well?

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.240
 It's a bird, yeah.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.240
 Didn't you do this with your flag as well a few years ago?

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240
 You had a flag referendum.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240
 Yes, we did.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.240
 So we tend to do these things,

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.240
 and it costs a lot of money,

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.240
 and then everyone goes, "Oh, no, I'll just keep with what we're talking."

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240
 I think that's good.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.240
 I think it's good to experiment sometimes.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.240
 I think we could do with more of that here.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.240
 Although where's New Zealand's something,

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.240
 something that's something of a spirit when it's naming stuff by public vote.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.240
 You seem to be lacking that.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.240
 Yeah.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.240
 Let's call something a really stupid name for the hell of it.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.240
 Yeah, I think you're right.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.240
 You actually get a lot of shit, I think, for your Air Force logo as well.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.240
 In fact, to go back to Air Force is...

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.240
 Oh, you were in the Air Force, weren't you, Ruth?

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.240
 Well, for a little bit.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.240
 Yes.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.240
 Shall I put the different outfit on?

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.240
 You know what your Air Force logo is?

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240
 Yes, the Kiwi.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.240
 This is the Kiwi, and everyone finds it very funny.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.240
 It's a flightless bird.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.240
 But they worked hard over that,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.240
 and they actually abandoned...

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.240
 It was a fern leaf before that, I think,

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.240
 in the '50s and '60s,

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.240
 which people then pointed out was just a white fern leaf

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.240
 that looks like a white feather,

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.240
 which is basically a symbol for surrendering.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.240
 Which is quite a funny idea, with your warplanes.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.240
 We just can't get it right.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.240
 Can I tell you a really quick thing about rail,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.240
 and railways?

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.240
 When did the last horse work on British rail?

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.240
 Wait, so how did they work?

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.240
 They'd just been moving trains from one line to another.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.240
 They're shunting, basically, shunting jobs.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.240
 They were agile, they're cheap, obviously.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240
 They're good for these small jobs,

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.240
 not for massive, great locomotives.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240
 So they'd walk along the tracks?

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.240
 Pretty much, yeah, yeah.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.240
 And there were shunting horses,

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.240
 and that's what they were doing.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.240
 OK, I'm going to say there is currently a horse working in,

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.240
 and it sort of nibbles the plants at the edge of the track.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.240
 I wish that would be so good.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.240
 No, they're not still in action.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.240
 OK, 1750.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.240
 Thank you.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.240
 1967.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.240
 So Charlie, the last British rail shunting horse,

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.240
 could have heard Sergeant Pepper while in work.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.240
 What's a weird connection there,

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.240
 is that Ringo Starr, of course,

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.240
 is the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine,

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.240
 and what's Thomas the Tank Engine's job?

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.240
 A shunting engine.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.240
 Thomas put the horses out of business.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.240
 Lovely, that's superb connection.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.240
 There was debate in the early days

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.240
 about whether horses or trains would be better.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.240
 Do you remember the Rainhill Trials,

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.240
 with this huge competition at Rainhill, where...

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.240
 Stevenson's Rocket won.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.240
 Stevenson's Rocket won,

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240
 but there were about five contenders.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.240
 There was Stevenson's Rocket,

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.240
 there were a few other actual trains,

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.240
 and then there was Cycloped,

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.240
 owned by a guy called Thomas Brandrith,

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.240
 which was a horse walking on a treadmill

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.240
 on top of a train,

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.240
 and it was withdrawn.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.240
 The horse got the thing to five miles an hour,

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.240
 and then the horse fell through the belt,

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.240
 and it just did not, it just didn't work.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240
 But it could have gone another way.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240
 Okay, sliced meat.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.240
 Oh, God!

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:48.240
 Okay, it is time for our final fact,

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.240
 and that is James.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.240
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1936,

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.240
 a robot in California shot its inventor in the head.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.240
 So what would that have sounded like?

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.240
 Oh, no!

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.240
 Very good California accent, though.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.240
 That's the robot, that's the robot,

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.240
 repenting what it's done.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.240
 So I was looking for something else

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.240
 in the newspaper archives,

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.240
 and I just saw this as a tiny little article

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.240
 in the Buffalo News of the 15th of February, 1936.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.240
 Amazing.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.240
 And I had no idea what it was about,

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.240
 but then I've since done some more research,

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.240
 and it was something called the Mechanical Man,

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.240
 and it was a San Diego fair in 1936,

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.240
 which was a big exposition,

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.240
 and there was a guy called Henry C. May,

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.240
 who was a British inventor,

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.240
 and he toured it around America,

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.240
 and it was a six-foot giant steel robot

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.240
 that could stand up, sit down, smoke cigarettes,

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.240
 fire a gun, and answer questions.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.240
 And I'll be honest, I've seen some pictures,

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.240
 and I think it was a man in tin foil.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.240
 Really, really?

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.240
 Was it really?

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240
 I think, I can't really tell,

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.240
 but it looks like a Doctor Who buddy.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.240
 Right, okay.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.240
 But I've seen this in a television show.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.240
 I think it might be Penny Dreadful,

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.240
 or one of those type of shows,

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.240
 so there was a link to it,

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.240
 and yeah, there really was this mechanical man

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.240
 made many, many years ago.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.240
 It's incredible.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.240
 But I think there was a lot of cheating, wasn't there?

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.240
 Well, maybe they weren't suggesting

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.240
 that it was operated properly, robotically,

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.240
 but it seemed like a lot of them were people,

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.240
 which does suggest it was just a guy

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.240
 with a vendetta against the maker inside.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.240
 Apparently, 'cause he could answer questions.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.240
 Someone asked the robot if he loved his wife,

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.240
 and he replied, "I have a heart of steel.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.240
 "I don't love nobody, and nobody loves me."

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240
 That's a guy in a suit.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.240
 That's a single guy in a suit.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.240
 When did the Wizard of Oz come out?

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.240
 Oh, '30s.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.240
 '39, wasn't it?

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.240
 Yeah, okay.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.240
 That's a good point.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.240
 It could be the Tin Man, you know?

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.240
 The world's first robot.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.240
 I love nobody, and nobody loves me.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.240
 He's looking for a heart.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:00.240
 He's looking for a heart.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.240
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.240
 It's all coming together.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.240
 It's all coming together.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.240
 It's actually a documentary, it turns out.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.240
 Can I check, James?

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.240
 Did the inventor who was shot the head,

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.240
 was he all right?

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.240
 He was fine, yeah.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.240
 So, there was an article in The New York Times.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.240
 Again, a very small article.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.240
 It said, "The robot showed more aptitude

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.240
 "than Henry C. May expected,"

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.240
 and he shot him in the head,

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.240
 but then it says, "He will recover."

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.240
 And then there's no more mention of him

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.240
 in any of the newspapers,

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.240
 but I assume he must have recovered,

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:27.240
 otherwise it would have been in there.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.240
 They underplayed news in those days, didn't they?

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.240
 Yeah, but this was a big exposition

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.240
 in San Diego Fair.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.240
 Other things they had there was the Gold Gulch,

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.240
 which was like one of the first frontier villages,

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.240
 like a fake Wild West village.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.240
 Oh, cool.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.240
 They had the Zorro Garden nudist colony,

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.240
 which was basically a load of naked women

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.240
 and a few naked men,

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.240
 which you could pay 25 cents to look at.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.240
 I thought an exposition was for scientific stuff.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.240
 I thought it was like we've got a new kind of toaster,

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.240
 and you're telling me there's just the nudist village,

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.240
 which I could pay a quarter and go and look at.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.240
 The nudist one, honestly, the nudist one was really bad

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.240
 because basically actual local nudists were really upset.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.240
 They were the ones who were the most upset,

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.240
 because they were like, "You've got showgirls in,"

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.240
 instead of getting actual nudists in.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.240
 Right, and that would be paid top dollar too.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.240
 And there was complaints to the council

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.240
 from the San Diego Council of Catholic Women,

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.240
 the Women's Civic Centre,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.240
 and the San Diego Braille Club.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.240
 [laughter]

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.240
 I can't find any reason.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.240
 About the nudism.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.240
 Is that because you weren't allowed to touch them,

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.240
 and so it's sort of discriminating against blind people?

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.240
 I need to know that they're nude.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.240
 I'm coming through now, I'm blind,

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.240
 but let me have a feel.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.240
 Oh, that's not a proper nudist.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.240
 And you can keep the rest of this panini.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.240
 [laughter]

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.240
 It's not a panini!

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.240
 Get your hands off.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240
 [laughter]

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.240
 So anyway, that's the story of the San Diego Fair.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.240
 That was forever in 1936.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.240
 I think there was a sequel to this,

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.240
 who became this big celebrity robot,

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.240
 because there was a few years later,

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.240
 there was the World's Fair in 1939 in New York,

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.240
 and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation paraded Electro,

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.240
 who again was a talking cigarette smoking robot.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.240
 Cigarette smoking seemed to be the main thing

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.240
 people wanted from their robots in those days.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.240
 The back of the day was the main hobby, wasn't it?

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.240
 It was, yeah.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.240
 And he again seemed to be operated by people behind a curtain.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.240
 But all robots are.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.240
 Oh, even today.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.240
 Even today, when you think of Musk

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.240
 and what he's trying to do and what have you,

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.240
 there's always someone hidden behind the curtain

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.240
 with a radio control device.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.240
 Is that with every self-driving car?

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.240
 Musk has employed a person with a remote control somewhere.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.240
 There's a teenager in the boot.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.240
 [laughter]

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.240
 Yeah, you can have a look.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.240
 Now they get paid a lot of money,

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.240
 and they've got a t-shirt on,

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.240
 and they've got little tiny controls.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.240
 They like being in small dark rooms.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.240
 The celebrity robot, 1939,

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.240
 went on to star in a film called Sex Kittens Go to College,

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.240
 which I just wondered if any of you guys would see.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.240
 Oh, I love that one.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.240
 Mmm, I thought it might be you.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.240
 Because its career sort of ended after 1939,

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.240
 and we did a little bit of a world tour.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.240
 Was there anything going on in 1939

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.240
 which might have made it less important

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.240
 to see a cigarette smoking robot?

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.240
 [laughter]

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.240
 I saw the sequel, Sex Kittens Go to the Frontline.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.240
 [laughter]

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.240
 Demon sex kittens struggle to adjust to post-war life.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.240
 Very sad, very sad one there.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.240
 [laughter]

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.240
 I don't know until you've watched it.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.240
 It sounds really good.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.240
 So this is 1960.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.240
 Suddenly this robot became a celebrity again,

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.240
 starred in a film, Sex Kittens Go to College,

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.240
 where he advises the college to hire this genius

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.240
 as a science professor who turns out to be a stripper.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.240
 And then there's lots of stripping scenes.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.240
 But that's just the great career of the world's

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.240
 first ever celebrity robot.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.240
 Rhys, do you ever drive in autonomous cars?

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.240
 Have you got an autonomous cab anywhere?

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.240
 Things like that.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.240
 I've seen a lot of them.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.240
 I was almost hit by one.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.240
 Really?

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.240
 Yeah, I was pulling out of the car park in my car,

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.240
 and you know, when you go out,

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.240
 you sort of go a little bit too far out into the road,

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.240
 and in this oncoming traffic,

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.240
 you think, "I better pull back in a bit."

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.240
 Well, the oncoming traffic was the Waymo.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.240
 And so I put into reverse and go back a little bit

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.240
 because my nose was sticking out.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.240
 And then, just as I did it,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.240
 the Waymo straight past me,

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.240
 it didn't alter its path at all.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.240
 And I said, "If it was a human,

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.240
 you would have actually altered your path."

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.240
 Yeah, you just nod to bear.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.240
 A bit of shove and a bit of give or whatever.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.240
 But this one, as soon as I reversed back,

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.240
 and I thought to myself,

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.240
 "Well, if I hadn't have pulled my nose in a little bit there,

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.240
 would it have hit me?"

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.240
 That's weird, because that is like a legit way

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.240
 to get out of a junction, isn't it?

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240
 You just edge a little bit,

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.240
 and hopefully someone will notice you,

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.240
 and they'll stop for you.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.240
 Yeah, they'll slow down.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.240
 You peep and creep.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.240
 Yeah.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.240
 That's what I'm doing on the love train.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:46.240
 I'm up in the luggage compartment.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.240
 No, but this is...

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.240
 Because that's one area where there's loads of progress, isn't there?

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240
 Or certainly people have...

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.240
 I mean, I know Elon Musk has been predicting

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.240
 full self-driving for like 15 years.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.240
 He said we'll have it next year.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.240
 Yeah, he's raving on about them.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.240
 They are on the way.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.240
 I just mentioned this,

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.240
 because Kawasaki at the moment,

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.240
 there are lots of...

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.240
 Should robots look like humans?

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.240
 It's a big debate.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.240
 Is a bipedal humanoid figure

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.240
 the most efficient use for a robot?

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.240
 No, normally no, obviously.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.240
 But Kawasaki are working on a robo-horse.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.240
 Oh, I've seen this, too.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.240
 It sounds so good.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.240
 It's a motorbike with legs, basically.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.240
 Yes, it's called Corleone.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.240
 Really?

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.240
 Which I think is weird,

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.240
 because Corleone is the first letter of Corleone,

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.240
 which is the family of the godfather,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.240
 which does feature a horse, right?

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.240
 Head of one.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.240
 Head of one, yeah.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.240
 But they're developing sensors,

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.240
 so hopefully it'll respond to you just like a horse does.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.240
 As in you're moving your body around,

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.240
 you know, you're digging in with your heels,

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.240
 or you're bouncing up and down,

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.240
 or you're literally...

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.240
 Or you're squeezing your thighs.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.240
 I don't write horses, but whatever.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.240
 Clearly.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.240
 That would be pretty cool.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.240
 I think a robotic horse would be awesome.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.240
 Yes, and I've seen videos of these.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.240
 There must be a prototype out there,

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.240
 and terrain-wise,

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.240
 they can do the same things that an animal could.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.240
 Better than wheels,

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.240
 and I think that's where we're getting with.

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.240
 But do they look like they're walking properly?

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.240
 Because we've tried to make humanoid robots

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.240
 look like they walk properly, and they still don't.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240
 They're getting pretty close now.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.240
 I've seen the one that claims to be closest,

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.240
 and I still think it looks...

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:17.240
 It now looks like a very elderly, shuffling person.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.240
 I met the first robot that could run by Peter-1.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.240
 You remember that?

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.240
 It wasn't programmed to run,

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.240
 but it saw you coming, didn't it?

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.240
 I stopped offering it at Russian chocolate.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.240
 What was it called?

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.240
 It was the Honda one.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.240
 Yeah, he was guest on QI.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.240
 He was guest on QI, and I danced with him.

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240
 I remember.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.240
 And he did look like the most human one there, actually.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240
 But yeah, then he ran,

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.240
 and that was at the time,

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.240
 which could only have been 15 years ago,

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:48.240
 12 years ago, that was the biggest thing in robotics,

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.240
 but now it's crazy.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.240
 I don't think that has been left behind that much.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.240
 And again, doing basic tasks,

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.240
 like Google DeepMind did a big brag last year

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.240
 about how it's got a robot to tie a shoelace

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.240
 for the first time ever.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.240
 And it's two massive arms,

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.240
 incredibly ungainly and incredibly slowly,

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.240
 only doing the bow bit.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.240
 Anna, Anna.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.240
 As soon as they can tie our shoelaces together,

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.240
 that's where they could take over the world.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.240
 Exactly.

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.240
 Then they'll be able to make nooses.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.240
 And do you know what they're going to use those for, Anna?

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.240
 Us, right?

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.240
 Rhys, do you think we're all doomed?

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.240
 Yes.

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.240
 When robots are ready to go,

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.240
 and this is what my show is actually about.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.240
 I'm touring here in the UK,

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.240
 and my show is about the demise of humanity

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.240
 because of AI and robotics,

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.240
 and how can we stop it?

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.240
 And why does AI have to be in the creative world?

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.240
 Can we please not have it?

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.240
 Because once it takes all of our creative jobs away from us,

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.240
 what are we doing?

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.240
 And that was written by chatGPT that show, was it?

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:47.240
 No, I've had a couple of goes with chatGPT,

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.240
 and we just don't get on.

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:52.240
 Who doesn't like whom, though?

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.240
 Oh, I don't think it likes me.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.240
 During my favourite AI, if we can call it AI,

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.240
 it was invented by the AI pioneer who sounds awesome,

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.240
 Marvin Minsky, and he was around in the 1950s.

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.240
 He went to MIT, and actually his boss said when he joined MIT,

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.240
 don't work on anything that's going to take less than 30 years.

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.240
 We're playing the long game here,

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.240
 which is a dreamy thing for a boss to say.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.240
 So he had to have something to entertain him,

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.240
 little projects on the side,

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.240
 so he invented this thing called the useless machine,

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.240
 and it was a robot capable of doing one thing,

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.240
 which was that if you turned it on,

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:28.240
 it ejected its hand out and turned itself off again.

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.240
 Wow.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.240
 Isn't that so great?

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.240
 I love that.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.240
 What happens if it stops working?

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.240
 You usually have to turn it off and turn it back on again.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:40.240
 Just while we're on this fact,

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.240
 Robot in California shooting its eventa,

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.240
 there's a Wikipedia page of unusual deaths

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.240
 in the 20th century, and it's stunning.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240
 Oh, really?

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240
 It's so good.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.240
 OK, R. Stanton Walker, right?

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.240
 Yeah.

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.240
 In 1902, he was watching a baseball game with friends,

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.240
 and a ball, a foul ball, hit him in the hand.

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.240
 Unfortunately, he's halfway through passing his friend a knife,

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.240
 a large and sharp one, which then is driven into his chest,

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.240
 and he dies within a few minutes.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.240
 I mean, this is final destination, isn't it?

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.240
 It is, isn't it?

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.240
 Yeah.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.240
 The designer and builder of the first ever offshore lighthouse,

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.240
 Henry Wyn Stanley.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.240
 Oh, this is a little longer ago,

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.240
 so comedy is more acceptable about it.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.240
 1698, he builds it.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.240
 It's offshore in Devon, right?

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.240
 Mm-hmm.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.240
 It's a very wild bit of coast, the Eddystone rocks.

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.240
 He says it's going to survive the greatest storm

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.240
 that could ever be.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.240
 Five years later, he is inside it for the great storm of 1703.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.240
 He has never found, neither has the lighthouse.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.240
 It just disappears into the sea.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.240
 I know, tragic.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.240
 Do they have Robbie Williams in there?

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.240
 Because I'm pretty sure Robbie Williams is the name

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.240
 of the first person to be killed by a robot.

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.240
 I didn't find him.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.240
 I mean, it's a long old list.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.240
 This is from memory, but I think he was working in a factory

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.240
 that had robotics there and something tragic happens.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240
 Yeah, in the '70s.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.240
 Yeah, it was like something that built cars,

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.240
 that kind of thing.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.240
 It was the arm of a machine that whipped him.

00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240
 But he was called Robbie Williams, so...

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.240
 No, he's loving angels instead.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:10.240
 That is all of our facts for this week.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.240

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.240
 We read out emails from listeners,
