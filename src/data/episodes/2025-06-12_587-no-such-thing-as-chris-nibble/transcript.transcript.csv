00:00:00,00:00:05,Hello everyone and welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:00:05,00:00:07,Now why am I talking to you before the show starts?
00:00:07,00:00:13,"Well, of course it is because one of us is away this week and it is Dan Schreiber."
00:00:13,00:00:16,So in his place we have gotten the most Dan Schreiber person we can.
00:00:16,00:00:21,"In fact, the most Dan Schreiber person in the entirety of the world."
00:00:21,00:00:24,Arguably more Dan Schreiber than Dan Schreiber himself.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"It is the wonderful, incredible, you'll know him from Flight of the Concords, Tumanji,"
00:00:29,00:00:33,"our flag means death, of course it is Rhys Darby."
00:00:33,00:00:38,Now we always love to see Rhys when he's in town and we are so lucky that he is currently
00:00:38,00:00:43,"on tour in the UK and that means that as well as enjoying him on our podcast, you can go"
00:00:43,00:00:45,and see his show.
00:00:45,00:00:50,"So if you are listening to this on the day it goes out, then quick go to the internet"
00:00:50,00:00:55,and get tickets to his show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London.
00:00:55,00:01:00,"And if you live in Brighton Sheffield, St Albans Leeds, Swindon, Exeter, Bristol, Newcastle,"
00:01:00,00:01:04,"Glasgow, Manchester or Edinburgh, then you are also in luck because he is yet to do your"
00:01:04,00:01:05,cities.
00:01:05,00:01:11,"If you want to get tickets for that, you must go to RhysDarby.com, that's R-H-Y-S-D-A-R-B-Y"
00:01:11,00:01:16,".com, all of the information, all of the tickets are available on there."
00:01:16,00:01:21,"But for now, please enjoy the fabulous Tour de Force, that is Rhys Darby."
00:01:21,00:01:23,"Okay, on with the podcast."
00:01:23,00:01:42,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:42,00:01:46,to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:46,00:01:51,"My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin"
00:01:51,00:01:58,"and the inimitable Rhys Darby, who has joined us in place of Dan Shriver today."
00:01:58,00:02:01,"So without further ado, we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts"
00:02:01,00:02:04,from the last seven days in no particular order.
00:02:04,00:02:05,Here we go.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"Rhys, what's your fact?"
00:02:07,00:02:09,"Well, and thank you for having me."
00:02:09,00:02:11,Hi everyone.
00:02:11,00:02:13,How are you?
00:02:13,00:02:15,Good.
00:02:15,00:02:21,The most highly decorated Soviet Air Unit of World War II didn't take part in the victory
00:02:21,00:02:24,parade because their planes were too slow.
00:02:24,00:02:25,Wow.
00:02:25,00:02:29,"Can you tell us more, why would a slow plane be useful in a war anyway?"
00:02:29,00:02:31,"Well, funny you should ask."
00:02:31,00:02:33,Do I now dive into the...
00:02:33,00:02:34,Dive in.
00:02:34,00:02:35,[Music]
00:02:35,00:02:36,Mosquito.
00:02:36,00:02:37,Yes.
00:02:37,00:02:38,But what type?
00:02:38,00:02:39,The plane.
00:02:39,00:02:40,"The plane, the Mosquito."
00:02:40,00:02:41,"No, no, no."
00:02:41,00:02:55,"It was, in fact, a South Pacific Mosquito and that was its last flight before I killed"
00:02:55,00:02:56,it.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"Right, but back to the..."
00:02:58,00:02:59,Cool.
00:02:59,00:03:04,"So basically, this is the story of a unit that was in Russia during World War II, the"
00:03:04,00:03:12,"Night Bomber Regiment, entirely made up of females, with ground crew and the air crew,"
00:03:12,00:03:19,"and they flew very old biplanes called the Polikropov or the Po-2, very old planes made"
00:03:19,00:03:20,of wood.
00:03:20,00:03:21,Wow.
00:03:21,00:03:22,And they were super slow.
00:03:22,00:03:24,"They were slow, I think, because they were old planes."
00:03:24,00:03:27,"They were old crop dusters, weren't they?"
00:03:27,00:03:28,"Yes, that's right."
00:03:28,00:03:31,"They were amazingly slow, like top speed 90 miles an hour."
00:03:31,00:03:32,Yeah.
00:03:32,00:03:33,That is slow.
00:03:33,00:03:36,"I drove faster than that, and my way's a nursery today."
00:03:36,00:03:37,Okay.
00:03:37,00:03:40,It is a 20-mile-an-hour zone.
00:03:40,00:03:45,"Yeah, but the idea was, because they were so old and made of wood, they were really"
00:03:45,00:03:51,"quiet, and so they could kind of get under the radar a little bit and do lots of bombing"
00:03:51,00:03:53,raids one after the other.
00:03:53,00:03:54,"And they were known as the witches, right?"
00:03:54,00:03:55,Yes.
00:03:55,00:03:56,And do we know why they were called witches?
00:03:56,00:03:57,Night witches.
00:03:57,00:03:58,They were witches.
00:03:58,00:03:59,They were witches.
00:03:59,00:04:01,It was no two ways about it.
00:04:01,00:04:04,They've got some great pictures here of them.
00:04:04,00:04:05,Yeah.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Poetry hearts.
00:04:06,00:04:07,Yeah.
00:04:07,00:04:11,"They had spells and all sorts of stuff, so it was quite amazing."
00:04:11,00:04:15,"But yeah, but because they turned their engines off from their planes, and they did this so"
00:04:15,00:04:20,"that they would come in silently, and so just to give you an impression of that one coming"
00:04:20,00:04:21,in.
00:04:21,00:04:46,"And then they would literally just drop bombs, and I don't know when they started their planes"
00:04:46,00:04:47,up again.
00:04:47,00:04:57,"Like they just passed the bombing zone, you know, and then sort of back they fly."
00:04:57,00:05:02,"So yeah, so just to reiterate, I think the Germans felt that they sounded like witches"
00:05:02,00:05:06,"on broomsticks coming in and just, you know, dropping bombs."
00:05:06,00:05:07,Swishing away.
00:05:07,00:05:14,"And let's not forget Marina Ruskova, Ruskova, the lead person in this group."
00:05:14,00:05:19,She had to really campaign to get it all happening.
00:05:19,00:05:24,"Obviously, it was mainly men involved in the battles back then."
00:05:24,00:05:28,"And you know, this is when Operation Barbarossa was on."
00:05:28,00:05:32,So this was the entire German army literally trying to take over Russia.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"A very bold move, as we all know."
00:05:34,00:05:35,How to play out.
00:05:35,00:05:39,"It didn't quite work, but it did look good at the beginning."
00:05:39,00:05:43,So there was like over three million German troops.
00:05:43,00:05:48,"They had, I think, three brigades, they had so many armoured divisions."
00:05:48,00:05:50,And there was really no opposition for a while.
00:05:50,00:05:52,They really were making a lot of ground.
00:05:52,00:05:58,And then it was a massive call up for the Russians to defend their land.
00:05:58,00:06:02,"And the women as well were like, well, we want to help, you know, we're strong."
00:06:02,00:06:03,Let's grab guns.
00:06:03,00:06:04,Let's go.
00:06:04,00:06:07,"It was the whole family, all family in, you know."
00:06:07,00:06:14,"And then so this particular woman, Marina Roscova, she ended up really sort of..."
00:06:14,00:06:15,"She recruited, didn't she?"
00:06:15,00:06:16,She recruited a lot.
00:06:16,00:06:21,"I think over a thousand women and did the training and, you know, sort of formulate."
00:06:21,00:06:25,"But she also persuaded Stalin, and an element that's often smooth though, for I feel, in"
00:06:25,00:06:27,"the great stories of how heroic they were, which they were, is the fact that she was"
00:06:27,00:06:30,"quite good mates with Stalin, which is how she managed to make happen."
00:06:30,00:06:31,But it's OK.
00:06:31,00:06:32,We didn't know a lot of what we knew now.
00:06:32,00:06:33,It's the foot in the door.
00:06:33,00:06:34,"You've got to get your foot in the door, right?"
00:06:34,00:06:37,She knew Stalin because she was one of the most famous women in Russia.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Yeah.
00:06:38,00:06:43,"She was an aviatrix, and she and her team had the world record for the longest continuous"
00:06:43,00:06:44,flight.
00:06:44,00:06:46,And she was like a hero of the whole country.
00:06:46,00:06:50,"And so when she came to say, I want my women to take part in the war, Stalin was not going"
00:06:50,00:06:53,to say no to her because she was so big.
00:06:53,00:06:59,"But did say no to the equipment, like you're not having our planes."
00:06:59,00:07:03,"These modern vehicles are not for you guys, ladies."
00:07:03,00:07:07,"And so this is how it all sort of came together, is that they got the planes that were left"
00:07:07,00:07:08,that no one wanted.
00:07:08,00:07:09,By planes?
00:07:09,00:07:10,Yeah.
00:07:10,00:07:11,It's crazy.
00:07:11,00:07:12,I didn't think by planes flew in the Second World War.
00:07:12,00:07:13,I'm certainly not in combat.
00:07:13,00:07:18,"But just can we quickly say about her earlier flight, where she was the navigator for this"
00:07:18,00:07:19,"cross Soviet Union journey, right?"
00:07:19,00:07:22,"And it was 4,000 miles."
00:07:22,00:07:25,"And as they were getting towards the end, there are two versions of the story."
00:07:25,00:07:31,One is that the plane was icing up and they threw everything out to try and maintain height.
00:07:31,00:07:34,"And then she decided, it's not going to be enough, I'm going to have to throw myself"
00:07:34,00:07:35,out of the plane.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Wow.
00:07:36,00:07:37,And she did.
00:07:37,00:07:38,That's the final straw.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"There are two pilots in her, the navigator."
00:07:41,00:07:42,Surely they had clothing first.
00:07:42,00:07:46,These hippie boots have got to go.
00:07:46,00:07:48,But I don't think she was naked when she jumped out.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"She wasn't naked because it was so cold, so she wanted a bit of protection."
00:07:51,00:07:54,"But they'd thrown everything else out, like up to and including the compass, I think, as"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"then she thought, my navigating job is done, so like we're very nearly there."
00:07:58,00:07:59,But so that's one version.
00:07:59,00:08:03,The other story is that they couldn't find the airfield and the navigator's cockpit
00:08:03,00:08:04,had no protection.
00:08:04,00:08:07,"Either way, she did jump out of the plane shortly before the end and she had no food"
00:08:07,00:08:08,or water for 10 days.
00:08:08,00:08:12,Eventually a hunter discovered her and that sort of cemented her heroics.
00:08:12,00:08:14,Can we just go back a little bit to her jumping out of the plane?
00:08:14,00:08:15,Did she have a parachute?
00:08:15,00:08:16,"Yes, she did."
00:08:16,00:08:17,Did she?
00:08:17,00:08:18,"She parachuted, yes."
00:08:18,00:08:22,"Because actually the night witches didn't have parachutes, did they?"
00:08:22,00:08:24,"No, they didn't."
00:08:24,00:08:29,"Just on this, another thing, sorry, I'm telling you, the oft reported negative spin of the"
00:08:29,00:08:31,"night witches, but you don't get very often."
00:08:31,00:08:34,But you know in that thing where these three women crash landed basically.
00:08:34,00:08:35,Right.
00:08:35,00:08:36,So they were all lost.
00:08:36,00:08:39,"She was lost for 10 days, the other two were lost for a couple of days."
00:08:39,00:08:43,"I think she had a bar and a half of chocolate to survive on for 10 days, which I really want"
00:08:43,00:08:45,to know why I'm in the other half.
00:08:45,00:08:48,"Well, if you also, if you've ever had to sell be a chocolate, it is utterly disgusting."
00:08:48,00:08:49,Wow.
00:08:49,00:08:51,Maybe it was better in the 1940s.
00:08:51,00:08:52,I suspect not.
00:08:52,00:08:58,"All I'm saying is you don't scoff it in the first moment, like if it was a Mars bar, you'd"
00:08:58,00:08:59,"be like, oh, delicious."
00:08:59,00:09:00,Yeah.
00:09:00,00:09:01,"No, you wouldn't."
00:09:01,00:09:02,I see.
00:09:02,00:09:03,Maybe that's part of the ploy.
00:09:03,00:09:04,You can survive longer.
00:09:04,00:09:05,The opposite of savoring it.
00:09:05,00:09:06,Yeah.
00:09:06,00:09:12,But there was a rescue mission sent out to save these three women and 16 men died.
00:09:12,00:09:13,Yeah.
00:09:13,00:09:16,But there were huge celebrations afterwards because they'd broken this record.
00:09:16,00:09:19,"And I think Stalin thought, you know what, it's going to dampen the vibe if we mention"
00:09:19,00:09:21,the fact that 16 men have been killed.
00:09:21,00:09:24,Can I just also say it wasn't like one man would go and look for them.
00:09:24,00:09:25,He would die.
00:09:25,00:09:26,And then another person would go out.
00:09:26,00:09:28,They all died in the plane crash.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Yeah.
00:09:29,00:09:30,It wasn't like a scream.
00:09:30,00:09:31,Shall I go and see what he's doing back there?
00:09:31,00:09:33,Someone's knocking them all off.
00:09:33,00:09:37,I'm not going to go and have a look.
00:09:37,00:09:38,You're next.
00:09:38,00:09:39,"Well, yeah."
00:09:39,00:09:43,"And then Raskova, she got the first ever state funeral, I think, in any country in World"
00:09:43,00:09:44,War II.
00:09:44,00:09:45,Definitely the first one in Moscow.
00:09:45,00:09:49,"There'd been none in Britain, none in Germany, none in America, obviously at that stage."
00:09:49,00:09:53,"Well, yeah, when she died, her ashes were placed in the Kremlin walls and they're still there"
00:09:53,00:09:54,today.
00:09:54,00:09:55,Wow.
00:09:55,00:09:56,Cool.
00:09:56,00:09:59,It's mad thinking about these incredibly old slow planes that were being flown into combat
00:09:59,00:10:03,"because they had to go at night because, not because they were loud, because they were"
00:10:03,00:10:04,slow.
00:10:04,00:10:05,That's it.
00:10:05,00:10:09,"But the advantage was, I think, if the Luftwaffe were chasing them or trying to shoot them down,"
00:10:09,00:10:11,"if the Luftwaffe flew at 90 miles an hour, they would stall."
00:10:11,00:10:15,Because their planes were too good to catch.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"So in a sense, they had an unfair advantage to the night, which is all I'm saying."
00:10:18,00:10:22,And they did it at night because that was the time to do the bombing.
00:10:22,00:10:27,"So there was no rest for the Germans because during the night, they would fix their stuff"
00:10:27,00:10:30,and they'd be being bombed so they couldn't.
00:10:30,00:10:31,So it was relentless.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Yeah.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"They weren't the only female pilots in the war, though, because I think in Britain there"
00:10:36,00:10:40,"was the ATA, the Air Transport Auxiliary, and that was mostly male pilots, but there"
00:10:40,00:10:42,was a sizable chunk of them who were women.
00:10:42,00:10:47,And their job was to get planes from factories to airfields and things like that.
00:10:47,00:10:48,Right.
00:10:48,00:10:49,By flying them.
00:10:49,00:10:50,"By flying them, exactly."
00:10:50,00:10:52,"And it would test them at the same time, I guess."
00:10:52,00:10:55,"Well, they had to know so many different kinds of planes, basically."
00:10:55,00:10:57,I think these women were amazing.
00:10:57,00:11:01,"So for example, Dolores Mogridge, an incredible name of the kind I think you don't really"
00:11:01,00:11:06,"get anymore, she flew 83 different types of plane during the war."
00:11:06,00:11:10,And she was once the subject of a complaint by a male RAF officer.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"He complained, ""It was dreadful weather and I can't believe not only was a woman flying"
00:11:13,00:11:16,"me here, but she was reading a book."""
00:11:16,00:11:17,Wow.
00:11:17,00:11:19,"And when he wasn't reading a novel, those are my notes, ""I hadn't flown this type"
00:11:19,00:11:20,"of plane before."""
00:11:20,00:11:22,And he nearly threw up when he read it.
00:11:22,00:11:23,Amazing.
00:11:23,00:11:24,Just lovely.
00:11:24,00:11:28,"The other thing they had to do was, as well as flying planes too, at the airfield from"
00:11:28,00:11:32,"which they'd fly into combat, they had to fly the planes back when they were damaged."
00:11:32,00:11:37,"So they'd have an attack plane, no undercarriage, wing missing, and then the men would be like,"
00:11:37,00:11:38,"""Fly there, Peck!"
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Will you love?"""
00:11:39,00:11:40,Yes.
00:11:40,00:11:41,It's got no wings.
00:11:41,00:11:42,You'll be right.
00:11:42,00:11:43,You'll figure it out.
00:11:43,00:11:44,That's amazing.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"Yeah, that's so cool."
00:11:45,00:11:47,The last of them only died in 2022.
00:11:47,00:11:48,It's crazy.
00:11:48,00:11:51,"I mean, a lot of them lived really long lives."
00:11:51,00:11:55,"Yeah, Stella Edwards, I think, was the last surviving ATA girl, as they got called."
00:11:55,00:12:01,"Well, you know, the night witches are all still alive, even the one who had the state"
00:12:01,00:12:02,funeral.
00:12:02,00:12:03,"Yeah, I think so."
00:12:03,00:12:05,She was the first to come back to life.
00:12:05,00:12:09,Do you know the country which has the highest proportion of female pilots?
00:12:09,00:12:10,Russia.
00:12:10,00:12:11,No.
00:12:11,00:12:12,"Oh, I'm not talking about the..."
00:12:12,00:12:13,"No, sorry."
00:12:13,00:12:15,"These days, commercial pilots."
00:12:15,00:12:17,I don't think it's very guessable.
00:12:17,00:12:18,"Oh, okay."
00:12:18,00:12:19,I'm going to have a go.
00:12:19,00:12:20,Rwanda.
00:12:20,00:12:21,It's not Rwanda.
00:12:21,00:12:22,Ireland.
00:12:22,00:12:23,It's not Ireland.
00:12:23,00:12:24,"That's close, though."
00:12:24,00:12:25,Oh.
00:12:25,00:12:26,Northern Ireland.
00:12:26,00:12:27,"No, India."
00:12:27,00:12:28,Oh.
00:12:28,00:12:29,Sorry.
00:12:29,00:12:30,"When I say close, I mean close alphabetically."
00:12:30,00:12:34,"That's very close alphabetically, isn't it?"
00:12:34,00:12:35,Yeah.
00:12:35,00:12:36,That's almost bulls-eye-eye.
00:12:36,00:12:37,Well done.
00:12:37,00:12:38,Thank you.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"My bad for not thinking alphabetically, too."
00:12:40,00:12:41,Silly me.
00:12:41,00:12:44,"I remember when we flew to Australia, and we'd only be going for an hour or so, and"
00:12:44,00:12:45,"I said, ""Are we close?"""
00:12:45,00:12:46,"And you said, ""Yeah, we're over Austria."""
00:12:46,00:12:50,We got railier to go.
00:12:50,00:12:51,India.
00:12:51,00:12:52,That's amazing.
00:12:52,00:12:55,"13% of pilots are women, isn't it?"
00:12:55,00:12:56,That's interesting.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Global average is about 5%.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"You know Douglas Bader, Bader?"
00:12:59,00:13:00,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:00,00:13:01,No legs.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Pilot.
00:13:02,00:13:03,But dreamy guy.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Dreamy trying ace.
00:13:04,00:13:05,"Oh, yes."
00:13:05,00:13:08,"He's famous, because he had no legs."
00:13:08,00:13:15,"So there was a guy called Alexi Mariseev, who was a Russian guy, and he was in a crash."
00:13:15,00:13:21,"And like this woman, Raskova, he had to walk around Siberia, living on a handful of ants"
00:13:21,00:13:23,"and half a lizard, he said."
00:13:23,00:13:25,It's still better than this Soviet chocolate bar.
00:13:25,00:13:29,"Yeah, when they found him, he had 10 chocolate bars in his pocket."
00:13:29,00:13:34,He was desperately hunting for another ant.
00:13:34,00:13:38,"But he had really bad frostbitten legs, and he had to have them chopped off."
00:13:38,00:13:42,He then went on and carried on fighting in dog fights and became a national hero.
00:13:42,00:13:45,So Russia had its own Douglas Bader.
00:13:45,00:13:50,"And Germany, Hans Ulrich Rudl, he was a German pilot."
00:13:50,00:13:52,He was one of the most decorated pilots of the war.
00:13:52,00:13:57,"And he got shot, wounded in one of his legs, had to lose his leg, and then carried on and"
00:13:57,00:14:00,shot down 26 more fights with only one leg.
00:14:00,00:14:01,So they had one.
00:14:01,00:14:02,One.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"To be fair, he got one leg, but that would be on the throttle."
00:14:05,00:14:08,"So, you know, he's got the advantage, he was faster to keep away."
00:14:08,00:14:10,He couldn't slam the brakes on.
00:14:10,00:14:11,No brakes.
00:14:11,00:14:15,Did they have to modify the planes or anything?
00:14:15,00:14:19,Because I think Douglas Bader's plane was somehow rigged up so he could keep flying
00:14:19,00:14:20,with no legs.
00:14:20,00:14:21,I think that's true.
00:14:21,00:14:24,But do you think it's interesting that all three of those countries had their own legless
00:14:24,00:14:25,feelings?
00:14:25,00:14:26,That's really interesting.
00:14:26,00:14:27,That's kind of amazing.
00:14:27,00:14:28,We can move on.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Yeah.
00:14:29,00:14:30,"You were in the Kiwi Army, weren't you?"
00:14:30,00:14:31,"Yes, that's right."
00:14:31,00:14:32,"You were in the Kiwi Army, weren't you, flying?"
00:14:32,00:14:34,"No, that would be the air force."
00:14:34,00:14:35,Got it.
00:14:35,00:14:39,"Guys, I'm a thicker snake."
00:14:39,00:14:42,"Which one do you fancy today, the boats, to play on the on foot?"
00:14:42,00:14:48,"Just get in the garage and have fun, guys."
00:14:48,00:14:54,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:14:54,00:14:56,That is my fact.
00:14:56,00:15:01,"My fact this week is that if you drop a wallet containing cash in Tokyo, you're three times"
00:15:01,00:15:06,more likely to get it back than if you drop it in New York.
00:15:06,00:15:11,I was furious when I first read about this in a BBC article which reported that 88% of
00:15:11,00:15:17,"phones that were lost deliberately by a researcher during the study in Tokyo were returned, but"
00:15:17,00:15:21,only 6% of those lost in New York were returned.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"Actually, it turned out that wasn't true."
00:15:23,00:15:30,"I looked at the study and 95% were returned in Tokyo, but 88% were returned to the police"
00:15:30,00:15:35,and only 7% were returned to the person whose phone number was on the phone.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"So he deliberately left contact details like, you know, call me if you find my stuff."
00:15:39,00:15:42,"And the Japanese are like, no, I'm not going to ring you."
00:15:42,00:15:43,"Official channels only, right?"
00:15:43,00:15:44,Official channels only.
00:15:44,00:15:47,"Whereas in New York, like 75% or something gave them back, but they just called the person."
00:15:47,00:15:49,Who writes their phone number on their phone?
00:15:49,00:15:50,"It's quite weird, isn't it?"
00:15:50,00:15:52,I'm thinking about doing that now.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Yeah.
00:15:53,00:15:54,It's quite a genius idea.
00:15:54,00:15:55,I don't know if it is.
00:15:55,00:15:56,That genius.
00:15:56,00:15:57,"But how would you, when you pick it up, you go, how am I going to call it?"
00:15:57,00:15:58,Yeah.
00:15:58,00:15:59,Yeah.
00:15:59,00:16:02,"You can write your best friend's phone number on it, maybe, or your mum's number, your house"
00:16:02,00:16:03,phone.
00:16:03,00:16:07,But basically Japanese culture is such that they're so set up for lost property.
00:16:07,00:16:10,Japan is basically a large lost property office masquerading as a country.
00:16:10,00:16:16,"As in, people in Japan are so culturally wired into handing lost things, it's just absolutely"
00:16:16,00:16:17,the rules.
00:16:17,00:16:18,It's just what you do.
00:16:18,00:16:22,"So last year, people in Japan handed in four and a half billion yen in cash."
00:16:22,00:16:24,It's still a very cash-based society.
00:16:24,00:16:27,"Yeah, but we don't know whether that was just a lot of 100 yen kind."
00:16:27,00:16:30,"So whether it was just one, it was a huge suitcase."
00:16:30,00:16:36,"Well, they have a thing where you can hand in a coin, and if you had it into the authorities,"
00:16:36,00:16:39,they would then give you that coin back as a gift.
00:16:39,00:16:40,It's an honor thing.
00:16:40,00:16:46,"So yeah, it's about kind of, rather than the older, if you see a penny, pick it up, and"
00:16:46,00:16:47,"all day long, you'll have good luck."
00:16:47,00:16:48,That classic one.
00:16:48,00:16:49,They don't have that.
00:16:49,00:16:55,"If they find something, I'm speaking for all Japanese people right now, I have been there,"
00:16:55,00:16:59,"and I remember having a conversation with one chap about it, and he said, ""Make sure"
00:16:59,00:17:02,"you talk about this on a podcast down the line."""
00:17:02,00:17:03,"""Oh, I will, I will."""
00:17:03,00:17:08,"But anyway, long story short, they give it back to you, and it's a gift, and so therefore"
00:17:08,00:17:13,"you have received the coin that you've found as a gift, and then, honorably, you can then"
00:17:13,00:17:14,hold on to it.
00:17:14,00:17:15,Brilliant.
00:17:15,00:17:16,That's really cool.
00:17:16,00:17:17,Worthy extra love.
00:17:17,00:17:18,I have actually done this in London.
00:17:18,00:17:21,"I found a wallet with some money in it, handed it into the police."
00:17:21,00:17:23,"You did skim a bit off the top, though, didn't you?"
00:17:23,00:17:24,"Hey, hey."
00:17:24,00:17:26,"Well, this was the thing about..."
00:17:26,00:17:28,"I think it had cash in, and I didn't..."
00:17:28,00:17:31,"I think it then got claimed, because I was at the police station every day for the next"
00:17:31,00:17:32,six months.
00:17:32,00:17:33,Anyone turn up to claim that cash yet?
00:17:33,00:17:37,"But I think in the UK, genuinely, in the UK, if it's been three months or some period"
00:17:37,00:17:42,"of time, and the money is not claimed, you can go and, as the finder, claim it."
00:17:42,00:17:44,"I didn't mean to say, ""Yeah, did you take the money out?"""
00:17:44,00:17:46,"Because in New York, one of the interesting things about, well, yeah, whatever, you would"
00:17:46,00:17:47,"say that, wouldn't you?"
00:17:47,00:17:54,"It wasn't that one day that you bought a round in when we went to the pub, was it?"
00:17:54,00:17:57,I remember that so clearly that day.
00:17:57,00:17:58,You were waving a 20-quid note.
00:17:58,00:17:59,"It was 2014, wasn't it?"
00:17:59,00:18:00,"Yeah, it was a great day."
00:18:00,00:18:01,Very proud.
00:18:01,00:18:02,It wasn't me.
00:18:02,00:18:06,"Just to save it for Randy, he's too proud of himself for handing this in."
00:18:06,00:18:09,Most people in pretty much any country will hand it in.
00:18:09,00:18:12,This is the thing that you don't get reported on much.
00:18:12,00:18:16,"Even in New York, 80% of people are handing in wallets, but of the wallets in New York,"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"the researcher dropped them with $20 in each, which is the amount you legally have to return"
00:18:20,00:18:23,if you find it in New York.
00:18:23,00:18:27,"And eight of the wallets were returned, but only six still have the money in."
00:18:27,00:18:30,So I'm counting that in my percentages as...
00:18:30,00:18:31,"How high were the drops, too?"
00:18:31,00:18:32,Were they...
00:18:32,00:18:33,The skyscrapers.
00:18:33,00:18:34,Were they?
00:18:34,00:18:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:18:35,00:18:36,"People died, actually."
00:18:36,00:18:37,People died.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Disconcussion.
00:18:38,00:18:39,The wallet dropped!
00:18:39,00:18:40,No!
00:18:40,00:18:44,Returning the wallet is just embedded in the head of someone who was standing under the
00:18:44,00:18:45,"Empire State Building, yeah, yeah."
00:18:45,00:18:46,That's really interesting.
00:18:46,00:18:50,"Do you think the person who takes the money is in their head, they think, you'd find"
00:18:50,00:18:51,us fee?
00:18:51,00:18:52,Maybe.
00:18:52,00:18:53,Maybe.
00:18:53,00:18:55,Or was it a different person who took the money and then a new person found the empty
00:18:55,00:18:56,wallet?
00:18:56,00:18:59,"If I was going to take the money, I might just take the money because it's not as identifiable."
00:18:59,00:19:04,"But you don't want to take someone's driving license, that's a huge faff for them, you"
00:19:04,00:19:05,know.
00:19:05,00:19:06,Yeah.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"So in Tokyo, they have these things called Corbans and they're tiny police stations and"
00:19:09,00:19:14,"a city like Tokyo will have dozens of them, but in the countryside, there'll be just one"
00:19:14,00:19:16,or two in each village.
00:19:16,00:19:19,"And the idea is, you hand your stuff in there and it's kept there for about a month and"
00:19:19,00:19:24,that's in case someone sort of retraces their steps and goes back to the area where they
00:19:24,00:19:27,"were, they find the nearest Corban and they say, ""It's my 50p there."""
00:19:27,00:19:28,Or whatever.
00:19:28,00:19:29,So good.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"And then after a certain amount of time, they're given to the big sort of lost and found in"
00:19:32,00:19:34,the middle of Tokyo or wherever.
00:19:34,00:19:35,Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:36,Okay.
00:19:36,00:19:37,Here's the thing that's lost in Japan.
00:19:37,00:19:38,This is nuts.
00:19:38,00:19:40,A big chunk of Japan has been lost.
00:19:40,00:19:41,Okay.
00:19:41,00:19:48,"So in Japan, a big chunk has no easily contactable owner and the property law is crazy there"
00:19:48,00:19:52,"as in it's very difficult, like property is distributed among heirs, sometimes if there's"
00:19:52,00:19:55,"no will, so it's kind of divvied up equally."
00:19:55,00:19:58,"There was a case where the government, they wanted to build a road, like really big road"
00:19:58,00:20:00,going into/out of Tokyo.
00:20:00,00:20:02,So important project for them.
00:20:02,00:20:06,They had to track down 148 heirs of one patch of land.
00:20:06,00:20:09,"They sent 200 letters out, a lot of people had emigrated, some of them had died, like"
00:20:09,00:20:12,just nightmare situation.
00:20:12,00:20:17,"The unowned bit of Japan is bigger than which country, I'd like you all to guess."
00:20:17,00:20:18,Is it close to Japan?
00:20:18,00:20:19,No.
00:20:19,00:20:20,Oh.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Not alphabetically.
00:20:21,00:20:22,I'm going to...
00:20:22,00:20:23,Not Jamaica then.
00:20:23,00:20:24,Okay.
00:20:24,00:20:26,I'm going to go with Russia.
00:20:26,00:20:27,Yeah.
00:20:27,00:20:28,That's okay.
00:20:28,00:20:31,"20% of Japan, I'm going to say Wales."
00:20:31,00:20:32,Not far off.
00:20:32,00:20:33,Belgium.
00:20:33,00:20:34,Far off.
00:20:34,00:20:35,"Denmark, very close to Belgium."
00:20:35,00:20:36,Okay.
00:20:36,00:20:38,The unowned bit of Japan or the bit where they just have no idea who owns it and it's
00:20:38,00:20:40,a nightmare legally is bigger than Denmark.
00:20:40,00:20:41,Wow.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Crazy.
00:20:42,00:20:43,It's just demographics.
00:20:43,00:20:44,You don't have to register when you own land.
00:20:44,00:20:45,It's not compulsory.
00:20:45,00:20:50,You know this big building in Tokyo where all the lost and found stuff goes?
00:20:50,00:20:52,The huge lost property office.
00:20:52,00:20:53,Yeah.
00:20:53,00:21:01,"In 2016, they processed 3.67 billion yen of cash and 74% of it was retrieved."
00:21:01,00:21:06,"But then compared to that, the percentage of umbrellas that were returned was 90 times"
00:21:06,00:21:07,less.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Yeah.
00:21:08,00:21:10,"This is the thing umbrellas never give them back because you wouldn't, would you?"
00:21:10,00:21:12,You wouldn't go and get claim your umbrella.
00:21:12,00:21:13,You'd drop it on the tube.
00:21:13,00:21:14,No.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Because they're really the sort of a few quid to buy.
00:21:15,00:21:16,You just buy not one.
00:21:16,00:21:17,Yeah.
00:21:17,00:21:18,And they all look the same.
00:21:18,00:21:19,Apparently they've got like a see-through...
00:21:19,00:21:20,Oh yeah.
00:21:20,00:21:21,They have that self...
00:21:21,00:21:22,Yeah.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Yeah.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Yeah.
00:21:24,00:21:25,And so and really it's an open game for umbrellas.
00:21:25,00:21:26,"So if you lose it, you can..."
00:21:26,00:21:29,"And you find one, you don't have to hand that and you're not going to get a special gift"
00:21:29,00:21:30,or anything like that.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Is that right?
00:21:31,00:21:32,"It's like The Purge, that film."
00:21:32,00:21:33,Yeah.
00:21:33,00:21:34,It's very similar to The Purge.
00:21:34,00:21:35,Yeah.
00:21:35,00:21:36,Yeah.
00:21:36,00:21:37,"Well, umbrella crime is legal."
00:21:37,00:21:38,Wow.
00:21:38,00:21:44,And I don't know if they have the opening up of the umbrella inside being bad luck as
00:21:44,00:21:45,well.
00:21:45,00:21:46,I'm not sure where that came from.
00:21:46,00:21:47,"Oh, interesting."
00:21:47,00:21:48,You guys heard of that one?
00:21:48,00:21:49,Yeah.
00:21:49,00:21:50,"Yeah, of course."
00:21:50,00:21:51,Do you know where that came from?
00:21:51,00:21:52,No.
00:21:52,00:21:56,So we've been told by the big umbrella shop in London that the reason that it's bad luck
00:21:56,00:22:01,is it was invented by umbrella salesmen and they didn't want people opening their umbrellas
00:22:01,00:22:05,inside so that they would get all rotted and horrible and people would have to buy new
00:22:05,00:22:06,umbrellas.
00:22:06,00:22:07,Oh.
00:22:07,00:22:08,That's what we were told.
00:22:08,00:22:09,That makes total sense.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"When you buy an umbrella from that shop, it's because it's in the centre, it's only about"
00:22:11,00:22:12,a 10 minute walk from here.
00:22:12,00:22:13,Yeah.
00:22:13,00:22:14,It's amazing as well.
00:22:14,00:22:15,"Like, they're beautiful."
00:22:15,00:22:16,It's like the oldest umbrella shop in the world.
00:22:16,00:22:17,"They're so, they're so classy."
00:22:17,00:22:18,The umbrella's in there.
00:22:18,00:22:20,I bought one from there once as a real treat to myself.
00:22:20,00:22:23,"It was just after you found that money in the street, wasn't it?"
00:22:23,00:22:27,"And I've lost it now and I'm so gutted because it was this beautiful thing, but they give"
00:22:27,00:22:29,you a tutorial on how to open and close it.
00:22:29,00:22:30,"Like, they get special."
00:22:30,00:22:31,Really?
00:22:31,00:22:33,It's a bit embarrassing to go through it.
00:22:33,00:22:38,And does that umbrella shop have lots of little umbrella shops throughout the world?
00:22:38,00:22:39,I think it's one of a kind.
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Oh, it's not an umbrella organisation."
00:22:41,00:22:42,Oh gosh.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Oh gosh.
00:22:43,00:22:44,What?
00:22:44,00:22:45,What?
00:22:45,00:22:46,What?
00:22:46,00:22:48,You had to wonder where he was going with the questions.
00:22:48,00:22:50,I just love the way you walk straight into that.
00:22:50,00:22:57,"Well, these guys are being dex as usual, but I'm glad Rhys is interested in umbrella shop"
00:22:57,00:22:58,logistics.
00:22:58,00:23:04,"Guys, if you found a wallet on the street, then would you be more likely to hand it in"
00:23:04,00:23:05,if it had money in?
00:23:05,00:23:09,"If it's got other forms of ID, I hope I would just hand it in anyway."
00:23:09,00:23:10,Regardless.
00:23:10,00:23:12,Even if it had a million pounds in it.
00:23:12,00:23:13,How big is this wallet?
00:23:13,00:23:14,What is it?
00:23:14,00:23:15,What is it?
00:23:15,00:23:16,What denomination and currency are we talking about?
00:23:16,00:23:17,Is it in crypto?
00:23:17,00:23:18,What are you talking about?
00:23:18,00:23:21,"No, I think I would hand it in no matter what, actually."
00:23:21,00:23:22,Yeah.
00:23:22,00:23:23,I'm sure we're all honest people.
00:23:23,00:23:26,"Rhys, you haven't piped up, but we're just going to assume."
00:23:26,00:23:30,"Well, it depends on your circumstances, isn't it?"
00:23:30,00:23:35,"We're all sitting here in a nice building where we've got money, but I think if you"
00:23:35,00:23:40,"have anything, I think, you know, got to pick up a door too."
00:23:40,00:23:41,Very good point.
00:23:41,00:23:45,"You've shamed us all into having a bit of perspective, but the truth is that if you"
00:23:45,00:23:49,"drop a wallet with money in it, that's better than dropping one without because you're more"
00:23:49,00:23:51,likely to get it back.
00:23:51,00:23:57,"And this really surprised people. This is a study in 2019 which planted 17,303 wallets"
00:23:57,00:23:58,around the world.
00:23:58,00:23:59,Wow.
00:23:59,00:24:00,It's got a big study.
00:24:00,00:24:01,Did they need to do it?
00:24:01,00:24:03,Did they need to do the last three?
00:24:03,00:24:04,No.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"We're doing 17,300."
00:24:05,00:24:09,I don't think that's a good sample size.
00:24:09,00:24:10,Maybe there was three researchers.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"They dropped the 17,000 and they realized it accidentally dropped their own wallets as"
00:24:13,00:24:14,well.
00:24:14,00:24:15,I think that was it.
00:24:15,00:24:16,You're not going to believe this.
00:24:16,00:24:17,I lost my own.
00:24:17,00:24:19,Just grab one from the collection.
00:24:19,00:24:21,How the hell do they get them?
00:24:21,00:24:24,"Anyway, they dropped them in 355 cities all over the world."
00:24:24,00:24:28,So this is completely cross-cultural and half of them had no money in them.
00:24:28,00:24:36,"Half of them had $13.45 in them and 40% were returned when they had no cash, but 51% were"
00:24:36,00:24:37,returned when they had cash.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Wow.
00:24:38,00:24:40,"And they thought this is about weird, isn't it?"
00:24:40,00:24:47,So they did a follow-up study where they put another load with $94 in and the ones
00:24:47,00:24:53,"with $94, 72% were returned compared to only $60 for the $13, because I guess the thinking"
00:24:53,00:24:55,being that someone might really need it.
00:24:55,00:24:59,It feels a bit more like stealing if you've stole the $90 compared to $13.
00:24:59,00:25:01,"Mo money, mo guilt."
00:25:01,00:25:02,Exactly.
00:25:02,00:25:03,Yeah.
00:25:03,00:25:04,So.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Can I do one test on you guys?
00:25:05,00:25:06,"Yeah, go on."
00:25:06,00:25:10,I'm going to give you three words and I want to tell you which two words go together instinctively
00:25:10,00:25:11,for you.
00:25:11,00:25:13,This is related to this fact.
00:25:13,00:25:17,"So the three words are train, bus, track."
00:25:17,00:25:18,Okay.
00:25:18,00:25:19,Train and track alphabetically.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Very close together.
00:25:20,00:25:21,Sorry.
00:25:21,00:25:24,"Well, these were in the game."
00:25:24,00:25:25,What's the challenge?
00:25:25,00:25:26,"Train, track and bus."
00:25:26,00:25:27,Yeah.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"Well, trains go on tracks."
00:25:28,00:25:29,Do we pick?
00:25:29,00:25:30,Do we pick two words?
00:25:30,00:25:31,Which two go together for you?
00:25:31,00:25:32,"Train, track, bus?"
00:25:32,00:25:36,"Well, I normally track my wife as she travels around on the bus every day, so I'd say bus"
00:25:36,00:25:37,and track.
00:25:37,00:25:38,There you go.
00:25:38,00:25:39,Yeah.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Okay.
00:25:40,00:25:41,I feel like that's something that's seriously either.
00:25:41,00:25:42,There is.
00:25:42,00:25:47,"Well, like when I joined the Army with the aptitude tests, just a lucky dip for me."
00:25:47,00:25:48,Train and bus.
00:25:48,00:25:51,Thank you for no good reason.
00:25:51,00:25:52,You've given me the answer.
00:25:52,00:25:53,I wanted.
00:25:53,00:25:54,Bombs of transport.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Yeah.
00:25:55,00:25:58,So this is a difference between Eastern and Western cultures and this is so part of this
00:25:58,00:26:03,"thing about Japanese people handing stuff in, like very different culturally, collective"
00:26:03,00:26:07,"cultures dominate the East, individualist cultures dominate the West quite broadly."
00:26:07,00:26:08,And there are these huge differences.
00:26:08,00:26:13,"And then one of them is that given those three words, most Westerners say train and bus because"
00:26:13,00:26:18,"we think of things in categories, but most people from China or Japan or Korea will say"
00:26:18,00:26:21,train and track because everything is relational.
00:26:21,00:26:25,"So for instance, if you ask someone to describe themselves in the West, they'll say, oh, I'm"
00:26:25,00:26:26,a QI researcher.
00:26:26,00:26:27,Tall and handsome.
00:26:27,00:26:28,Exactly.
00:26:28,00:26:32,"We also lie a lot in our culture, don't we?"
00:26:32,00:26:33,We do.
00:26:33,00:26:37,"Anna, which culture do people say bus and track in, please?"
00:26:37,00:26:40,I'm here to rule myself out of East and West.
00:26:40,00:26:42,Have you heard of the Andaman Islands?
00:26:42,00:26:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:43,00:26:44,"Oh, come on."
00:26:44,00:26:45,Uncontacted tribes.
00:26:45,00:26:46,They're my people.
00:26:46,00:26:50,"This is a slightly different, forget the buses and the tracks."
00:26:50,00:26:54,"If you're Japanese or Chinese, you would more likely say, I'm so-and-so sister, I'm so-and-so"
00:26:54,00:26:58,"daughter, I'm employed by so-and-so, I'm the friend of so-and-so that it's all about like"
00:26:58,00:26:59,in relations.
00:26:59,00:27:03,"Anyway, we've thought that this is a difference between spiritual cultures and collectivism"
00:27:03,00:27:05,and things like that.
00:27:05,00:27:10,"And then there was an amazing study done in the border of China and Russia, which looked"
00:27:10,00:27:15,"at rice farming versus grain farming, and it's completely split on those grounds."
00:27:15,00:27:20,"And people with these more communal, collective responses to things are rice farmers, whereas"
00:27:20,00:27:22,grain farmers are more individualist.
00:27:22,00:27:26,And we think now it's just because rice farming involves way more cooperation.
00:27:26,00:27:27,That's really interesting.
00:27:27,00:27:31,"I read another study which I think is related to this, which is, if you're in Starbucks,"
00:27:31,00:27:35,"because I think it was done in Starbucks, and you need to get from one place to another,"
00:27:35,00:27:39,so from your seat to the place where you buy your coffee.
00:27:39,00:27:43,"If there's chairs in the way, Western people will sort of dodge around the chairs and get"
00:27:43,00:27:47,"to the place where they're supposed to go, whereas Eastern people will move the chairs"
00:27:47,00:27:50,out of the way and put them where they're supposed to be so that the next person can
00:27:50,00:27:51,get there as well.
00:27:51,00:27:52,That's nice.
00:27:52,00:27:53,"Wait, are there people on the chairs?"
00:27:53,00:27:54,No.
00:27:54,00:27:59,"And Andy, of course, turns all the chairs upside down and pours coffee on them."
00:27:59,00:28:02,What's your Starbucks coffee name?
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Oh, I use my actual name."
00:28:03,00:28:04,"Oh, really?"
00:28:04,00:28:05,Yeah.
00:28:05,00:28:06,"What do you use, Rhys?"
00:28:06,00:28:07,Chris Nibble.
00:28:07,00:28:08,"Do you, actually?"
00:28:08,00:28:09,Mmm.
00:28:09,00:28:12,But I always say the nibble.
00:28:12,00:28:13,Yeah.
00:28:13,00:28:14,Yeah.
00:28:14,00:28:15,Do you tell them to definitely say the nibble?
00:28:15,00:28:16,Nice.
00:28:16,00:28:17,"If you say Chris, you don't respond."
00:28:17,00:28:18,Yeah.
00:28:18,00:28:19,They need to say Chris Nibble.
00:28:19,00:28:25,"And then one time I got like something that was edible, and I was in the corner and I was"
00:28:25,00:28:31,"just having really tiny nibbles on it for about half an hour, and I left most of it behind."
00:28:31,00:28:35,"And I wondered whether they thought, ""Oh, yeah, that'll be him."""
00:28:35,00:28:36,Nibble by name.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Nibble by name.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"They'll be thinking, ""That's Rhys Stalpey."""
00:28:39,00:28:47,"There's also a test to see whether they know who I am or not, you know?"
00:28:47,00:28:54,"And then as I leave, I knew you didn't know who I am, as if I was Chris Nibble, and you"
00:28:54,00:28:57,couldn't keep the rest of this panini.
00:28:57,00:29:07,"Okay, time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:29:07,00:29:12,"My fact is that when trains were new in New Zealand, an elderly lady flagged one down"
00:29:12,00:29:16,by standing on the tracks to see if anyone could give her change for a £1 note.
00:29:16,00:29:17,Oh.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Wow.
00:29:18,00:29:19,That's...
00:29:19,00:29:20,Nice.
00:29:20,00:29:21,This is a story of something that really happened.
00:29:21,00:29:22,Wow.
00:29:22,00:29:27,"It's related in a book called Our Iron Roads by F.S. Williams, and I'm doing a little bit"
00:29:27,00:29:29,of prop comedy here because I brought in a copy.
00:29:29,00:29:30,"Oh, look at that."
00:29:30,00:29:31,It is stunning.
00:29:31,00:29:32,This was printed in 1883.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"Sorry, you said prop comedy?"
00:29:34,00:29:35,Hmm.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"It's a very bland, hard-backed book."
00:29:38,00:29:39,It's...
00:29:39,00:29:41,Wait for the comedy.
00:29:41,00:29:45,I'm happy that New Zealand is mentioned in one of these old books.
00:29:45,00:29:48,"Yeah, because trains were not very late in New Zealand, not much after the rest of the"
00:29:48,00:29:52,"world, but it's quite a hard country to navigate around, isn't it, by train, just because"
00:29:52,00:29:54,there's a lot of valleys and canyons and things.
00:29:54,00:29:55,Yes.
00:29:55,00:29:56,"Yeah, I imagine."
00:29:56,00:30:00,"But there's this anecdote, it's paid £402 if you're reading along at home."
00:30:00,00:30:04,"The eccentricities of English travellers, however, if dangerous are not so odd as some"
00:30:04,00:30:10,"in foreign parts, that's in quotes, it is said, so big tongs there, that not long ago"
00:30:10,00:30:14,an engine driver in New Zealand noticed a lady energetically waving her hand at a siding
00:30:14,00:30:16,where he was not time to stop.
00:30:16,00:30:21,"On pulling up his train, she was asked if she wished to come on board, also in quotes,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,when she stated that her object in stopping the train was to ascertain whether any passenger
00:30:24,00:30:26,could give her change for a £1 note.
00:30:26,00:30:27,There you go.
00:30:27,00:30:28,Wow.
00:30:28,00:30:29,So she wanted change.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"She just flagged it down, like presumably there was a coin operator machine that she"
00:30:32,00:30:34,was sending the next day and like...
00:30:34,00:30:37,Did they give the year there?
00:30:37,00:30:41,"It's no, not long ago, and this was printed in 1883, so..."
00:30:41,00:30:42,Okay.
00:30:42,00:30:45,"Well, I think the first trains were what, in the 1870s, so..."
00:30:45,00:30:48,"Oh no, 1830, well, in the UK, 1830s."
00:30:48,00:30:49,"And sorry, in New Zealand."
00:30:49,00:30:50,How were they?
00:30:50,00:30:51,"Oh, that's quite late."
00:30:51,00:30:52,"I think they were in the late '70s, 1870s."
00:30:52,00:30:53,That's really late.
00:30:53,00:30:54,I think so.
00:30:54,00:30:57,"And the first ones were in various different cities, and it was usually to get from the"
00:30:57,00:30:59,ports to the city.
00:30:59,00:31:01,"So in Vicargo, there was loads of swamps."
00:31:01,00:31:04,"You had to get past, so they put a railway line there."
00:31:04,00:31:08,"In Dunedin, you had to go over some difficult land to get there."
00:31:08,00:31:11,"In Christchurch, you had to go over some hills, and so they all put these different railways"
00:31:11,00:31:14,"in, but they all used different gauges."
00:31:14,00:31:15,Oh God.
00:31:15,00:31:18,"And so when they decided to put the whole country together, so the gauge is the width"
00:31:18,00:31:19,of the railway line.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Right.
00:31:20,00:31:23,"And when they decided to put the whole country together, they were like, OK, this is going"
00:31:23,00:31:24,to be a problem.
00:31:24,00:31:29,"And in the end, they went for this thing, which is three foot six inch gauge, which was kind"
00:31:29,00:31:30,of the smallest.
00:31:30,00:31:31,That's narrow gauge.
00:31:31,00:31:32,It's really narrow.
00:31:32,00:31:34,And the reason was because it was kind of cheaper.
00:31:34,00:31:35,But apparently...
00:31:35,00:31:36,Typical Kiwis.
00:31:36,00:31:37,That's such a false economy.
00:31:37,00:31:38,Go with the cheap gauge.
00:31:38,00:31:39,Go with the cheap one!
00:31:39,00:31:44,"But apparently, if you ride on modern railways even, it's like riding the Piccadilly line"
00:31:44,00:31:46,"in London, which is very sort of jerky and..."
00:31:46,00:31:47,Rickety.
00:31:47,00:31:48,Rickety.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"Oh, really?"
00:31:49,00:31:50,Because of that gauge?
00:31:50,00:31:51,Yeah.
00:31:51,00:31:56,"The gauge system that I've always been entertained by, the most, is the oddest."
00:31:56,00:31:57,And everyone's got one.
00:31:57,00:31:58,"Oh, God."
00:31:58,00:32:01,"Save it for your spinoff podcast, Anna."
00:32:01,00:32:05,"My favourite gauge, that's a good seed."
00:32:05,00:32:08,We ask a global megastar what their favourite gauge is.
00:32:08,00:32:09,"This week, Tom Cruise."
00:32:09,00:32:10,"Next week, Chris Dibble."
00:32:10,00:32:13,"Guys, it's going to run and run, I'm telling you."
00:32:13,00:32:17,You can keep the rest of that panini!
00:32:17,00:32:21,"My favourite gauge is the Australian gauge system, which I'm sure you're very familiar"
00:32:21,00:32:22,"with, which is mad."
00:32:22,00:32:25,"So they basically did what New Zealand did, but then they never put their country together"
00:32:25,00:32:27,properly train-wise.
00:32:27,00:32:32,"So it's also a joke involving an Irishman, a Scotsman and an Englishman."
00:32:32,00:32:33,Perfect.
00:32:33,00:32:36,"Because basically, we're in the 1850s, there was an Irish guy, Francis Shields, who's in"
00:32:36,00:32:38,charge of a rail company in New South Wales.
00:32:38,00:32:41,"He likes a broad gauge, the Irish gauge."
00:32:41,00:32:46,"Then, Scottish James Wallace came along, took over shortly afterwards, converted New South"
00:32:46,00:32:50,Wales and some of South Australia to a standard gauge.
00:32:50,00:32:54,"And then an English bloke came along, rocked up in Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland,"
00:32:54,00:32:57,"and made them all do the cheap, cheap-ass narrow gauge."
00:32:57,00:33:00,"And then some other bloke said, ""Let's do a completely different gauge to transport"
00:33:00,00:33:01,"sugarcane."""
00:33:01,00:33:04,The four different gauges never fixed.
00:33:04,00:33:07,"Still to this day, if you go on forums about it, the kind of forums that I like to go on"
00:33:07,00:33:10,"sometime late at night, there are quite a lot of Australians going, ""What's wrong with"
00:33:10,00:33:11,"our rail system?"""
00:33:11,00:33:14,Are there bits where everyone has to get off and get on a train with a different gauge?
00:33:14,00:33:15,Yes.
00:33:15,00:33:18,You'll have to transport your freight across the country and you'll have to transfer your
00:33:18,00:33:19,goods to new trains four different times.
00:33:19,00:33:20,"Oh, God!"
00:33:20,00:33:24,"It really explains where that saying comes from with New Zealand and Australia, and that's"
00:33:24,00:33:26,"the saying, ""It's difficult to gauge."""
00:33:26,00:33:27,That's what it is.
00:33:27,00:33:29,It comes from where I live.
00:33:29,00:33:30,Isn't that satisfying?
00:33:30,00:33:31,Now you know that.
00:33:31,00:33:32,Yeah.
00:33:32,00:33:33,Yeah.
00:33:33,00:33:40,Are you auditioning for a part in a children's transport show or something?
00:33:40,00:33:41,Always.
00:33:41,00:33:45,"Rhys, have you ever been on the New Zealand love trade?"
00:33:45,00:33:46,The love trade?
00:33:46,00:33:47,Yeah.
00:33:47,00:33:48,Not since the '80s.
00:33:48,00:33:49,Okay.
00:33:49,00:33:51,"Well, it's been going, I think, since then."
00:33:51,00:33:54,"This is, have you heard of a town on the South Island called Middlemarch?"
00:33:54,00:33:55,It's small.
00:33:55,00:33:57,Very vaguely.
00:33:57,00:33:59,"Population 186 is small, right?"
00:33:59,00:34:04,"But every two years, the population absolutely blooms for one night, which is when they have"
00:34:04,00:34:10,"the Middlemarch Ball and it's a singles ball, because often, you know, if you're on the"
00:34:10,00:34:14,"apps and the nearest match is 100 miles away, this is a problem."
00:34:14,00:34:17,"So every two years, they have a night where everyone gets the train down to Middlemarch"
00:34:17,00:34:22,"and there is a special love train put on full of, you know, excited young people wanting"
00:34:22,00:34:26,"to find love or certainly get off with someone that night, basically."
00:34:26,00:34:28,"And it's really, it sounds lovely, actually."
00:34:28,00:34:32,"And then the day after the ball, there's a shame train to take people home who didn't"
00:34:32,00:34:33,get the train home the night before.
00:34:33,00:34:35,I want to see this movie.
00:34:35,00:34:36,Yeah.
00:34:36,00:34:37,It sounds charming.
00:34:37,00:34:39,Can I just written The Guardian did a lovely report about it.
00:34:39,00:34:41,So this is the actual ball itself.
00:34:41,00:34:47,"On the dance floor, heels are cast aside as the heady crowd grind against one another."
00:34:47,00:34:53,Sliced hot meats and buttered bread are served in the makeshift kitchen and two worn sofas
00:34:53,00:34:57,placed beside the bain-marie grown under the weight of courting lovers.
00:34:57,00:34:58,Oh my goodness.
00:34:58,00:35:01,It's so disgusting as well as being innocent.
00:35:01,00:35:03,"It's really charming, I think."
00:35:03,00:35:04,It is.
00:35:04,00:35:07,"Although I think we all thought when you said sliced hot meats and buttered bread, that"
00:35:07,00:35:08,was there.
00:35:08,00:35:09,You've missed us for the men of the world.
00:35:09,00:35:12,"We were thinking of sexual things there, but I thought it was just me."
00:35:12,00:35:15,How could you know it wasn't?
00:35:15,00:35:16,That's amazing.
00:35:16,00:35:20,Please write in to tell us if you've ever met the love of your life or if you've had
00:35:20,00:35:23,"an embarrassing failure to meet the love of your life, buddy yet."
00:35:23,00:35:29,"So the main railway in New Zealand was built thanks to Julius Vogel, who's prime minister."
00:35:29,00:35:30,"Oh, yes."
00:35:30,00:35:32,I know the bread.
00:35:32,00:35:33,It's delicious.
00:35:33,00:35:34,Vogel's bread.
00:35:34,00:35:35,I've never heard of that.
00:35:35,00:35:36,Oh my goodness.
00:35:36,00:35:37,It's the best bread.
00:35:37,00:35:38,And they don't do it anymore in Waitrose.
00:35:38,00:35:41,"I'll talk after the podcast, but it's going off the market here."
00:35:41,00:35:42,You can still get it in New Zealand.
00:35:42,00:35:43,I'm going to move back here too.
00:35:43,00:35:46,Is it named after this Kiwi Prime Minister?
00:35:46,00:35:47,Must be.
00:35:47,00:35:48,One can only assume.
00:35:48,00:35:52,"Well, he also, as well as his bread reputation, he has a reputation as being the first New"
00:35:52,00:35:54,Zealand to write a science fiction novel.
00:35:54,00:35:55,Hey.
00:35:55,00:36:00,"Yeah, it was called Anno Domini 2000 or Woman's Destiny, and it was published in 1889, and"
00:36:00,00:36:05,it anticipated a utopian world where women held many positions of authority.
00:36:05,00:36:07,"Well, that is New Zealand."
00:36:07,00:36:11,"Yeah, because he also introduced the first women's suffrage bill to the New Zealand"
00:36:11,00:36:12,parliament.
00:36:12,00:36:13,"I was going to say they were the first country in the world, weren't they?"
00:36:13,00:36:18,"Now, he introduced a bill, and the bill didn't pass, and then he left parliament, and then"
00:36:18,00:36:19,it passed a few years later.
00:36:19,00:36:21,So he kind of started the ball roll.
00:36:21,00:36:22,That is cool.
00:36:22,00:36:27,"And had he written the sci-fi as a means of political change, saying this would be a good"
00:36:27,00:36:29,society to build?
00:36:29,00:36:32,He introduced the bill in 1887.
00:36:32,00:36:38,"The science fiction novel was published in 1889, and suffrage was granted in 1893."
00:36:38,00:36:39,So it was all happening around the system.
00:36:39,00:36:42,"So it's like he tried the political method, and if that had failed, so he thought, ""Right,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,what other tool do I have?
00:36:44,00:36:45,"Sci-fi."""
00:36:45,00:36:48,Sounds like he introduced the bill as a publicity stunt to sell more books than he knew he was
00:36:48,00:36:49,going to write.
00:36:49,00:36:50,It's very clever.
00:36:50,00:36:52,And that's the story of the first-ever women's suffrage.
00:36:52,00:36:53,Some bloke trying to flog some books.
00:36:53,00:36:55,That is really cool.
00:36:55,00:37:02,"The reason trains were needed in New Zealand was transport logs around, and it was mostly"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"these cow-ree trees, which are..."
00:37:04,00:37:05,How do you say it?
00:37:05,00:37:06,Cow-ree?
00:37:06,00:37:07,Cow-ree.
00:37:07,00:37:08,"Yeah, cow-ree."
00:37:08,00:37:09,Cow-ree.
00:37:09,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:12,"It's hard to roll my arse, but if you can, you can."
00:37:12,00:37:13,Yeah.
00:37:13,00:37:14,I have difficulty with it.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"Well, it was for cow-ree."
00:37:16,00:37:21,I felt like I was back in people's march for a second.
00:37:21,00:37:24,All the more!
00:37:24,00:37:29,Looks like sliced meat.
00:37:29,00:37:34,Logging industry was huge.
00:37:34,00:37:38,"The cow-ree trees used to cover basically all of New Zealand, now they cover almost none"
00:37:38,00:37:40,because they chop them all down.
00:37:40,00:37:41,Very sad.
00:37:41,00:37:45,"But they did this amazing thing, their way of transporting them before they got all the"
00:37:45,00:37:48,"trains up and running, were these things called cow-ree dams."
00:37:48,00:37:51,"So normally, you dump logs in a river and they could float downstream."
00:37:51,00:37:54,They can't when they're these tiny little weak streams.
00:37:54,00:37:55,And so...
00:37:55,00:37:58,We've got a lot of weak streams in New Zealand.
00:37:58,00:38:00,It's a shame.
00:38:00,00:38:01,Okay.
00:38:01,00:38:02,Yeah.
00:38:02,00:38:07,"They would build dams and they'd leave the dams for a year or more, a year, two years,"
00:38:07,00:38:09,and they'd just pile logs up behind the dam.
00:38:09,00:38:14,"And then one day, they'd come back and they could have up to 30,000 logs behind this dam"
00:38:14,00:38:20,"and they'd whip up this drawbridge and suddenly 30,000 logs will descend from the mountains"
00:38:20,00:38:22,in this giant waterfall.
00:38:22,00:38:23,Get out.
00:38:23,00:38:24,To the beach.
00:38:24,00:38:25,Isn't that amazing?
00:38:25,00:38:27,The beaches just transform.
00:38:27,00:38:29,"Suddenly, you've gone for a day out on the beach."
00:38:29,00:38:31,"Oh, my God."
00:38:31,00:38:35,You're frantically flogging the donkey or riding faster.
00:38:35,00:38:36,He's very old.
00:38:36,00:38:37,He goes slowly.
00:38:37,00:38:39,Look at the ice cream.
00:38:39,00:38:43,The Punch and Judy man is frantically rolling the canvas tight.
00:38:43,00:38:45,That is amazing.
00:38:45,00:38:46,Wow.
00:38:46,00:38:47,It's really cool.
00:38:47,00:38:48,That is stunning.
00:38:48,00:38:49,Yeah.
00:38:49,00:38:53,"Your fact, Andy, was about someone getting changed for a one-pound note."
00:38:53,00:38:54,Yes.
00:38:54,00:38:57,"And they didn't know where their currency is, the dollar."
00:38:57,00:38:58,Right.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Not in those days.
00:38:59,00:39:00,"Well, yes, exactly."
00:39:00,00:39:02,So it's interesting that they did have the pound.
00:39:02,00:39:03,Yeah.
00:39:03,00:39:06,"Until the dollar came in relatively recently, I think."
00:39:06,00:39:08,"That was one of the moments, I think, when they were right,"
00:39:08,00:39:10,"""Well, we're going to have our own currency."""
00:39:10,00:39:12,We'll still have the Queen on it.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"Which, you know."
00:39:14,00:39:16,"So when they decided to go for the dollar,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,it wasn't obvious that they would call it a New Zealand dollar.
00:39:19,00:39:22,"They could call anything because they're getting their own currency, right?"
00:39:22,00:39:24,They didn't want to be a pound anymore.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"And so they sent it to the public, basically,"
00:39:26,00:39:29,and had a public discussion of what should we call our coin.
00:39:29,00:39:31,A lot of people thought they'd call it the Kiwi.
00:39:31,00:39:32,"Oh, brilliant."
00:39:32,00:39:35,"The Zeal, as in New Zealand."
00:39:35,00:39:36,Nice.
00:39:36,00:39:37,I like the Zeal.
00:39:37,00:39:39,"The NZ, E-M-Z-E-D."
00:39:39,00:39:40,They almost called it the NZ.
00:39:40,00:39:41,"Oh, I like that as well."
00:39:41,00:39:43,"The Moa, the Zac, the Tui."
00:39:43,00:39:45,Those were all ideas to call it.
00:39:45,00:39:48,And then because I think Australia had just gone to the dollar
00:39:48,00:39:52,"relatively recently, they decided, ""Oh, yeah, we should probably do the same."""
00:39:52,00:39:54,You could have had the Tui.
00:39:54,00:39:55,Tui?
00:39:55,00:39:56,"Tui, T-U-I."
00:39:56,00:39:57,Is that a bird as well?
00:39:57,00:39:58,"It's a bird, yeah."
00:39:58,00:40:00,Didn't you do this with your flag as well a few years ago?
00:40:00,00:40:01,You had a flag referendum.
00:40:01,00:40:02,"Yes, we did."
00:40:02,00:40:04,"So we tend to do these things,"
00:40:04,00:40:06,"and it costs a lot of money,"
00:40:06,00:40:09,"and then everyone goes, ""Oh, no, I'll just keep with what we're talking."""
00:40:09,00:40:10,I think that's good.
00:40:10,00:40:12,I think it's good to experiment sometimes.
00:40:12,00:40:13,I think we could do with more of that here.
00:40:13,00:40:15,"Although where's New Zealand's something,"
00:40:15,00:40:18,something that's something of a spirit when it's naming stuff by public vote.
00:40:18,00:40:19,You seem to be lacking that.
00:40:19,00:40:20,Yeah.
00:40:20,00:40:22,Let's call something a really stupid name for the hell of it.
00:40:22,00:40:23,"Yeah, I think you're right."
00:40:23,00:40:26,"You actually get a lot of shit, I think, for your Air Force logo as well."
00:40:26,00:40:28,"In fact, to go back to Air Force is..."
00:40:28,00:40:30,"Oh, you were in the Air Force, weren't you, Ruth?"
00:40:30,00:40:32,"Well, for a little bit."
00:40:32,00:40:33,Yes.
00:40:33,00:40:35,Shall I put the different outfit on?
00:40:35,00:40:36,You know what your Air Force logo is?
00:40:36,00:40:37,"Yes, the Kiwi."
00:40:37,00:40:39,"This is the Kiwi, and everyone finds it very funny."
00:40:39,00:40:41,It's a flightless bird.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"But they worked hard over that,"
00:40:43,00:40:45,and they actually abandoned...
00:40:45,00:40:48,"It was a fern leaf before that, I think,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,"in the '50s and '60s,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,which people then pointed out was just a white fern leaf
00:40:52,00:40:53,"that looks like a white feather,"
00:40:53,00:40:55,which is basically a symbol for surrendering.
00:40:55,00:40:59,"Which is quite a funny idea, with your warplanes."
00:40:59,00:41:01,We just can't get it right.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"Can I tell you a really quick thing about rail,"
00:41:03,00:41:05,and railways?
00:41:05,00:41:09,When did the last horse work on British rail?
00:41:10,00:41:13,"Wait, so how did they work?"
00:41:13,00:41:15,They'd just been moving trains from one line to another.
00:41:15,00:41:17,"They're shunting, basically, shunting jobs."
00:41:17,00:41:19,"They were agile, they're cheap, obviously."
00:41:19,00:41:20,"They're good for these small jobs,"
00:41:20,00:41:22,"not for massive, great locomotives."
00:41:22,00:41:23,So they'd walk along the tracks?
00:41:23,00:41:24,"Pretty much, yeah, yeah."
00:41:24,00:41:25,"And there were shunting horses,"
00:41:25,00:41:26,and that's what they were doing.
00:41:26,00:41:29,"OK, I'm going to say there is currently a horse working in,"
00:41:29,00:41:33,and it sort of nibbles the plants at the edge of the track.
00:41:33,00:41:35,I wish that would be so good.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"No, they're not still in action."
00:41:39,00:41:41,"OK, 1750."
00:41:41,00:41:43,Thank you.
00:41:43,00:41:45,1967.
00:41:45,00:41:48,"So Charlie, the last British rail shunting horse,"
00:41:48,00:41:52,could have heard Sergeant Pepper while in work.
00:41:52,00:41:55,"What's a weird connection there,"
00:41:55,00:41:57,"is that Ringo Starr, of course,"
00:41:57,00:41:59,"is the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine,"
00:41:59,00:42:01,and what's Thomas the Tank Engine's job?
00:42:01,00:42:02,A shunting engine.
00:42:02,00:42:05,Thomas put the horses out of business.
00:42:05,00:42:07,"Lovely, that's superb connection."
00:42:07,00:42:08,There was debate in the early days
00:42:08,00:42:10,about whether horses or trains would be better.
00:42:10,00:42:12,"Do you remember the Rainhill Trials,"
00:42:12,00:42:15,"with this huge competition at Rainhill, where..."
00:42:15,00:42:16,Stevenson's Rocket won.
00:42:16,00:42:17,"Stevenson's Rocket won,"
00:42:17,00:42:18,but there were about five contenders.
00:42:18,00:42:19,"There was Stevenson's Rocket,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,"there were a few other actual trains,"
00:42:21,00:42:23,"and then there was Cycloped,"
00:42:23,00:42:24,"owned by a guy called Thomas Brandrith,"
00:42:24,00:42:26,which was a horse walking on a treadmill
00:42:26,00:42:27,"on top of a train,"
00:42:27,00:42:31,and it was withdrawn.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"The horse got the thing to five miles an hour,"
00:42:33,00:42:34,"and then the horse fell through the belt,"
00:42:34,00:42:36,"and it just did not, it just didn't work."
00:42:36,00:42:37,But it could have gone another way.
00:42:37,00:42:38,"Okay, sliced meat."
00:42:38,00:42:39,"Oh, God!"
00:42:39,00:42:48,"Okay, it is time for our final fact,"
00:42:48,00:42:49,and that is James.
00:42:49,00:42:53,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1936,"
00:42:53,00:42:58,a robot in California shot its inventor in the head.
00:42:58,00:43:00,So what would that have sounded like?
00:43:00,00:43:05,"Oh, no!"
00:43:06,00:43:11,"Very good California accent, though."
00:43:11,00:43:13,"That's the robot, that's the robot,"
00:43:13,00:43:14,repenting what it's done.
00:43:14,00:43:19,So I was looking for something else
00:43:19,00:43:20,"in the newspaper archives,"
00:43:20,00:43:23,and I just saw this as a tiny little article
00:43:23,00:43:27,"in the Buffalo News of the 15th of February, 1936."
00:43:27,00:43:28,Amazing.
00:43:28,00:43:29,"And I had no idea what it was about,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,"but then I've since done some more research,"
00:43:31,00:43:34,"and it was something called the Mechanical Man,"
00:43:34,00:43:37,"and it was a San Diego fair in 1936,"
00:43:37,00:43:39,"which was a big exposition,"
00:43:39,00:43:41,"and there was a guy called Henry C. May,"
00:43:41,00:43:43,"who was a British inventor,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,"and he toured it around America,"
00:43:45,00:43:48,and it was a six-foot giant steel robot
00:43:48,00:43:51,"that could stand up, sit down, smoke cigarettes,"
00:43:51,00:43:54,"fire a gun, and answer questions."
00:43:54,00:43:56,"And I'll be honest, I've seen some pictures,"
00:43:56,00:43:58,and I think it was a man in tin foil.
00:43:58,00:43:59,"Really, really?"
00:43:59,00:44:00,Was it really?
00:44:00,00:44:01,"I think, I can't really tell,"
00:44:01,00:44:04,but it looks like a Doctor Who buddy.
00:44:04,00:44:05,"Right, okay."
00:44:05,00:44:08,But I've seen this in a television show.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"I think it might be Penny Dreadful,"
00:44:10,00:44:12,"or one of those type of shows,"
00:44:12,00:44:14,"so there was a link to it,"
00:44:14,00:44:17,"and yeah, there really was this mechanical man"
00:44:17,00:44:19,"made many, many years ago."
00:44:19,00:44:20,It's incredible.
00:44:20,00:44:22,"But I think there was a lot of cheating, wasn't there?"
00:44:22,00:44:24,"Well, maybe they weren't suggesting"
00:44:24,00:44:26,"that it was operated properly, robotically,"
00:44:26,00:44:28,"but it seemed like a lot of them were people,"
00:44:28,00:44:29,which does suggest it was just a guy
00:44:29,00:44:33,with a vendetta against the maker inside.
00:44:33,00:44:35,"Apparently, 'cause he could answer questions."
00:44:35,00:44:37,"Someone asked the robot if he loved his wife,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,"and he replied, ""I have a heart of steel."
00:44:39,00:44:42,"""I don't love nobody, and nobody loves me."""
00:44:42,00:44:43,That's a guy in a suit.
00:44:43,00:44:46,That's a single guy in a suit.
00:44:46,00:44:48,When did the Wizard of Oz come out?
00:44:48,00:44:49,"Oh, '30s."
00:44:49,00:44:50,"'39, wasn't it?"
00:44:50,00:44:51,"Yeah, okay."
00:44:51,00:44:52,That's a good point.
00:44:52,00:44:55,"It could be the Tin Man, you know?"
00:44:55,00:44:56,The world's first robot.
00:44:56,00:44:58,"I love nobody, and nobody loves me."
00:44:58,00:44:59,He's looking for a heart.
00:44:59,00:45:00,He's looking for a heart.
00:45:00,00:45:01,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:45:01,00:45:02,It's all coming together.
00:45:02,00:45:03,It's all coming together.
00:45:03,00:45:04,"It's actually a documentary, it turns out."
00:45:04,00:45:05,"Can I check, James?"
00:45:05,00:45:07,"Did the inventor who was shot the head,"
00:45:07,00:45:08,was he all right?
00:45:08,00:45:09,"He was fine, yeah."
00:45:09,00:45:13,"So, there was an article in The New York Times."
00:45:13,00:45:14,"Again, a very small article."
00:45:14,00:45:16,"It said, ""The robot showed more aptitude"
00:45:16,00:45:18,"""than Henry C. May expected,"""
00:45:18,00:45:20,"and he shot him in the head,"
00:45:20,00:45:22,"but then it says, ""He will recover."""
00:45:22,00:45:23,And then there's no more mention of him
00:45:23,00:45:24,"in any of the newspapers,"
00:45:24,00:45:25,"but I assume he must have recovered,"
00:45:25,00:45:27,otherwise it would have been in there.
00:45:27,00:45:29,"They underplayed news in those days, didn't they?"
00:45:29,00:45:32,"Yeah, but this was a big exposition"
00:45:32,00:45:34,in San Diego Fair.
00:45:34,00:45:37,"Other things they had there was the Gold Gulch,"
00:45:37,00:45:39,"which was like one of the first frontier villages,"
00:45:39,00:45:41,like a fake Wild West village.
00:45:41,00:45:42,"Oh, cool."
00:45:42,00:45:45,"They had the Zorro Garden nudist colony,"
00:45:45,00:45:47,which was basically a load of naked women
00:45:47,00:45:48,"and a few naked men,"
00:45:48,00:45:51,which you could pay 25 cents to look at.
00:45:51,00:45:53,I thought an exposition was for scientific stuff.
00:45:53,00:45:55,"I thought it was like we've got a new kind of toaster,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,"and you're telling me there's just the nudist village,"
00:45:57,00:45:59,which I could pay a quarter and go and look at.
00:45:59,00:46:02,"The nudist one, honestly, the nudist one was really bad"
00:46:02,00:46:06,because basically actual local nudists were really upset.
00:46:06,00:46:08,"They were the ones who were the most upset,"
00:46:08,00:46:09,"because they were like, ""You've got showgirls in,"""
00:46:09,00:46:11,instead of getting actual nudists in.
00:46:11,00:46:13,"Right, and that would be paid top dollar too."
00:46:13,00:46:15,And there was complaints to the council
00:46:15,00:46:18,"from the San Diego Council of Catholic Women,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,"the Women's Civic Centre,"
00:46:20,00:46:22,and the San Diego Braille Club.
00:46:22,00:46:25,[laughter]
00:46:25,00:46:26,I can't find any reason.
00:46:26,00:46:27,About the nudism.
00:46:27,00:46:28,"Is that because you weren't allowed to touch them,"
00:46:28,00:46:30,and so it's sort of discriminating against blind people?
00:46:30,00:46:32,I need to know that they're nude.
00:46:32,00:46:34,"I'm coming through now, I'm blind,"
00:46:34,00:46:36,but let me have a feel.
00:46:36,00:46:38,"Oh, that's not a proper nudist."
00:46:38,00:46:41,And you can keep the rest of this panini.
00:46:41,00:46:42,[laughter]
00:46:42,00:46:44,It's not a panini!
00:46:44,00:46:46,Get your hands off.
00:46:46,00:46:47,[laughter]
00:46:47,00:46:50,"So anyway, that's the story of the San Diego Fair."
00:46:50,00:46:52,That was forever in 1936.
00:46:52,00:46:53,"I think there was a sequel to this,"
00:46:53,00:46:55,"who became this big celebrity robot,"
00:46:55,00:46:57,"because there was a few years later,"
00:46:57,00:47:00,"there was the World's Fair in 1939 in New York,"
00:47:00,00:47:03,"and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation paraded Electro,"
00:47:03,00:47:06,who again was a talking cigarette smoking robot.
00:47:06,00:47:08,Cigarette smoking seemed to be the main thing
00:47:08,00:47:10,people wanted from their robots in those days.
00:47:10,00:47:12,"The back of the day was the main hobby, wasn't it?"
00:47:12,00:47:13,"It was, yeah."
00:47:13,00:47:16,And he again seemed to be operated by people behind a curtain.
00:47:16,00:47:18,But all robots are.
00:47:18,00:47:20,"Oh, even today."
00:47:20,00:47:23,"Even today, when you think of Musk"
00:47:23,00:47:25,"and what he's trying to do and what have you,"
00:47:25,00:47:27,there's always someone hidden behind the curtain
00:47:27,00:47:29,with a radio control device.
00:47:29,00:47:31,Is that with every self-driving car?
00:47:31,00:47:33,Musk has employed a person with a remote control somewhere.
00:47:33,00:47:35,There's a teenager in the boot.
00:47:35,00:47:36,[laughter]
00:47:36,00:47:37,"Yeah, you can have a look."
00:47:37,00:47:39,"Now they get paid a lot of money,"
00:47:39,00:47:40,"and they've got a t-shirt on,"
00:47:40,00:47:42,and they've got little tiny controls.
00:47:42,00:47:44,They like being in small dark rooms.
00:47:44,00:47:46,"The celebrity robot, 1939,"
00:47:46,00:47:48,"went on to star in a film called Sex Kittens Go to College,"
00:47:48,00:47:50,which I just wondered if any of you guys would see.
00:47:50,00:47:51,"Oh, I love that one."
00:47:51,00:47:53,"Mmm, I thought it might be you."
00:47:53,00:47:56,"Because its career sort of ended after 1939,"
00:47:56,00:47:58,and we did a little bit of a world tour.
00:47:58,00:47:59,Was there anything going on in 1939
00:47:59,00:48:00,which might have made it less important
00:48:00,00:48:02,to see a cigarette smoking robot?
00:48:02,00:48:04,[laughter]
00:48:04,00:48:07,"I saw the sequel, Sex Kittens Go to the Frontline."
00:48:07,00:48:10,[laughter]
00:48:10,00:48:13,Demon sex kittens struggle to adjust to post-war life.
00:48:13,00:48:15,"Very sad, very sad one there."
00:48:15,00:48:17,[laughter]
00:48:17,00:48:19,I don't know until you've watched it.
00:48:19,00:48:20,It sounds really good.
00:48:20,00:48:22,So this is 1960.
00:48:22,00:48:24,"Suddenly this robot became a celebrity again,"
00:48:24,00:48:26,"starred in a film, Sex Kittens Go to College,"
00:48:26,00:48:29,where he advises the college to hire this genius
00:48:29,00:48:32,as a science professor who turns out to be a stripper.
00:48:32,00:48:35,And then there's lots of stripping scenes.
00:48:35,00:48:37,But that's just the great career of the world's
00:48:37,00:48:39,first ever celebrity robot.
00:48:39,00:48:41,"Rhys, do you ever drive in autonomous cars?"
00:48:41,00:48:43,Have you got an autonomous cab anywhere?
00:48:43,00:48:44,Things like that.
00:48:44,00:48:45,I've seen a lot of them.
00:48:45,00:48:47,I was almost hit by one.
00:48:47,00:48:48,Really?
00:48:48,00:48:50,"Yeah, I was pulling out of the car park in my car,"
00:48:50,00:48:52,"and you know, when you go out,"
00:48:52,00:48:54,"you sort of go a little bit too far out into the road,"
00:48:54,00:48:56,"and in this oncoming traffic,"
00:48:56,00:48:58,"you think, ""I better pull back in a bit."""
00:48:58,00:49:00,"Well, the oncoming traffic was the Waymo."
00:49:00,00:49:02,And so I put into reverse and go back a little bit
00:49:02,00:49:04,because my nose was sticking out.
00:49:04,00:49:06,"And then, just as I did it,"
00:49:06,00:49:09,"the Waymo straight past me,"
00:49:09,00:49:11,it didn't alter its path at all.
00:49:11,00:49:13,"And I said, ""If it was a human,"
00:49:13,00:49:15,"you would have actually altered your path."""
00:49:15,00:49:17,"Yeah, you just nod to bear."
00:49:17,00:49:20,A bit of shove and a bit of give or whatever.
00:49:20,00:49:22,"But this one, as soon as I reversed back,"
00:49:22,00:49:24,"and I thought to myself,"
00:49:24,00:49:27,"""Well, if I hadn't have pulled my nose in a little bit there,"
00:49:27,00:49:28,"would it have hit me?"""
00:49:28,00:49:30,"That's weird, because that is like a legit way"
00:49:30,00:49:31,"to get out of a junction, isn't it?"
00:49:31,00:49:32,"You just edge a little bit,"
00:49:32,00:49:33,"and hopefully someone will notice you,"
00:49:33,00:49:34,and they'll stop for you.
00:49:34,00:49:35,"Yeah, they'll slow down."
00:49:35,00:49:36,You peep and creep.
00:49:36,00:49:37,Yeah.
00:49:37,00:49:40,That's what I'm doing on the love train.
00:49:40,00:49:46,I'm up in the luggage compartment.
00:49:46,00:49:50,"No, but this is..."
00:49:50,00:49:52,"Because that's one area where there's loads of progress, isn't there?"
00:49:52,00:49:53,Or certainly people have...
00:49:53,00:49:55,"I mean, I know Elon Musk has been predicting"
00:49:55,00:49:57,full self-driving for like 15 years.
00:49:57,00:49:58,He said we'll have it next year.
00:49:58,00:49:59,"Yeah, he's raving on about them."
00:49:59,00:50:00,They are on the way.
00:50:00,00:50:01,"I just mentioned this,"
00:50:01,00:50:02,"because Kawasaki at the moment,"
00:50:02,00:50:03,there are lots of...
00:50:03,00:50:04,Should robots look like humans?
00:50:04,00:50:05,It's a big debate.
00:50:05,00:50:07,Is a bipedal humanoid figure
00:50:07,00:50:09,the most efficient use for a robot?
00:50:09,00:50:11,"No, normally no, obviously."
00:50:11,00:50:14,But Kawasaki are working on a robo-horse.
00:50:14,00:50:15,"Oh, I've seen this, too."
00:50:15,00:50:16,It sounds so good.
00:50:16,00:50:18,"It's a motorbike with legs, basically."
00:50:18,00:50:20,"Yes, it's called Corleone."
00:50:20,00:50:21,Really?
00:50:21,00:50:22,"Which I think is weird,"
00:50:22,00:50:24,"because Corleone is the first letter of Corleone,"
00:50:24,00:50:25,"which is the family of the godfather,"
00:50:25,00:50:27,"which does feature a horse, right?"
00:50:27,00:50:28,Head of one.
00:50:28,00:50:29,"Head of one, yeah."
00:50:29,00:50:31,"But they're developing sensors,"
00:50:31,00:50:33,so hopefully it'll respond to you just like a horse does.
00:50:33,00:50:35,"As in you're moving your body around,"
00:50:35,00:50:36,"you know, you're digging in with your heels,"
00:50:36,00:50:38,"or you're bouncing up and down,"
00:50:38,00:50:39,or you're literally...
00:50:39,00:50:40,Or you're squeezing your thighs.
00:50:40,00:50:42,"I don't write horses, but whatever."
00:50:42,00:50:43,Clearly.
00:50:43,00:50:46,That would be pretty cool.
00:50:46,00:50:48,I think a robotic horse would be awesome.
00:50:48,00:50:51,"Yes, and I've seen videos of these."
00:50:51,00:50:53,"There must be a prototype out there,"
00:50:53,00:50:55,"and terrain-wise,"
00:50:55,00:50:58,they can do the same things that an animal could.
00:50:58,00:50:59,"Better than wheels,"
00:50:59,00:51:02,and I think that's where we're getting with.
00:51:02,00:51:04,But do they look like they're walking properly?
00:51:04,00:51:06,Because we've tried to make humanoid robots
00:51:06,00:51:08,"look like they walk properly, and they still don't."
00:51:08,00:51:09,They're getting pretty close now.
00:51:09,00:51:12,"I've seen the one that claims to be closest,"
00:51:12,00:51:13,and I still think it looks...
00:51:13,00:51:17,"It now looks like a very elderly, shuffling person."
00:51:17,00:51:21,I met the first robot that could run by Peter-1.
00:51:21,00:51:22,You remember that?
00:51:22,00:51:23,"It wasn't programmed to run,"
00:51:23,00:51:25,"but it saw you coming, didn't it?"
00:51:25,00:51:28,I stopped offering it at Russian chocolate.
00:51:28,00:51:31,What was it called?
00:51:31,00:51:33,It was the Honda one.
00:51:33,00:51:35,"Yeah, he was guest on QI."
00:51:35,00:51:37,"He was guest on QI, and I danced with him."
00:51:37,00:51:38,I remember.
00:51:38,00:51:41,"And he did look like the most human one there, actually."
00:51:41,00:51:42,"But yeah, then he ran,"
00:51:42,00:51:43,"and that was at the time,"
00:51:43,00:51:45,"which could only have been 15 years ago,"
00:51:45,00:51:48,"12 years ago, that was the biggest thing in robotics,"
00:51:48,00:51:50,but now it's crazy.
00:51:50,00:51:53,I don't think that has been left behind that much.
00:51:53,00:51:54,"And again, doing basic tasks,"
00:51:54,00:51:56,like Google DeepMind did a big brag last year
00:51:56,00:51:58,about how it's got a robot to tie a shoelace
00:51:58,00:52:00,for the first time ever.
00:52:00,00:52:03,"And it's two massive arms,"
00:52:03,00:52:05,"incredibly ungainly and incredibly slowly,"
00:52:05,00:52:07,only doing the bow bit.
00:52:07,00:52:08,"Anna, Anna."
00:52:08,00:52:10,"As soon as they can tie our shoelaces together,"
00:52:10,00:52:12,that's where they could take over the world.
00:52:12,00:52:13,Exactly.
00:52:13,00:52:14,Then they'll be able to make nooses.
00:52:14,00:52:16,"And do you know what they're going to use those for, Anna?"
00:52:16,00:52:17,"Us, right?"
00:52:17,00:52:19,"Rhys, do you think we're all doomed?"
00:52:19,00:52:20,Yes.
00:52:20,00:52:22,"When robots are ready to go,"
00:52:22,00:52:24,and this is what my show is actually about.
00:52:24,00:52:25,"I'm touring here in the UK,"
00:52:25,00:52:27,and my show is about the demise of humanity
00:52:27,00:52:29,"because of AI and robotics,"
00:52:29,00:52:31,and how can we stop it?
00:52:31,00:52:34,And why does AI have to be in the creative world?
00:52:34,00:52:36,Can we please not have it?
00:52:36,00:52:39,"Because once it takes all of our creative jobs away from us,"
00:52:39,00:52:40,what are we doing?
00:52:40,00:52:43,"And that was written by chatGPT that show, was it?"
00:52:43,00:52:47,"No, I've had a couple of goes with chatGPT,"
00:52:47,00:52:49,and we just don't get on.
00:52:49,00:52:52,"Who doesn't like whom, though?"
00:52:52,00:52:54,"Oh, I don't think it likes me."
00:52:54,00:52:57,"During my favourite AI, if we can call it AI,"
00:52:57,00:53:00,"it was invented by the AI pioneer who sounds awesome,"
00:53:00,00:53:04,"Marvin Minsky, and he was around in the 1950s."
00:53:04,00:53:08,"He went to MIT, and actually his boss said when he joined MIT,"
00:53:08,00:53:11,don't work on anything that's going to take less than 30 years.
00:53:11,00:53:13,"We're playing the long game here,"
00:53:13,00:53:15,which is a dreamy thing for a boss to say.
00:53:15,00:53:17,"So he had to have something to entertain him,"
00:53:17,00:53:18,"little projects on the side,"
00:53:18,00:53:21,"so he invented this thing called the useless machine,"
00:53:21,00:53:23,"and it was a robot capable of doing one thing,"
00:53:23,00:53:25,"which was that if you turned it on,"
00:53:25,00:53:28,it ejected its hand out and turned itself off again.
00:53:28,00:53:29,Wow.
00:53:29,00:53:30,Isn't that so great?
00:53:30,00:53:31,I love that.
00:53:31,00:53:33,What happens if it stops working?
00:53:33,00:53:35,You usually have to turn it off and turn it back on again.
00:53:35,00:53:40,"Just while we're on this fact,"
00:53:40,00:53:42,"Robot in California shooting its eventa,"
00:53:42,00:53:45,there's a Wikipedia page of unusual deaths
00:53:45,00:53:48,"in the 20th century, and it's stunning."
00:53:48,00:53:49,"Oh, really?"
00:53:49,00:53:50,It's so good.
00:53:50,00:53:52,"OK, R. Stanton Walker, right?"
00:53:52,00:53:53,Yeah.
00:53:53,00:53:56,"In 1902, he was watching a baseball game with friends,"
00:53:56,00:53:59,"and a ball, a foul ball, hit him in the hand."
00:53:59,00:54:02,"Unfortunately, he's halfway through passing his friend a knife,"
00:54:02,00:54:06,"a large and sharp one, which then is driven into his chest,"
00:54:06,00:54:07,and he dies within a few minutes.
00:54:07,00:54:09,"I mean, this is final destination, isn't it?"
00:54:09,00:54:10,"It is, isn't it?"
00:54:10,00:54:11,Yeah.
00:54:11,00:54:13,"The designer and builder of the first ever offshore lighthouse,"
00:54:13,00:54:14,Henry Wyn Stanley.
00:54:14,00:54:15,"Oh, this is a little longer ago,"
00:54:15,00:54:17,so comedy is more acceptable about it.
00:54:17,00:54:19,"1698, he builds it."
00:54:19,00:54:20,"It's offshore in Devon, right?"
00:54:20,00:54:21,Mm-hmm.
00:54:21,00:54:24,"It's a very wild bit of coast, the Eddystone rocks."
00:54:24,00:54:26,He says it's going to survive the greatest storm
00:54:26,00:54:27,that could ever be.
00:54:27,00:54:31,"Five years later, he is inside it for the great storm of 1703."
00:54:31,00:54:33,"He has never found, neither has the lighthouse."
00:54:33,00:54:36,It just disappears into the sea.
00:54:36,00:54:37,"I know, tragic."
00:54:37,00:54:39,Do they have Robbie Williams in there?
00:54:39,00:54:41,Because I'm pretty sure Robbie Williams is the name
00:54:41,00:54:43,of the first person to be killed by a robot.
00:54:43,00:54:45,I didn't find him.
00:54:45,00:54:46,"I mean, it's a long old list."
00:54:46,00:54:49,"This is from memory, but I think he was working in a factory"
00:54:49,00:54:52,that had robotics there and something tragic happens.
00:54:52,00:54:53,"Yeah, in the '70s."
00:54:53,00:54:55,"Yeah, it was like something that built cars,"
00:54:55,00:54:56,that kind of thing.
00:54:56,00:54:58,It was the arm of a machine that whipped him.
00:54:58,00:54:59,"Yeah, yeah."
00:54:59,00:55:00,"But he was called Robbie Williams, so..."
00:55:00,00:55:02,"No, he's loving angels instead."
00:55:02,00:55:10,That is all of our facts for this week.
00:55:10,00:55:12,Thank you so much for listening.
