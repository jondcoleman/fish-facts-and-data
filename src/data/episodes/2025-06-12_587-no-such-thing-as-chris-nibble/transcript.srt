00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,260
 Hello everyone and welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,560
 Now why am I talking to you before the show starts?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,080
 Well, of course it is because one of us is away this week and it is Dan Schreiber.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,880
 So in his place we have gotten the most Dan Schreiber person we can.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,280
 In fact, the most Dan Schreiber person in the entirety of the world.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,200
 Arguably more Dan Schreiber than Dan Schreiber himself.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,680
 It is the wonderful, incredible, you'll know him from Flight of the Concords, Tumanji,

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,600
 our flag means death, of course it is Rhys Darby.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,240
 Now we always love to see Rhys when he's in town and we are so lucky that he is currently

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,640
 on tour in the UK and that means that as well as enjoying him on our podcast, you can go

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,960
 and see his show.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,440
 So if you are listening to this on the day it goes out, then quick go to the internet

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,280
 and get tickets to his show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,040
 And if you live in Brighton Sheffield, St Albans Leeds, Swindon, Exeter, Bristol, Newcastle,

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,720
 Glasgow, Manchester or Edinburgh, then you are also in luck because he is yet to do your

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
 cities.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,880
 If you want to get tickets for that, you must go to RhysDarby.com, that's R-H-Y-S-D-A-R-B-Y

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,120
 .com, all of the information, all of the tickets are available on there.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,640
 But for now, please enjoy the fabulous Tour de Force, that is Rhys Darby.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,240
 Okay, on with the podcast.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:42,480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,480
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,980
 My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,400
 and the inimitable Rhys Darby, who has joined us in place of Dan Shriver today.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,920
 So without further ado, we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,900
 from the last seven days in no particular order.

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,900
 Here we go.

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,400
 Rhys, what's your fact?

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,560
 Well, and thank you for having me.

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
 Hi everyone.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,440
 How are you?

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,160
 Good.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,200
 The most highly decorated Soviet Air Unit of World War II didn't take part in the victory

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,620
 parade because their planes were too slow.

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,620
 Wow.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,460
 Can you tell us more, why would a slow plane be useful in a war anyway?

37
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,660
 Well, funny you should ask.

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,100
 Do I now dive into the...

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,100
 Dive in.

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
 [Music]

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
 Mosquito.

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
 Yes.

43
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
 But what type?

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,100
 The plane.

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,100
 The plane, the Mosquito.

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,100
 No, no, no.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:55,640
 It was, in fact, a South Pacific Mosquito and that was its last flight before I killed

48
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
 it.

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,140
 Right, but back to the...

50
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,140
 Cool.

51
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,160
 So basically, this is the story of a unit that was in Russia during World War II, the

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:12,080
 Night Bomber Regiment, entirely made up of females, with ground crew and the air crew,

53
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,500
 and they flew very old biplanes called the Polikropov or the Po-2, very old planes made

54
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
 of wood.

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 Wow.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
 And they were super slow.

57
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,700
 They were slow, I think, because they were old planes.

58
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,100
 They were old crop dusters, weren't they?

59
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,180
 Yes, that's right.

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,660
 They were amazingly slow, like top speed 90 miles an hour.

61
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,660
 Yeah.

62
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,660
 That is slow.

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,360
 I drove faster than that, and my way's a nursery today.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 Okay.

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,160
 It is a 20-mile-an-hour zone.

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,080
 Yeah, but the idea was, because they were so old and made of wood, they were really

67
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,080
 quiet, and so they could kind of get under the radar a little bit and do lots of bombing

68
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
 raids one after the other.

69
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,920
 And they were known as the witches, right?

70
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
 Yes.

71
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
 And do we know why they were called witches?

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
 Night witches.

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
 They were witches.

74
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
 They were witches.

75
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
 It was no two ways about it.

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,220
 They've got some great pictures here of them.

77
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
 Yeah.

78
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,220
 Poetry hearts.

79
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,220
 Yeah.

80
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,260
 They had spells and all sorts of stuff, so it was quite amazing.

81
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,460
 But yeah, but because they turned their engines off from their planes, and they did this so

82
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,420
 that they would come in silently, and so just to give you an impression of that one coming

83
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,420
 in.

84
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:46,280
 And then they would literally just drop bombs, and I don't know when they started their planes

85
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
 up again.

86
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:57,380
 Like they just passed the bombing zone, you know, and then sort of back they fly.

87
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,900
 So yeah, so just to reiterate, I think the Germans felt that they sounded like witches

88
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,940
 on broomsticks coming in and just, you know, dropping bombs.

89
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
 Swishing away.

90
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,640
 And let's not forget Marina Ruskova, Ruskova, the lead person in this group.

91
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,160
 She had to really campaign to get it all happening.

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,880
 Obviously, it was mainly men involved in the battles back then.

93
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,140
 And you know, this is when Operation Barbarossa was on.

94
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,440
 So this was the entire German army literally trying to take over Russia.

95
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,760
 A very bold move, as we all know.

96
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
 How to play out.

97
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,420
 It didn't quite work, but it did look good at the beginning.

98
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,640
 So there was like over three million German troops.

99
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,360
 They had, I think, three brigades, they had so many armoured divisions.

100
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,800
 And there was really no opposition for a while.

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,960
 They really were making a lot of ground.

102
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,080
 And then it was a massive call up for the Russians to defend their land.

103
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,320
 And the women as well were like, well, we want to help, you know, we're strong.

104
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
 Let's grab guns.

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
 Let's go.

106
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,200
 It was the whole family, all family in, you know.

107
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,680
 And then so this particular woman, Marina Roscova, she ended up really sort of...

108
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
 She recruited, didn't she?

109
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
 She recruited a lot.

110
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,160
 I think over a thousand women and did the training and, you know, sort of formulate.

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,000
 But she also persuaded Stalin, and an element that's often smooth though, for I feel, in

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,960
 the great stories of how heroic they were, which they were, is the fact that she was

113
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,720
 quite good mates with Stalin, which is how she managed to make happen.

114
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
 But it's OK.

115
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
 We didn't know a lot of what we knew now.

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
 It's the foot in the door.

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
 You've got to get your foot in the door, right?

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,080
 She knew Stalin because she was one of the most famous women in Russia.

119
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
 Yeah.

120
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,440
 She was an aviatrix, and she and her team had the world record for the longest continuous

121
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
 flight.

122
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,680
 And she was like a hero of the whole country.

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,940
 And so when she came to say, I want my women to take part in the war, Stalin was not going

124
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,520
 to say no to her because she was so big.

125
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,160
 But did say no to the equipment, like you're not having our planes.

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,520
 These modern vehicles are not for you guys, ladies.

127
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,240
 And so this is how it all sort of came together, is that they got the planes that were left

128
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 that no one wanted.

129
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
 By planes?

130
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
 Yeah.

131
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
 It's crazy.

132
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
 I didn't think by planes flew in the Second World War.

133
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
 I'm certainly not in combat.

134
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,080
 But just can we quickly say about her earlier flight, where she was the navigator for this

135
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,800
 cross Soviet Union journey, right?

136
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,360
 And it was 4,000 miles.

137
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,320
 And as they were getting towards the end, there are two versions of the story.

138
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,920
 One is that the plane was icing up and they threw everything out to try and maintain height.

139
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,680
 And then she decided, it's not going to be enough, I'm going to have to throw myself

140
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
 out of the plane.

141
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 Wow.

142
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 And she did.

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 That's the final straw.

144
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,200
 There are two pilots in her, the navigator.

145
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,700
 Surely they had clothing first.

146
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,640
 These hippie boots have got to go.

147
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,880
 But I don't think she was naked when she jumped out.

148
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,720
 She wasn't naked because it was so cold, so she wanted a bit of protection.

149
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,640
 But they'd thrown everything else out, like up to and including the compass, I think, as

150
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,120
 then she thought, my navigating job is done, so like we're very nearly there.

151
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
 But so that's one version.

152
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,080
 The other story is that they couldn't find the airfield and the navigator's cockpit

153
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
 had no protection.

154
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,880
 Either way, she did jump out of the plane shortly before the end and she had no food

155
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
 or water for 10 days.

156
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,000
 Eventually a hunter discovered her and that sort of cemented her heroics.

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,280
 Can we just go back a little bit to her jumping out of the plane?

158
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
 Did she have a parachute?

159
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
 Yes, she did.

160
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
 Did she?

161
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
 She parachuted, yes.

162
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,720
 Because actually the night witches didn't have parachutes, did they?

163
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,840
 No, they didn't.

164
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,160
 Just on this, another thing, sorry, I'm telling you, the oft reported negative spin of the

165
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,240
 night witches, but you don't get very often.

166
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,280
 But you know in that thing where these three women crash landed basically.

167
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 Right.

168
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
 So they were all lost.

169
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,360
 She was lost for 10 days, the other two were lost for a couple of days.

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,240
 I think she had a bar and a half of chocolate to survive on for 10 days, which I really want

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,000
 to know why I'm in the other half.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,640
 Well, if you also, if you've ever had to sell be a chocolate, it is utterly disgusting.

173
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
 Wow.

174
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
 Maybe it was better in the 1940s.

175
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
 I suspect not.

176
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,520
 All I'm saying is you don't scoff it in the first moment, like if it was a Mars bar, you'd

177
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
 be like, oh, delicious.

178
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
 Yeah.

179
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
 No, you wouldn't.

180
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
 I see.

181
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
 Maybe that's part of the ploy.

182
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
 You can survive longer.

183
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
 The opposite of savoring it.

184
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
 Yeah.

185
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,360
 But there was a rescue mission sent out to save these three women and 16 men died.

186
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
 Yeah.

187
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,320
 But there were huge celebrations afterwards because they'd broken this record.

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,720
 And I think Stalin thought, you know what, it's going to dampen the vibe if we mention

189
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,040
 the fact that 16 men have been killed.

190
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,240
 Can I just also say it wasn't like one man would go and look for them.

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
 He would die.

192
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,760
 And then another person would go out.

193
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
 They all died in the plane crash.

194
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
 Yeah.

195
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
 It wasn't like a scream.

196
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,960
 Shall I go and see what he's doing back there?

197
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
 Someone's knocking them all off.

198
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,440
 I'm not going to go and have a look.

199
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
 You're next.

200
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
 Well, yeah.

201
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,800
 And then Raskova, she got the first ever state funeral, I think, in any country in World

202
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
 War II.

203
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
 Definitely the first one in Moscow.

204
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,680
 There'd been none in Britain, none in Germany, none in America, obviously at that stage.

205
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,800
 Well, yeah, when she died, her ashes were placed in the Kremlin walls and they're still there

206
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 today.

207
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
 Wow.

208
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
 Cool.

209
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,680
 It's mad thinking about these incredibly old slow planes that were being flown into combat

210
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,600
 because they had to go at night because, not because they were loud, because they were

211
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
 slow.

212
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
 That's it.

213
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,400
 But the advantage was, I think, if the Luftwaffe were chasing them or trying to shoot them down,

214
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,880
 if the Luftwaffe flew at 90 miles an hour, they would stall.

215
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,480
 Because their planes were too good to catch.

216
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,480
 So in a sense, they had an unfair advantage to the night, which is all I'm saying.

217
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,000
 And they did it at night because that was the time to do the bombing.

218
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,560
 So there was no rest for the Germans because during the night, they would fix their stuff

219
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,080
 and they'd be being bombed so they couldn't.

220
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
 So it was relentless.

221
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
 Yeah.

222
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,360
 They weren't the only female pilots in the war, though, because I think in Britain there

223
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,280
 was the ATA, the Air Transport Auxiliary, and that was mostly male pilots, but there

224
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,440
 was a sizable chunk of them who were women.

225
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,720
 And their job was to get planes from factories to airfields and things like that.

226
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 Right.

227
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
 By flying them.

228
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
 By flying them, exactly.

229
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,240
 And it would test them at the same time, I guess.

230
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
 Well, they had to know so many different kinds of planes, basically.

231
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
 I think these women were amazing.

232
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,560
 So for example, Dolores Mogridge, an incredible name of the kind I think you don't really

233
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,600
 get anymore, she flew 83 different types of plane during the war.

234
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,720
 And she was once the subject of a complaint by a male RAF officer.

235
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
 He complained, "It was dreadful weather and I can't believe not only was a woman flying

236
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,320
 me here, but she was reading a book."

237
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
 Wow.

238
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,600
 And when he wasn't reading a novel, those are my notes, "I hadn't flown this type

239
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 of plane before."

240
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,920
 And he nearly threw up when he read it.

241
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
 Amazing.

242
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
 Just lovely.

243
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,280
 The other thing they had to do was, as well as flying planes too, at the airfield from

244
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,120
 which they'd fly into combat, they had to fly the planes back when they were damaged.

245
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,120
 So they'd have an attack plane, no undercarriage, wing missing, and then the men would be like,

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
 "Fly there, Peck!

247
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
 Will you love?"

248
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
 Yes.

249
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
 It's got no wings.

250
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
 You'll be right.

251
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
 You'll figure it out.

252
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
 That's amazing.

253
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,480
 Yeah, that's so cool.

254
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
 The last of them only died in 2022.

255
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
 It's crazy.

256
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 I mean, a lot of them lived really long lives.

257
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,240
 Yeah, Stella Edwards, I think, was the last surviving ATA girl, as they got called.

258
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,160
 Well, you know, the night witches are all still alive, even the one who had the state

259
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
 funeral.

260
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
 Yeah, I think so.

261
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,880
 She was the first to come back to life.

262
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,520
 Do you know the country which has the highest proportion of female pilots?

263
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
 Russia.

264
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
 No.

265
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
 Oh, I'm not talking about the...

266
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
 No, sorry.

267
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,640
 These days, commercial pilots.

268
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,440
 I don't think it's very guessable.

269
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
 Oh, okay.

270
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
 I'm going to have a go.

271
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
 Rwanda.

272
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
 It's not Rwanda.

273
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
 Ireland.

274
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
 It's not Ireland.

275
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
 That's close, though.

276
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
 Oh.

277
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
 Northern Ireland.

278
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
 No, India.

279
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
 Oh.

280
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
 Sorry.

281
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
 When I say close, I mean close alphabetically.

282
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 That's very close alphabetically, isn't it?

283
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
 Yeah.

284
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
 That's almost bulls-eye-eye.

285
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
 Well done.

286
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
 Thank you.

287
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
 My bad for not thinking alphabetically, too.

288
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 Silly me.

289
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,760
 I remember when we flew to Australia, and we'd only be going for an hour or so, and

290
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
 I said, "Are we close?"

291
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
 And you said, "Yeah, we're over Austria."

292
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,560
 We got railier to go.

293
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
 India.

294
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,640
 That's amazing.

295
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,200
 13% of pilots are women, isn't it?

296
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 That's interesting.

297
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,560
 Global average is about 5%.

298
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,200
 You know Douglas Bader, Bader?

299
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
 Oh, yeah.

300
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 No legs.

301
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 Pilot.

302
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 But dreamy guy.

303
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 Dreamy trying ace.

304
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
 Oh, yes.

305
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,080
 He's famous, because he had no legs.

306
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:15,840
 So there was a guy called Alexi Mariseev, who was a Russian guy, and he was in a crash.

307
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,560
 And like this woman, Raskova, he had to walk around Siberia, living on a handful of ants

308
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,320
 and half a lizard, he said.

309
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,680
 It's still better than this Soviet chocolate bar.

310
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,720
 Yeah, when they found him, he had 10 chocolate bars in his pocket.

311
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,600
 He was desperately hunting for another ant.

312
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 But he had really bad frostbitten legs, and he had to have them chopped off.

313
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,920
 He then went on and carried on fighting in dog fights and became a national hero.

314
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,680
 So Russia had its own Douglas Bader.

315
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,000
 And Germany, Hans Ulrich Rudl, he was a German pilot.

316
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,800
 He was one of the most decorated pilots of the war.

317
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,160
 And he got shot, wounded in one of his legs, had to lose his leg, and then carried on and

318
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,920
 shot down 26 more fights with only one leg.

319
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
 So they had one.

320
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
 One.

321
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,520
 To be fair, he got one leg, but that would be on the throttle.

322
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,840
 So, you know, he's got the advantage, he was faster to keep away.

323
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,560
 He couldn't slam the brakes on.

324
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
 No brakes.

325
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,080
 Did they have to modify the planes or anything?

326
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,320
 Because I think Douglas Bader's plane was somehow rigged up so he could keep flying

327
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 with no legs.

328
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
 I think that's true.

329
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,160
 But do you think it's interesting that all three of those countries had their own legless

330
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
 feelings?

331
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
 That's really interesting.

332
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
 That's kind of amazing.

333
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
 We can move on.

334
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
 Yeah.

335
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,640
 You were in the Kiwi Army, weren't you?

336
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
 Yes, that's right.

337
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
 You were in the Kiwi Army, weren't you, flying?

338
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
 No, that would be the air force.

339
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
 Got it.

340
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,160
 Guys, I'm a thicker snake.

341
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,760
 Which one do you fancy today, the boats, to play on the on foot?

342
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,320
 Just get in the garage and have fun, guys.

343
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,840
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

344
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,080
 That is my fact.

345
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,600
 My fact this week is that if you drop a wallet containing cash in Tokyo, you're three times

346
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,080
 more likely to get it back than if you drop it in New York.

347
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,000
 I was furious when I first read about this in a BBC article which reported that 88% of

348
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,960
 phones that were lost deliberately by a researcher during the study in Tokyo were returned, but

349
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,120
 only 6% of those lost in New York were returned.

350
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,000
 Actually, it turned out that wasn't true.

351
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,640
 I looked at the study and 95% were returned in Tokyo, but 88% were returned to the police

352
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,840
 and only 7% were returned to the person whose phone number was on the phone.

353
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,720
 So he deliberately left contact details like, you know, call me if you find my stuff.

354
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,620
 And the Japanese are like, no, I'm not going to ring you.

355
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,620
 Official channels only, right?

356
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,620
 Official channels only.

357
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,800
 Whereas in New York, like 75% or something gave them back, but they just called the person.

358
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,280
 Who writes their phone number on their phone?

359
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
 It's quite weird, isn't it?

360
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
 I'm thinking about doing that now.

361
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
 Yeah.

362
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
 It's quite a genius idea.

363
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
 I don't know if it is.

364
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
 That genius.

365
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
 But how would you, when you pick it up, you go, how am I going to call it?

366
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
 Yeah.

367
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
 Yeah.

368
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,240
 You can write your best friend's phone number on it, maybe, or your mum's number, your house

369
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
 phone.

370
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,360
 But basically Japanese culture is such that they're so set up for lost property.

371
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,880
 Japan is basically a large lost property office masquerading as a country.

372
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,120
 As in, people in Japan are so culturally wired into handing lost things, it's just absolutely

373
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
 the rules.

374
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
 It's just what you do.

375
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,560
 So last year, people in Japan handed in four and a half billion yen in cash.

376
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,280
 It's still a very cash-based society.

377
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,440
 Yeah, but we don't know whether that was just a lot of 100 yen kind.

378
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,840
 So whether it was just one, it was a huge suitcase.

379
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,280
 Well, they have a thing where you can hand in a coin, and if you had it into the authorities,

380
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,240
 they would then give you that coin back as a gift.

381
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,400
 It's an honor thing.

382
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,040
 So yeah, it's about kind of, rather than the older, if you see a penny, pick it up, and

383
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,600
 all day long, you'll have good luck.

384
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 That classic one.

385
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 They don't have that.

386
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,000
 If they find something, I'm speaking for all Japanese people right now, I have been there,

387
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,960
 and I remember having a conversation with one chap about it, and he said, "Make sure

388
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,360
 you talk about this on a podcast down the line."

389
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,600
 "Oh, I will, I will."

390
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,240
 But anyway, long story short, they give it back to you, and it's a gift, and so therefore

391
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,400
 you have received the coin that you've found as a gift, and then, honorably, you can then

392
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
 hold on to it.

393
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
 Brilliant.

394
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
 That's really cool.

395
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
 Worthy extra love.

396
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
 I have actually done this in London.

397
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,880
 I found a wallet with some money in it, handed it into the police.

398
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,960
 You did skim a bit off the top, though, didn't you?

399
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
 Hey, hey.

400
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,200
 Well, this was the thing about...

401
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,320
 I think it had cash in, and I didn't...

402
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,120
 I think it then got claimed, because I was at the police station every day for the next

403
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
 six months.

404
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,360
 Anyone turn up to claim that cash yet?

405
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,840
 But I think in the UK, genuinely, in the UK, if it's been three months or some period

406
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,080
 of time, and the money is not claimed, you can go and, as the finder, claim it.

407
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,280
 I didn't mean to say, "Yeah, did you take the money out?"

408
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,840
 Because in New York, one of the interesting things about, well, yeah, whatever, you would

409
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
 say that, wouldn't you?

410
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,640
 It wasn't that one day that you bought a round in when we went to the pub, was it?

411
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,160
 I remember that so clearly that day.

412
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,680
 You were waving a 20-quid note.

413
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
 It was 2014, wasn't it?

414
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
 Yeah, it was a great day.

415
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
 Very proud.

416
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
 It wasn't me.

417
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,280
 Just to save it for Randy, he's too proud of himself for handing this in.

418
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,520
 Most people in pretty much any country will hand it in.

419
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,240
 This is the thing that you don't get reported on much.

420
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,940
 Even in New York, 80% of people are handing in wallets, but of the wallets in New York,

421
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,840
 the researcher dropped them with $20 in each, which is the amount you legally have to return

422
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,200
 if you find it in New York.

423
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,280
 And eight of the wallets were returned, but only six still have the money in.

424
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
 So I'm counting that in my percentages as...

425
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
 How high were the drops, too?

426
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
 Were they...

427
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
 The skyscrapers.

428
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
 Were they?

429
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
 Yeah, yeah.

430
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
 People died, actually.

431
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
 People died.

432
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
 Disconcussion.

433
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
 The wallet dropped!

434
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
 No!

435
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,000
 Returning the wallet is just embedded in the head of someone who was standing under the

436
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
 Empire State Building, yeah, yeah.

437
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
 That's really interesting.

438
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,140
 Do you think the person who takes the money is in their head, they think, you'd find

439
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
 us fee?

440
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
 Maybe.

441
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
 Maybe.

442
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,620
 Or was it a different person who took the money and then a new person found the empty

443
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
 wallet?

444
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,620
 If I was going to take the money, I might just take the money because it's not as identifiable.

445
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,100
 But you don't want to take someone's driving license, that's a huge faff for them, you

446
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
 know.

447
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
 Yeah.

448
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,900
 So in Tokyo, they have these things called Corbans and they're tiny police stations and

449
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,500
 a city like Tokyo will have dozens of them, but in the countryside, there'll be just one

450
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,100
 or two in each village.

451
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,720
 And the idea is, you hand your stuff in there and it's kept there for about a month and

452
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,200
 that's in case someone sort of retraces their steps and goes back to the area where they

453
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,960
 were, they find the nearest Corban and they say, "It's my 50p there."

454
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
 Or whatever.

455
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
 So good.

456
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,440
 And then after a certain amount of time, they're given to the big sort of lost and found in

457
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,120
 the middle of Tokyo or wherever.

458
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
 Yeah.

459
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
 Okay.

460
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
 Here's the thing that's lost in Japan.

461
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
 This is nuts.

462
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,960
 A big chunk of Japan has been lost.

463
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
 Okay.

464
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,500
 So in Japan, a big chunk has no easily contactable owner and the property law is crazy there

465
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,320
 as in it's very difficult, like property is distributed among heirs, sometimes if there's

466
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,560
 no will, so it's kind of divvied up equally.

467
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,600
 There was a case where the government, they wanted to build a road, like really big road

468
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,840
 going into/out of Tokyo.

469
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,420
 So important project for them.

470
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,360
 They had to track down 148 heirs of one patch of land.

471
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 They sent 200 letters out, a lot of people had emigrated, some of them had died, like

472
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,120
 just nightmare situation.

473
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,080
 The unowned bit of Japan is bigger than which country, I'd like you all to guess.

474
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
 Is it close to Japan?

475
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
 No.

476
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
 Oh.

477
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
 Not alphabetically.

478
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
 I'm going to...

479
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 Not Jamaica then.

480
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
 Okay.

481
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,280
 I'm going to go with Russia.

482
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
 Yeah.

483
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
 That's okay.

484
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,360
 20% of Japan, I'm going to say Wales.

485
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
 Not far off.

486
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
 Belgium.

487
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
 Far off.

488
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 Denmark, very close to Belgium.

489
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
 Okay.

490
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,480
 The unowned bit of Japan or the bit where they just have no idea who owns it and it's

491
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
 a nightmare legally is bigger than Denmark.

492
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
 Wow.

493
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
 Crazy.

494
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
 It's just demographics.

495
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
 You don't have to register when you own land.

496
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
 It's not compulsory.

497
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,040
 You know this big building in Tokyo where all the lost and found stuff goes?

498
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,200
 The huge lost property office.

499
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
 Yeah.

500
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:01,720
 In 2016, they processed 3.67 billion yen of cash and 74% of it was retrieved.

501
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,800
 But then compared to that, the percentage of umbrellas that were returned was 90 times

502
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
 less.

503
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
 Yeah.

504
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,600
 This is the thing umbrellas never give them back because you wouldn't, would you?

505
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,400
 You wouldn't go and get claim your umbrella.

506
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
 You'd drop it on the tube.

507
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
 No.

508
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
 Because they're really the sort of a few quid to buy.

509
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
 You just buy not one.

510
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
 Yeah.

511
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
 And they all look the same.

512
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
 Apparently they've got like a see-through...

513
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
 Oh yeah.

514
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
 They have that self...

515
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
 Yeah.

516
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
 Yeah.

517
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
 Yeah.

518
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
 And so and really it's an open game for umbrellas.

519
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
 So if you lose it, you can...

520
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
 And you find one, you don't have to hand that and you're not going to get a special gift

521
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 or anything like that.

522
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
 Is that right?

523
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 It's like The Purge, that film.

524
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
 Yeah.

525
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
 It's very similar to The Purge.

526
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
 Yeah.

527
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 Yeah.

528
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 Well, umbrella crime is legal.

529
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
 Wow.

530
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,100
 And I don't know if they have the opening up of the umbrella inside being bad luck as

531
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
 well.

532
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
 I'm not sure where that came from.

533
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,100
 Oh, interesting.

534
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
 You guys heard of that one?

535
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
 Yeah.

536
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
 Yeah, of course.

537
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
 Do you know where that came from?

538
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
 No.

539
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,000
 So we've been told by the big umbrella shop in London that the reason that it's bad luck

540
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,360
 is it was invented by umbrella salesmen and they didn't want people opening their umbrellas

541
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,120
 inside so that they would get all rotted and horrible and people would have to buy new

542
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
 umbrellas.

543
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
 Oh.

544
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
 That's what we were told.

545
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
 That makes total sense.

546
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,940
 When you buy an umbrella from that shop, it's because it's in the centre, it's only about

547
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
 a 10 minute walk from here.

548
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
 Yeah.

549
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
 It's amazing as well.

550
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,940
 Like, they're beautiful.

551
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,940
 It's like the oldest umbrella shop in the world.

552
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
 They're so, they're so classy.

553
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
 The umbrella's in there.

554
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
 I bought one from there once as a real treat to myself.

555
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,940
 It was just after you found that money in the street, wasn't it?

556
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,740
 And I've lost it now and I'm so gutted because it was this beautiful thing, but they give

557
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,820
 you a tutorial on how to open and close it.

558
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
 Like, they get special.

559
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,820
 Really?

560
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,380
 It's a bit embarrassing to go through it.

561
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,200
 And does that umbrella shop have lots of little umbrella shops throughout the world?

562
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
 I think it's one of a kind.

563
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 Oh, it's not an umbrella organisation.

564
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
 Oh gosh.

565
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
 Oh gosh.

566
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
 What?

567
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
 What?

568
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
 What?

569
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
 You had to wonder where he was going with the questions.

570
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,700
 I just love the way you walk straight into that.

571
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:57,120
 Well, these guys are being dex as usual, but I'm glad Rhys is interested in umbrella shop

572
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
 logistics.

573
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:04,760
 Guys, if you found a wallet on the street, then would you be more likely to hand it in

574
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,960
 if it had money in?

575
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,240
 If it's got other forms of ID, I hope I would just hand it in anyway.

576
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
 Regardless.

577
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,680
 Even if it had a million pounds in it.

578
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
 How big is this wallet?

579
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
 What is it?

580
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
 What is it?

581
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,840
 What denomination and currency are we talking about?

582
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
 Is it in crypto?

583
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
 What are you talking about?

584
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,440
 No, I think I would hand it in no matter what, actually.

585
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
 Yeah.

586
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
 I'm sure we're all honest people.

587
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,640
 Rhys, you haven't piped up, but we're just going to assume.

588
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,120
 Well, it depends on your circumstances, isn't it?

589
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,240
 We're all sitting here in a nice building where we've got money, but I think if you

590
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,080
 have anything, I think, you know, got to pick up a door too.

591
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
 Very good point.

592
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,880
 You've shamed us all into having a bit of perspective, but the truth is that if you

593
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,520
 drop a wallet with money in it, that's better than dropping one without because you're more

594
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
 likely to get it back.

595
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,880
 And this really surprised people. This is a study in 2019 which planted 17,303 wallets

596
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
 around the world.

597
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
 Wow.

598
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 It's got a big study.

599
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
 Did they need to do it?

600
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 Did they need to do the last three?

601
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
 No.

602
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
 We're doing 17,300.

603
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,160
 I don't think that's a good sample size.

604
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,400
 Maybe there was three researchers.

605
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,760
 They dropped the 17,000 and they realized it accidentally dropped their own wallets as

606
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
 well.

607
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
 I think that was it.

608
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
 You're not going to believe this.

609
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
 I lost my own.

610
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,960
 Just grab one from the collection.

611
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
 How the hell do they get them?

612
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,840
 Anyway, they dropped them in 355 cities all over the world.

613
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,960
 So this is completely cross-cultural and half of them had no money in them.

614
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,560
 Half of them had $13.45 in them and 40% were returned when they had no cash, but 51% were

615
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,760
 returned when they had cash.

616
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
 Wow.

617
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,560
 And they thought this is about weird, isn't it?

618
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:47,080
 So they did a follow-up study where they put another load with $94 in and the ones

619
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,560
 with $94, 72% were returned compared to only $60 for the $13, because I guess the thinking

620
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,640
 being that someone might really need it.

621
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,800
 It feels a bit more like stealing if you've stole the $90 compared to $13.

622
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
 Mo money, mo guilt.

623
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
 Exactly.

624
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 Yeah.

625
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 So.

626
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 Can I do one test on you guys?

627
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 Yeah, go on.

628
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,760
 I'm going to give you three words and I want to tell you which two words go together instinctively

629
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
 for you.

630
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
 This is related to this fact.

631
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,040
 So the three words are train, bus, track.

632
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
 Okay.

633
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,400
 Train and track alphabetically.

634
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 Very close together.

635
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
 Sorry.

636
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,080
 Well, these were in the game.

637
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
 What's the challenge?

638
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
 Train, track and bus.

639
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
 Yeah.

640
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
 Well, trains go on tracks.

641
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
 Do we pick?

642
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
 Do we pick two words?

643
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
 Which two go together for you?

644
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
 Train, track, bus?

645
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,080
 Well, I normally track my wife as she travels around on the bus every day, so I'd say bus

646
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
 and track.

647
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
 There you go.

648
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
 Yeah.

649
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
 Okay.

650
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
 I feel like that's something that's seriously either.

651
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
 There is.

652
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,360
 Well, like when I joined the Army with the aptitude tests, just a lucky dip for me.

653
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
 Train and bus.

654
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,360
 Thank you for no good reason.

655
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
 You've given me the answer.

656
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
 I wanted.

657
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
 Bombs of transport.

658
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
 Yeah.

659
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,440
 So this is a difference between Eastern and Western cultures and this is so part of this

660
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,160
 thing about Japanese people handing stuff in, like very different culturally, collective

661
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,440
 cultures dominate the East, individualist cultures dominate the West quite broadly.

662
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
 And there are these huge differences.

663
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,280
 And then one of them is that given those three words, most Westerners say train and bus because

664
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,560
 we think of things in categories, but most people from China or Japan or Korea will say

665
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,240
 train and track because everything is relational.

666
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,800
 So for instance, if you ask someone to describe themselves in the West, they'll say, oh, I'm

667
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 a QI researcher.

668
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 Tall and handsome.

669
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 Exactly.

670
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,720
 We also lie a lot in our culture, don't we?

671
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
 We do.

672
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,280
 Anna, which culture do people say bus and track in, please?

673
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,280
 I'm here to rule myself out of East and West.

674
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,120
 Have you heard of the Andaman Islands?

675
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
 Oh, yeah.

676
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
 Oh, come on.

677
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
 Uncontacted tribes.

678
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
 They're my people.

679
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,520
 This is a slightly different, forget the buses and the tracks.

680
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,880
 If you're Japanese or Chinese, you would more likely say, I'm so-and-so sister, I'm so-and-so

681
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,680
 daughter, I'm employed by so-and-so, I'm the friend of so-and-so that it's all about like

682
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
 in relations.

683
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,440
 Anyway, we've thought that this is a difference between spiritual cultures and collectivism

684
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,120
 and things like that.

685
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,040
 And then there was an amazing study done in the border of China and Russia, which looked

686
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,320
 at rice farming versus grain farming, and it's completely split on those grounds.

687
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,760
 And people with these more communal, collective responses to things are rice farmers, whereas

688
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,720
 grain farmers are more individualist.

689
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,340
 And we think now it's just because rice farming involves way more cooperation.

690
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
 That's really interesting.

691
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,480
 I read another study which I think is related to this, which is, if you're in Starbucks,

692
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,940
 because I think it was done in Starbucks, and you need to get from one place to another,

693
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,160
 so from your seat to the place where you buy your coffee.

694
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,760
 If there's chairs in the way, Western people will sort of dodge around the chairs and get

695
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,600
 to the place where they're supposed to go, whereas Eastern people will move the chairs

696
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,420
 out of the way and put them where they're supposed to be so that the next person can

697
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,420
 get there as well.

698
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
 That's nice.

699
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
 Wait, are there people on the chairs?

700
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,420
 No.

701
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,920
 And Andy, of course, turns all the chairs upside down and pours coffee on them.

702
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,040
 What's your Starbucks coffee name?

703
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,880
 Oh, I use my actual name.

704
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
 Oh, really?

705
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 Yeah.

706
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
 What do you use, Rhys?

707
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 Chris Nibble.

708
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
 Do you, actually?

709
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 Mmm.

710
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,880
 But I always say the nibble.

711
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
 Yeah.

712
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
 Yeah.

713
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
 Do you tell them to definitely say the nibble?

714
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
 Nice.

715
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 If you say Chris, you don't respond.

716
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
 Yeah.

717
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
 They need to say Chris Nibble.

718
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,120
 And then one time I got like something that was edible, and I was in the corner and I was

719
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,040
 just having really tiny nibbles on it for about half an hour, and I left most of it behind.

720
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,000
 And I wondered whether they thought, "Oh, yeah, that'll be him."

721
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Nibble by name.

722
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Nibble by name.

723
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,480
 They'll be thinking, "That's Rhys Stalpey."

724
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:47,800
 There's also a test to see whether they know who I am or not, you know?

725
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:54,160
 And then as I leave, I knew you didn't know who I am, as if I was Chris Nibble, and you

726
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,560
 couldn't keep the rest of this panini.

727
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:07,680
 Okay, time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

728
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,040
 My fact is that when trains were new in New Zealand, an elderly lady flagged one down

729
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,360
 by standing on the tracks to see if anyone could give her change for a £1 note.

730
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
 Oh.

731
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
 Wow.

732
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
 That's...

733
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
 Nice.

734
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
 This is a story of something that really happened.

735
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
 Wow.

736
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,200
 It's related in a book called Our Iron Roads by F.S. Williams, and I'm doing a little bit

737
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,120
 of prop comedy here because I brought in a copy.

738
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
 Oh, look at that.

739
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
 It is stunning.

740
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
 This was printed in 1883.

741
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,320
 Sorry, you said prop comedy?

742
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
 Hmm.

743
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,640
 It's a very bland, hard-backed book.

744
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
 It's...

745
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,880
 Wait for the comedy.

746
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,200
 I'm happy that New Zealand is mentioned in one of these old books.

747
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,880
 Yeah, because trains were not very late in New Zealand, not much after the rest of the

748
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,280
 world, but it's quite a hard country to navigate around, isn't it, by train, just because

749
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,360
 there's a lot of valleys and canyons and things.

750
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
 Yes.

751
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
 Yeah, I imagine.

752
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,680
 But there's this anecdote, it's paid £402 if you're reading along at home.

753
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,920
 The eccentricities of English travellers, however, if dangerous are not so odd as some

754
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,680
 in foreign parts, that's in quotes, it is said, so big tongs there, that not long ago

755
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,520
 an engine driver in New Zealand noticed a lady energetically waving her hand at a siding

756
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,080
 where he was not time to stop.

757
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,400
 On pulling up his train, she was asked if she wished to come on board, also in quotes,

758
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,640
 when she stated that her object in stopping the train was to ascertain whether any passenger

759
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,800
 could give her change for a £1 note.

760
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
 There you go.

761
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
 Wow.

762
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
 So she wanted change.

763
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,760
 She just flagged it down, like presumably there was a coin operator machine that she

764
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,720
 was sending the next day and like...

765
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,320
 Did they give the year there?

766
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,400
 It's no, not long ago, and this was printed in 1883, so...

767
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
 Okay.

768
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,880
 Well, I think the first trains were what, in the 1870s, so...

769
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,040
 Oh no, 1830, well, in the UK, 1830s.

770
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
 And sorry, in New Zealand.

771
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
 How were they?

772
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
 Oh, that's quite late.

773
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
 I think they were in the late '70s, 1870s.

774
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
 That's really late.

775
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
 I think so.

776
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,720
 And the first ones were in various different cities, and it was usually to get from the

777
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,360
 ports to the city.

778
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,520
 So in Vicargo, there was loads of swamps.

779
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,560
 You had to get past, so they put a railway line there.

780
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,160
 In Dunedin, you had to go over some difficult land to get there.

781
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,840
 In Christchurch, you had to go over some hills, and so they all put these different railways

782
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,000
 in, but they all used different gauges.

783
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Oh God.

784
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,720
 And so when they decided to put the whole country together, so the gauge is the width

785
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
 of the railway line.

786
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
 Right.

787
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,240
 And when they decided to put the whole country together, they were like, OK, this is going

788
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,400
 to be a problem.

789
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,120
 And in the end, they went for this thing, which is three foot six inch gauge, which was kind

790
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
 of the smallest.

791
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
 That's narrow gauge.

792
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
 It's really narrow.

793
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,640
 And the reason was because it was kind of cheaper.

794
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
 But apparently...

795
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
 Typical Kiwis.

796
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
 That's such a false economy.

797
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
 Go with the cheap gauge.

798
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
 Go with the cheap one!

799
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,320
 But apparently, if you ride on modern railways even, it's like riding the Piccadilly line

800
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,640
 in London, which is very sort of jerky and...

801
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
 Rickety.

802
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
 Rickety.

803
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
 Oh, really?

804
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
 Because of that gauge?

805
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
 Yeah.

806
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,600
 The gauge system that I've always been entertained by, the most, is the oddest.

807
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
 And everyone's got one.

808
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
 Oh, God.

809
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,440
 Save it for your spinoff podcast, Anna.

810
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,200
 My favourite gauge, that's a good seed.

811
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,160
 We ask a global megastar what their favourite gauge is.

812
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,760
 This week, Tom Cruise.

813
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
 Next week, Chris Dibble.

814
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,920
 Guys, it's going to run and run, I'm telling you.

815
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,600
 You can keep the rest of that panini!

816
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,320
 My favourite gauge is the Australian gauge system, which I'm sure you're very familiar

817
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,640
 with, which is mad.

818
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,680
 So they basically did what New Zealand did, but then they never put their country together

819
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,640
 properly train-wise.

820
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,160
 So it's also a joke involving an Irishman, a Scotsman and an Englishman.

821
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
 Perfect.

822
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,320
 Because basically, we're in the 1850s, there was an Irish guy, Francis Shields, who's in

823
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,440
 charge of a rail company in New South Wales.

824
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,280
 He likes a broad gauge, the Irish gauge.

825
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,080
 Then, Scottish James Wallace came along, took over shortly afterwards, converted New South

826
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,120
 Wales and some of South Australia to a standard gauge.

827
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,440
 And then an English bloke came along, rocked up in Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland,

828
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,880
 and made them all do the cheap, cheap-ass narrow gauge.

829
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,480
 And then some other bloke said, "Let's do a completely different gauge to transport

830
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
 sugarcane."

831
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,000
 The four different gauges never fixed.

832
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,140
 Still to this day, if you go on forums about it, the kind of forums that I like to go on

833
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,800
 sometime late at night, there are quite a lot of Australians going, "What's wrong with

834
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
 our rail system?"

835
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,800
 Are there bits where everyone has to get off and get on a train with a different gauge?

836
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
 Yes.

837
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,000
 You'll have to transport your freight across the country and you'll have to transfer your

838
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,840
 goods to new trains four different times.

839
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
 Oh, God!

840
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,200
 It really explains where that saying comes from with New Zealand and Australia, and that's

841
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,880
 the saying, "It's difficult to gauge."

842
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 That's what it is.

843
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,360
 It comes from where I live.

844
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
 Isn't that satisfying?

845
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
 Now you know that.

846
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
 Yeah.

847
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
 Yeah.

848
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:40,600
 Are you auditioning for a part in a children's transport show or something?

849
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
 Always.

850
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,000
 Rhys, have you ever been on the New Zealand love trade?

851
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 The love trade?

852
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Yeah.

853
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Not since the '80s.

854
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Okay.

855
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,400
 Well, it's been going, I think, since then.

856
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,920
 This is, have you heard of a town on the South Island called Middlemarch?

857
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
 It's small.

858
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,080
 Very vaguely.

859
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,520
 Population 186 is small, right?

860
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,760
 But every two years, the population absolutely blooms for one night, which is when they have

861
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,320
 the Middlemarch Ball and it's a singles ball, because often, you know, if you're on the

862
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,000
 apps and the nearest match is 100 miles away, this is a problem.

863
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,880
 So every two years, they have a night where everyone gets the train down to Middlemarch

864
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,780
 and there is a special love train put on full of, you know, excited young people wanting

865
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,760
 to find love or certainly get off with someone that night, basically.

866
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,960
 And it's really, it sounds lovely, actually.

867
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,320
 And then the day after the ball, there's a shame train to take people home who didn't

868
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,680
 get the train home the night before.

869
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,560
 I want to see this movie.

870
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
 Yeah.

871
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
 It sounds charming.

872
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,840
 Can I just written The Guardian did a lovely report about it.

873
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,960
 So this is the actual ball itself.

874
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,000
 On the dance floor, heels are cast aside as the heady crowd grind against one another.

875
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,280
 Sliced hot meats and buttered bread are served in the makeshift kitchen and two worn sofas

876
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,320
 placed beside the bain-marie grown under the weight of courting lovers.

877
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
 Oh my goodness.

878
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,880
 It's so disgusting as well as being innocent.

879
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,720
 It's really charming, I think.

880
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
 It is.

881
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,040
 Although I think we all thought when you said sliced hot meats and buttered bread, that

882
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
 was there.

883
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
 You've missed us for the men of the world.

884
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,040
 We were thinking of sexual things there, but I thought it was just me.

885
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,160
 How could you know it wasn't?

886
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
 That's amazing.

887
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,200
 Please write in to tell us if you've ever met the love of your life or if you've had

888
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,480
 an embarrassing failure to meet the love of your life, buddy yet.

889
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,760
 So the main railway in New Zealand was built thanks to Julius Vogel, who's prime minister.

890
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
 Oh, yes.

891
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,760
 I know the bread.

892
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
 It's delicious.

893
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
 Vogel's bread.

894
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
 I've never heard of that.

895
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
 Oh my goodness.

896
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
 It's the best bread.

897
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
 And they don't do it anymore in Waitrose.

898
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,600
 I'll talk after the podcast, but it's going off the market here.

899
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
 You can still get it in New Zealand.

900
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
 I'm going to move back here too.

901
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,280
 Is it named after this Kiwi Prime Minister?

902
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
 Must be.

903
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
 One can only assume.

904
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,320
 Well, he also, as well as his bread reputation, he has a reputation as being the first New

905
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,680
 Zealand to write a science fiction novel.

906
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
 Hey.

907
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,760
 Yeah, it was called Anno Domini 2000 or Woman's Destiny, and it was published in 1889, and

908
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,520
 it anticipated a utopian world where women held many positions of authority.

909
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,320
 Well, that is New Zealand.

910
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,400
 Yeah, because he also introduced the first women's suffrage bill to the New Zealand

911
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
 parliament.

912
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,800
 I was going to say they were the first country in the world, weren't they?

913
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,120
 Now, he introduced a bill, and the bill didn't pass, and then he left parliament, and then

914
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,840
 it passed a few years later.

915
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,240
 So he kind of started the ball roll.

916
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
 That is cool.

917
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,440
 And had he written the sci-fi as a means of political change, saying this would be a good

918
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,520
 society to build?

919
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,280
 He introduced the bill in 1887.

920
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,440
 The science fiction novel was published in 1889, and suffrage was granted in 1893.

921
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
 So it was all happening around the system.

922
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,840
 So it's like he tried the political method, and if that had failed, so he thought, "Right,

923
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,040
 what other tool do I have?

924
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
 Sci-fi."

925
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,440
 Sounds like he introduced the bill as a publicity stunt to sell more books than he knew he was

926
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
 going to write.

927
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
 It's very clever.

928
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,280
 And that's the story of the first-ever women's suffrage.

929
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,760
 Some bloke trying to flog some books.

930
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,640
 That is really cool.

931
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:02,240
 The reason trains were needed in New Zealand was transport logs around, and it was mostly

932
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
 these cow-ree trees, which are...

933
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
 How do you say it?

934
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
 Cow-ree?

935
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
 Cow-ree.

936
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
 Yeah, cow-ree.

937
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
 Cow-ree.

938
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
 Yeah.

939
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,240
 It's hard to roll my arse, but if you can, you can.

940
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
 Yeah.

941
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
 I have difficulty with it.

942
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
 Well, it was for cow-ree.

943
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,240
 I felt like I was back in people's march for a second.

944
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,240
 All the more!

945
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,240
 Looks like sliced meat.

946
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,240
 Logging industry was huge.

947
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,240
 The cow-ree trees used to cover basically all of New Zealand, now they cover almost none

948
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
 because they chop them all down.

949
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
 Very sad.

950
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,240
 But they did this amazing thing, their way of transporting them before they got all the

951
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,240
 trains up and running, were these things called cow-ree dams.

952
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,240
 So normally, you dump logs in a river and they could float downstream.

953
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,240
 They can't when they're these tiny little weak streams.

954
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
 And so...

955
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,240
 We've got a lot of weak streams in New Zealand.

956
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
 It's a shame.

957
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
 Okay.

958
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
 Yeah.

959
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 They would build dams and they'd leave the dams for a year or more, a year, two years,

960
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
 and they'd just pile logs up behind the dam.

961
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,240
 And then one day, they'd come back and they could have up to 30,000 logs behind this dam

962
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,240
 and they'd whip up this drawbridge and suddenly 30,000 logs will descend from the mountains

963
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
 in this giant waterfall.

964
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
 Get out.

965
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
 To the beach.

966
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
 Isn't that amazing?

967
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
 The beaches just transform.

968
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
 Suddenly, you've gone for a day out on the beach.

969
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
 Oh, my God.

970
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,240
 You're frantically flogging the donkey or riding faster.

971
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
 He's very old.

972
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
 He goes slowly.

973
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
 Look at the ice cream.

974
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,240
 The Punch and Judy man is frantically rolling the canvas tight.

975
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
 That is amazing.

976
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
 Wow.

977
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
 It's really cool.

978
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
 That is stunning.

979
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
 Yeah.

980
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,240
 Your fact, Andy, was about someone getting changed for a one-pound note.

981
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
 Yes.

982
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,240
 And they didn't know where their currency is, the dollar.

983
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
 Right.

984
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
 Not in those days.

985
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
 Well, yes, exactly.

986
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
 So it's interesting that they did have the pound.

987
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
 Yeah.

988
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,240
 Until the dollar came in relatively recently, I think.

989
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,240
 That was one of the moments, I think, when they were right,

990
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
 "Well, we're going to have our own currency."

991
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
 We'll still have the Queen on it.

992
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
 Which, you know.

993
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
 So when they decided to go for the dollar,

994
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,240
 it wasn't obvious that they would call it a New Zealand dollar.

995
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,240
 They could call anything because they're getting their own currency, right?

996
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
 They didn't want to be a pound anymore.

997
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
 And so they sent it to the public, basically,

998
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,240
 and had a public discussion of what should we call our coin.

999
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
 A lot of people thought they'd call it the Kiwi.

1000
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
 Oh, brilliant.

1001
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,240
 The Zeal, as in New Zealand.

1002
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
 Nice.

1003
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
 I like the Zeal.

1004
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
 The NZ, E-M-Z-E-D.

1005
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
 They almost called it the NZ.

1006
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
 Oh, I like that as well.

1007
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
 The Moa, the Zac, the Tui.

1008
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
 Those were all ideas to call it.

1009
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,240
 And then because I think Australia had just gone to the dollar

1010
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,240
 relatively recently, they decided, "Oh, yeah, we should probably do the same."

1011
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
 You could have had the Tui.

1012
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
 Tui?

1013
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240
 Tui, T-U-I.

1014
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
 Is that a bird as well?

1015
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
 It's a bird, yeah.

1016
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
 Didn't you do this with your flag as well a few years ago?

1017
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
 You had a flag referendum.

1018
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
 Yes, we did.

1019
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
 So we tend to do these things,

1020
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
 and it costs a lot of money,

1021
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,240
 and then everyone goes, "Oh, no, I'll just keep with what we're talking."

1022
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
 I think that's good.

1023
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
 I think it's good to experiment sometimes.

1024
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
 I think we could do with more of that here.

1025
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
 Although where's New Zealand's something,

1026
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,240
 something that's something of a spirit when it's naming stuff by public vote.

1027
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
 You seem to be lacking that.

1028
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,240
 Yeah.

1029
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
 Let's call something a really stupid name for the hell of it.

1030
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
 Yeah, I think you're right.

1031
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,240
 You actually get a lot of shit, I think, for your Air Force logo as well.

1032
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
 In fact, to go back to Air Force is...

1033
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
 Oh, you were in the Air Force, weren't you, Ruth?

1034
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
 Well, for a little bit.

1035
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
 Yes.

1036
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
 Shall I put the different outfit on?

1037
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
 You know what your Air Force logo is?

1038
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
 Yes, the Kiwi.

1039
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
 This is the Kiwi, and everyone finds it very funny.

1040
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,240
 It's a flightless bird.

1041
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
 But they worked hard over that,

1042
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
 and they actually abandoned...

1043
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,240
 It was a fern leaf before that, I think,

1044
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
 in the '50s and '60s,

1045
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
 which people then pointed out was just a white fern leaf

1046
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
 that looks like a white feather,

1047
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,240
 which is basically a symbol for surrendering.

1048
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,240
 Which is quite a funny idea, with your warplanes.

1049
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
 We just can't get it right.

1050
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,240
 Can I tell you a really quick thing about rail,

1051
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,240
 and railways?

1052
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,240
 When did the last horse work on British rail?

1053
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,240
 Wait, so how did they work?

1054
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
 They'd just been moving trains from one line to another.

1055
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
 They're shunting, basically, shunting jobs.

1056
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,240
 They were agile, they're cheap, obviously.

1057
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,240
 They're good for these small jobs,

1058
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
 not for massive, great locomotives.

1059
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,240
 So they'd walk along the tracks?

1060
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
 Pretty much, yeah, yeah.

1061
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
 And there were shunting horses,

1062
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
 and that's what they were doing.

1063
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,240
 OK, I'm going to say there is currently a horse working in,

1064
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,240
 and it sort of nibbles the plants at the edge of the track.

1065
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
 I wish that would be so good.

1066
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,240
 No, they're not still in action.

1067
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
 OK, 1750.

1068
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
 Thank you.

1069
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
 1967.

1070
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,240
 So Charlie, the last British rail shunting horse,

1071
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,240
 could have heard Sergeant Pepper while in work.

1072
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,240
 What's a weird connection there,

1073
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
 is that Ringo Starr, of course,

1074
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
 is the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine,

1075
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
 and what's Thomas the Tank Engine's job?

1076
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
 A shunting engine.

1077
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,240
 Thomas put the horses out of business.

1078
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
 Lovely, that's superb connection.

1079
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
 There was debate in the early days

1080
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
 about whether horses or trains would be better.

1081
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
 Do you remember the Rainhill Trials,

1082
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,240
 with this huge competition at Rainhill, where...

1083
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
 Stevenson's Rocket won.

1084
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
 Stevenson's Rocket won,

1085
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
 but there were about five contenders.

1086
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
 There was Stevenson's Rocket,

1087
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
 there were a few other actual trains,

1088
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
 and then there was Cycloped,

1089
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
 owned by a guy called Thomas Brandrith,

1090
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
 which was a horse walking on a treadmill

1091
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
 on top of a train,

1092
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,240
 and it was withdrawn.

1093
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
 The horse got the thing to five miles an hour,

1094
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
 and then the horse fell through the belt,

1095
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,240
 and it just did not, it just didn't work.

1096
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
 But it could have gone another way.

1097
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
 Okay, sliced meat.

1098
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
 Oh, God!

1099
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:48,240
 Okay, it is time for our final fact,

1100
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
 and that is James.

1101
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,240
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1936,

1102
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,240
 a robot in California shot its inventor in the head.

1103
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
 So what would that have sounded like?

1104
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,240
 Oh, no!

1105
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,240
 Very good California accent, though.

1106
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,240
 That's the robot, that's the robot,

1107
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
 repenting what it's done.

1108
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,240
 So I was looking for something else

1109
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,240
 in the newspaper archives,

1110
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,240
 and I just saw this as a tiny little article

1111
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,240
 in the Buffalo News of the 15th of February, 1936.

1112
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,240
 Amazing.

1113
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
 And I had no idea what it was about,

1114
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,240
 but then I've since done some more research,

1115
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,240
 and it was something called the Mechanical Man,

1116
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,240
 and it was a San Diego fair in 1936,

1117
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
 which was a big exposition,

1118
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
 and there was a guy called Henry C. May,

1119
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,240
 who was a British inventor,

1120
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
 and he toured it around America,

1121
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,240
 and it was a six-foot giant steel robot

1122
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,240
 that could stand up, sit down, smoke cigarettes,

1123
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,240
 fire a gun, and answer questions.

1124
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
 And I'll be honest, I've seen some pictures,

1125
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
 and I think it was a man in tin foil.

1126
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
 Really, really?

1127
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
 Was it really?

1128
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
 I think, I can't really tell,

1129
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,240
 but it looks like a Doctor Who buddy.

1130
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,240
 Right, okay.

1131
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,240
 But I've seen this in a television show.

1132
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
 I think it might be Penny Dreadful,

1133
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
 or one of those type of shows,

1134
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,240
 so there was a link to it,

1135
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,240
 and yeah, there really was this mechanical man

1136
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
 made many, many years ago.

1137
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
 It's incredible.

1138
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
 But I think there was a lot of cheating, wasn't there?

1139
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,240
 Well, maybe they weren't suggesting

1140
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
 that it was operated properly, robotically,

1141
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
 but it seemed like a lot of them were people,

1142
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
 which does suggest it was just a guy

1143
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,240
 with a vendetta against the maker inside.

1144
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
 Apparently, 'cause he could answer questions.

1145
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,240
 Someone asked the robot if he loved his wife,

1146
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,240
 and he replied, "I have a heart of steel.

1147
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,240
 "I don't love nobody, and nobody loves me."

1148
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,240
 That's a guy in a suit.

1149
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,240
 That's a single guy in a suit.

1150
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
 When did the Wizard of Oz come out?

1151
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
 Oh, '30s.

1152
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
 '39, wasn't it?

1153
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,240
 Yeah, okay.

1154
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,240
 That's a good point.

1155
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,240
 It could be the Tin Man, you know?

1156
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,240
 The world's first robot.

1157
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
 I love nobody, and nobody loves me.

1158
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,240
 He's looking for a heart.

1159
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,240
 He's looking for a heart.

1160
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,240
 Yeah, absolutely.

1161
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,240
 It's all coming together.

1162
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,240
 It's all coming together.

1163
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,240
 It's actually a documentary, it turns out.

1164
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,240
 Can I check, James?

1165
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
 Did the inventor who was shot the head,

1166
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
 was he all right?

1167
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,240
 He was fine, yeah.

1168
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,240
 So, there was an article in The New York Times.

1169
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
 Again, a very small article.

1170
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
 It said, "The robot showed more aptitude

1171
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
 "than Henry C. May expected,"

1172
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,240
 and he shot him in the head,

1173
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,240
 but then it says, "He will recover."

1174
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,240
 And then there's no more mention of him

1175
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,240
 in any of the newspapers,

1176
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,240
 but I assume he must have recovered,

1177
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,240
 otherwise it would have been in there.

1178
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
 They underplayed news in those days, didn't they?

1179
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,240
 Yeah, but this was a big exposition

1180
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
 in San Diego Fair.

1181
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,240
 Other things they had there was the Gold Gulch,

1182
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,240
 which was like one of the first frontier villages,

1183
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,240
 like a fake Wild West village.

1184
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,240
 Oh, cool.

1185
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,240
 They had the Zorro Garden nudist colony,

1186
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
 which was basically a load of naked women

1187
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,240
 and a few naked men,

1188
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,240
 which you could pay 25 cents to look at.

1189
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,240
 I thought an exposition was for scientific stuff.

1190
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,240
 I thought it was like we've got a new kind of toaster,

1191
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,240
 and you're telling me there's just the nudist village,

1192
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
 which I could pay a quarter and go and look at.

1193
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,240
 The nudist one, honestly, the nudist one was really bad

1194
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,240
 because basically actual local nudists were really upset.

1195
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,240
 They were the ones who were the most upset,

1196
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,240
 because they were like, "You've got showgirls in,"

1197
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,240
 instead of getting actual nudists in.

1198
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,240
 Right, and that would be paid top dollar too.

1199
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,240
 And there was complaints to the council

1200
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,240
 from the San Diego Council of Catholic Women,

1201
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
 the Women's Civic Centre,

1202
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
 and the San Diego Braille Club.

1203
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,240
 [laughter]

1204
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
 I can't find any reason.

1205
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
 About the nudism.

1206
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
 Is that because you weren't allowed to touch them,

1207
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
 and so it's sort of discriminating against blind people?

1208
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
 I need to know that they're nude.

1209
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
 I'm coming through now, I'm blind,

1210
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
 but let me have a feel.

1211
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
 Oh, that's not a proper nudist.

1212
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,240
 And you can keep the rest of this panini.

1213
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
 [laughter]

1214
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
 It's not a panini!

1215
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
 Get your hands off.

1216
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,240
 [laughter]

1217
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,240
 So anyway, that's the story of the San Diego Fair.

1218
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
 That was forever in 1936.

1219
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,240
 I think there was a sequel to this,

1220
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
 who became this big celebrity robot,

1221
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
 because there was a few years later,

1222
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,240
 there was the World's Fair in 1939 in New York,

1223
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,240
 and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation paraded Electro,

1224
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,240
 who again was a talking cigarette smoking robot.

1225
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,240
 Cigarette smoking seemed to be the main thing

1226
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240
 people wanted from their robots in those days.

1227
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
 The back of the day was the main hobby, wasn't it?

1228
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,240
 It was, yeah.

1229
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,240
 And he again seemed to be operated by people behind a curtain.

1230
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
 But all robots are.

1231
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
 Oh, even today.

1232
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,240
 Even today, when you think of Musk

1233
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,240
 and what he's trying to do and what have you,

1234
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
 there's always someone hidden behind the curtain

1235
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
 with a radio control device.

1236
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,240
 Is that with every self-driving car?

1237
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,240
 Musk has employed a person with a remote control somewhere.

1238
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
 There's a teenager in the boot.

1239
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,240
 [laughter]

1240
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,240
 Yeah, you can have a look.

1241
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
 Now they get paid a lot of money,

1242
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,240
 and they've got a t-shirt on,

1243
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
 and they've got little tiny controls.

1244
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
 They like being in small dark rooms.

1245
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
 The celebrity robot, 1939,

1246
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,240
 went on to star in a film called Sex Kittens Go to College,

1247
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
 which I just wondered if any of you guys would see.

1248
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,240
 Oh, I love that one.

1249
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,240
 Mmm, I thought it might be you.

1250
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,240
 Because its career sort of ended after 1939,

1251
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
 and we did a little bit of a world tour.

1252
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,240
 Was there anything going on in 1939

1253
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
 which might have made it less important

1254
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
 to see a cigarette smoking robot?

1255
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
 [laughter]

1256
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,240
 I saw the sequel, Sex Kittens Go to the Frontline.

1257
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,240
 [laughter]

1258
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,240
 Demon sex kittens struggle to adjust to post-war life.

1259
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
 Very sad, very sad one there.

1260
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
 [laughter]

1261
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
 I don't know until you've watched it.

1262
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
 It sounds really good.

1263
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
 So this is 1960.

1264
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
 Suddenly this robot became a celebrity again,

1265
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
 starred in a film, Sex Kittens Go to College,

1266
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,240
 where he advises the college to hire this genius

1267
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,240
 as a science professor who turns out to be a stripper.

1268
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,240
 And then there's lots of stripping scenes.

1269
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,240
 But that's just the great career of the world's

1270
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
 first ever celebrity robot.

1271
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
 Rhys, do you ever drive in autonomous cars?

1272
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
 Have you got an autonomous cab anywhere?

1273
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,240
 Things like that.

1274
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
 I've seen a lot of them.

1275
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,240
 I was almost hit by one.

1276
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,240
 Really?

1277
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,240
 Yeah, I was pulling out of the car park in my car,

1278
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
 and you know, when you go out,

1279
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
 you sort of go a little bit too far out into the road,

1280
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,240
 and in this oncoming traffic,

1281
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,240
 you think, "I better pull back in a bit."

1282
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
 Well, the oncoming traffic was the Waymo.

1283
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,240
 And so I put into reverse and go back a little bit

1284
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,240
 because my nose was sticking out.

1285
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
 And then, just as I did it,

1286
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,240
 the Waymo straight past me,

1287
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,240
 it didn't alter its path at all.

1288
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,240
 And I said, "If it was a human,

1289
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,240
 you would have actually altered your path."

1290
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
 Yeah, you just nod to bear.

1291
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,240
 A bit of shove and a bit of give or whatever.

1292
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,240
 But this one, as soon as I reversed back,

1293
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
 and I thought to myself,

1294
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,240
 "Well, if I hadn't have pulled my nose in a little bit there,

1295
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
 would it have hit me?"

1296
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
 That's weird, because that is like a legit way

1297
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,240
 to get out of a junction, isn't it?

1298
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
 You just edge a little bit,

1299
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
 and hopefully someone will notice you,

1300
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,240
 and they'll stop for you.

1301
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,240
 Yeah, they'll slow down.

1302
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
 You peep and creep.

1303
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,240
 Yeah.

1304
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,240
 That's what I'm doing on the love train.

1305
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,240
 I'm up in the luggage compartment.

1306
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,240
 No, but this is...

1307
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,240
 Because that's one area where there's loads of progress, isn't there?

1308
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
 Or certainly people have...

1309
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
 I mean, I know Elon Musk has been predicting

1310
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
 full self-driving for like 15 years.

1311
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
 He said we'll have it next year.

1312
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
 Yeah, he's raving on about them.

1313
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
 They are on the way.

1314
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
 I just mentioned this,

1315
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
 because Kawasaki at the moment,

1316
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
 there are lots of...

1317
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
 Should robots look like humans?

1318
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
 It's a big debate.

1319
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
 Is a bipedal humanoid figure

1320
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,240
 the most efficient use for a robot?

1321
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
 No, normally no, obviously.

1322
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,240
 But Kawasaki are working on a robo-horse.

1323
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,240
 Oh, I've seen this, too.

1324
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,240
 It sounds so good.

1325
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
 It's a motorbike with legs, basically.

1326
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,240
 Yes, it's called Corleone.

1327
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
 Really?

1328
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
 Which I think is weird,

1329
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
 because Corleone is the first letter of Corleone,

1330
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
 which is the family of the godfather,

1331
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,240
 which does feature a horse, right?

1332
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,240
 Head of one.

1333
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,240
 Head of one, yeah.

1334
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,240
 But they're developing sensors,

1335
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
 so hopefully it'll respond to you just like a horse does.

1336
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
 As in you're moving your body around,

1337
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
 you know, you're digging in with your heels,

1338
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,240
 or you're bouncing up and down,

1339
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,240
 or you're literally...

1340
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,240
 Or you're squeezing your thighs.

1341
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
 I don't write horses, but whatever.

1342
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,240
 Clearly.

1343
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,240
 That would be pretty cool.

1344
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,240
 I think a robotic horse would be awesome.

1345
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,240
 Yes, and I've seen videos of these.

1346
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,240
 There must be a prototype out there,

1347
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,240
 and terrain-wise,

1348
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,240
 they can do the same things that an animal could.

1349
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,240
 Better than wheels,

1350
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,240
 and I think that's where we're getting with.

1351
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,240
 But do they look like they're walking properly?

1352
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,240
 Because we've tried to make humanoid robots

1353
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,240
 look like they walk properly, and they still don't.

1354
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,240
 They're getting pretty close now.

1355
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,240
 I've seen the one that claims to be closest,

1356
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
 and I still think it looks...

1357
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,240
 It now looks like a very elderly, shuffling person.

1358
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,240
 I met the first robot that could run by Peter-1.

1359
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,240
 You remember that?

1360
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
 It wasn't programmed to run,

1361
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
 but it saw you coming, didn't it?

1362
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,240
 I stopped offering it at Russian chocolate.

1363
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,240
 What was it called?

1364
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,240
 It was the Honda one.

1365
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,240
 Yeah, he was guest on QI.

1366
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
 He was guest on QI, and I danced with him.

1367
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
 I remember.

1368
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,240
 And he did look like the most human one there, actually.

1369
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
 But yeah, then he ran,

1370
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
 and that was at the time,

1371
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,240
 which could only have been 15 years ago,

1372
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,240
 12 years ago, that was the biggest thing in robotics,

1373
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,240
 but now it's crazy.

1374
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,240
 I don't think that has been left behind that much.

1375
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
 And again, doing basic tasks,

1376
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,240
 like Google DeepMind did a big brag last year

1377
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,240
 about how it's got a robot to tie a shoelace

1378
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
 for the first time ever.

1379
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,240
 And it's two massive arms,

1380
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
 incredibly ungainly and incredibly slowly,

1381
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
 only doing the bow bit.

1382
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,240
 Anna, Anna.

1383
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,240
 As soon as they can tie our shoelaces together,

1384
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,240
 that's where they could take over the world.

1385
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
 Exactly.

1386
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
 Then they'll be able to make nooses.

1387
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
 And do you know what they're going to use those for, Anna?

1388
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,240
 Us, right?

1389
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,240
 Rhys, do you think we're all doomed?

1390
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,240
 Yes.

1391
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,240
 When robots are ready to go,

1392
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,240
 and this is what my show is actually about.

1393
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,240
 I'm touring here in the UK,

1394
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,240
 and my show is about the demise of humanity

1395
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,240
 because of AI and robotics,

1396
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
 and how can we stop it?

1397
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,240
 And why does AI have to be in the creative world?

1398
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,240
 Can we please not have it?

1399
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,240
 Because once it takes all of our creative jobs away from us,

1400
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,240
 what are we doing?

1401
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,240
 And that was written by chatGPT that show, was it?

1402
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,240
 No, I've had a couple of goes with chatGPT,

1403
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,240
 and we just don't get on.

1404
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,240
 Who doesn't like whom, though?

1405
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
 Oh, I don't think it likes me.

1406
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,240
 During my favourite AI, if we can call it AI,

1407
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,240
 it was invented by the AI pioneer who sounds awesome,

1408
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,240
 Marvin Minsky, and he was around in the 1950s.

1409
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,240
 He went to MIT, and actually his boss said when he joined MIT,

1410
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,240
 don't work on anything that's going to take less than 30 years.

1411
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,240
 We're playing the long game here,

1412
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,240
 which is a dreamy thing for a boss to say.

1413
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,240
 So he had to have something to entertain him,

1414
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,240
 little projects on the side,

1415
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,240
 so he invented this thing called the useless machine,

1416
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,240
 and it was a robot capable of doing one thing,

1417
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,240
 which was that if you turned it on,

1418
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,240
 it ejected its hand out and turned itself off again.

1419
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,240
 Wow.

1420
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
 Isn't that so great?

1421
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,240
 I love that.

1422
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240
 What happens if it stops working?

1423
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,240
 You usually have to turn it off and turn it back on again.

1424
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,240
 Just while we're on this fact,

1425
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,240
 Robot in California shooting its eventa,

1426
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,240
 there's a Wikipedia page of unusual deaths

1427
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,240
 in the 20th century, and it's stunning.

1428
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,240
 Oh, really?

1429
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,240
 It's so good.

1430
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,240
 OK, R. Stanton Walker, right?

1431
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,240
 Yeah.

1432
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,240
 In 1902, he was watching a baseball game with friends,

1433
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,240
 and a ball, a foul ball, hit him in the hand.

1434
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,240
 Unfortunately, he's halfway through passing his friend a knife,

1435
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,240
 a large and sharp one, which then is driven into his chest,

1436
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,240
 and he dies within a few minutes.

1437
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,240
 I mean, this is final destination, isn't it?

1438
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,240
 It is, isn't it?

1439
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,240
 Yeah.

1440
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,240
 The designer and builder of the first ever offshore lighthouse,

1441
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,240
 Henry Wyn Stanley.

1442
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,240
 Oh, this is a little longer ago,

1443
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,240
 so comedy is more acceptable about it.

1444
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,240
 1698, he builds it.

1445
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,240
 It's offshore in Devon, right?

1446
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,240
 Mm-hmm.

1447
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,240
 It's a very wild bit of coast, the Eddystone rocks.

1448
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,240
 He says it's going to survive the greatest storm

1449
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,240
 that could ever be.

1450
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,240
 Five years later, he is inside it for the great storm of 1703.

1451
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,240
 He has never found, neither has the lighthouse.

1452
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,240
 It just disappears into the sea.

1453
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,240
 I know, tragic.

1454
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
 Do they have Robbie Williams in there?

1455
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,240
 Because I'm pretty sure Robbie Williams is the name

1456
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,240
 of the first person to be killed by a robot.

1457
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
 I didn't find him.

1458
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
 I mean, it's a long old list.

1459
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,240
 This is from memory, but I think he was working in a factory

1460
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,240
 that had robotics there and something tragic happens.

1461
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,240
 Yeah, in the '70s.

1462
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,240
 Yeah, it was like something that built cars,

1463
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
 that kind of thing.

1464
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,240
 It was the arm of a machine that whipped him.

1465
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,240
 Yeah, yeah.

1466
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
 But he was called Robbie Williams, so...

1467
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
 No, he's loving angels instead.

1468
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:10,240
 That is all of our facts for this week.

1469
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
 Thank you so much for listening.

1470
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,240

00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,240
 Yes, Rhys Darby, present.

1478
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,240

00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,240
 come and see my show.

1481
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,240
 It's Rhys Darby, The Legend Returns.

1482
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,240
 And where do you get tickets?

1483
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,240
 Online, Rhysdarby.com.

1484
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,240
 It's all listed there.

1485
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,240
 There you go. Do it.

1486
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,240
 So there you go.

1487
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,240
 If you want to get in touch with Rhys,

1488
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,240
 apparently you just have to go to one of his shows

1489
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,240
 and shout whatever questions you've got.

1490
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,240
 From the audience.

1491
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,240
 Hi, Chris Nibble.

1492
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,240

 ask just jollying around.

1513
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,240
 We read out emails from listeners,

1514
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,240
 which are better than anything we've got to say.

1515
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
 So get there. That's Club Fish.

1516
