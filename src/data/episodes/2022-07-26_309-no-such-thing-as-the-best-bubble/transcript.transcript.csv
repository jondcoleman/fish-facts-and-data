00:00:00,00:00:04,Do you know where they're going to look like?
00:00:04,00:00:07,Do you know where they're going to look like?
00:00:07,00:00:11,Do you know where they're going to look like?
00:00:11,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:23,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anichesitsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:00:27,00:00:28,James Harkin.
00:00:28,00:00:32,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:32,00:00:37,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:38,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:38,00:00:44,My fact is that there is a 16th century exercise manual which recommends exercises including
00:00:44,00:00:47,"running, tennis and loud reading."
00:00:47,00:00:51,"So two of those sounded quite sensible, running and loud reading."
00:00:51,00:00:55,"No, it's about tennis, not good for you."
00:00:55,00:01:01,So this was actually posted on Twitter by a colleague Justin Pollard who was a historian
00:01:01,00:01:06,and it was an article which was based on something found by Joan Fitzpatrick who was reading
00:01:06,00:01:10,a dietary by Sir Thomas Elliott.
00:01:10,00:01:14,"It does sound like someone with a speech impediment saying the word ""diary"" there."
00:01:14,00:01:19,But it is a dietary and it's called the Castle of Health.
00:01:19,00:01:24,So it's about all these different ways that you can gain health in your life and there
00:01:24,00:01:28,is a category of exercise called strong or violent exercise where he recommends all these
00:01:28,00:01:35,"things you can do like digging heavy soil or doing resistance training which is, I don't"
00:01:35,00:01:40,know if he invented this but basically you have to lift up your arms to the sides while
00:01:40,00:01:43,your friend is trying to hold them in place.
00:01:43,00:01:47,"I don't think he invented most of it because it was all from Galen, wasn't it, and from"
00:01:47,00:01:48,the classical people.
00:01:48,00:01:52,He was kind of translating what the classics had said.
00:01:52,00:01:57,"There was another guy called Linnaker, not Gary Linnaker I don't think because it's spelled"
00:01:57,00:01:58,different.
00:01:58,00:02:01,But he was doing the same thing at the same time but he was translating Galen from Greek
00:02:01,00:02:06,to Latin because he wanted doctors to be able to know this stuff but he didn't want
00:02:06,00:02:11,normal people to be able to tell what was wrong with them whereas Elliott thought no everyone
00:02:11,00:02:13,should be able to know what's wrong with them.
00:02:13,00:02:26,"It's basically the doodling what's wrong with you if it's day, and I think we like Elliott,"
00:02:26,00:02:27,right?
00:02:27,00:02:31,You could blow into wind instruments as well if you wanted to help your intestines work better.
00:02:31,00:02:35,"Yes, also singing or crying."
00:02:35,00:02:38,"Crying, apparently you read that, right?"
00:02:38,00:02:43,"And I did look into crying to see if it's good for you and according to, this is admittedly"
00:02:43,00:02:44,from Quarress.
00:02:44,00:02:46,I'm not sure how true it is but it was asked.
00:02:46,00:02:51,They said if you cry for an hour then you would use up 78 calories and I worked out that's
00:02:51,00:02:54,about the same as 40 grams of ice cream.
00:02:54,00:02:59,"So if you cry for an hour and eat 40 grams of ice cream, you're on a level thing."
00:02:59,00:03:03,No one's ever cried for an hour and eat that little ice cream after it.
00:03:03,00:03:06,Can I just quickly say one of the things you recommended in this text because we were
00:03:06,00:03:10,saying that he's recommending things in English to make them clear of normal people.
00:03:10,00:03:14,"Yeah, I just want to read a sentence to you from the text."
00:03:14,00:03:18,"As touching things, proceeding exercise, as much as it is to be feared, least by vehement"
00:03:18,00:03:22,"exercise, any of the excriments of the belly or bladder should hastily be received into"
00:03:22,00:03:27,"the habit of the body by the violence of the heat kindled by exercise, also least something"
00:03:27,00:03:30,"which is whole by, by heaviness of excriments or violence."
00:03:30,00:03:34,So he just goes on and on and on and he says that that's about a third of the way through
00:03:34,00:03:35,that sentence.
00:03:35,00:03:36,Do you know what that's about?
00:03:36,00:03:39,I think one of the things he's saying is you should warm up so you don't shit yourself
00:03:39,00:03:40,when you exercise.
00:03:40,00:03:44,"Yes, he is saying that and he also, because he got this from Gaelin as well, he's saying that"
00:03:44,00:03:49,you should always go to the toilet just before you exercise and the reason is if you don't
00:03:49,00:03:54,"do that, then the exercise will kind of drive your waist deeper and deeper into your body"
00:03:54,00:03:56,and you'll never be able to get rid of it.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Oh no.
00:03:57,00:03:59,But the body is not a never-ending pit.
00:03:59,00:04:03,"If you drive your waist further and further down, it does emerge from the other end."
00:04:03,00:04:04,But we know.
00:04:04,00:04:05,That's what we know now.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"But no, did he think it would go into your legs?"
00:04:08,00:04:09,I don't think so.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"Sure, we've got people within you, deeper and drive you."
00:04:12,00:04:17,"It's more than like that, so when you get older and you've got this swollen feet, that actually"
00:04:17,00:04:22,"is based in some truth because if you do go for a run, you quite often get an attack of"
00:04:22,00:04:24,"diarrhea about 40 minutes in, don't you?"
00:04:24,00:04:25,Do you?
00:04:25,00:04:26,Do you?
00:04:26,00:04:27,I don't.
00:04:27,00:04:28,"No, I don't either."
00:04:28,00:04:32,"It's a very common thing, it doesn't affect everyone, but it affects a large proportion"
00:04:32,00:04:33,of the people.
00:04:33,00:04:37,"I don't maybe one quarter of the people in this room, for instance, I guess."
00:04:37,00:04:42,"It's a bit like that time, you told us that when anyone drinks coffee, they shit themselves."
00:04:42,00:04:45,"Again, these are all hypothetical, they're just things that I've read, and have read up a"
00:04:45,00:04:46,lot on this sort of thing.
00:04:46,00:04:49,"I guess pull a ratcliff, but I thought that was a fairly solid poo."
00:04:49,00:04:50,"Oh, God."
00:04:50,00:04:52,From what I read.
00:04:52,00:04:57,"I've never run anywhere for longer than 37 minutes, so I've actually never had this."
00:04:57,00:04:58,There you go.
00:04:58,00:05:00,"Just add an extra three, you know."
00:05:00,00:05:02,James did a half marathon recently.
00:05:02,00:05:03,I did.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"I ran for a lot longer than 37 minutes because I didn't run very fast, and I didn't"
00:05:06,00:05:09,"shit myself, which was the main thing I was aiming for."
00:05:09,00:05:10,"Yeah, really."
00:05:10,00:05:13,"Made some money for charity, didn't shit myself."
00:05:13,00:05:14,A good day all round.
00:05:14,00:05:18,"Thomas Jefferson used to cure his diarrhea by riding horseback, and I believe without a"
00:05:18,00:05:23,"saddle, and that was, yeah, he claimed that cured his diarrhea in the first bout that"
00:05:23,00:05:24,he had.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Wow.
00:05:25,00:05:26,Yeah.
00:05:26,00:05:29,What did the horse claim?
00:05:29,00:05:34,"This time, Thomas Elliott, he was a bit of a professional suck up, because his first"
00:05:34,00:05:38,"book that he wrote was called The Book of the Governer, and it basically just said how great"
00:05:38,00:05:39,kings are.
00:05:39,00:05:40,"Oh, really?"
00:05:40,00:05:41,Yeah.
00:05:41,00:05:42,All the way through.
00:05:42,00:05:43,"It just says, oh, aren't kings amazing?"
00:05:43,00:05:48,"And then a few years later, he got a job from the king who sent him as his ambassador to the"
00:05:48,00:05:49,Emperor Charles V.
00:05:49,00:05:50,Yeah.
00:05:50,00:05:55,So his job was to basically negotiate the divorce with Catherine of Oregon.
00:05:55,00:05:59,"So he was working for Henry VIII, and he was one of the people Henry VIII sent to Europe"
00:05:59,00:06:01,"to say, look, the Catholics in Europe are really pissed off with me."
00:06:01,00:06:02,Can you make it all okay?
00:06:02,00:06:03,Yes.
00:06:03,00:06:07,And the Church of England was created.
00:06:07,00:06:12,"But he was also quite cool, because he was a supporter of Learned Women, which was quite"
00:06:12,00:06:13,unusual at the time.
00:06:13,00:06:17,"This is the thing he sort of got from Thomas Moore, but he wrote a book called Defense of Good"
00:06:17,00:06:18,Women.
00:06:18,00:06:22,"And the idea was at the time, a lot of people thought it was quite bad for women to learn"
00:06:22,00:06:27,"to read or be educated or talk quite dangerous for them, but he said in his book Defense of Good"
00:06:27,00:06:31,"Women, it's good for women to be educated so that they can provide intellectual companionship"
00:06:31,00:06:32,for their husbands.
00:06:32,00:06:35,"Which is a step in the right direction, guys."
00:06:35,00:06:36,Yeah.
00:06:36,00:06:40,And the really out loud thing being good for your health was quite a persistent idea.
00:06:40,00:06:45,"So I came across a thing written in 1816 called the Code of Health and Long Gevity, which"
00:06:45,00:06:49,is another basically exercise manual book.
00:06:49,00:06:53,And it also said that loud reading and speaking are often good substitutes for other kinds
00:06:53,00:06:54,of exercise.
00:06:54,00:06:58,"And it says, hence the longevity of school masters, because they don't really move around"
00:06:58,00:06:59,very much.
00:06:59,00:07:01,But they do speak loudly a lot.
00:07:01,00:07:08,"It also says that because speaking loudly is a healthful exercise, it's one reason why"
00:07:08,00:07:12,women require less bodily exercise than men since they are often more laquacious.
00:07:12,00:07:17,I've got a lot of sexist facts today.
00:07:17,00:07:22,I didn't realize until researching this fact that reading aloud at parties and social gatherings
00:07:22,00:07:25,was a thing that we used to do.
00:07:25,00:07:26,Yeah.
00:07:26,00:07:28,I wonder if you've got all these looks on the tube.
00:07:28,00:07:33,"No, it's such a wonderful world to be the idea that you would sit in a room and someone"
00:07:33,00:07:35,would just read to you and you would all join in.
00:07:35,00:07:41,"And there's all these examples of, in the 1700s, particularly women in letters correspondences,"
00:07:41,00:07:45,sending each other recommendations for types of books to be read out loud while they were
00:07:45,00:07:52,"doing certain things like Notting Work, for example, apparently Boswell's Tour of the"
00:07:52,00:07:55,Hebrides is a fantastic book to be read out loud.
00:07:55,00:07:59,Just tying knots in pieces of string while you're notting.
00:07:59,00:08:00,Yeah.
00:08:00,00:08:04,"But yeah, there's many examples of good books to be read for situations."
00:08:04,00:08:06,"I'm sorry, we're sure it's not knitting."
00:08:06,00:08:12,"It's said Notting, and so I assume that was a 17th century."
00:08:12,00:08:16,Anything that's not knitting is Notting.
00:08:16,00:08:17,"No, good call."
00:08:17,00:08:18,It's one of those things that I just assumed.
00:08:18,00:08:20,"Oh, that's a weird hobby at the past."
00:08:20,00:08:21,I don't need to look that up.
00:08:21,00:08:22,Yeah.
00:08:22,00:08:23,"Maybe they were all sailors, these women."
00:08:23,00:08:25,They could have been making rope.
00:08:25,00:08:26,Yeah.
00:08:26,00:08:30,"Is this what you're talking about, they're in factories, they would have people reading to"
00:08:30,00:08:31,them.
00:08:31,00:08:32,They used to do that as well.
00:08:32,00:08:33,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:33,00:08:34,There was a cigar.
00:08:34,00:08:39,"Monter Cristo cigars, in fact, are named after the fact that it was the favourite book to"
00:08:39,00:08:42,be read out in the factory at the lectern.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Wow.
00:08:43,00:08:44,So that's what they say.
00:08:44,00:08:48,"The guy who took over it rebranded the company, and one of their favourite books was"
00:08:48,00:08:49,the counter-monter Cristo.
00:08:49,00:08:50,You don't have to work.
00:08:50,00:08:53,They were a fuck of a long time to get through the whole book.
00:08:53,00:08:58,"I really want to quit my job, but he hasn't even got out of prison yet."
00:08:58,00:08:59,That's better though.
00:08:59,00:09:01,You want to have a long read to keep the factory work entertained.
00:09:01,00:09:04,"If it was called the very hungry caterpillar cigar company, you'd have a lot of very bored"
00:09:04,00:09:05,employees.
00:09:05,00:09:06,Right.
00:09:06,00:09:14,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Chisinski."
00:09:14,00:09:19,My fact this week is that scientists in Georgia just blew a six metre wide soap bubble.
00:09:19,00:09:20,Wow.
00:09:20,00:09:21,Wow.
00:09:21,00:09:22,What room did they do it in?
00:09:22,00:09:26,It's not the first question I was thinking of asking.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"I just thought, that's wider than this room."
00:09:28,00:09:31,"I think the room we're recording in now, and it's probably wider than most of the rooms"
00:09:31,00:09:33,I am in my home.
00:09:33,00:09:39,"They actually had to have a special, extra-large room built just for this bubble."
00:09:39,00:09:43,I can't believe you don't have a job as an interviewer on national television.
00:09:43,00:09:49,"We're cutting live that, Andy, who was on the scene."
00:09:49,00:09:53,Presumably this wasn't the room back then.
00:09:53,00:09:57,"Prince Andrew, what room was it at Peterings Press that you were in?"
00:09:57,00:10:00,"The whole main restaurant, eh?"
00:10:00,00:10:02,All right.
00:10:02,00:10:03,So what room was it in?
00:10:03,00:10:04,It was outdoors.
00:10:04,00:10:05,It was outdoors.
00:10:05,00:10:06,"It was outdoors, yeah."
00:10:06,00:10:07,I believe so.
00:10:07,00:10:08,"Risky for a bubble, though."
00:10:08,00:10:09,"But, potentially the best."
00:10:09,00:10:12,"But, at least you can get one that big."
00:10:12,00:10:17,"It's an outdoors, the biggest room of all."
00:10:17,00:10:21,"I think I've certainly seen him practicing outdoors, or I didn't see where they did the"
00:10:21,00:10:22,real thing.
00:10:22,00:10:23,Yeah.
00:10:23,00:10:24,"But yeah, outdoors on the ground."
00:10:24,00:10:31,"So this was a study published in Physical Review Fluids, and one of the authors was inspired"
00:10:31,00:10:35,"when he went to Barcelona, and he saw street performers blowing these."
00:10:35,00:10:39,"They have those massive bubbles in his love, and they don't blow them."
00:10:39,00:10:40,They sort of weave them.
00:10:40,00:10:41,You know what I'm talking about?
00:10:41,00:10:43,It's a bit of rope in between sticks.
00:10:43,00:10:45,With sticks and rope.
00:10:45,00:10:49,"And he thought how an earth is something so thin stay together when it gets so big, and"
00:10:49,00:10:50,there's that pressure on it.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"And so they tried to blow a massive one, and they did."
00:10:53,00:10:56,"And they worked out the way of doing it, and it's not very interesting if you don't know"
00:10:56,00:10:57,a lot about it.
00:10:57,00:11:01,Is this the biggest bubble ever made?
00:11:01,00:11:03,I believe it's the biggest soap bubble ever made.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Wow.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"How big can bubbles get, I mean, how big is your room first of all, but then how big can"
00:11:07,00:11:08,they get?
00:11:08,00:11:09,Is it like they can get...
00:11:09,00:11:11,I think we don't know a maximum.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"Well, there are records."
00:11:12,00:11:14,So Guinness keeps a lot of records.
00:11:14,00:11:15,OK.
00:11:15,00:11:17,"So 2015, the record was broken then."
00:11:17,00:11:23,"I don't know if this new 6-meter one has beaten it, but the largest bubble then was 3,400"
00:11:23,00:11:24,cubic feet in volume.
00:11:24,00:11:27,And that I genuinely have written down is about the size of a classroom.
00:11:27,00:11:31,It's probably why I was asking about the room thing.
00:11:31,00:11:35,"But the weird thing about that is how do you measure, because it's not perfectly round,"
00:11:35,00:11:40,and it's not an independent adjudicator from Guinness needs to turn up and measure it.
00:11:40,00:11:43,And what they did is they photographed it just as it was finished.
00:11:43,00:11:47,And then the scientist independently used photographs from...
00:11:47,00:11:52,"I've written this down, orthogonal angles, orthogonal angles, which I've net is a term"
00:11:52,00:11:53,I've never heard before.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"But basically, I think photographed from a lot of different angles, and you build up"
00:11:55,00:11:57,a picture of how big it is.
00:11:57,00:11:59,How big do you say that one was?
00:11:59,00:12:01,"That was 3,400 cubic feet."
00:12:01,00:12:02,Yeah.
00:12:02,00:12:06,"So this one that Anna's talking about was 100,000 litres."
00:12:06,00:12:07,"So do you, Matt?"
00:12:07,00:12:09,I am.
00:12:09,00:12:12,They said it was big enough to swallow a Volkswagen Beetle.
00:12:12,00:12:13,Nice.
00:12:13,00:12:14,That's big.
00:12:14,00:12:15,That is big.
00:12:15,00:12:17,"You know, as you're saying, there's a bunch of bubble records."
00:12:17,00:12:22,I think my favourite one I found on the Guinness site is most bubbles blown with a tarantula
00:12:22,00:12:23,in the mouth.
00:12:23,00:12:26,That's an existing record.
00:12:26,00:12:27,Did you watch the footage?
00:12:27,00:12:28,"No, I saw a photo."
00:12:28,00:12:32,"There's a video of this guy who loves this tarantula, but he loves bubbles as well."
00:12:32,00:12:35,And he just pops his tarantula in his mouth and then blows bubbles with.
00:12:35,00:12:40,"Is the tarantula allowed to help like blowing because you've got two people blowing, aren't"
00:12:40,00:12:41,you?
00:12:41,00:12:42,That's true.
00:12:42,00:12:43,Has he really broken the record?
00:12:43,00:12:46,"It's the weirdest record attempt you've ever seen, because he's just got a tarantula sitting"
00:12:46,00:12:49,"inside his mouth live, and it's his pet, it's his favourite."
00:12:49,00:12:53,"And then he blows bubbles for a while, then it just crawls out of his mouth onto his hand."
00:12:53,00:12:54,And what was the previous record?
00:12:54,00:12:58,Were there lots of people who thought this was something that many people have done?
00:12:58,00:13:01,He got 119 bubbles blown in 30 seconds.
00:13:01,00:13:04,Surely he could just do one and he's broken the record.
00:13:04,00:13:05,Why bother?
00:13:05,00:13:11,"There's also most people put inside a soap bubble in 30 seconds, and that's 13."
00:13:11,00:13:14,"And this brings me to an important point, which might speak to what Andy said before"
00:13:14,00:13:16,about the Guinness bubble.
00:13:16,00:13:20,"So the putty inside the soap bubble, again, it's one of those ones on sticks where you sort"
00:13:20,00:13:22,of people jump inside it and it's woven up through them.
00:13:22,00:13:27,"And that's not a bubble as far as this study was concerned, because the bubble just needs"
00:13:27,00:13:29,"to go all the way around, this full sphere."
00:13:29,00:13:34,So I don't know if the one that broke the record was still being blown out of the aperture.
00:13:34,00:13:39,"But I think the bubble needs to be self-contained, complete."
00:13:39,00:13:41,And it's an example of science being very clever.
00:13:41,00:13:44,The fact that bubbles will always try and be a sphere.
00:13:44,00:13:48,So if you've got a piece of string and you're told to lay out on a table with the biggest
00:13:48,00:13:52,"possible area, then you'll naturally put it in a circle."
00:13:52,00:13:55,"So if you've got a piece of string of the same length, a circle is a shape which will give"
00:13:55,00:13:56,it the biggest area.
00:13:56,00:13:58,"And in the same way, the bubble kind of knows that."
00:13:58,00:14:03,"Well, when the first people who studied this was a guy called Antoine Plateau, he is probably"
00:14:03,00:14:05,the world's first bubble scientist.
00:14:05,00:14:10,"And he worked out that not only the bubbles always turn into spheres, if left on their own,"
00:14:10,00:14:14,"if you put them together, they always join an angle of 120 degrees."
00:14:14,00:14:15,What?
00:14:15,00:14:18,"And again, there's mathematical reasons why this is the case."
00:14:18,00:14:20,It's all about packing and stuff like that.
00:14:20,00:14:22,But this guy Plateau is really amazing.
00:14:22,00:14:24,He had problems as a child.
00:14:24,00:14:26,He lost his parents and he had mental problems.
00:14:26,00:14:29,And so they sent him away to the country to get better.
00:14:29,00:14:34,"Unfortunately, it was June 1815 and they sent him to the village of Waterloo."
00:14:34,00:14:36,Oh my God.
00:14:36,00:14:37,Oh my God.
00:14:37,00:14:38,I know.
00:14:38,00:14:40,And so he was there when the battle was happening.
00:14:40,00:14:41,But then...
00:14:41,00:14:42,Was he all right?
00:14:42,00:14:47,He was fine because he managed to live to be a bubble scientist.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"And the best bubble scientist there ever was, probably."
00:14:50,00:14:52,"Well, his career started very well, didn't it, Plateau?"
00:14:52,00:14:58,"But then, unfortunately, it's kind of very good, very good."
00:14:58,00:15:02,And he did his bubble work despite being blind a lot of his work.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"Because when he was older, he was blind."
00:15:04,00:15:08,He lost his sight in an experiment to see how long he could look at the sun.
00:15:08,00:15:09,Oh no.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Oh no.
00:15:10,00:15:11,He had to give us a record of its day.
00:15:11,00:15:12,Yeah.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Just an experiment.
00:15:13,00:15:14,"Oh, that's wonderful."
00:15:14,00:15:15,Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"But I mean, he's one of the greats in this field."
00:15:17,00:15:20,"And he doesn't sound like that smart guy, does he?"
00:15:20,00:15:21,He really doesn't.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"Because Newton did that as well, didn't he?"
00:15:23,00:15:24,Yeah.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"Yeah, he did."
00:15:25,00:15:28,He reported that his eye's her afterwards and he went blind for a couple of days.
00:15:28,00:15:30,And so I don't know why people continue to do it.
00:15:30,00:15:31,Newton was an idiot.
00:15:31,00:15:35,He used to put bockins in the back of his eyes to see if he could look behind them.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"Okay, come on."
00:15:36,00:15:42,"Um, do you remember, I think I'm out of time, you guys, that I used to come on stage"
00:15:42,00:15:43,every day after a bubble performer.
00:15:43,00:15:44,Did you?
00:15:44,00:15:48,"Yeah, when we were doing ostentatious at the fringe, the act before us was the amazing"
00:15:48,00:15:49,bubble man.
00:15:49,00:15:50,Cool.
00:15:50,00:15:51,What did he do?
00:15:51,00:15:52,Unbelievable things.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Was it big?
00:15:53,00:15:54,Was it a number of bubbles?
00:15:54,00:15:55,"Was it a size, the shape?"
00:15:55,00:15:56,Was it a tarantula involved?
00:15:56,00:16:00,"No tarantulas that I saw, but I only ever saw the last 10 minutes of his act, but how big"
00:16:00,00:16:01,was the room?
00:16:01,00:16:02,It was.
00:16:02,00:16:04,It was quite a big room.
00:16:04,00:16:05,It was.
00:16:05,00:16:12,"He always demanded playing huge rooms, even though he was only about to help people."
00:16:12,00:16:16,"He would, he did it quite like, he would, um, he did bubbles that he stabbed and then they"
00:16:16,00:16:21,survived or he would make bubbles inside other bubbles and he would do bubbles filled
00:16:21,00:16:22,with smoke.
00:16:22,00:16:25,He would.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"I made a bubble inside another, but like every child who's had bubble mixes done that."
00:16:27,00:16:28,What?
00:16:28,00:16:29,That's hard.
00:16:29,00:16:30,"Well, that's so embarrassing, Andy."
00:16:30,00:16:33,"Less time reading, more time blowing bubbles than a kid for you, so I would recommend it."
00:16:33,00:16:37,I was in one corner of the playground blowing bubbles and Andy was doing his jane ostentatious
00:16:37,00:16:41,improvisation at the other side.
00:16:41,00:16:47,"Did he, um, spill some of his bubble juice on the stage and you kept slipping on it, because"
00:16:47,00:16:48,"it would be slippy, wasn't it?"
00:16:48,00:16:52,"It was very slippy, but he always mopped up very carefully afterwards, yeah."
00:16:52,00:16:53,But it was.
00:16:53,00:16:54,"No, it was a messy old thing."
00:16:54,00:16:55,Yeah.
00:16:55,00:16:56,They call it bubble juice.
00:16:56,00:16:57,Did they?
00:16:57,00:16:58,"Yeah, the, um, bubbles do."
00:16:58,00:16:59,Like the people.
00:16:59,00:17:00,And they're called bubbles.
00:17:00,00:17:03,"The people who like bubbles are called bubbles, or if they really like it, they're called"
00:17:03,00:17:04,bubble heads.
00:17:04,00:17:08,"And they call the juice, bubble juice."
00:17:08,00:17:12,"I think if you're being called a bubbler, you must like bubbles enough to be called a"
00:17:12,00:17:13,bubble head.
00:17:13,00:17:14,Maybe not.
00:17:14,00:17:15,"Come on, mate."
00:17:15,00:17:16,"In all these subcultures, you need levels."
00:17:16,00:17:17,That's true.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Yeah.
00:17:18,00:17:19,I'm going to fall out of the stuff.
00:17:19,00:17:20,So I quite like bubbles.
00:17:20,00:17:22,Does that make me anything in this world?
00:17:22,00:17:23,"No, I don't think so."
00:17:23,00:17:24,"No, okay."
00:17:24,00:17:25,Yeah.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"It's like saying, I've read all the Harry Potter's and someone says, what house are you sorted"
00:17:27,00:17:29,"into and you say, oh, I haven't done that."
00:17:29,00:17:30,You're not a potterhead.
00:17:30,00:17:32,You're just a reader of potter.
00:17:32,00:17:33,Okay.
00:17:33,00:17:34,That's a good analogy.
00:17:34,00:17:35,I'm fine with that.
00:17:35,00:17:36,"Yeah, so it was pretty close."
00:17:36,00:17:37,And then I'm fine with that.
00:17:37,00:17:39,Are you fine with not being a bubble head?
00:17:39,00:17:40,"No, I'm vivid."
00:17:40,00:17:41,And then you better get into it.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"Because it is a quite big subculture, the bubblers."
00:17:44,00:17:45,And this actually was.
00:17:45,00:17:47,Getting bigger all the time.
00:17:47,00:17:51,I think it's going to burst.
00:17:51,00:17:56,"So they were consulted heavily in the study that I mentioned at the start of this fact,"
00:17:56,00:18:00,when the physicists were looking for advice on how to blow the best bubbles.
00:18:00,00:18:05,"All these nerds, suddenly, their use became apparent because they were always exchanging"
00:18:05,00:18:07,"like, this is the best liquid to use."
00:18:07,00:18:08,This is the best.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Juice.
00:18:09,00:18:10,Juice.
00:18:10,00:18:11,Sorry.
00:18:11,00:18:12,This is the best juice to use.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"And actually, do you know what the best soap is?"
00:18:14,00:18:15,No.
00:18:15,00:18:16,No.
00:18:16,00:18:18,"Well, it's not surprising, actually, if you watched the adverts."
00:18:18,00:18:19,Imperial leather.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"Oh, it's not imperial liquid."
00:18:21,00:18:22,It's fairy.
00:18:22,00:18:23,Isn't it?
00:18:23,00:18:24,This is actually according to another study I read.
00:18:24,00:18:26,So studies on bubbles just abound.
00:18:26,00:18:27,It's a huge area.
00:18:27,00:18:33,And it is a 2006 paper called Giant Soap Curtains for Public Presentations.
00:18:33,00:18:34,And it's--
00:18:34,00:18:35,Soap Curtains sounds disgusting.
00:18:35,00:18:36,Yeah.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"I don't even know what it's supposed to be, but it sounds disgusting."
00:18:38,00:18:41,I also very ineffective soap curtains.
00:18:41,00:18:43,I had a pair of soap curtains for this.
00:18:43,00:18:45,They kept that almost none of the light.
00:18:45,00:18:49,And there was always a rainbow outside.
00:18:49,00:18:50,"So this, it was actually quite good."
00:18:50,00:18:52,"It was by some physicists, too."
00:18:52,00:18:55,"First of all, said the question we're always asked is, are we paid to do this?"
00:18:55,00:18:59,"No, we're high level researchers, which is doing this to spread the word."
00:18:59,00:19:02,And it was saying soap curtains are a really good thing to engage kids.
00:19:02,00:19:05,"So it's basically like a huge soap bubble, but it's very flat."
00:19:05,00:19:08,It's drawn between two big poles.
00:19:08,00:19:10,And you sort of wash soap down it like a waterfall.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"And it creates this constantly moving, long bubble."
00:19:13,00:19:14,"Anyway, they looked into it."
00:19:14,00:19:17,And they said the best washing up liquid for surface elasticity
00:19:17,00:19:21,"is a proctor and gamble, which is marketed as drift in Europe"
00:19:21,00:19:22,and dawn in the US.
00:19:22,00:19:25,And fairy in the UK.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"But if you're in France, terrible news"
00:19:28,00:19:31,doesn't contain the crucial ingredient that makes it elastic.
00:19:31,00:19:32,It doesn't know.
00:19:32,00:19:34,So you can't blow such big bubbles in France.
00:19:34,00:19:35,What is it? Can you add it to it?
00:19:35,00:19:37,I don't actually know what it is.
00:19:37,00:19:38,I think it's probably some long chemical word.
00:19:38,00:19:39,"But yeah, you'd have to add it."
00:19:39,00:19:41,You'd have to order your own from elsewhere.
00:19:41,00:19:42,"Oh, wow."
00:19:42,00:19:44,So desulée.
00:19:44,00:19:45,That's very good.
00:19:45,00:19:50,"On the bubble Wikipedia, they also asked what's the best bubble juice"
00:19:50,00:19:54,in the FAQs and the answer is not quite so clear-cut.
00:19:54,00:19:58,"It says, ""Everyone has a different definition of the best bubble."
00:19:58,00:20:00,There is no actual best juice.
00:20:00,00:20:03,Because what one person defines as the best bubble
00:20:03,00:20:05,may not align with how another person
00:20:05,00:20:07,"defines the best bubble."""
00:20:07,00:20:09,It feels like there's a divorce behind that.
00:20:09,00:20:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:11,00:20:12,Is there a bubble--
00:20:12,00:20:13,do you mean there's like a separate mini Wikipedia
00:20:13,00:20:14,for bubbles?
00:20:14,00:20:14,Yes.
00:20:14,00:20:18,"So these guys from Georgia, who Anna was talking about,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,they went into a big online community of bubbles
00:20:20,00:20:21,like Anna says.
00:20:21,00:20:25,And I think one part of it was the bubble Wikipedia.
00:20:25,00:20:26,"Yeah, so cool."
00:20:26,00:20:27,So cool.
00:20:27,00:20:29,"And actually, bubbles is really important."
00:20:29,00:20:31,"If you're studying it, bubbles are really important."
00:20:31,00:20:35,"Because when you work out how they exist,"
00:20:35,00:20:37,it can help you in glass making.
00:20:37,00:20:40,It can help you in other industrial processes.
00:20:40,00:20:43,"I read one that's called, ""It helps in building lab"
00:20:43,00:20:45,"on a chip bubble logic devices."""
00:20:45,00:20:46,I don't know what they are.
00:20:46,00:20:51,"So for all I know, there might be 100 of my phone."
00:20:51,00:20:53,And also artificial viruses for vaccines.
00:20:53,00:20:54,"Oh, cool."
00:20:54,00:20:56,Do you need to learn about bubbles if you want to make those?
00:20:56,00:20:58,I found one other bubble that is not on Earth.
00:20:58,00:20:59,It's in space.
00:20:59,00:21:04,These are two super bubbles at the center of a distant galaxy.
00:21:04,00:21:06,They're massive cavities filled with gas.
00:21:06,00:21:09,And they're full of charged particles.
00:21:09,00:21:11,And the particles are 100 times stronger than we've
00:21:11,00:21:12,even made it certain.
00:21:12,00:21:14,They're 100 times stronger than any particles
00:21:14,00:21:16,found on Earth in terms of their charge.
00:21:16,00:21:17,Okay.
00:21:17,00:21:19,Charger stronger.
00:21:19,00:21:24,"One of these bubbles is 3,600 light years across."
00:21:24,00:21:27,"And the other one is 4,900 light years across."
00:21:27,00:21:29,Think of the size of room you'd need to--
00:21:29,00:21:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:32,00:21:33,Wow.
00:21:33,00:21:34,So yeah.
00:21:34,00:21:35,What happens if they pop?
00:21:35,00:21:36,I don't know.
00:21:36,00:21:38,But the Neptune's orbit around the sun
00:21:38,00:21:41,"is less than 1,000th of one light year across,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,just to put that in perspective.
00:21:43,00:21:45,Into a perspective that you still can't even begin
00:21:45,00:21:47,to understand.
00:21:47,00:21:48,"Yeah, cheers, mate."
00:21:48,00:21:51,One other space bubble that's dangerous to humans
00:21:51,00:21:53,is the space bubble that we create.
00:21:53,00:21:55,"So astronauts in the International Space Station,"
00:21:55,00:21:58,"when they go to sleep, when they exhale,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,they build this bubble of carbon dioxide that sits
00:22:01,00:22:02,in front of their face.
00:22:02,00:22:03,That can be very dangerous.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"So every astronaut, when they go to sleep,"
00:22:05,00:22:08,they have to sleep with their head near an air vent
00:22:08,00:22:10,because they need that bubble pushed away from them.
00:22:10,00:22:12,"Otherwise, they can suffocate on it,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,"wake up with huge migraines, potentially die."
00:22:14,00:22:17,You could just sleep with a very long straw in your mouth.
00:22:17,00:22:20,"No, because then the bubble would start"
00:22:20,00:22:22,at the end of the straw.
00:22:22,00:22:23,Thank god you're not.
00:22:23,00:22:25,You're just moving the problem.
00:22:25,00:22:27,Imagine if you were a NASA designer.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"It wasn't really long straw, though."
00:22:28,00:22:29,I'm sure it would be fine.
00:22:29,00:22:32,What if you had-- you went to sleep and you
00:22:32,00:22:33,invented this thing.
00:22:33,00:22:35,It's like a tiny straw.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"But as the time goes on, the straw gets longer and longer"
00:22:37,00:22:38,and longer.
00:22:38,00:22:38,That's a good idea.
00:22:38,00:22:39,That's a good idea.
00:22:39,00:22:40,That's the Nokia straw.
00:22:40,00:22:41,Yeah.
00:22:41,00:22:44,"You are lying after all, aren't you?"
00:22:44,00:22:46,Absolutely right.
00:22:46,00:22:47,So good.
00:22:47,00:22:49,This thing sells itself.
00:22:49,00:22:52,"One more thing about bubbles, which I really like,"
00:22:52,00:22:54,is penguins.
00:22:54,00:22:56,"We're not quite sure how they do this,"
00:22:56,00:22:59,but we think they basically blow bubbles out of their beaks.
00:22:59,00:23:01,And then the bubbles go onto their body.
00:23:01,00:23:03,"And when they're swimming, it means they can go quicker"
00:23:03,00:23:06,through the water because the bubbles
00:23:06,00:23:08,mean there's left friction with the water.
00:23:08,00:23:08,Really?
00:23:08,00:23:10,And that's the only way they can get the speeds.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"Well, you know a penguin kind of swims up"
00:23:13,00:23:15,and then can jump out of the water onto the land.
00:23:15,00:23:15,Yes.
00:23:15,00:23:16,They won't be able to do that if they
00:23:16,00:23:18,didn't have bubbles around the whole body.
00:23:18,00:23:19,Wow.
00:23:19,00:23:22,And there's an idea that we could make ships
00:23:22,00:23:24,with a lot of bubbles around the hull.
00:23:24,00:23:27,And then that could cut fuel consumption by about 15%.
00:23:27,00:23:28,That's worth doing.
00:23:28,00:23:29,Very good.
00:23:29,00:23:32,"Oh, get penguins to dribble on our ships."
00:23:32,00:23:33,And then where's that?
00:23:33,00:23:37,Just tie one penguin at the front of every ship.
00:23:37,00:23:40,With a straw could get bigger as well.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"Yeah, put it in the place of that pointless, like,"
00:23:42,00:23:45,fit-statch-ever woman that's always at the front of ships.
00:23:45,00:23:48,But that was the last time you saw a ship.
00:23:48,00:23:51,It was the last time you got a ferry to France.
00:23:51,00:23:53,I only traveled on Viking ships.
00:23:53,00:23:58,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:23:58,00:24:00,And that is my fact.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"My fact this week is that before she became famous,"
00:24:03,00:24:06,Marilyn Monroe was named the Artechoque Queen
00:24:06,00:24:09,"of Castroville, California, Miss Cheesecake"
00:24:09,00:24:11,by Stars and Stripes magazine.
00:24:11,00:24:13,And Queen of the radio plane company
00:24:13,00:24:15,where she worked assembling military drones
00:24:15,00:24:17,during World War II.
00:24:17,00:24:18,So cool.
00:24:18,00:24:19,"Look, interesting career moment."
00:24:19,00:24:21,She sort of had a lot of early prizes
00:24:21,00:24:23,before she became the true Marilyn Monroe.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Yeah.
00:24:24,00:24:25,But she even caught Marilyn Monroe that much.
00:24:25,00:24:26,She wasn't.
00:24:26,00:24:27,She was Norma Jean at that point.
00:24:27,00:24:29,She was at the time she got the Artechoque Queen.
00:24:29,00:24:30,"Yes, that's true."
00:24:30,00:24:30,Yes.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"Because that was at a time when she wasn't famous,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,but she was almost famous.
00:24:36,00:24:39,Because she was on a promotional tour for Diamonds.
00:24:39,00:24:41,There was a guy who was selling Diamonds.
00:24:41,00:24:44,And he also was a movie star promoter.
00:24:44,00:24:46,And he wanted to promote his star by getting a young star
00:24:46,00:24:47,let in.
00:24:47,00:24:49,And he asked this star let called Doreen Nash
00:24:49,00:24:50,if she would do it.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"She said, yes, she canceled it in the last minute."
00:24:52,00:24:54,And then Marilyn Monroe came along and did it instead.
00:24:54,00:24:56,But she was famous enough that she was
00:24:56,00:24:57,doing autographs and stuff.
00:24:57,00:24:58,"Yes, exactly."
00:24:58,00:24:58,She was at that point.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"She was given the sort of honorary role,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,rather than having to compete for it.
00:25:02,00:25:04,She became the queen of the Artechoque.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Yes.
00:25:05,00:25:07,"And what actually happened is she was in another,"
00:25:07,00:25:10,she was in some like room or something.
00:25:10,00:25:13,And some guys who were like a room.
00:25:13,00:25:15,Tell me more.
00:25:15,00:25:17,And there was a load of Artechoque salesmen
00:25:17,00:25:19,who just saw their chance and then ran over to her
00:25:19,00:25:20,and gave her a sash.
00:25:20,00:25:23,Held a load of Artechoque's took a photo and that was it.
00:25:23,00:25:24,"Yes, no."
00:25:24,00:25:26,There was nothing else happening there.
00:25:26,00:25:27,So these are the things that Marilyn Monroe
00:25:27,00:25:30,or Norma Jean did before she became super famous.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"Well, they were in the '40s, weren't they, really?"
00:25:32,00:25:35,"And she, her first small break, I reckon, was probably"
00:25:35,00:25:39,"in World War II when she was working for this kind of,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,"as you said, like a drone company where she was,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,"so what they did was they had these remote control planes,"
00:25:44,00:25:47,"which the Americans wanted to use for basically reconnaissance,"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"I think, and she was spraying the parachute,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,"the mini parachutes for these planes, is that right?"
00:25:52,00:25:53,"And target practice, too."
00:25:53,00:25:55,Some of them were used for some of the drones
00:25:55,00:25:58,were just for anti-aircraft gunners to have a go on.
00:25:58,00:25:59,OK.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"And OK, because then you don't have to fly the drone"
00:26:01,00:26:03,as far away as you'd have to fly a full-size one
00:26:03,00:26:06,in order to get the corresponding target practice.
00:26:06,00:26:10,You don't have to kill a pilot every time you're doing anti-aircraft training.
00:26:10,00:26:10,The best of both worlds.
00:26:10,00:26:12,So many advantages.
00:26:12,00:26:14,"So anyway, there was this idea that people"
00:26:14,00:26:16,should start photographing women who were working
00:26:16,00:26:19,"towards the war effort as part of this PR campaign,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,"pro-war PR campaign, and she was one of these women photographed,"
00:26:22,00:26:24,and that was her first small break.
00:26:24,00:26:27,And the person who instructed this campaign to happen
00:26:27,00:26:29,was one Captain Ronald Reagan.
00:26:29,00:26:31,"What was it, indeed?"
00:26:31,00:26:35,So Marilyn Monroe may never have existed if a one for Reagan.
00:26:35,00:26:39,"So when Marilyn Monroe first became more famous,"
00:26:39,00:26:44,one of her things they tried to sell her as was an mm-girl.
00:26:44,00:26:45,OK.
00:26:45,00:26:48,That's mm-m-m-m-girl.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"And that was in response to Anne Sheridan,"
00:26:50,00:26:53,"who was a previous actor, actually still there at the time,"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"but she was known as a mm-girl, because she had a lot of mm-f."
00:26:57,00:26:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:58,00:26:59,OK.
00:26:59,00:27:03,"And when people said, ""Well, why are you calling Marilyn Monroe that, 'Mmm girl?'"""
00:27:03,00:27:11,"Her publicist said, ""Well, it's because whenever she goes to Detroit, that's what people say. Whenever she walks past, they all go, 'Mmm, Detroit!'"""
00:27:11,00:27:15,"- ""Why Detroit?"" - ""Well, according to her publicist, it's because people in Detroit can't whistle."""
00:27:15,00:27:16,[laughter]
00:27:16,00:27:18,"""What is this story, James?"""
00:27:18,00:27:23,"""That's what the publicist said. Why did the publicist just say her name is Marilyn Monroe?"""
00:27:23,00:27:27,"""Mmm, I know, and her middle name's Margaret Michael."""
00:27:27,00:27:29,[laughter]
00:27:29,00:27:31,"""It's a really stupid story. That's why I bring it up."""
00:27:31,00:27:33,"""People in Detroit can't whistle."""
00:27:33,00:27:35,"""It sounds like the panics lie of..."""
00:27:35,00:27:37,"""It sounds like the panics lie of..."""
00:27:37,00:27:38,[laughter]
00:27:38,00:27:41,"I was looking a bit into her first marriage,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"which is probably her at least no marriage, so a guy called James Doherty,"
00:27:44,00:27:47,and they were married for four years in the late 1940s.
00:27:47,00:27:53,And he always said that he never claims to have any insights on Marilyn Monroe.
00:27:53,00:27:56,I never knew Marilyn Monroe. I knew and loved Norma Jean.
00:27:56,00:27:59,"Spelt with an extra ear on the end, by the way, which no one ever does."
00:27:59,00:28:02,"So, Jean was spelled J-E-A-N-E."
00:28:02,00:28:04,But he had a weird career.
00:28:04,00:28:07,"He went on to work for the LAPD for basically his whole life,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,where he helped to found and train.
00:28:10,00:28:13,And he was the lead trainer of America's first ever SWAT team.
00:28:13,00:28:16,"- What I see. - You know, like a SWAT team, like elite police."
00:28:16,00:28:19,- Yeah. - Not a man who would go into hostage situations and stuff like that.
00:28:19,00:28:23,"He also, when he was working as a policeman, at one stage,"
00:28:23,00:28:28,"he was doing crowd control at the movie premiere of a Marilyn Monroe film,"
00:28:28,00:28:31,"which was the, yeah, the asphalt jungle."
00:28:31,00:28:35,- Wow. - It seems a bit heavy handed to dispatch a SWAT team to Marilyn Monroe.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"- Well, he, he, that wasn't really painful for him,"
00:28:39,00:28:42,"because he was never allowed to actually watch Marilyn Monroe film,"
00:28:42,00:28:43,because his wife panned him.
00:28:43,00:28:48,I think you would be a jealous of him if you were the second wife to Marilyn Monroe.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"But he had a really awkward incident when, in the 1950s,"
00:28:51,00:28:55,"he was asked to be on a reality TV show, which was to tell the truth."
00:28:55,00:28:57,It was called to tell the truth of the game show.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"And they had a segment which they do on buscox,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,"which, where they bring sort of a number of people out,"
00:29:02,00:29:04,and you have to guess which one of them is the real ex.
00:29:04,00:29:05,"- Wow. - Yeah, yeah."
00:29:05,00:29:10,- And they had the contestants had to guess which one is the real ex-husband of Marilyn Monroe.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"- Wow. - Did they guess him, do you know?"
00:29:12,00:29:13,- I actually don't know if they guessed him right.
00:29:13,00:29:16,"What I do know is he lied to his wife, so he could be on the show."
00:29:16,00:29:19,"And when she found out, terrible like, as obviously she was watching TV."
00:29:19,00:29:22,- And there was only one channel at the time.
00:29:22,00:29:24,Incredibly stupid lie.
00:29:24,00:29:27,"- So when she found out, she threw a pan at him."
00:29:27,00:29:29,"- Oh, yeah. - She threw a pan, yeah."
00:29:29,00:29:31,"- Well, they did do that in those days,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,didn't they throw pans at each other?
00:29:33,00:29:38,- So this fact was partly about Marilyn Monroe being Artichoke Queen.
00:29:38,00:29:40,- Yes. - I found out a few other
00:29:40,00:29:42,- Queens. - Okay.
00:29:42,00:29:44,- Food related queens that America has.
00:29:44,00:29:46,There's a great article in the Wall Street Journal
00:29:46,00:29:49,"which described the National Pork Queen,"
00:29:49,00:29:52,"the Ohio Queen of Beef, and various other queens."
00:29:52,00:29:55,And this is a thing where they all face off against each other
00:29:55,00:29:57,to be Miss Agriculture.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"- Oh, wow. - So it's like a massive derby"
00:29:59,00:30:01,of queens of different foods.
00:30:01,00:30:03,- Did they fight each other with massive cuts
00:30:03,00:30:05,of the meats that they had?
00:30:05,00:30:07,- Who would your money be on?
00:30:07,00:30:09,"Would it be on the bacon, the sausage?"
00:30:09,00:30:12,- I'm thinking a big cow corpse.
00:30:12,00:30:14,- Yeah. - Queen of Beef.
00:30:14,00:30:17,"- If you could wield one of those, you're unbeatable."
00:30:17,00:30:19,"- Definitely, because you're not gonna be in much trouble"
00:30:19,00:30:22,"up against the egg queen, which is another one of these queens."
00:30:22,00:30:23,"There's a torn queen, wheat queen,"
00:30:23,00:30:27,"the separate lamb and wool queens, which is very weird."
00:30:27,00:30:30,"Anyway, they have to be, you know,"
00:30:30,00:30:33,"there's a sort of element that they're all quite good looking young women,"
00:30:33,00:30:36,"obviously, because that's one of the things they have there."
00:30:36,00:30:39,But they also have to give speeches on the products they represent
00:30:39,00:30:42,and they have to converse while being watched by judges
00:30:42,00:30:44,about their chosen products.
00:30:44,00:30:45,And the judges are looking to see
00:30:45,00:30:47,who best represents farming spirit.
00:30:47,00:30:50,And then the winner gets crowned queen of agriculture
00:30:50,00:30:52,and goes around speaking about agriculture
00:30:52,00:30:53,and how important it is and all of this.
00:30:53,00:30:56,"- Yeah, so if you're the egg queen,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,do they ask you just questions about eggs
00:30:58,00:31:01,"or are they asking, 'cause you're actually representing"
00:31:01,00:31:03,"the whole of agriculture, so you'd need to know about beef"
00:31:03,00:31:05,and lamb and wool and everything?
00:31:05,00:31:06,"- I think in these regionals,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,you only have to answer questions on your specialist food.
00:31:09,00:31:11,I'm not certain by think I said.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"But yeah, if you're promoted to queen of agriculture,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,it's like if you've just been home secretary for years
00:31:15,00:31:17,and then you become Prime Minister or something.
00:31:17,00:31:19,How do you know about all the other departments?
00:31:19,00:31:20,- It's a really big step.
00:31:20,00:31:21,- It's a huge step.
00:31:21,00:31:23,I don't think they should be allowed this kind of responsibility.
00:31:23,00:31:26,- I think you should have to be every single minister
00:31:26,00:31:28,before you become Prime Minister.
00:31:28,00:31:30,- And every single queen.
00:31:30,00:31:31,- Yes.
00:31:31,00:31:33,- I think Boris Johnson needs to be a sausage queen.
00:31:33,00:31:36,(all laughing)
00:31:36,00:31:37,"Actually, never mind."
00:31:37,00:31:39,- Sounds like a bit of prison terminology there.
00:31:39,00:31:41,(all laughing)
00:31:41,00:31:43,"- Yeah, industry queens have been quite a big thing"
00:31:43,00:31:45,"for about 100 years, haven't they?"
00:31:45,00:31:48,"I think they kick, which are mascots for certain industries."
00:31:48,00:31:51,And I think we cover them a bit in the queue series of QI.
00:31:51,00:31:52,"- We did, yeah."
00:31:52,00:31:54,"- But if it's gone out, yeah, I'm not sure if it's gone out yet."
00:31:54,00:31:55,- Absolutely.
00:31:55,00:31:56,- I might have done.
00:31:56,00:31:58,- You may have seen this or you're about to see it on QI.
00:31:58,00:32:01,But they were people who represented their industries.
00:32:01,00:32:04,They would have a coal queen or railway queen.
00:32:04,00:32:07,"And there's actually, we did cover the sausage queen"
00:32:07,00:32:10,"because 15 years old, and they were so important"
00:32:10,00:32:12,and considered such diplomats for their industries
00:32:12,00:32:15,that they did things like this 15 year old sausage queen
00:32:15,00:32:17,was put straight on a train to Moscow in 1936
00:32:17,00:32:19,to meet Joseph Stalin.
00:32:19,00:32:22,And talk about how great British sausages were.
00:32:22,00:32:24,- Did she have sausages to present?
00:32:24,00:32:25,- She must have done.
00:32:25,00:32:26,- She must have done.
00:32:26,00:32:27,- As per so.
00:32:27,00:32:29,- I've seen a picture where she's wearing sausages
00:32:29,00:32:31,around her neck and on her head and stuff.
00:32:31,00:32:32,- It's a very odd picture.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"- Oh, that's a weird cra--"
00:32:34,00:32:36,- She's wearing a sort of hula skirt made of sausages.
00:32:36,00:32:38,- Yeah.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"As Stalin, you would have to think,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,"""These people are trying to take the piss, aren't they?"""
00:32:41,00:32:42,- Yeah.
00:32:42,00:32:44,- I'm in charge of Russia.
00:32:44,00:32:46,And they're sending their sausage queen.
00:32:46,00:32:47,- Apparently they do great diplomats.
00:32:47,00:32:48,"Well, that's one of the main reasons"
00:32:48,00:32:50,that Russia eventually joined other side
00:32:50,00:32:51,in the second world war.
00:32:51,00:32:53,It's thought it was because of her.
00:32:53,00:32:59,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:32:59,00:33:01,And that is James.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"- Okay, my fact this week is that there is a salamander"
00:33:03,00:33:05,in Bosnia who hasn't moved from the same spot
00:33:05,00:33:07,since 2010.
00:33:07,00:33:09,"- Was it, and was sure it's alive?"
00:33:09,00:33:12,"- Well, I'm not sure it's currently alive."
00:33:12,00:33:15,I'm sure it was alive in 2018 when they last checked.
00:33:15,00:33:17,It might have moved since then.
00:33:17,00:33:19,But I'm assuming if it stayed in the same place
00:33:19,00:33:21,"between 2010 and 2018,"
00:33:21,00:33:23,it probably is still there.
00:33:23,00:33:24,- Yeah.
00:33:24,00:33:25,- Is that fair to assume?
00:33:25,00:33:26,"- I think so, although it's so."
00:33:26,00:33:28,"- In the study that was done,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,there was a suggestion that they can't be positive
00:33:31,00:33:32,it hasn't moved.
00:33:32,00:33:34,It might have gone away and just returned
00:33:34,00:33:35,by the time they go back.
00:33:35,00:33:37,"- Every time they checked, it was always"
00:33:37,00:33:38,in exactly the same spot.
00:33:38,00:33:39,- Yeah.
00:33:39,00:33:40,- But that doesn't mean that it's sneaking off
00:33:40,00:33:42,"and then when it sees them coming, it runs back in."
00:33:42,00:33:43,"- Yeah, it's possible."
00:33:43,00:33:44,- It's like having a toy story toys.
00:33:44,00:33:45,- Exactly.
00:33:45,00:33:47,"- As soon as the kid come back in the room,"
00:33:47,00:33:49,obviously they're going to be back in the same place.
00:33:49,00:33:50,"- Back to your places, yeah."
00:33:50,00:33:53,"- Okay, so this is an Olm."
00:33:53,00:33:56,It's a white salamander.
00:33:56,00:33:59,It's known in Bosnia as the human fish
00:33:59,00:34:02,because it has a pink skin color.
00:34:02,00:34:06,"And there is a couple of scientists in Budapest,"
00:34:06,00:34:09,whose names I'm not going to try and pronounce.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"Gurgly Balash, maybe."
00:34:11,00:34:12,- Gurgly Balash.
00:34:12,00:34:15,(laughing)
00:34:15,00:34:17,- It's joking on water or something.
00:34:17,00:34:19,(laughing)
00:34:19,00:34:21,- It's a strong name.
00:34:21,00:34:23,- Imagine it's not that at all.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"You just completely, someone said,"
00:34:25,00:34:26,"""Hey, you're on the..."
00:34:26,00:34:28,"""No such thing as a fish podcast, a sweet couple."""
00:34:28,00:34:30,(laughing)
00:34:30,00:34:33,"- Unfortunately, he was once asked to introduce himself,"
00:34:33,00:34:34,"and his name's just Balash,"
00:34:34,00:34:37,but he was just following a mouthful of water at the time.
00:34:37,00:34:39,(laughing)
00:34:39,00:34:42,"- Well, actually, I mean, he was diving into the water"
00:34:42,00:34:46,to inject these Olms with a pigment.
00:34:46,00:34:49,"And each Olm, they injected with a different shape of pigment."
00:34:49,00:34:51,"And then every now and then,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,they'd come back and see where they were.
00:34:53,00:34:55,And the idea was to see how much they're moving.
00:34:55,00:34:59,And it turns out that most of the Olms move less than 10 meters.
00:34:59,00:35:03,And about five meters per year was typical.
00:35:03,00:35:05,And the most active Olm they found
00:35:05,00:35:08,moved 38 meters in 230 days.
00:35:08,00:35:10,And then the guy who I'm talking about
00:35:10,00:35:13,was found in exactly the same spot
00:35:13,00:35:16,"after 2,567 days."
00:35:16,00:35:17,(laughing)
00:35:17,00:35:18,- More than seven years.
00:35:18,00:35:20,- It's really amazing.
00:35:20,00:35:21,"- And the other thing,"
00:35:21,00:35:23,"I mean, Olms are incredible"
00:35:23,00:35:26,because they can survive a very long time without eating.
00:35:26,00:35:29,"- Yes. - And they've got, I think, they've tested some"
00:35:29,00:35:30,"'cause they have a lab in France,"
00:35:30,00:35:32,because they're very endangered these things.
00:35:32,00:35:35,And one Olm is known to have survived 12 years
00:35:35,00:35:37,without eating anything. - Yes.
00:35:37,00:35:38,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"- They just, like, one little crustacean comes along"
00:35:40,00:35:41,and they just gobble it all up.
00:35:41,00:35:42,They can eat it whole.
00:35:42,00:35:45,And then it'll just take them all that time to digest it.
00:35:45,00:35:46,And they'll just sit around doing nothing
00:35:46,00:35:48,until the next one comes along.
00:35:48,00:35:49,"- Well, thinking."
00:35:49,00:35:50,I think they're meditating.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"They're all sitting there just going,"
00:35:51,00:35:52,"""Oh!"""
00:35:52,00:35:54,(laughing)
00:35:54,00:35:59,- I've actually seen Olms live in the pale flesh.
00:35:59,00:36:01,"Yeah, I went to Slovenia."
00:36:01,00:36:05,"And in the post-Jana caves,"
00:36:05,00:36:08,they have this...
00:36:08,00:36:09,You're underground.
00:36:09,00:36:10,You're in this incredible cave system.
00:36:10,00:36:12,And then they've just got this booth.
00:36:12,00:36:15,It's so weird seeing this metal booth.
00:36:15,00:36:17,And it's like a terrarium for these Olms.
00:36:17,00:36:19,"And they, you can look at them."
00:36:19,00:36:21,And they keep them there partly to educate the public
00:36:21,00:36:22,and partly to conserve them.
00:36:22,00:36:24,And they're there.
00:36:24,00:36:26,- Did you see the move?
00:36:26,00:36:28,"- No, I didn't see the move."
00:36:28,00:36:29,They stayed very still.
00:36:29,00:36:30,"In fact, I have a prop with me,"
00:36:30,00:36:32,which I've left downstairs related to this.
00:36:32,00:36:33,- Great.
00:36:33,00:36:34,(laughing)
00:36:34,00:36:35,- Shall I go get it?
00:36:35,00:36:37,- Is it going to be good radio?
00:36:37,00:36:38,- No.
00:36:38,00:36:39,- Get it.
00:36:39,00:36:40,(laughing)
00:36:40,00:36:41,"- Oh, my God."
00:36:41,00:36:43,"- Okay, well, one of these away."
00:36:43,00:36:45,- I'm not saying people were at Olms.
00:36:45,00:36:46,(laughing)
00:36:46,00:36:48,- I'm just sad because you can't hear it.
00:36:48,00:36:50,"If you said, don't say anything more about Olms while I'm gone."
00:36:50,00:36:52,"- Look, I want to get the prop."
00:36:52,00:36:53,- He's going to get the prop.
00:36:53,00:36:56,"So, what are we going to say about Andy while he's away?"
00:36:56,00:36:58,- Who is going to replace him?
00:36:58,00:36:59,"- Oh, yeah."
00:36:59,00:37:00,- And the next few months.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"- If you want to replace Andy on those things are first,"
00:37:02,00:37:05,then please write to podcast@ky.com.
00:37:05,00:37:06,- Yes.
00:37:06,00:37:07,- Qualifications?
00:37:07,00:37:08,- Great props.
00:37:08,00:37:09,(laughing)
00:37:09,00:37:11,Always bring your props with you.
00:37:11,00:37:12,It's very important.
00:37:12,00:37:14,(laughing)
00:37:14,00:37:16,"- Okay, so Andy has returned."
00:37:16,00:37:17,- He's been eating off.
00:37:17,00:37:18,- Please.
00:37:18,00:37:19,- He's going to turn the heating off.
00:37:19,00:37:22,- It is something that can't survive in high temperatures.
00:37:22,00:37:25,"- Kind of, because it's a model Olm."
00:37:25,00:37:26,- Wow.
00:37:26,00:37:30,"- So, Andy, you want to explain what Andy's just put on the table?"
00:37:30,00:37:33,"- Yeah, so it's a soft toy penis."
00:37:33,00:37:34,(laughing)
00:37:34,00:37:35,It's an Olm.
00:37:35,00:37:37,"- If your penis has four legs down,"
00:37:37,00:37:38,then you need to get a look.
00:37:38,00:37:39,(laughing)
00:37:39,00:37:41,"- Yeah, it's a little soft toy Olm."
00:37:41,00:37:44,I just brought it because I bought it at the caves
00:37:44,00:37:45,and I wanted to show you that.
00:37:45,00:37:46,"- Yeah, it's really cool."
00:37:46,00:37:48,"I mean, it is quite phallic."
00:37:48,00:37:49,"- It is, yeah."
00:37:49,00:37:51,- This is a lot bigger than the ones they have in the caves.
00:37:51,00:37:52,(laughing)
00:37:52,00:37:54,It's tiny and they've really both beefed this up
00:37:54,00:37:55,for the blush toy version.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"- Well, you've just turned the heating off,"
00:37:56,00:37:58,so it'll probably get smarter in the next few minutes.
00:37:58,00:38:00,(laughing)
00:38:00,00:38:02,"- Anyway, I just, I couldn't,"
00:38:02,00:38:04,we couldn't do it without me bringing in the soft toy.
00:38:04,00:38:07,- This whole book doesn't work without you bringing this off toy.
00:38:07,00:38:09,- Maybe you should put a picture of the Olm
00:38:09,00:38:11,on your Twitter account.
00:38:11,00:38:12,- Where are we going to do this?
00:38:12,00:38:13,- What does it have a name?
00:38:13,00:38:14,"- No, it doesn't yet."
00:38:14,00:38:16,- I would call it Sherlock Olms.
00:38:16,00:38:17,- Brilliant.
00:38:17,00:38:19,"- Ah, very strong."
00:38:19,00:38:22,"- Terrible at solving crimes, if you can't."
00:38:22,00:38:24,(laughing)
00:38:24,00:38:26,"You just, it's like heating."
00:38:26,00:38:29,You just have to hope a crime happens directly in front of you.
00:38:29,00:38:31,(laughing)
00:38:31,00:38:34,"- So, what, what more can we say about Olms?"
00:38:34,00:38:35,"- Well, David Attenborough loves them."
00:38:35,00:38:36,- To see.
00:38:36,00:38:39,- So he picked them in 2012 as one of the 10 endangered species
00:38:39,00:38:41,he'd take on his own personal arc.
00:38:41,00:38:42,"And guys, we're not even there."
00:38:42,00:38:43,I guess we're not endangered.
00:38:43,00:38:46,"- This is so weird, 'cause I have a salamander related"
00:38:46,00:38:49,"Noah's Ark fact, which is that."
00:38:49,00:38:50,So this is not on related.
00:38:50,00:38:52,So there's just a brief step away from Olms.
00:38:52,00:38:55,"But there's a giant salamander in China,"
00:38:55,00:38:57,which is absolutely massive.
00:38:57,00:38:59,There are about five feet long.
00:38:59,00:39:01,They weigh about 60 kilos.
00:39:01,00:39:03,And the very first fossil of it found
00:39:03,00:39:06,was one of the earliest fossils discovered by humans.
00:39:06,00:39:07,- Okay.
00:39:07,00:39:10,"- And it was named Homo Deluvie Testis,"
00:39:10,00:39:12,which means human witness of the flood.
00:39:12,00:39:15,Because people didn't know what this salamander fossil was.
00:39:15,00:39:18,And it was thought to be a person who had died
00:39:18,00:39:19,in Noah's flood.
00:39:19,00:39:20,- Wow.
00:39:20,00:39:24,And if any of you at home thought it meant human floodballs.
00:39:24,00:39:27,"That's just, you know, you learn your lesson better."
00:39:27,00:39:28,- Not just at home.
00:39:28,00:39:33,Most Chinese salamanders are eaten in some parts of China.
00:39:33,00:39:36,I think they are on the endangered.
00:39:36,00:39:37,- They're endangered.
00:39:37,00:39:38,- They are endangered.
00:39:38,00:39:39,So don't do it kids.
00:39:39,00:39:42,"But they used to eat salamanders in the Southern USA,"
00:39:42,00:39:45,especially in times of poverty.
00:39:45,00:39:48,And there is one theory that the term hush puppies
00:39:48,00:39:51,originally referred to as salamander.
00:39:51,00:39:55,"Because a hush puppy, before it became like a type of shoe,"
00:39:55,00:39:56,is it?
00:39:56,00:39:57,- Yeah.
00:39:57,00:40:00,- It was like a tiny bit of food that you would eat.
00:40:00,00:40:04,"And the idea was, these salamanders were also known as water puppies."
00:40:04,00:40:07,And the hush came from the fact that people didn't want to know
00:40:07,00:40:10,that they were eating this stuff because it was a poverty food.
00:40:10,00:40:16,"It's either that, or it was like a little bit of food you gave to a dog"
00:40:16,00:40:18,"to keep it quiet, it could be that as well."
00:40:18,00:40:21,- How did that become a shoe?
00:40:21,00:40:24,"- Well, no, the branding is a dog, right?"
00:40:24,00:40:25,- I didn't know that.
00:40:25,00:40:26,"- Yeah, yeah, I don't really know that."
00:40:26,00:40:29,"- So sorry, is the branding about hot to make your puppy hush"
00:40:29,00:40:30,kick it with this shoe?
00:40:30,00:40:31,"- No, no, no."
00:40:31,00:40:32,"- No, no, no, no."
00:40:32,00:40:34,- The adverts were controversial at the time.
00:40:34,00:40:37,- Just one more thing about the giant Chinese salamander.
00:40:37,00:40:40,It's very cool because it also generates glue.
00:40:40,00:40:43,And this is really glue that might be actually very useful.
00:40:43,00:40:45,So it's a Cretaceous mucus.
00:40:45,00:40:48,"And it was a Cretaceous mucus if you gently scratch it, apparently."
00:40:48,00:40:51,And so researchers have been investigating this to see
00:40:51,00:40:53,if it can be used as a medical adhesive.
00:40:53,00:40:55,And apparently it's a more effective medical adhesive
00:40:55,00:40:59,than any other naturally occurring glue found in the world.
00:40:59,00:41:02,And it's much more flexible than synthetic adhesives.
00:41:02,00:41:06,And so they think that maybe we could use it to seal wounds in the future.
00:41:06,00:41:11,"So people who are good at Latin, who are all of our listeners,"
00:41:11,00:41:15,"but not me, would know when I say that salamanders often"
00:41:15,00:41:19,have mental glands where on their body they would be.
00:41:19,00:41:25,"It comes from the Latin mentum, not men's, so men's is mind."
00:41:25,00:41:26,But it's from mentum.
00:41:26,00:41:27,- Mentum.
00:41:27,00:41:28,- Is that a joint?
00:41:28,00:41:29,- They're tongue.
00:41:29,00:41:30,"- Oh, they're chin."
00:41:30,00:41:31,- Chin.
00:41:31,00:41:32,- How did you get that?
00:41:32,00:41:37,"- Yes, so they have mental glands from the Latin mental meaning chin."
00:41:37,00:41:40,And they secrete ferrimones.
00:41:40,00:41:44,"So when salamanders want to have sex, the male rubs his chin"
00:41:44,00:41:46,on the back of the female.
00:41:46,00:41:49,And he secreets the ferrimones onto her back with his chin.
00:41:49,00:41:50,- Oh nice.
00:41:50,00:41:51,- And then that gets her in the mood.
00:41:51,00:41:52,- Very sexy.
00:41:52,00:41:53,"- Yeah, very sexy."
00:41:53,00:41:54,- Very sexy.
00:41:54,00:41:58,I didn't find out how Olm's made themselves.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"I mean, I guess it's hard if you don't ever move from your spot."
00:42:01,00:42:04,"- They made, I think they're some of the only amphibians."
00:42:04,00:42:08,They're not the only amphibians that mate internally rather than laying eggs.
00:42:08,00:42:09,Is that right?
00:42:09,00:42:10,- Okay.
00:42:10,00:42:13,"- So I think they have actual sex, which is nice."
00:42:13,00:42:17,"- I think they do have a period of activity where they just suddenly all just go,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"""Okay, let's do the stuff we need to do and just one go."""
00:42:19,00:42:21,- That's great.
00:42:21,00:42:22,- Yeah.
00:42:22,00:42:23,- That's like a Saturday morning.
00:42:23,00:42:26,Just get everything out of the way and then the rest of the weekend you can just relax.
00:42:26,00:42:27,- Exactly.
00:42:27,00:42:30,"- So just on Salamander, sort of type of Salamander, right?"
00:42:30,00:42:33,And I didn't realise there was this persistent belief throughout all of history
00:42:33,00:42:35,that Salamander is a fireproof.
00:42:35,00:42:36,- And what?
00:42:36,00:42:41,"- From ancient times people, there was this rumor that Salamander is a born from fire"
00:42:41,00:42:42,and they're totally resistant to it.
00:42:42,00:42:44,"They're so cold, they can just walk through fire."
00:42:44,00:42:50,It was also thought that Asbestos was Salamander here because you know Asbestos looks like a hairy.
00:42:50,00:42:52,And it's fire resistant.
00:42:52,00:42:55,And so everyone thought that Asbestos was just the shed hair of Salamander.
00:42:55,00:42:57,"- I mean, it only takes one experiment."
00:42:57,00:43:01,"- You bizarrely, Pliny actually did it, and it was proven to be incorrect."
00:43:01,00:43:03,And he went on to believe it.
00:43:03,00:43:05,"- Well, there must be a Salamander there."
00:43:05,00:43:06,- Yeah.
00:43:06,00:43:08,- That's why he thought he was just proving.
00:43:08,00:43:09,- Yeah.
00:43:09,00:43:12,"- And it was so persistent that even in the 19th century,"
00:43:12,00:43:14,people still thought Salamanders were fireproof.
00:43:14,00:43:18,"To the extent that you had human Salamanders, which were popular entertainers,"
00:43:18,00:43:20,and they were performant fairs.
00:43:20,00:43:21,And this was across Europe.
00:43:21,00:43:24,And their trick was they wore these big Asbestos cloaks.
00:43:24,00:43:27,And so a lot of them probably ended up quite ill.
00:43:27,00:43:30,With these big Asbestos cloaks and gloves and shoes.
00:43:30,00:43:32,And then they'd walk through bonfires.
00:43:32,00:43:34,And they were called human Salamanders.
00:43:34,00:43:35,- Cool.
00:43:35,00:43:38,- And their trick was it was most impressive if they take a raw steak into the middle of a bonfire.
00:43:38,00:43:42,And then they'd stand in there and then they'd come out and the steak's cooked.
00:43:42,00:43:43,- That is quite clever.
00:43:43,00:43:44,- Hopefully they're not.
00:43:44,00:43:48,"- They could have the human oil in the other part of the circus, just kind of sitting there."
00:43:48,00:43:49,- Yeah.
00:43:49,00:43:51,- Just don't look waiting for the crowd to come fast.
00:43:51,00:43:53,- Oh no.
00:43:53,00:43:54,- We love it.
00:43:54,00:43:57,"I mean, literally people do that in Covent Garden, don't they?"
00:43:57,00:43:58,- The human statues.
00:43:58,00:43:59,- The human statue.
00:43:59,00:44:00,- That's true.
00:44:00,00:44:01,- I'm going to start calling them human alms.
00:44:01,00:44:02,- Yeah.
00:44:02,00:44:08,"- Okay, that's it."
00:44:08,00:44:09,That is all of our facts.
00:44:09,00:44:11,Thank you so much for listening.
