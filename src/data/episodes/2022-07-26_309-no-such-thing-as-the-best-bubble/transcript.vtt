00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
 Do you know where they're going to look like?

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.620
 Do you know where they're going to look like?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.320
 Do you know where they're going to look like?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.080
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.640
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anichesitsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 James Harkin.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.400
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.520
 My fact is that there is a 16th century exercise manual which recommends exercises including

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.720
 running, tennis and loud reading.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.320
 So two of those sounded quite sensible, running and loud reading.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.080
 No, it's about tennis, not good for you.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.240
 So this was actually posted on Twitter by a colleague Justin Pollard who was a historian

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.920
 and it was an article which was based on something found by Joan Fitzpatrick who was reading

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.040
 a dietary by Sir Thomas Elliott.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.200
 It does sound like someone with a speech impediment saying the word "diary" there.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.760
 But it is a dietary and it's called the Castle of Health.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.480
 So it's about all these different ways that you can gain health in your life and there

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.920
 is a category of exercise called strong or violent exercise where he recommends all these

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.440
 things you can do like digging heavy soil or doing resistance training which is, I don't

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.280
 know if he invented this but basically you have to lift up your arms to the sides while

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.320
 your friend is trying to hold them in place.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 I don't think he invented most of it because it was all from Galen, wasn't it, and from

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.880
 the classical people.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.440
 He was kind of translating what the classics had said.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.560
 There was another guy called Linnaker, not Gary Linnaker I don't think because it's spelled

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 different.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.880
 But he was doing the same thing at the same time but he was translating Galen from Greek

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.400
 to Latin because he wanted doctors to be able to know this stuff but he didn't want

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.840
 normal people to be able to tell what was wrong with them whereas Elliott thought no everyone

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.600
 should be able to know what's wrong with them.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:26.800
 It's basically the doodling what's wrong with you if it's day, and I think we like Elliott,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800
 right?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.920
 You could blow into wind instruments as well if you wanted to help your intestines work better.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.640
 Yes, also singing or crying.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.320
 Crying, apparently you read that, right?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.200
 And I did look into crying to see if it's good for you and according to, this is admittedly

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
 from Quarress.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 I'm not sure how true it is but it was asked.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.480
 They said if you cry for an hour then you would use up 78 calories and I worked out that's

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.520
 about the same as 40 grams of ice cream.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.640
 So if you cry for an hour and eat 40 grams of ice cream, you're on a level thing.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.520
 No one's ever cried for an hour and eat that little ice cream after it.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.920
 Can I just quickly say one of the things you recommended in this text because we were

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.560
 saying that he's recommending things in English to make them clear of normal people.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.000
 Yeah, I just want to read a sentence to you from the text.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.320
 As touching things, proceeding exercise, as much as it is to be feared, least by vehement

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.640
 exercise, any of the excriments of the belly or bladder should hastily be received into

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.520
 the habit of the body by the violence of the heat kindled by exercise, also least something

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.920
 which is whole by, by heaviness of excriments or violence.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.840
 So he just goes on and on and on and he says that that's about a third of the way through

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840
 that sentence.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.840
 Do you know what that's about?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.520
 I think one of the things he's saying is you should warm up so you don't shit yourself

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.520
 when you exercise.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.680
 Yes, he is saying that and he also, because he got this from Gaelin as well, he's saying that

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.640
 you should always go to the toilet just before you exercise and the reason is if you don't

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.440
 do that, then the exercise will kind of drive your waist deeper and deeper into your body

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.040
 and you'll never be able to get rid of it.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040
 Oh no.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.480
 But the body is not a never-ending pit.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.680
 If you drive your waist further and further down, it does emerge from the other end.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 But we know.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
 That's what we know now.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.000
 But no, did he think it would go into your legs?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 I don't think so.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.120
 Sure, we've got people within you, deeper and drive you.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.480
 It's more than like that, so when you get older and you've got this swollen feet, that actually

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.160
 is based in some truth because if you do go for a run, you quite often get an attack of

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.280
 diarrhea about 40 minutes in, don't you?

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280
 Do you?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.280
 Do you?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280
 I don't.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.280
 No, I don't either.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.600
 It's a very common thing, it doesn't affect everyone, but it affects a large proportion

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 of the people.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.280
 I don't maybe one quarter of the people in this room, for instance, I guess.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.000
 It's a bit like that time, you told us that when anyone drinks coffee, they shit themselves.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.640
 Again, these are all hypothetical, they're just things that I've read, and have read up a

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.640
 lot on this sort of thing.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.440
 I guess pull a ratcliff, but I thought that was a fairly solid poo.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440
 Oh, God.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.440
 From what I read.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.480
 I've never run anywhere for longer than 37 minutes, so I've actually never had this.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480
 There you go.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.520
 Just add an extra three, you know.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.000
 James did a half marathon recently.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 I did.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.400
 I ran for a lot longer than 37 minutes because I didn't run very fast, and I didn't

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.160
 shit myself, which was the main thing I was aiming for.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.160
 Yeah, really.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
 Made some money for charity, didn't shit myself.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.840
 A good day all round.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.840
 Thomas Jefferson used to cure his diarrhea by riding horseback, and I believe without a

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.080
 saddle, and that was, yeah, he claimed that cured his diarrhea in the first bout that

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.080
 he had.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.080
 Wow.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.080
 Yeah.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.600
 What did the horse claim?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 This time, Thomas Elliott, he was a bit of a professional suck up, because his first

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.560
 book that he wrote was called The Book of the Governer, and it basically just said how great

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560
 kings are.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.560
 Oh, really?

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.560
 Yeah.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.560
 All the way through.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560
 It just says, oh, aren't kings amazing?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.400
 And then a few years later, he got a job from the king who sent him as his ambassador to the

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400
 Emperor Charles V.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400
 Yeah.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.040
 So his job was to basically negotiate the divorce with Catherine of Oregon.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.120
 So he was working for Henry VIII, and he was one of the people Henry VIII sent to Europe

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.840
 to say, look, the Catholics in Europe are really pissed off with me.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840
 Can you make it all okay?

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840
 Yes.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.040
 And the Church of England was created.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.880
 But he was also quite cool, because he was a supporter of Learned Women, which was quite

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.880
 unusual at the time.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.880
 This is the thing he sort of got from Thomas Moore, but he wrote a book called Defense of Good

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880
 Women.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.080
 And the idea was at the time, a lot of people thought it was quite bad for women to learn

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.560
 to read or be educated or talk quite dangerous for them, but he said in his book Defense of Good

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.640
 Women, it's good for women to be educated so that they can provide intellectual companionship

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640
 for their husbands.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.960
 Which is a step in the right direction, guys.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960
 Yeah.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.880
 And the really out loud thing being good for your health was quite a persistent idea.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.840
 So I came across a thing written in 1816 called the Code of Health and Long Gevity, which

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.280
 is another basically exercise manual book.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.560
 And it also said that loud reading and speaking are often good substitutes for other kinds

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.560
 of exercise.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.560
 And it says, hence the longevity of school masters, because they don't really move around

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.560
 very much.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.920
 But they do speak loudly a lot.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:08.320
 It also says that because speaking loudly is a healthful exercise, it's one reason why

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.480
 women require less bodily exercise than men since they are often more laquacious.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.000
 I've got a lot of sexist facts today.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.240
 I didn't realize until researching this fact that reading aloud at parties and social gatherings

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.480
 was a thing that we used to do.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.480
 Yeah.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.480
 I wonder if you've got all these looks on the tube.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.600
 No, it's such a wonderful world to be the idea that you would sit in a room and someone

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.640
 would just read to you and you would all join in.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.960
 And there's all these examples of, in the 1700s, particularly women in letters correspondences,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.960
 sending each other recommendations for types of books to be read out loud while they were

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.280
 doing certain things like Notting Work, for example, apparently Boswell's Tour of the

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.240
 Hebrides is a fantastic book to be read out loud.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.360
 Just tying knots in pieces of string while you're notting.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360
 Yeah.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.440
 But yeah, there's many examples of good books to be read for situations.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.840
 I'm sorry, we're sure it's not knitting.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.160
 It's said Notting, and so I assume that was a 17th century.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.600
 Anything that's not knitting is Notting.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600
 No, good call.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.920
 It's one of those things that I just assumed.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.000
 Oh, that's a weird hobby at the past.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 I don't need to look that up.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Yeah.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Maybe they were all sailors, these women.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.240
 They could have been making rope.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.240
 Yeah.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.600
 Is this what you're talking about, they're in factories, they would have people reading to

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 them.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
 They used to do that as well.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600
 There was a cigar.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.640
 Monter Cristo cigars, in fact, are named after the fact that it was the favourite book to

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.040
 be read out in the factory at the lectern.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040
 Wow.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.040
 So that's what they say.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.120
 The guy who took over it rebranded the company, and one of their favourite books was

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120
 the counter-monter Cristo.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120
 You don't have to work.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.840
 They were a fuck of a long time to get through the whole book.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.200
 I really want to quit my job, but he hasn't even got out of prison yet.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200
 That's better though.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.200
 You want to have a long read to keep the factory work entertained.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.840
 If it was called the very hungry caterpillar cigar company, you'd have a lot of very bored

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840
 employees.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840
 Right.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:14.120
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Chisinski.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.320
 My fact this week is that scientists in Georgia just blew a six metre wide soap bubble.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320
 Wow.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320
 Wow.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320
 What room did they do it in?

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.040
 It's not the first question I was thinking of asking.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.320
 I just thought, that's wider than this room.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.760
 I think the room we're recording in now, and it's probably wider than most of the rooms

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.240
 I am in my home.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:39.080
 They actually had to have a special, extra-large room built just for this bubble.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.800
 I can't believe you don't have a job as an interviewer on national television.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.280
 We're cutting live that, Andy, who was on the scene.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.880
 Presumably this wasn't the room back then.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.920
 Prince Andrew, what room was it at Peterings Press that you were in?

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.920
 The whole main restaurant, eh?

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.240
 All right.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.240
 So what room was it in?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
 It was outdoors.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.240
 It was outdoors.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240
 It was outdoors, yeah.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.240
 I believe so.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240
 Risky for a bubble, though.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240
 But, potentially the best.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.240
 But, at least you can get one that big.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.040
 It's an outdoors, the biggest room of all.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.280
 I think I've certainly seen him practicing outdoors, or I didn't see where they did the

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280
 real thing.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280
 Yeah.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280
 But yeah, outdoors on the ground.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:31.760
 So this was a study published in Physical Review Fluids, and one of the authors was inspired

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.560
 when he went to Barcelona, and he saw street performers blowing these.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.080
 They have those massive bubbles in his love, and they don't blow them.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.960
 They sort of weave them.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960
 You know what I'm talking about?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.760
 It's a bit of rope in between sticks.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.240
 With sticks and rope.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.480
 And he thought how an earth is something so thin stay together when it gets so big, and

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.680
 there's that pressure on it.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.680
 And so they tried to blow a massive one, and they did.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.880
 And they worked out the way of doing it, and it's not very interesting if you don't know

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880
 a lot about it.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.440
 Is this the biggest bubble ever made?

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.600
 I believe it's the biggest soap bubble ever made.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600
 Wow.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.640
 How big can bubbles get, I mean, how big is your room first of all, but then how big can

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640
 they get?

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.640
 Is it like they can get...

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.280
 I think we don't know a maximum.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.760
 Well, there are records.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.120
 So Guinness keeps a lot of records.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120
 OK.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.360
 So 2015, the record was broken then.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.240
 I don't know if this new 6-meter one has beaten it, but the largest bubble then was 3,400

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.960
 cubic feet in volume.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.680
 And that I genuinely have written down is about the size of a classroom.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.520
 It's probably why I was asking about the room thing.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.760
 But the weird thing about that is how do you measure, because it's not perfectly round,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.040
 and it's not an independent adjudicator from Guinness needs to turn up and measure it.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.600
 And what they did is they photographed it just as it was finished.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.280
 And then the scientist independently used photographs from...

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.520
 I've written this down, orthogonal angles, orthogonal angles, which I've net is a term

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.520
 I've never heard before.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.960
 But basically, I think photographed from a lot of different angles, and you build up

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.480
 a picture of how big it is.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.120
 How big do you say that one was?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.720
 That was 3,400 cubic feet.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720
 Yeah.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.320
 So this one that Anna's talking about was 100,000 litres.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320
 So do you, Matt?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.840
 I am.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.400
 They said it was big enough to swallow a Volkswagen Beetle.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.400
 Nice.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400
 That's big.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400
 That is big.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.720
 You know, as you're saying, there's a bunch of bubble records.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.320
 I think my favourite one I found on the Guinness site is most bubbles blown with a tarantula

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.320
 in the mouth.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.400
 That's an existing record.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400
 Did you watch the footage?

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.400
 No, I saw a photo.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.240
 There's a video of this guy who loves this tarantula, but he loves bubbles as well.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.880
 And he just pops his tarantula in his mouth and then blows bubbles with.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.440
 Is the tarantula allowed to help like blowing because you've got two people blowing, aren't

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.440
 you?

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440
 That's true.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440
 Has he really broken the record?

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.520
 It's the weirdest record attempt you've ever seen, because he's just got a tarantula sitting

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.560
 inside his mouth live, and it's his pet, it's his favourite.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.200
 And then he blows bubbles for a while, then it just crawls out of his mouth onto his hand.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.960
 And what was the previous record?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.440
 Were there lots of people who thought this was something that many people have done?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.360
 He got 119 bubbles blown in 30 seconds.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.560
 Surely he could just do one and he's broken the record.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.560
 Why bother?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.480
 There's also most people put inside a soap bubble in 30 seconds, and that's 13.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.320
 And this brings me to an important point, which might speak to what Andy said before

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.120
 about the Guinness bubble.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.080
 So the putty inside the soap bubble, again, it's one of those ones on sticks where you sort

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.960
 of people jump inside it and it's woven up through them.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.280
 And that's not a bubble as far as this study was concerned, because the bubble just needs

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.400
 to go all the way around, this full sphere.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.320
 So I don't know if the one that broke the record was still being blown out of the aperture.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.060
 But I think the bubble needs to be self-contained, complete.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.080
 And it's an example of science being very clever.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.180
 The fact that bubbles will always try and be a sphere.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.560
 So if you've got a piece of string and you're told to lay out on a table with the biggest

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.400
 possible area, then you'll naturally put it in a circle.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.480
 So if you've got a piece of string of the same length, a circle is a shape which will give

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.480
 it the biggest area.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.960
 And in the same way, the bubble kind of knows that.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.280
 Well, when the first people who studied this was a guy called Antoine Plateau, he is probably

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.680
 the world's first bubble scientist.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.880
 And he worked out that not only the bubbles always turn into spheres, if left on their own,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.480
 if you put them together, they always join an angle of 120 degrees.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.480
 What?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.080
 And again, there's mathematical reasons why this is the case.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.360
 It's all about packing and stuff like that.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.760
 But this guy Plateau is really amazing.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.320
 He had problems as a child.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.480
 He lost his parents and he had mental problems.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.560
 And so they sent him away to the country to get better.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.280
 Unfortunately, it was June 1815 and they sent him to the village of Waterloo.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.280
 Oh my God.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.280
 Oh my God.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.280
 I know.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.720
 And so he was there when the battle was happening.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.720
 But then...

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720
 Was he all right?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.040
 He was fine because he managed to live to be a bubble scientist.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.120
 And the best bubble scientist there ever was, probably.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.800
 Well, his career started very well, didn't it, Plateau?

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.560
 But then, unfortunately, it's kind of very good, very good.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.680
 And he did his bubble work despite being blind a lot of his work.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.680
 Because when he was older, he was blind.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.080
 He lost his sight in an experiment to see how long he could look at the sun.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080
 Oh no.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.080
 Oh no.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.600
 He had to give us a record of its day.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 Yeah.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.600
 Just an experiment.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.600
 Oh, that's wonderful.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.600
 Yeah.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.680
 But I mean, he's one of the greats in this field.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.440
 And he doesn't sound like that smart guy, does he?

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.440
 He really doesn't.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.800
 Because Newton did that as well, didn't he?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800
 Yeah.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.800
 Yeah, he did.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.600
 He reported that his eye's her afterwards and he went blind for a couple of days.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.520
 And so I don't know why people continue to do it.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.520
 Newton was an idiot.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.520
 He used to put bockins in the back of his eyes to see if he could look behind them.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.520
 Okay, come on.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.080
 Um, do you remember, I think I'm out of time, you guys, that I used to come on stage

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.880
 every day after a bubble performer.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.880
 Did you?

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.120
 Yeah, when we were doing ostentatious at the fringe, the act before us was the amazing

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.120
 bubble man.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120
 Cool.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.120
 What did he do?

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.120
 Unbelievable things.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.120
 Was it big?

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120
 Was it a number of bubbles?

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120
 Was it a size, the shape?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.480
 Was it a tarantula involved?

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.000
 No tarantulas that I saw, but I only ever saw the last 10 minutes of his act, but how big

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 was the room?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 It was.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.800
 It was quite a big room.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.800
 It was.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:12.280
 He always demanded playing huge rooms, even though he was only about to help people.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.800
 He would, he did it quite like, he would, um, he did bubbles that he stabbed and then they

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.560
 survived or he would make bubbles inside other bubbles and he would do bubbles filled

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560
 with smoke.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.560
 He would.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.520
 I made a bubble inside another, but like every child who's had bubble mixes done that.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.520
 What?

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.520
 That's hard.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.520
 Well, that's so embarrassing, Andy.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.400
 Less time reading, more time blowing bubbles than a kid for you, so I would recommend it.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.800
 I was in one corner of the playground blowing bubbles and Andy was doing his jane ostentatious

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.880
 improvisation at the other side.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.880
 Did he, um, spill some of his bubble juice on the stage and you kept slipping on it, because

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.880
 it would be slippy, wasn't it?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.840
 It was very slippy, but he always mopped up very carefully afterwards, yeah.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.840
 But it was.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.840
 No, it was a messy old thing.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840
 Yeah.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840
 They call it bubble juice.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.840
 Did they?

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.840
 Yeah, the, um, bubbles do.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.840
 Like the people.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.840
 And they're called bubbles.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.960
 The people who like bubbles are called bubbles, or if they really like it, they're called

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960
 bubble heads.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.320
 And they call the juice, bubble juice.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.360
 I think if you're being called a bubbler, you must like bubbles enough to be called a

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.360
 bubble head.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.360
 Maybe not.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.360
 Come on, mate.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.360
 In all these subcultures, you need levels.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360
 That's true.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360
 Yeah.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.720
 I'm going to fall out of the stuff.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.880
 So I quite like bubbles.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.320
 Does that make me anything in this world?

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.320
 No, I don't think so.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.320
 No, okay.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320
 Yeah.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.760
 It's like saying, I've read all the Harry Potter's and someone says, what house are you sorted

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.560
 into and you say, oh, I haven't done that.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.880
 You're not a potterhead.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.920
 You're just a reader of potter.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.920
 Okay.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.920
 That's a good analogy.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920
 I'm fine with that.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.920
 Yeah, so it was pretty close.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.920
 And then I'm fine with that.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.280
 Are you fine with not being a bubble head?

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.280
 No, I'm vivid.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280
 And then you better get into it.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.200
 Because it is a quite big subculture, the bubblers.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.200
 And this actually was.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.200
 Getting bigger all the time.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.960
 I think it's going to burst.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.480
 So they were consulted heavily in the study that I mentioned at the start of this fact,

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.080
 when the physicists were looking for advice on how to blow the best bubbles.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.280
 All these nerds, suddenly, their use became apparent because they were always exchanging

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.080
 like, this is the best liquid to use.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.080
 This is the best.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080
 Juice.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.080
 Juice.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080
 Sorry.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.120
 This is the best juice to use.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.560
 And actually, do you know what the best soap is?

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.560
 No.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560
 No.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.560
 Well, it's not surprising, actually, if you watched the adverts.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.560
 Imperial leather.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.240
 Oh, it's not imperial liquid.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.240
 It's fairy.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.240
 Isn't it?

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.640
 This is actually according to another study I read.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.600
 So studies on bubbles just abound.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600
 It's a huge area.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.680
 And it is a 2006 paper called Giant Soap Curtains for Public Presentations.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.680
 And it's--

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.920
 Soap Curtains sounds disgusting.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.920
 Yeah.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.920
 I don't even know what it's supposed to be, but it sounds disgusting.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.240
 I also very ineffective soap curtains.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.440
 I had a pair of soap curtains for this.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.880
 They kept that almost none of the light.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.560
 And there was always a rainbow outside.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.880
 So this, it was actually quite good.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.080
 It was by some physicists, too.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.280
 First of all, said the question we're always asked is, are we paid to do this?

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.120
 No, we're high level researchers, which is doing this to spread the word.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.480
 And it was saying soap curtains are a really good thing to engage kids.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.000
 So it's basically like a huge soap bubble, but it's very flat.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.040
 It's drawn between two big poles.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.840
 And you sort of wash soap down it like a waterfall.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.240
 And it creates this constantly moving, long bubble.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.680
 Anyway, they looked into it.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.800
 And they said the best washing up liquid for surface elasticity

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.520
 is a proctor and gamble, which is marketed as drift in Europe

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.800
 and dawn in the US.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.680
 And fairy in the UK.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.560
 But if you're in France, terrible news

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.200
 doesn't contain the crucial ingredient that makes it elastic.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.240
 It doesn't know.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.040
 So you can't blow such big bubbles in France.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.960
 What is it? Can you add it to it?

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.120
 I don't actually know what it is.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.840
 I think it's probably some long chemical word.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.920
 But yeah, you'd have to add it.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.600
 You'd have to order your own from elsewhere.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.600
 Oh, wow.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.040
 So desulée.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.600
 That's very good.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.880
 On the bubble Wikipedia, they also asked what's the best bubble juice

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.480
 in the FAQs and the answer is not quite so clear-cut.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.320
 It says, "Everyone has a different definition of the best bubble.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.360
 There is no actual best juice.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.240
 Because what one person defines as the best bubble

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.080
 may not align with how another person

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.080
 defines the best bubble."

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.440
 It feels like there's a divorce behind that.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.320
 Is there a bubble--

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.960
 do you mean there's like a separate mini Wikipedia

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.640
 for bubbles?

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:14.960
 Yes.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.400
 So these guys from Georgia, who Anna was talking about,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.680
 they went into a big online community of bubbles

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.480
 like Anna says.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.400
 And I think one part of it was the bubble Wikipedia.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.560
 Yeah, so cool.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.560
 So cool.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.640
 And actually, bubbles is really important.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.720
 If you're studying it, bubbles are really important.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.200
 Because when you work out how they exist,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.000
 it can help you in glass making.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.080
 It can help you in other industrial processes.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.120
 I read one that's called, "It helps in building lab

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.640
 on a chip bubble logic devices."

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.960
 I don't know what they are.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.160
 So for all I know, there might be 100 of my phone.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.800
 And also artificial viruses for vaccines.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.320
 Oh, cool.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.240
 Do you need to learn about bubbles if you want to make those?

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.440
 I found one other bubble that is not on Earth.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.760
 It's in space.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.960
 These are two super bubbles at the center of a distant galaxy.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.800
 They're massive cavities filled with gas.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.160
 And they're full of charged particles.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.400
 And the particles are 100 times stronger than we've

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.360
 even made it certain.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.920
 They're 100 times stronger than any particles

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.920
 found on Earth in terms of their charge.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.760
 Okay.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.000
 Charger stronger.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.440
 One of these bubbles is 3,600 light years across.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.920
 And the other one is 4,900 light years across.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.840
 Think of the size of room you'd need to--

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.600
 Wow.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.520
 So yeah.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.720
 What happens if they pop?

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.240
 I don't know.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.240
 But the Neptune's orbit around the sun

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.120
 is less than 1,000th of one light year across,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.240
 just to put that in perspective.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.840
 Into a perspective that you still can't even begin

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.160
 to understand.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.680
 Yeah, cheers, mate.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.280
 One other space bubble that's dangerous to humans

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.640
 is the space bubble that we create.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.840
 So astronauts in the International Space Station,

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.160
 when they go to sleep, when they exhale,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.680
 they build this bubble of carbon dioxide that sits

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.760
 in front of their face.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.800
 That can be very dangerous.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.520
 So every astronaut, when they go to sleep,

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.040
 they have to sleep with their head near an air vent

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.520
 because they need that bubble pushed away from them.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.360
 Otherwise, they can suffocate on it,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.800
 wake up with huge migraines, potentially die.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.880
 You could just sleep with a very long straw in your mouth.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.000
 No, because then the bubble would start

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.640
 at the end of the straw.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.480
 Thank god you're not.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.680
 You're just moving the problem.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.080
 Imagine if you were a NASA designer.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.520
 It wasn't really long straw, though.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.880
 I'm sure it would be fine.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.960
 What if you had-- you went to sleep and you

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.840
 invented this thing.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.240
 It's like a tiny straw.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.760
 But as the time goes on, the straw gets longer and longer

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.240
 and longer.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.920
 That's a good idea.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.760
 That's a good idea.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.800
 That's the Nokia straw.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800
 Yeah.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.880
 You are lying after all, aren't you?

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.360
 Absolutely right.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.200
 So good.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.720
 This thing sells itself.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.240
 One more thing about bubbles, which I really like,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.600
 is penguins.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.080
 We're not quite sure how they do this,

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.040
 but we think they basically blow bubbles out of their beaks.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.200
 And then the bubbles go onto their body.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.960
 And when they're swimming, it means they can go quicker

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.200
 through the water because the bubbles

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.160
 mean there's left friction with the water.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.680
 Really?

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.920
 And that's the only way they can get the speeds.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.160
 Well, you know a penguin kind of swims up

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.320
 and then can jump out of the water onto the land.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:15.520
 Yes.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.640
 They won't be able to do that if they

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.360
 didn't have bubbles around the whole body.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.400
 Wow.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.040
 And there's an idea that we could make ships

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.080
 with a lot of bubbles around the hull.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.960
 And then that could cut fuel consumption by about 15%.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.880
 That's worth doing.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.360
 Very good.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.280
 Oh, get penguins to dribble on our ships.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.480
 And then where's that?

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.640
 Just tie one penguin at the front of every ship.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.320
 With a straw could get bigger as well.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.120
 Yeah, put it in the place of that pointless, like,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.280
 fit-statch-ever woman that's always at the front of ships.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.960
 But that was the last time you saw a ship.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.240
 It was the last time you got a ferry to France.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.000
 I only traveled on Viking ships.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.760
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.160
 And that is my fact.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.280
 My fact this week is that before she became famous,

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.240
 Marilyn Monroe was named the Artechoque Queen

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.400
 of Castroville, California, Miss Cheesecake

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.160
 by Stars and Stripes magazine.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.280
 And Queen of the radio plane company

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.520
 where she worked assembling military drones

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.440
 during World War II.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.200
 So cool.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.720
 Look, interesting career moment.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.400
 She sort of had a lot of early prizes

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.960
 before she became the true Marilyn Monroe.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.480
 Yeah.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.720
 But she even caught Marilyn Monroe that much.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.000
 She wasn't.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.440
 She was Norma Jean at that point.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.480
 She was at the time she got the Artechoque Queen.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.440
 Yes, that's true.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:30.960
 Yes.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.360
 Because that was at a time when she wasn't famous,

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.960
 but she was almost famous.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.840
 Because she was on a promotional tour for Diamonds.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.640
 There was a guy who was selling Diamonds.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.040
 And he also was a movie star promoter.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.800
 And he wanted to promote his star by getting a young star

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.800
 let in.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.840
 And he asked this star let called Doreen Nash

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.520
 if she would do it.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.160
 She said, yes, she canceled it in the last minute.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.680
 And then Marilyn Monroe came along and did it instead.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.200
 But she was famous enough that she was

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.400
 doing autographs and stuff.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.080
 Yes, exactly.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.920
 She was at that point.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.920
 She was given the sort of honorary role,

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.720
 rather than having to compete for it.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.680
 She became the queen of the Artechoque.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.480
 Yes.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.720
 And what actually happened is she was in another,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.680
 she was in some like room or something.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.840
 And some guys who were like a room.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.360
 Tell me more.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.480
 And there was a load of Artechoque salesmen

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.800
 who just saw their chance and then ran over to her

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.760
 and gave her a sash.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.200
 Held a load of Artechoque's took a photo and that was it.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.720
 Yes, no.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.200
 There was nothing else happening there.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.880
 So these are the things that Marilyn Monroe

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.040
 or Norma Jean did before she became super famous.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.000
 Well, they were in the '40s, weren't they, really?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.880
 And she, her first small break, I reckon, was probably

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.320
 in World War II when she was working for this kind of,

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.480
 as you said, like a drone company where she was,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.840
 so what they did was they had these remote control planes,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.880
 which the Americans wanted to use for basically reconnaissance,

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.160
 I think, and she was spraying the parachute,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.120
 the mini parachutes for these planes, is that right?

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.400
 And target practice, too.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.640
 Some of them were used for some of the drones

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.160
 were just for anti-aircraft gunners to have a go on.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.240
 OK.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.600
 And OK, because then you don't have to fly the drone

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.920
 as far away as you'd have to fly a full-size one

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.520
 in order to get the corresponding target practice.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.000
 You don't have to kill a pilot every time you're doing anti-aircraft training.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.920
 The best of both worlds.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.840
 So many advantages.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.680
 So anyway, there was this idea that people

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.960
 should start photographing women who were working

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.560
 towards the war effort as part of this PR campaign,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.560
 pro-war PR campaign, and she was one of these women photographed,

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.480
 and that was her first small break.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.440
 And the person who instructed this campaign to happen

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.560
 was one Captain Ronald Reagan.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.440
 What was it, indeed?

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.720
 So Marilyn Monroe may never have existed if a one for Reagan.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.920
 So when Marilyn Monroe first became more famous,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.560
 one of her things they tried to sell her as was an mm-girl.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.240
 OK.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.120
 That's mm-m-m-m-girl.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.520
 And that was in response to Anne Sheridan,

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.680
 who was a previous actor, actually still there at the time,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.720
 but she was known as a mm-girl, because she had a lot of mm-f.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.200
 OK.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.360
 And when people said, "Well, why are you calling Marilyn Monroe that, 'Mmm girl?'"

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:11.200
 Her publicist said, "Well, it's because whenever she goes to Detroit, that's what people say. Whenever she walks past, they all go, 'Mmm, Detroit!'"

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.200
 - "Why Detroit?" - "Well, according to her publicist, it's because people in Detroit can't whistle."

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.200
 [laughter]

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.200
 "What is this story, James?"

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:23.200
 "That's what the publicist said. Why did the publicist just say her name is Marilyn Monroe?"

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.200
 "Mmm, I know, and her middle name's Margaret Michael."

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.200
 [laughter]

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.200
 "It's a really stupid story. That's why I bring it up."

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.200
 "People in Detroit can't whistle."

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.200
 "It sounds like the panics lie of..."

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.200
 "It sounds like the panics lie of..."

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.200
 [laughter]

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.200
 I was looking a bit into her first marriage,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.200
 which is probably her at least no marriage, so a guy called James Doherty,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.200
 and they were married for four years in the late 1940s.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:53.200
 And he always said that he never claims to have any insights on Marilyn Monroe.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.200
 I never knew Marilyn Monroe. I knew and loved Norma Jean.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.200
 Spelt with an extra ear on the end, by the way, which no one ever does.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.200
 So, Jean was spelled J-E-A-N-E.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.200
 But he had a weird career.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.200
 He went on to work for the LAPD for basically his whole life,

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.200
 where he helped to found and train.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.200
 And he was the lead trainer of America's first ever SWAT team.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.200
 - What I see. - You know, like a SWAT team, like elite police.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.200
 - Yeah. - Not a man who would go into hostage situations and stuff like that.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.200
 He also, when he was working as a policeman, at one stage,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.200
 he was doing crowd control at the movie premiere of a Marilyn Monroe film,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.200
 which was the, yeah, the asphalt jungle.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.200
 - Wow. - It seems a bit heavy handed to dispatch a SWAT team to Marilyn Monroe.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.200
 - Well, he, he, that wasn't really painful for him,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.200
 because he was never allowed to actually watch Marilyn Monroe film,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200
 because his wife panned him.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.200
 I think you would be a jealous of him if you were the second wife to Marilyn Monroe.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.200
 But he had a really awkward incident when, in the 1950s,

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.200
 he was asked to be on a reality TV show, which was to tell the truth.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200
 It was called to tell the truth of the game show.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.200
 And they had a segment which they do on buscox,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.200
 which, where they bring sort of a number of people out,

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.200
 and you have to guess which one of them is the real ex.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.200
 - Wow. - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.200
 - And they had the contestants had to guess which one is the real ex-husband of Marilyn Monroe.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.200
 - Wow. - Did they guess him, do you know?

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.200
 - I actually don't know if they guessed him right.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.200
 What I do know is he lied to his wife, so he could be on the show.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.200
 And when she found out, terrible like, as obviously she was watching TV.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.200
 - And there was only one channel at the time.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.200
 Incredibly stupid lie.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.200
 - So when she found out, she threw a pan at him.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.200
 - Oh, yeah. - She threw a pan, yeah.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.200
 - Well, they did do that in those days,

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.200
 didn't they throw pans at each other?

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.200
 - So this fact was partly about Marilyn Monroe being Artichoke Queen.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.200
 - Yes. - I found out a few other

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.200
 - Queens. - Okay.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.200
 - Food related queens that America has.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.200
 There's a great article in the Wall Street Journal

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.200
 which described the National Pork Queen,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.200
 the Ohio Queen of Beef, and various other queens.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.200
 And this is a thing where they all face off against each other

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.200
 to be Miss Agriculture.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.200
 - Oh, wow. - So it's like a massive derby

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.200
 of queens of different foods.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.200
 - Did they fight each other with massive cuts

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.200
 of the meats that they had?

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.200
 - Who would your money be on?

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.200
 Would it be on the bacon, the sausage?

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.200
 - I'm thinking a big cow corpse.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.200
 - Yeah. - Queen of Beef.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.200
 - If you could wield one of those, you're unbeatable.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.200
 - Definitely, because you're not gonna be in much trouble

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.200
 up against the egg queen, which is another one of these queens.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.200
 There's a torn queen, wheat queen,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.200
 the separate lamb and wool queens, which is very weird.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.200
 Anyway, they have to be, you know,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.200
 there's a sort of element that they're all quite good looking young women,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.200
 obviously, because that's one of the things they have there.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.200
 But they also have to give speeches on the products they represent

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.200
 and they have to converse while being watched by judges

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.200
 about their chosen products.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.200
 And the judges are looking to see

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.200
 who best represents farming spirit.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.200
 And then the winner gets crowned queen of agriculture

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.200
 and goes around speaking about agriculture

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200
 and how important it is and all of this.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.200
 - Yeah, so if you're the egg queen,

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.200
 do they ask you just questions about eggs

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.200
 or are they asking, 'cause you're actually representing

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.200
 the whole of agriculture, so you'd need to know about beef

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.200
 and lamb and wool and everything?

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.200
 - I think in these regionals,

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.200
 you only have to answer questions on your specialist food.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.200
 I'm not certain by think I said.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.200
 But yeah, if you're promoted to queen of agriculture,

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.200
 it's like if you've just been home secretary for years

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.200
 and then you become Prime Minister or something.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.200
 How do you know about all the other departments?

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.200
 - It's a really big step.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.200
 - It's a huge step.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 I don't think they should be allowed this kind of responsibility.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.200
 - I think you should have to be every single minister

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.200
 before you become Prime Minister.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.200
 - And every single queen.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.200
 - Yes.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.200
 - I think Boris Johnson needs to be a sausage queen.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.200
 (all laughing)

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.200
 Actually, never mind.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.200
 - Sounds like a bit of prison terminology there.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.200
 (all laughing)

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.200
 - Yeah, industry queens have been quite a big thing

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.200
 for about 100 years, haven't they?

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.200
 I think they kick, which are mascots for certain industries.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.200
 And I think we cover them a bit in the queue series of QI.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200
 - We did, yeah.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.200
 - But if it's gone out, yeah, I'm not sure if it's gone out yet.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.200
 - Absolutely.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.200
 - I might have done.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.200
 - You may have seen this or you're about to see it on QI.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.200
 But they were people who represented their industries.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.200
 They would have a coal queen or railway queen.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.200
 And there's actually, we did cover the sausage queen

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.200
 because 15 years old, and they were so important

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.200
 and considered such diplomats for their industries

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.200
 that they did things like this 15 year old sausage queen

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.200
 was put straight on a train to Moscow in 1936

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200
 to meet Joseph Stalin.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.200
 And talk about how great British sausages were.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.200
 - Did she have sausages to present?

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200
 - She must have done.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.200
 - She must have done.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.200
 - As per so.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.200
 - I've seen a picture where she's wearing sausages

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.200
 around her neck and on her head and stuff.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.200
 - It's a very odd picture.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.200
 - Oh, that's a weird cra--

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.200
 - She's wearing a sort of hula skirt made of sausages.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.200
 - Yeah.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.200
 As Stalin, you would have to think,

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.200
 "These people are trying to take the piss, aren't they?"

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.200
 - Yeah.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.200
 - I'm in charge of Russia.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.200
 And they're sending their sausage queen.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200
 - Apparently they do great diplomats.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.200
 Well, that's one of the main reasons

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.200
 that Russia eventually joined other side

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.200
 in the second world war.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.200
 It's thought it was because of her.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:59.200
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.200
 And that is James.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.200
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there is a salamander

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200
 in Bosnia who hasn't moved from the same spot

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200
 since 2010.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.200
 - Was it, and was sure it's alive?

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.200
 - Well, I'm not sure it's currently alive.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.200
 I'm sure it was alive in 2018 when they last checked.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.200
 It might have moved since then.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.200
 But I'm assuming if it stayed in the same place

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.200
 between 2010 and 2018,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.200
 it probably is still there.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.200
 - Yeah.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.200
 - Is that fair to assume?

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.200
 - I think so, although it's so.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.200
 - In the study that was done,

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.200
 there was a suggestion that they can't be positive

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.200
 it hasn't moved.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.200
 It might have gone away and just returned

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.200
 by the time they go back.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.200
 - Every time they checked, it was always

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.200
 in exactly the same spot.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.200
 - Yeah.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.200
 - But that doesn't mean that it's sneaking off

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.200
 and then when it sees them coming, it runs back in.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200
 - Yeah, it's possible.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200
 - It's like having a toy story toys.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.200
 - Exactly.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.200
 - As soon as the kid come back in the room,

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.200
 obviously they're going to be back in the same place.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.200
 - Back to your places, yeah.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.200
 - Okay, so this is an Olm.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.200
 It's a white salamander.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.200
 It's known in Bosnia as the human fish

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.200
 because it has a pink skin color.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.200
 And there is a couple of scientists in Budapest,

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.200
 whose names I'm not going to try and pronounce.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.200
 Gurgly Balash, maybe.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.200
 - Gurgly Balash.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.200
 (laughing)

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.200
 - It's joking on water or something.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.200
 (laughing)

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.200
 - It's a strong name.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.200
 - Imagine it's not that at all.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.200
 You just completely, someone said,

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.200
 "Hey, you're on the...

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.200
 "No such thing as a fish podcast, a sweet couple."

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.200
 (laughing)

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.200
 - Unfortunately, he was once asked to introduce himself,

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.200
 and his name's just Balash,

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.200
 but he was just following a mouthful of water at the time.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.200
 (laughing)

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.200
 - Well, actually, I mean, he was diving into the water

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.200
 to inject these Olms with a pigment.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.200
 And each Olm, they injected with a different shape of pigment.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.200
 And then every now and then,

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.200
 they'd come back and see where they were.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.200
 And the idea was to see how much they're moving.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.200
 And it turns out that most of the Olms move less than 10 meters.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.200
 And about five meters per year was typical.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.200
 And the most active Olm they found

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.200
 moved 38 meters in 230 days.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.200
 And then the guy who I'm talking about

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.200
 was found in exactly the same spot

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.200
 after 2,567 days.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.200
 (laughing)

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.200
 - More than seven years.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.200
 - It's really amazing.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.200
 - And the other thing,

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.200
 I mean, Olms are incredible

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.200
 because they can survive a very long time without eating.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.200
 - Yes. - And they've got, I think, they've tested some

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200
 'cause they have a lab in France,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.200
 because they're very endangered these things.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.200
 And one Olm is known to have survived 12 years

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.200
 without eating anything. - Yes.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.200
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.200
 - They just, like, one little crustacean comes along

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.200
 and they just gobble it all up.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200
 They can eat it whole.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.200
 And then it'll just take them all that time to digest it.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.200
 And they'll just sit around doing nothing

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.200
 until the next one comes along.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.200
 - Well, thinking.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.200
 I think they're meditating.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.200
 They're all sitting there just going,

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.200
 "Oh!"

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.200
 (laughing)

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.200
 - I've actually seen Olms live in the pale flesh.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.200
 Yeah, I went to Slovenia.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.200
 And in the post-Jana caves,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.200
 they have this...

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.200
 You're underground.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.200
 You're in this incredible cave system.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.200
 And then they've just got this booth.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.200
 It's so weird seeing this metal booth.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.200
 And it's like a terrarium for these Olms.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.200
 And they, you can look at them.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.200
 And they keep them there partly to educate the public

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.200
 and partly to conserve them.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.200
 And they're there.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.200
 - Did you see the move?

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.200
 - No, I didn't see the move.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.200
 They stayed very still.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200
 In fact, I have a prop with me,

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.200
 which I've left downstairs related to this.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200
 - Great.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200
 (laughing)

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200
 - Shall I go get it?

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.200
 - Is it going to be good radio?

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200
 - No.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.200
 - Get it.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.200
 (laughing)

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.200
 - Oh, my God.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.200
 - Okay, well, one of these away.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.200
 - I'm not saying people were at Olms.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.200
 (laughing)

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.200
 - I'm just sad because you can't hear it.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.200
 If you said, don't say anything more about Olms while I'm gone.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.200
 - Look, I want to get the prop.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.200
 - He's going to get the prop.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.200
 So, what are we going to say about Andy while he's away?

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.200
 - Who is going to replace him?

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.200
 - Oh, yeah.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.200
 - And the next few months.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.200
 - If you want to replace Andy on those things are first,

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.200
 then please write to podcast@ky.com.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.200
 - Yes.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.200
 - Qualifications?

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.200
 - Great props.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.200
 (laughing)

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.200
 Always bring your props with you.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.200
 It's very important.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.200
 (laughing)

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.200
 - Okay, so Andy has returned.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.200
 - He's been eating off.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.200
 - Please.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.200
 - He's going to turn the heating off.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.200
 - It is something that can't survive in high temperatures.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.200
 - Kind of, because it's a model Olm.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200
 - Wow.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.200
 - So, Andy, you want to explain what Andy's just put on the table?

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.200
 - Yeah, so it's a soft toy penis.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200
 (laughing)

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200
 It's an Olm.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.200
 - If your penis has four legs down,

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.200
 then you need to get a look.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.200
 (laughing)

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.200
 - Yeah, it's a little soft toy Olm.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.200
 I just brought it because I bought it at the caves

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.200
 and I wanted to show you that.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200
 - Yeah, it's really cool.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.200
 I mean, it is quite phallic.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200
 - It is, yeah.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.200
 - This is a lot bigger than the ones they have in the caves.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.200
 (laughing)

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.200
 It's tiny and they've really both beefed this up

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.200
 for the blush toy version.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200
 - Well, you've just turned the heating off,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.200
 so it'll probably get smarter in the next few minutes.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.200
 (laughing)

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.200
 - Anyway, I just, I couldn't,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.200
 we couldn't do it without me bringing in the soft toy.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.200
 - This whole book doesn't work without you bringing this off toy.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.200
 - Maybe you should put a picture of the Olm

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.200
 on your Twitter account.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200
 - Where are we going to do this?

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.200
 - What does it have a name?

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.200
 - No, it doesn't yet.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.200
 - I would call it Sherlock Olms.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200
 - Brilliant.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.200
 - Ah, very strong.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.200
 - Terrible at solving crimes, if you can't.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.200
 (laughing)

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.200
 You just, it's like heating.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.200
 You just have to hope a crime happens directly in front of you.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.200
 (laughing)

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.200
 - So, what, what more can we say about Olms?

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.200
 - Well, David Attenborough loves them.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.200
 - To see.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.200
 - So he picked them in 2012 as one of the 10 endangered species

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.200
 he'd take on his own personal arc.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.200
 And guys, we're not even there.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.200
 I guess we're not endangered.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.200
 - This is so weird, 'cause I have a salamander related

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.200
 Noah's Ark fact, which is that.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.200
 So this is not on related.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.200
 So there's just a brief step away from Olms.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.200
 But there's a giant salamander in China,

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.200
 which is absolutely massive.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.200
 There are about five feet long.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200
 They weigh about 60 kilos.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.200
 And the very first fossil of it found

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.200
 was one of the earliest fossils discovered by humans.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.200
 - Okay.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.200
 - And it was named Homo Deluvie Testis,

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.200
 which means human witness of the flood.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.200
 Because people didn't know what this salamander fossil was.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.200
 And it was thought to be a person who had died

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.200
 in Noah's flood.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.200
 - Wow.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.200
 And if any of you at home thought it meant human floodballs.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.200
 That's just, you know, you learn your lesson better.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.200
 - Not just at home.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.200
 Most Chinese salamanders are eaten in some parts of China.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.200
 I think they are on the endangered.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.200
 - They're endangered.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200
 - They are endangered.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200
 So don't do it kids.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.200
 But they used to eat salamanders in the Southern USA,

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.200
 especially in times of poverty.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.200
 And there is one theory that the term hush puppies

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.200
 originally referred to as salamander.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.200
 Because a hush puppy, before it became like a type of shoe,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.200
 is it?

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.200
 - Yeah.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.200
 - It was like a tiny bit of food that you would eat.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.200
 And the idea was, these salamanders were also known as water puppies.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.200
 And the hush came from the fact that people didn't want to know

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.200
 that they were eating this stuff because it was a poverty food.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:16.200
 It's either that, or it was like a little bit of food you gave to a dog

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200
 to keep it quiet, it could be that as well.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.200
 - How did that become a shoe?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.200
 - Well, no, the branding is a dog, right?

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.200
 - I didn't know that.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200
 - Yeah, yeah, I don't really know that.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.200
 - So sorry, is the branding about hot to make your puppy hush

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200
 kick it with this shoe?

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.200
 - No, no, no.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.200
 - No, no, no, no.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.200
 - The adverts were controversial at the time.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.200
 - Just one more thing about the giant Chinese salamander.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.200
 It's very cool because it also generates glue.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.200
 And this is really glue that might be actually very useful.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.200
 So it's a Cretaceous mucus.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.200
 And it was a Cretaceous mucus if you gently scratch it, apparently.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.200
 And so researchers have been investigating this to see

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.200
 if it can be used as a medical adhesive.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.200
 And apparently it's a more effective medical adhesive

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.200
 than any other naturally occurring glue found in the world.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.200
 And it's much more flexible than synthetic adhesives.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.200
 And so they think that maybe we could use it to seal wounds in the future.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.200
 So people who are good at Latin, who are all of our listeners,

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.200
 but not me, would know when I say that salamanders often

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.200
 have mental glands where on their body they would be.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:25.200
 It comes from the Latin mentum, not men's, so men's is mind.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200
 But it's from mentum.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200
 - Mentum.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.200
 - Is that a joint?

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200
 - They're tongue.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200
 - Oh, they're chin.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200
 - Chin.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.200
 - How did you get that?

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:37.200
 - Yes, so they have mental glands from the Latin mental meaning chin.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.200
 And they secrete ferrimones.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.200
 So when salamanders want to have sex, the male rubs his chin

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.200
 on the back of the female.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.200
 And he secreets the ferrimones onto her back with his chin.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.200
 - Oh nice.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.200
 - And then that gets her in the mood.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.200
 - Very sexy.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200
 - Yeah, very sexy.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.200
 - Very sexy.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.200
 I didn't find out how Olm's made themselves.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.200
 I mean, I guess it's hard if you don't ever move from your spot.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.200
 - They made, I think they're some of the only amphibians.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.200
 They're not the only amphibians that mate internally rather than laying eggs.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.200
 Is that right?

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.200
 - Okay.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.200
 - So I think they have actual sex, which is nice.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.200
 - I think they do have a period of activity where they just suddenly all just go,

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.200
 "Okay, let's do the stuff we need to do and just one go."

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.200
 - That's great.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.200
 - Yeah.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.200
 - That's like a Saturday morning.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.200
 Just get everything out of the way and then the rest of the weekend you can just relax.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.200
 - Exactly.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.200
 - So just on Salamander, sort of type of Salamander, right?

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.200
 And I didn't realise there was this persistent belief throughout all of history

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.200
 that Salamander is a fireproof.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.200
 - And what?

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.200
 - From ancient times people, there was this rumor that Salamander is a born from fire

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.200
 and they're totally resistant to it.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.200
 They're so cold, they can just walk through fire.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:50.200
 It was also thought that Asbestos was Salamander here because you know Asbestos looks like a hairy.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.200
 And it's fire resistant.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.200
 And so everyone thought that Asbestos was just the shed hair of Salamander.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.200
 - I mean, it only takes one experiment.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.200
 - You bizarrely, Pliny actually did it, and it was proven to be incorrect.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.200
 And he went on to believe it.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.200
 - Well, there must be a Salamander there.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200
 - Yeah.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.200
 - That's why he thought he was just proving.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200
 - Yeah.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.200
 - And it was so persistent that even in the 19th century,

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.200
 people still thought Salamanders were fireproof.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.200
 To the extent that you had human Salamanders, which were popular entertainers,

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.200
 and they were performant fairs.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200
 And this was across Europe.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.200
 And their trick was they wore these big Asbestos cloaks.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.200
 And so a lot of them probably ended up quite ill.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.200
 With these big Asbestos cloaks and gloves and shoes.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.200
 And then they'd walk through bonfires.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.200
 And they were called human Salamanders.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.200
 - Cool.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.200
 - And their trick was it was most impressive if they take a raw steak into the middle of a bonfire.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.200
 And then they'd stand in there and then they'd come out and the steak's cooked.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.200
 - That is quite clever.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.200
 - Hopefully they're not.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.200
 - They could have the human oil in the other part of the circus, just kind of sitting there.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.200
 - Yeah.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.200
 - Just don't look waiting for the crowd to come fast.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.200
 - Oh no.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.200
 - We love it.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.200
 I mean, literally people do that in Covent Garden, don't they?

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.200
 - The human statues.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.200
 - The human statue.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.200
 - That's true.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.200
 - I'm going to start calling them human alms.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.200
 - Yeah.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:08.200
 - Okay, that's it.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200
 That is all of our facts.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.200

 Oh, I meant to say "olmes under the hammer."

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.200
 [Laughter]

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.200
 Say it now, click.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.200
 Olmes under the hammer.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.200
 Would be a good TV show.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.200
 - Yeah.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.200
 - Omelie Connect.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.200
 - Yeah.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.200
 - And "olmes and gardens" magazine.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.200
 It's just pictures of "olmes and gardens."

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.200
 Olmes sweet "olmes."

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.200
 - So the recipe?

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.200
 [Laughter]

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.200
 - You'll find a place to put that in it.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.200
 - I'm sure I'll find somewhere.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.200
 You know that better than the end where I put all the really shit jokes.
