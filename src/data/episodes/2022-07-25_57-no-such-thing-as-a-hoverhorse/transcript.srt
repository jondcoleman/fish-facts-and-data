00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting with Anne Chazinski, James Harkin and Andy Murray.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 in the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Starting with fact number one, that's my fact.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 My fact this week is that monorails were originally horse-drawn.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 That's really great. It's like the ultra-modern with not very modern at all.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Yeah, exactly. It's the future, but there's a horse attack.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 It's like everything. I always wonder.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Spaceships of the same thing, I think.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Yeah, exactly. I've always wanted to, though, if back in that period there were books

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 called "When Will I Get My Hover Horse?"

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 They hadn't yet known about the next bit of technology.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 The thing I really love about it is all the main new inventions coming out of that time.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Even household stuff that was run on QI that vacuumed cleaners used to be horse-drawn as well.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Just everything was horse-drawn. We should say why, because that sounds insane.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 They were really, really, really big is the idea.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 The vacuum cleaner would pull up outside your house and they would send in tubes

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 to who were inside the house, and it would suck all the dust.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And the tubes were see-through, so you could see all of the crap coming out of the house.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 It was quite cool, because then you just like see what your neighbours, all the crap that's in that house.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 You don't want to put embarrassing stuff on your floor.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So you might end up doing that thing of making sure all the stuff that's vacuumed

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 looks really expensive and nice, you know, just for a nosy neighbours.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I mean, masks, yeah.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Got a few more, doesn't matter.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I don't know if you've seen it, but the Jackson's have some very expensive looking dust.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 So when are we talking? What era?

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 This was in 1820, and it was a guy called Ivan Elmanov, and this was in Russia.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 The 1800s, like when you think about all of these horse-powered things,

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 it just feels like it was such a productive time for horses.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 They had a lot of jobs that they seemed to have gone through like a job recession recently,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 because they were doing monorails, they were doing obviously fire engines,

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 they were doing trains, they were, I mean, they were everywhere and there was this amazing robot.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Actually, before I mentioned this bit, they were used in plays with the first Ben Hur play

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 that they did on Broadway was done using real horses on treadmills on the stage.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Yeah, on these treadmills.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And they were attached to these poles so that the horses couldn't get loose and go into the crowd.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 But they wanted to make it as spectacle when the audience was watching the chariot races.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 That's quite as spectacle, isn't it?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Yeah. So all these horses were lined, bolting like crazy on a movable floor,

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 so they weren't making any ground, and it toured the world.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 It was a huge, huge place, so they were in plays as well.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Do you think the Grand National will ever just be on treadmills?

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Wow, it's not a bad idea, yeah.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Well, it's not a great idea, is it?

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 That's wrong with it.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 One disadvantage, for instance, is you only have a very small amount of place

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 where people couldn't watch.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But on the other hand, everyone there gets a really good view of the whole race.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 You don't see the horses go by a flap, and then you have to wait on a five minutes.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 You watch the whole race, yeah.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 You see the whole race.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 No jumps.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 That's a problem.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Not with my revolutionary moving hedge treadmills.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Maybe like an OK-go video, don't you?

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Monorails are very old-fashioned, in a way.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 So the official monorail, well, I don't know how official it is, but the Monorail's website, I looked at.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 What was the website?

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 It's monorails.org, I think, on monorails.com.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 It's one of the two.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But there are lots of theories that the guys who run that website have about why monorails are not more popular.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Why we're not all on a monorail all the time.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And they've said that, like, there is one theory that they espouse,

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 that people actually make a lot more money out of railways,

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 or that more groups of people stand to make a profit out of railways.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So that's why they've been keeping monorails down.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 It's the same reason we don't have those everlasting light bulbs.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 The light bulb manufacturers will go out of business.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Or the idea that Gillette supposedly have come up with a blade that never dullens,

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 but they won't sell it, because then people stop buying blades.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Yeah, I don't buy it myself.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 But they also say that another problem is that people think of monorails as being a bit eccentric or quaint.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So the Disney problem is what you've got to know, that they go around Disney World,

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 or Chessington World of Adventures, and they're not serious.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 They aren't that serious, so are they really?

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I like them, though.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 But it's like someone who rides a unicycle just going,

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 "I don't know why everyone's riding unicycles."

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It's because they make money out of that extra wheel.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's also because it's much easier to ride a bicycle, mate,

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 and it's much easier to make a train.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It is more than really unbalanced, like unicycles.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Well, they were very hard to balance.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 They're not, because they have saddlebags kind of below the level of the track.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So you have to admit that it's more complicated and difficult than just having to get ready.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 So the trains people have got to you.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Winston Churchill once drove a monorail.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Did he?

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Yeah.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 For a job?

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 No, for a job, no.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 In 1910, before he was Prime Minister, was it a British exhibition?

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And the Daily Mail wrote it up and said it was as interesting to him as a new toy would be to a child.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And he liked it so much that he then persuaded the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to come and have a go.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And he put loads of money into developing it, and he was hugely enthused.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Now the money ran out, eventually.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 That was a nice simile, as interesting as a toy to a child.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And I have some other similes here.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 As useful as a coal man on a maglev monorail means, like, as useful as a chocolate tea pot.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Or something like that.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 A coal man on a maglev monorail.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Yeah, because you don't need to put coal into a monorail because they run on magnets.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 See?

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 There's a list of some other as useful as a, which I found online.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So, these are all things that are useless.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 As useful as a warm bucket of spit.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Like one of those really handy cold buckets of spit.

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And another one, this is my favourite.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 As useful as a hat full of busted assholes.

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 So that's a little hat full of busted ass, a little phrase that you could use.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Wow.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Have you guys heard of tumor monorails?

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 There's a medical innovation they've come up with.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So it's still in the very early days.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But they're very tiny nano fibers which scientists want to use to put into the body to persuade cancer cells to move along them.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Because it mimics the past that cancers use to get around inside the body.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 So they latch on the cancerous cells.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 They get them to other bits of the body, which is either where scientists can cut them out more safely,

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 as well as less dangerous to operate.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Or they can even, they've tried experiments actually moving them out of the body.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And this is just on rats.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 They've tried an into a toxic gel.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Isn't that incredible?

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Do you look really real comics coming out of your face?

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And you just watch the little train total out.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Wow.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Have they persuade the cancer cells to get on board?

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Do they have a very cheap fare?

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 It just looks like, it looks to the cancer cells, I think, like the way that they get around.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So they're just assuming, oh, this is the route that we're going to go on.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 That's unbelievable.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 That's so cool.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And you thought Monorail's were bad.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 They take it back.

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 That's awesome.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 All right.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Anyone got anything else?

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 San Diego World Animal Park opened in 1972 with a Monorail around the park, like a lot of things do.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 The railway was called the Wagasa Busch Line.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Everyone thought Wagasa was like an African name or whatever.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 But it actually stood for, who gives a shit anyway?

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Oh, I couldn't think of a name.

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Oh, wow.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 That feels like the end of a long meeting.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 OK, time for fact number two.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Andy Murray.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 My fact is that the great smog of 1952 was so bad that blind people led sighted people home from the train station.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 The sighted people just could not see where they were going.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It was completely impossible.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 So the great smog is the most extraordinary, I think it was a five-day stretch in London specifically,

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 but it later spread across the whole of the UK.

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 OK, so what was it like people burning things in their houses or factories?

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Yeah, a bit of a mix.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 So people were using coal, but they were using very dirty coal, which had lots of sulfur in it.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And factories were also belching out lots of sulfur dioxide, which then turned into sulfuric acid in the air.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And all the dirty coal, normally, the coal fumes would have just gone into the atmosphere and spread out.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 But there was this layer of coal there above London, which sort of formed this bubble, if you like, of warmer air inside.

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And everything just turned back towards the ground and mixed with moisture.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 So it would have been hazardous to your health to breathe in this small.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Yes, very so.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 So, right.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I think they think now that 12,000 people died and 100,000 became ill.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Wow, yeah.

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Oh my god.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 There were 19 people, I'm not sure if this was the same great smog it might have been.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 19 people were drowned after unwittingly walking into the Thames, because they couldn't see where they were going.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So you couldn't see your feet, could you?

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 At the end of it.

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And bus conductors had to get out of buses and have flames in front of buses to guide them down the street, because it was, I mean, it was about three feet of visibility.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And librarians, I find this a really funny image.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 So it got inside buildings and library workers reported walking through stacks of libraries and turning a corner along the library corridor

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and suddenly bumping into a huge waft of smog that was just sitting in their library.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Yeah.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Just hanging in as a column.

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Just hanging out.

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 It sounds like something.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It's amazing trying to check out a book.

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Yeah.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Yeah.

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Because like, so I read the Sadler's Wells, they had to stop a play midway through because so much smog entered.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 But I love that idea of that.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It's that suddenly being like, whoa, the production levels of this.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Wait, it's phenomenal.

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Look at this.

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And they had to abandon dog racing because the dogs couldn't see the hair.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 So they just had to go.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And presumably the people couldn't see what his dog wanted.

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Yeah.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Everyone's waiting.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Nobody can see anything.

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Yeah.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And they had to cancel football matches because nobody could see the ball.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 You just kick the ball and you, that's it.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Everyone's looking for the ball.

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And then, you know, for half an hour.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I've been to football matches where they had to be cancelled for fog.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Really?

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Yeah.

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And it's interesting when you're like a fan because often you're behind the goal.

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And you just can't see anything on the other side of the pitch.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And you just hear a massive cheer from the other side.

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 You've got no idea whether it's a goal or that it's valuable.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I like this as well.

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So, obviously, very dangerous on the railway lines because, you know,

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 there were workers on the railway lines and if you can't see a train.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 So train engineers, what they would do, they put little explosives on the line itself,

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 which would go off as the train went over them like a cap gun basically.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I like those things that kids throw on the floor.

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Yeah, exactly.

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Yeah.

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And then that would make a noise so that they would notify the workers that there was a train

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 coming slowly along the tracks and they could get out of the way.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Oh, wow.

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 But that must have been because a small like that when this must have been a really productive time of people going,

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 OK, buying people are now offering their services to walk people home at tube stations.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 The train people are going, OK, we're going to lay down like it's very home alone, isn't it?

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Like everyone's like trying to reinvent how you can get by in a city where you can't like a 1980s movie to use.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Well, just think about it.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Like no one would have been prepared for an entire city to be totally just.

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Actually, it was kind of semi-common, wasn't it?

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 That they would have these kind of things.

229
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 This was the worst by miles, but peace supers were kind of common at the time.

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Yeah.

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Peace super being, peace super just being the nickname for the, for the fog,

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 because it was as thick as peace soup.

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And it was greenish, apparently.

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Was it?

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 The greenish yellow has lots of commonit.

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Yeah.

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 The licking the air.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 No, you're right. It would have been a time of ingenuity, but also like the roads were covered in abandoned cars,

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 because people just could not see you to drive.

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Speaking of ingenuity, they have quite bad smog in China at the moment, especially in Beijing.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And the Chinese state media came up with a number of benefits of smog in China.

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Has anyone seen these?

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Yeah, they're really good.

244
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So one, it unifies the Chinese people.

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Which is quite good.

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It's kind of what you were saying, Dan, about, you know, everyone gets together and has to, it's like against a common enemy.

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Yeah.

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 If you excuse the 12,000 or so deaths, it's kind of a party.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Yeah.

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 What do you think about it?

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's my big, massive smoke machine.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Yeah.

253
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 It's like the beginning of Matthew Kelly's stars in their eyes.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 That's what it is.

255
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be falling in the tent.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Another one was it makes people more knowledgeable brackets of things like fog.

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Sure.

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And also apparently it makes people funnier.

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Oh, it's because of the dark humour that comes with it.

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 But obviously, if you do come up with any jokes, don't put them online because the party will find you.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Yes.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Right in the smog.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Actually, there was a fire in Beijing in 2013 at a furniture factory.

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And no one noticed it was on fire because the smog in the city was so bad.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Wow.

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 That's terrible.

267
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Well, the thing in China as well, in Beijing particularly, is that the goby is kind of really encroaching

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 on China at the moment.

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So not only so smog and fog must be a massive one, but they get huge sandstorms now.

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 They have sandstorm warnings on the weather now.

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And they started this plan.

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Did you know about the great green wall of China?

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 I do not.

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Yeah, they've been building this huge wall of effectively a forest wall.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Yeah.

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Where they're going to try and stop the desert from encroaching and capture all the sand as it comes in.

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So it's like sand versus smog at the moment.

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Like an alien versus predator for the 21st century China.

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Yeah.

280
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 They're taking each other on.

281
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Yeah.

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 You compare everything to bad 2010 films.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Yeah.

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Like shock to pusversus.

285
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Yeah.

286
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Yeah.

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 In China, in 2013, alone Chinese consumers spent the equivalent of $140 million on anti smog devices,

288
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 which is not great because I think--

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 One day, anti smog.

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Oh, they're sorry.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 They're just those smog masks that you see.

292
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 A lot of people in China were only about a fifth of them work, so which is kind of a shame.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But it's been adopted into their fashions because a couple of years ago on the catwalk,

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 the people on the catwalk had to wear smog masks just because--

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Oh.

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And a designer decided to make smog masks suddenly fashionable.

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 So he's called Yin Peng and his 2015 collection includes fashionable smog masks.

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And they look so cool.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 So that's--

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 One of them looks like the shredder.

301
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Is it the shredder who has--

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Yeah.

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 From Tinian tradition.

304
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Yeah.

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 One of them looks a bit like Darth Vader.

306
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Yeah.

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Are they all films from the '70s and '80s?

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Yeah.

309
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I think that's the thing he's going for.

310
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Yeah.

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 This is the thing.

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Hong Kong and China are very good at doing that kind of thing where they try and convince the

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 public that it's now fashionable.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And when SARS came out, very similar.

315
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 When SARS-- remember when SARS came out?

316
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 That was first release.

317
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Is that on the '90s film?

318
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Yeah.

319
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So everyone was wearing the masks to stop themselves from having the cops.

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And there were like huge wrappers singing about SARS and stuff.

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 They tried to make it a pop culture thing so that people felt comfortable and cool wearing

322
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 SARS in your eyes.

323
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 [LAUGHTER]

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 It's better than dancing with the SARS.

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 [LAUGHTER]

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 On Clayton, I think about sight.

327
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Yes.

328
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Vision.

329
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Do you guys know about forbidden colours?

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 No.

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I can't really if I didn't know this.

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 So we can't see all the colours that are available for us to see.

333
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 For instance, reddish green.

334
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 You can't see reddish green with your eyes.

335
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 But that does exist.

336
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And you also can't see yellowish blue.

337
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 So that means that you can't see a colour which is in equal parts getting more red and more green.

338
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And more green at the same time.

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Because our cones, which are our receptors, which see these colours,

340
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 will, if they're exposing themselves to, let's say, the red part of reddish green,

341
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 then they will shut down the green bits of the receptor to allow you to properly see the red and vice versa.

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 But we could have eyes that could allow us to see both.

343
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And some people think there was an experiment done in 1983, which tried to make people see both.

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And there is a test you can do.

345
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And some people claim that they can see these never before seen, never before described colours.

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 So if you look up for bidden colours or impossible colours test, you'll see it online.

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And it's a yellow square, an extra blue square, and there are two white crosses in the middle of each one.

348
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And if you stare at that for long enough, apparently you'll see a colour that has never before been seen.

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Wow.

350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I read a great thing about Tigre beetles, which apparently is that they can run so fast that they go blind.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Is that one?

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 What?

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Yeah.

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Is that like exceeding the speed of light?

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 No, they exceed the speed of information, I guess, to their brain.

356
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 That's really funny.

357
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Yeah, they don't gather enough photons to make a picture of their prey.

358
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 So they end up having to stop to let their brain catch up so that like, in pursuit running, and then they'd have to just pause.

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 So their brain can suddenly bring the visuals back.

360
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Yeah.

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Sometimes they'll stop three to four times before they actually catch their prey.

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 They're like the opposite of pigeons, because pigeons could see a huge number of, as it were, frames per second.

363
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Yeah.

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So we did that thing ages ago on QI, that a film in a cinema to them would look like a slideshow.

365
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 They would find it incredibly boring.

366
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Yeah.

367
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And this has been used by some people to explain why pigeons don't get out the way as fast as we think they should,

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 if we're driving towards them or cycling towards them, it's because they're seeing stuff more frames per second.

369
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 So they can wait for longer, because we slide there in the matrix.

370
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Yeah.

371
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 But that's not true.

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 I crash into them all the time.

373
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 So whatever this amazing senses, which means they can escape quicker, it's not working.

374
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 They're cycling pigeons.

375
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Okay.

376
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 So I'm from fact number three, and that is James.

377
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Okay.

378
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 My fact this week is that on the 24th of March 2015, the temperature in Antarctica was higher than in Malta, Madrid and Marrakesh.

379
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It's a book you're flight now.

380
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 No, that is extraordinary.

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 This was the record temperature in Antarctica so far, and it was 17.5 degrees Celsius.

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And in all those three places, it was around 16 degrees.

383
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Wow.

384
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So does that mean you could go out in a T-shirt?

385
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Yeah.

386
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 You could.

387
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 This was in the corner.

388
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 It's not like in the absolute South Pole.

389
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 It was on Antarctica, but not right down in the centre where it probably was pretty cold.

390
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 You can always go out in a T-shirt.

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 That's true.

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 No one's stopping you.

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 No one's stopping you.

394
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 It's true.

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 They have that thing called the 300 club, don't they?

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Do you know that?

397
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 You sit in a sauna at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for as long as you can stand, and then you go out and run around the pole naked.

398
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And the idea is that the difference in temperature is 300 degrees Fahrenheit and also that you pass through all 24 time zones in your imminent.

399
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Do you need to do passport checks at all of those different borders?

400
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 No, obviously not.

401
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You don't get passport checks at time zones.

402
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 No, but the parts of Antarctica are claimed by different countries, so theoretically they could follow barriers.

403
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 No one respects that though.

404
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Like no country that will be like this is ours and everyone's going, it's not.

405
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 But that's true.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It's like Britain saying, oh, this bit's ours, and then everyone else is going, no, it's not.

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But this is ours.

408
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 No way.

409
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 No, this bit's ours.

410
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 No, not really.

411
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 But this is ours.

412
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I thought there was a treaty of the Antarctic, which said no one owns it, but only about 50 countries have signed it,

413
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 and it's probably countries which don't have large claims stakes.

414
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Yeah, equatorial guinea.

415
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Yeah, that's cool.

416
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 We'll sign it, we'll call that.

417
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 We'll be the bigger person here.

418
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 In order to bolster their claim to the Antarctic, Argentina sent a seven-month pregnant woman to Antarctica to give birth.

419
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So the first baby born in Antarctica was an Argentinian baby called Emil Marco Palma,

420
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 and that was in '78 or possibly '79.

421
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Yeah.

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I remember it was '78, I think, because it was the same year I was born.

423
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I mean, I don't remember it from when I was born.

424
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Even then, James was finding facts.

425
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I remember even thinking that could have been me, because the first test tube baby was in the same year.

426
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 We'll be spread on.

427
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 It was a big year for celebrity babies.

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 It's out.

429
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Oh, you could have been so special, James.

430
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 I know.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Well, some people say I am.

432
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Your mum.

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 She's a good woman.

434
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 So it's this idea that it's hotter in Antarctica isn't to say that it's always hotter in Antarctica.

435
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 They logged the record cold temperature last year as well.

436
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 So it's not to say that everything's warming up exactly by that amount.

437
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 It's a lot more complicated than that, but of course this is all probably down to climate change.

438
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Right.

439
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Oh, the big year Frank Dox took her breaking its own records constantly.

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And there's a guy online, he's called Maximiliano Herrera and he's a climatologist.

441
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And he has a list of all the extreme temperature records for every nation on earth.

442
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 It's a brilliant website, you know, if you like data go there.

443
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And he's found that in 2015 so far five nations or territories have set or tied all-time records for the hottest temperature.

444
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Wow.

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And they are Antarctica, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Wallis and Fortuna territory and Samoa.

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Have you seen the hottest temperature ever recorded was in America, I think.

447
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 It was it's somewhat called Furnace Creek Ranch, but on the Wikipedia it says...

448
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Is that just a coincidence, I'm name?

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Well, on the Wikipedia it says in brackets after it, formally Greenland Ranch.

450
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 I assume that they changed it after that, but I'm not sure.

451
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Come on, I've been there, is that not in Death Valley?

452
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Yeah.

453
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Yeah, I've been there, yeah.

454
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 It was hot.

455
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 It was a sign saying you must not go out of your car as after 10 AM or something, because it was so hot, everyone was ignoring it of course.

456
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And the people were like frying eggs on the floor and stuff like that.

457
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Not hygienic.

458
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 That's something people never talk about when you talk about frying eggs on a car bonnet.

459
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 It may work, but it's not hygienic at all.

460
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 No, I don't think they generally eat them straight afterwards.

461
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Oh, do they not?

462
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 What do they do with the eggs?

463
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Throw them away, maybe?

464
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 It's the point of that.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 I know, it's a waste.

466
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 You could eat something in a wrapper, like a microwave meal, for example, on the bonnet of your car.

467
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And then at least it would be hygienic, that's dealing with Anna's problem.

468
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Dad, please tell us the microwave fact that you told me yesterday.

469
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Oh, yeah, I saw this online on National Geographic.

470
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 There's been a pulse that's been detected.

471
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 A microwave...

472
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 A space, supposedly, it could be a pulsar or aliens even?

473
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Since the 90s, they've been thinking what the hell is this thing?

474
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 It's been a big mystery, and it would come by every so often.

475
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 They'd log it, and no one would know what it was.

476
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And they've dealt with this kind of thing with space before, mysterious signals that they eventually find out.

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 So they've continued the search to find out what it was, and they've had a breakthrough.

478
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 They now know what it is.

479
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 The microwave signals were coming from a microwave, basically, on premise.

480
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Anytime somebody used it, it would send out microwave signals.

481
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 It would register it, and that was mystery solved.

482
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 They would always send the same pulses that were two minutes long, and then a 30 second gap.

483
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And then another two minutes.

484
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 In a mysterious...

485
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 In every time.

486
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Is that, did you say, since the 90s?

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Yeah, and I think it's neighbouring microwaves as well from houses around.

488
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 It was at Parks Observatory.

489
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 That's where it was.

490
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Such a good fact.

491
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 I love that.

492
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So there has been some really weird weather this year in America, especially.

493
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 So they've had down the West Coast, for instance, San Francisco.

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 It was recorded at its first ever January without rain, I think.

495
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And then on the East Coast, it's been ridiculously snowy.

496
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 This everlasting snow in places like Boston.

497
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And they've realised, scientists have realised it's because of the blob.

498
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 What?

499
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Which is...

500
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 It's this warm mass of water.

501
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 It's a thousand miles long, and it's sitting off the west coast of America in the Pacific Ocean.

502
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 It's 300 feet deep.

503
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And it's not cooling off, and it's been there for about a year and a half.

504
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 And it's just sitting there, like hot, not hot.

505
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 It's about seven degrees Fahrenheit above the water around it.

506
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And not cooling, like it usually would.

507
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And so this is causing these crazy weather phenomena all across America because of the blob.

508
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 That's amazing.

509
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 I've never heard that, that's amazing.

510
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Yeah, that's cool.

511
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So, here's a weather thing for you.

512
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Go on.

513
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 What killed a third of Napoleon's army on his way to Moscow in 1812?

514
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Yes, it was the cold snap.

515
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Was it?

516
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It wasn't, it was heatstroke.

517
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 What?

518
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Yes.

519
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 No.

520
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Yeah?

521
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 That's not what I learned in school.

522
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 It was just as much of a problem.

523
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Seriously?

524
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 The cold was also a big problem later on, but no, there was an enormous heat wave which killed a lot of the soldiers who died.

525
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Was this going for an Antarctic style?

526
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Let's break two records in one year.

527
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 How do you know what to wear in the morning?

528
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Yeah, it's quite.

529
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 It's a nightmare.

530
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 You go invading Russia in layers, always.

531
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 That's what you're saying.

532
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So you can take them off if you have to.

533
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I've got a fleece, but there's a crop top underneath here.

534
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 That's right, I'll be fine.

535
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 There's an incredible image of the journey, too, and from Moscow.

536
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And he starts out with 400,000 men, a very, very thick line, and it shows where he goes geographically.

537
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 What the temperature is along the way.

538
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 By the time he gets there, he's got 100,000 men.

539
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 By the time he gets back, he has 10,000 men.

540
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Yeah, that's incredible.

541
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 It's one of the best infographics they would call them these days, but it's a very, very classic chart.

542
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I'll try and put it up on my Twitter.

543
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Yeah.

544
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Because it looks unbelievably cool.

545
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Wow.

546
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Oh, sorry.

547
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 No.

548
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I was just going to say, I do love how weather in places that you...

549
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 It's hard to guess the one place that on this podcast is constantly mentioned that blows me away in terms of the facts.

550
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Yeah.

551
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Like the fact that fires...

552
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Fire's a problem there.

553
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Yes, it's a problem, so they have a fire service there.

554
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Interesting, you say blows me away.

555
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It's got a serious wind problem at the moment because of global issues as well.

556
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Oh, does it?

557
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Yeah.

558
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I read that it suffers from horizontal avalanches, but I think that's a kind of a description that people who are out there.

559
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 It's not as dangerous or as crazy as it sounds, but they describe the idea of the horizontal avalanche.

560
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I'm guessing it must be wind smashing...

561
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 That's weird.

562
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 So this is another thing that's happened in America.

563
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I think that's called an ice shove.

564
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Or it's also known as an ice tsunami.

565
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And it is where wind will, for instance, in a frozen lake,

566
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 wind or weird water movements cause the ice to just move like a very slow tsunami onto the land.

567
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 But it happened last year in Minnesota.

568
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And it's so weird.

569
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 People just woke up and this huge wall of ice was just creeping into their houses and creeping up.

570
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 If you watch it, it moves at about a centimeter every couple of seconds.

571
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 That is still scarier than smug, though, isn't it?

572
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Yeah.

573
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Imagine walking through a library and there's a big load of ice.

574
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Yeah.

575
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Have you heard of spontaneous snowballs?

576
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 No.

577
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 This is a very similar thing.

578
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Right.

579
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Basically, it's when snow rolls up and forms a snowball on the ground spontaneously because of the wind.

580
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And they have a hollow center and there can be, there can be huge.

581
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 There can be up to a foot in diameter.

582
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And it's when you have a crust of old snow which is covered by a thin layer of new snow on top.

583
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And if the conditions are right, a small bit of snow gets rolled along by the wind and it gathers more as it goes.

584
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And they have a hollow center.

585
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Yeah.

586
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 That's amazing.

587
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Very cool.

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I was looking at places in Antarctica.

589
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 There are some quite good place names.

590
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Oh, I was literally just about to say this.

591
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Oh, we go from there.

592
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 No, no, you go from there.

593
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Take it and says do one each.

594
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Okay.

595
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Let's see who runs out first.

596
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Okay.

597
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 All right.

598
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Yeah, yeah.

599
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Let's go.

600
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 So come to put my favourites now.

601
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Nipple peak.

602
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 That's going to be hard to peak.

603
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Yep.

604
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Nobhead.

605
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Wait a minute.

606
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Are we doing names?

607
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Oh, just insults here.

608
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Nobhead's good.

609
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I will raise you dick peaks.

610
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Similar theme.

611
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Asses ears.

612
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Nice.

613
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 The office girls.

614
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 I want to know why.

615
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Shagnasty Island.

616
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Football mountain.

617
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Football mountain.

618
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 A shapeless mountain, which is really interesting, because it was named that.

619
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Like a mountain.

620
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 It was named that because of the inability of the discovering team to agree on what its actual shape was.

621
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 So much so that shapeless mountain was a confusing thing that when they went to climb shapeless mountain,

622
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 they climbed the wrong mountain.

623
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Because they assumed it was shapeless mountain and they ended up naming that mountain that they mistakenly climbed.

624
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Mistake peak.

625
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Yeah.

626
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I think I've only got mount cocks left and then I'm out.

627
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Guys, these names are about as much use as a hat full of busted assholes.

628
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky.

629
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 My fact is that Tonga's official finance minister was also its official court jester.

630
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 This is this guy Jesse Bogdanov, who was employed as a financial adviser in 1994,

631
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 financial adviser to the government of Tonga.

632
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And he was, I guess, he got a promotion.

633
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Actually, he decided he to be court jester.

634
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It was at his own suggestion, as financial adviser said,

635
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 "Why don't you make me your court jester because my birthday is April 1st."

636
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 So, it seems like the obvious thing to do.

637
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 It's not much of CV, that is it.

638
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Why should you get this job?

639
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Well, my birthday is on April 1st.

640
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It would have been better if it turned out his birthday wasn't on April 1st.

641
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 It was a trade.

642
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Maybe it was.

643
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 He wasn't a very trustworthy character at Slanderer, so I hope he's not listening.

644
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 He did lose the country about $25 million as their financial adviser.

645
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Wow, really?

646
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Yeah, there was the Tonga Trust Fund, which he was given to manage,

647
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 and he invested it all in...

648
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Squirty flowers.

649
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Massive shoes.

650
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Yeah, and the big shoe index fell off a cliff a few months later.

651
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 So, what were those little cars all of it?

652
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 It was basically that.

653
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 He invested it in questionable places, and it disappeared.

654
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Lost all their money.

655
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He had to flee the country.

656
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Well, he fled the country.

657
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 He left the country, and he can't return now, because he says he fears his life.

658
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 I think some Tonga and Sue put their money into this fund.

659
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 We're pretty angry when he lost it all.

660
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 As court jester, he was quite fun.

661
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 He used to play saxophone at royal events, and he wrote a poem about the king.

662
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And, yeah, he was generally an entertaining chap in that part of his life.

663
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 That doesn't sound like a lot.

664
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Saxophone.

665
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Saxophone, I haven't seen.

666
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 The funniest of all instruments.

667
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So, where is this guy now?

668
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 He's in America.

669
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 He's changed his name to Jesse Dean.

670
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 He's the founder and sole practitioner of a company called the Open Window Institute of Emotional Freedom in California,

671
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 and he does offer hypnosis as part of it.

672
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 So, he can't go back, because he's terrified for his life,

673
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 but is he a wanted man there, or is he...?

674
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 I did not openly.

675
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 I thought he was forced to pay back a million dollars.

676
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 He was forced to pay back a lot of money,

677
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 and he still has to pay part of his income to Tonga,

678
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 but he never admitted any liability.

679
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 That's very nice of him to pay back, then, isn't it?

680
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 He's nice.

681
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 That's the goodness of my heart.

682
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 I totally get it.

683
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 So, we should tell you Tonga, because a lot of people won't know much about Tonga.

684
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Yeah.

685
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Tonga is 171 different islands.

686
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Okay.

687
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And they're spread over 700,000 square kilometres of ocean.

688
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 It's hugely spread out.

689
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 But only 36 of the islands actually got permanent inhabitants on them.

690
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Right.

691
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Okay.

692
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 So, lots and lots of them are empty.

693
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 They used to be called the friendly islands, didn't they?

694
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 It was nice.

695
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 They originally called that, because James Cook was given such a friendly welcome

696
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 when he arrived there in 1773.

697
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 But legend tells that unbeknownst to him when they were having a big feast,

698
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 the only reason he departed unscathed was because the chiefs could not agree a plan

699
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 on how to kill him.

700
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 So, I've been to parties like that.

701
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 They must have been kicking themselves after he left.

702
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Yeah.

703
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 They must have been so close.

704
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Okay, so we're five to four in favour of decapitation.

705
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Please.

706
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Can we?

707
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Yeah, it's amazing that there isn't just, okay, if we don't decide on anything,

708
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 here's our fallback.

709
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Like, how do you not have a plan V of basic death?

710
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Between 1918 and 2006, Tonga had only two monarchs.

711
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Very amazing.

712
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Do we know who the current one is?

713
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 No, nobody knows.

714
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 It's just people have been looking into it.

715
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 The current one is George Tupor the sixth.

716
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 What do we know about George Tupor the sixth?

717
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Almost nothing.

718
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Oh.

719
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 But I believe we know some interesting stuff about George Tupor the fifth,

720
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 who was quite a fun character.

721
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 He used to own the island's only power company, brewery and mobile phone company.

722
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 He got rid of them eventually.

723
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 That sounds like he was having a fun time.

724
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Sounds like an entrepreneur, I like him.

725
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Was he just making drunken phone calls all the time?

726
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Is that his life?

727
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Oh, no, no.

728
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Oh, he also, I think it was him, wasn't it, who insisted on being driven round in a London black cab everywhere?

729
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And the reason that he gave it this was because a London taxi has the right proportions to make it easy for you to get in and out whilst wearing spurs and a sword.

730
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Wow.

731
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Which I think is why we all ride around in them sometimes.

732
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 That's why I never use Uber.

733
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 I can't get my sword out of there.

734
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 I've got a couple of things on gestures.

735
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 I don't know if anyone does.

736
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 So one thing that surprised me is that I just probably very stupidly assumed that all gestures were male back in the 1500s, the old times.

737
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 But gestress was an occupation as well.

738
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Oh, that's cool.

739
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 I can't just say that is definitely not the stupidest thing you've ever assumed in.

740
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Okay, good.

741
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Keep going.

742
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 So Le Jardinier served as Mary Stewart's gestress in 1543.

743
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And she was there for a very long time.

744
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And she got paid very well.

745
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 She even got paid four pounds of snow every summer.

746
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 I think paid very well.

747
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 I reckon you believe the P.R. that she believes.

748
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 I think that wasn't cocaine, was it?

749
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Because if it's cocaine, then four pounds is a lot, I believe.

750
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 I think that was bonus money.

751
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Four pounds of snow.

752
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Three pounds of scag.

753
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Yeah.

754
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 It was seen as a refrigeration.

755
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Yeah.

756
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 I can see that that's useful, especially in the spring, having a bit of, you know, a bit of snow in your, in your underhouses.

757
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Yeah.

758
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 To keep things cold.

759
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Yeah.

760
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 It's like a brahi, we've mentioned him before.

761
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 He had his own gesture, who was a little person.

762
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And it was his own personal gesture, who brahi thought possessed psychic powers, and he used to make him sit under the dinner table while he ate dinner.

763
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 And in the source I read, I think it was an I.O.9, which I do like the source, but it said he's just had to sit under the table while he ate dinner.

764
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Probably best not to speculate why he had to do this.

765
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Oh.

766
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 I don't think that was a necessary comment.

767
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Yeah.

768
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Didn't take a brahi die because he refused to leave the table.

769
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Yeah.

770
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 When he needed some pee and he never left.

771
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 So maybe the gesture had enough of him and then kind of held on to him and stopped him from leaving.

772
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 I made him die.

773
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Oh, that's what he was thinking.

774
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 He was speculating a little here.

775
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 My other, my favorite gesture that I've learned about recently.

776
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Perkyo of Heidelberg.

777
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 I'm here at a minute.

778
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 No.

779
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Perkyo of Heidelberg, 18th century in Germany.

780
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 His name actually was a shortening of an Italian for why not?

781
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 It's a Perkyo.

782
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 So he was a dwarf and he was famous for his ability to drink.

783
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And any time he was offered a drink, he would say.

784
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Perkyo, which was his name.

785
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Why not?

786
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And he would keep drinking.

787
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 That was basically his main entertainment.

788
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 He would just be drunk the whole time and he supposedly lived into his 80s.

789
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 So it didn't kill him.

790
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 But yeah, that was his one main thing.

791
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 There must have been times where his name was and where his catchphrase was quite annoying to him.

792
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Hey, do you want to put this snake on your leg?

793
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Perkyo.

794
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 [LAUGHTER]

795
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Do you want to punch in the face?

796
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Perkyo.

797
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Because St. Chrysostom defined the fool as he who gets slapped.

798
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Really?

799
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Wow.

800
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 That's a good definition.

801
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 It's also kind of misleading because the role of fools in, let's say, Tudor Courts and Late Medieval Courts

802
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 was to be the person who could insult the monarch, but get away with it, wasn't it?

803
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 I like the trick that King James is sixth of Scotland's Jester George Buchanan played on him.

804
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 So James is sixth was really lazy about signing official documents and he just signed them without reading them.

805
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And you know, George kept nagging him like someone knowing why I've actually read the documents.

806
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And he wouldn't learn.

807
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 So George the Jester eventually went to James and made him sign this document,

808
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 which had tricked him into advocating the throne and giving it up to his Jester.

809
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 And then he took the document away.

810
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 He walked back into the room, said to the king, "Oh, could you just get up or feel throne for a second?"

811
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And then he, the Jester sat down on it and said, "I'm king now, by the way, showed in the document."

812
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And apparently King James is sixth always read his official documents after that.

813
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 But the Jester was brutally capitulated.

814
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening.
