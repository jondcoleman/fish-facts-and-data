00:00:11,00:00:15,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:15,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:19,00:00:23,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting with Anne Chazinski, James Harkin and Andy Murray."
00:00:23,00:00:27,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:27,00:00:31,"in the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:31,00:00:34,"Starting with fact number one, that's my fact."
00:00:34,00:00:39,My fact this week is that monorails were originally horse-drawn.
00:00:39,00:00:44,That's really great. It's like the ultra-modern with not very modern at all.
00:00:44,00:00:47,"Yeah, exactly. It's the future, but there's a horse attack."
00:00:47,00:00:50,It's like everything. I always wonder.
00:00:50,00:00:52,"Spaceships of the same thing, I think."
00:00:52,00:00:55,"Yeah, exactly. I've always wanted to, though, if back in that period there were books"
00:00:55,00:00:58,"called ""When Will I Get My Hover Horse?"""
00:00:58,00:01:03,They hadn't yet known about the next bit of technology.
00:01:03,00:01:08,The thing I really love about it is all the main new inventions coming out of that time.
00:01:08,00:01:12,Even household stuff that was run on QI that vacuumed cleaners used to be horse-drawn as well.
00:01:12,00:01:16,"Just everything was horse-drawn. We should say why, because that sounds insane."
00:01:16,00:01:20,"They were really, really, really big is the idea."
00:01:20,00:01:24,The vacuum cleaner would pull up outside your house and they would send in tubes
00:01:24,00:01:27,"to who were inside the house, and it would suck all the dust."
00:01:27,00:01:31,"And the tubes were see-through, so you could see all of the crap coming out of the house."
00:01:31,00:01:36,"It was quite cool, because then you just like see what your neighbours, all the crap that's in that house."
00:01:36,00:01:38,You don't want to put embarrassing stuff on your floor.
00:01:38,00:01:41,So you might end up doing that thing of making sure all the stuff that's vacuumed
00:01:41,00:01:45,"looks really expensive and nice, you know, just for a nosy neighbours."
00:01:45,00:01:47,"I mean, masks, yeah."
00:01:47,00:01:49,"Got a few more, doesn't matter."
00:01:49,00:01:53,"I don't know if you've seen it, but the Jackson's have some very expensive looking dust."
00:01:53,00:01:56,So when are we talking? What era?
00:01:56,00:02:02,"This was in 1820, and it was a guy called Ivan Elmanov, and this was in Russia."
00:02:02,00:02:07,"The 1800s, like when you think about all of these horse-powered things,"
00:02:07,00:02:11,it just feels like it was such a productive time for horses.
00:02:11,00:02:15,"They had a lot of jobs that they seemed to have gone through like a job recession recently,"
00:02:15,00:02:20,"because they were doing monorails, they were doing obviously fire engines,"
00:02:20,00:02:25,"they were doing trains, they were, I mean, they were everywhere and there was this amazing robot."
00:02:25,00:02:29,"Actually, before I mentioned this bit, they were used in plays with the first Ben Hur play"
00:02:29,00:02:35,that they did on Broadway was done using real horses on treadmills on the stage.
00:02:35,00:02:37,"Yeah, on these treadmills."
00:02:37,00:02:41,And they were attached to these poles so that the horses couldn't get loose and go into the crowd.
00:02:41,00:02:44,But they wanted to make it as spectacle when the audience was watching the chariot races.
00:02:44,00:02:46,"That's quite as spectacle, isn't it?"
00:02:46,00:02:50,"Yeah. So all these horses were lined, bolting like crazy on a movable floor,"
00:02:50,00:02:53,"so they weren't making any ground, and it toured the world."
00:02:53,00:02:57,"It was a huge, huge place, so they were in plays as well."
00:02:57,00:03:00,Do you think the Grand National will ever just be on treadmills?
00:03:00,00:03:02,"Wow, it's not a bad idea, yeah."
00:03:02,00:03:04,"Well, it's not a great idea, is it?"
00:03:04,00:03:05,That's wrong with it.
00:03:05,00:03:09,"One disadvantage, for instance, is you only have a very small amount of place"
00:03:09,00:03:11,where people couldn't watch.
00:03:11,00:03:15,"But on the other hand, everyone there gets a really good view of the whole race."
00:03:15,00:03:18,"You don't see the horses go by a flap, and then you have to wait on a five minutes."
00:03:18,00:03:20,"You watch the whole race, yeah."
00:03:20,00:03:21,You see the whole race.
00:03:21,00:03:22,No jumps.
00:03:22,00:03:23,That's a problem.
00:03:23,00:03:27,Not with my revolutionary moving hedge treadmills.
00:03:27,00:03:31,"Maybe like an OK-go video, don't you?"
00:03:31,00:03:36,"Monorails are very old-fashioned, in a way."
00:03:36,00:03:41,"So the official monorail, well, I don't know how official it is, but the Monorail's website, I looked at."
00:03:41,00:03:42,What was the website?
00:03:42,00:03:45,"It's monorails.org, I think, on monorails.com."
00:03:45,00:03:47,It's one of the two.
00:03:47,00:03:53,But there are lots of theories that the guys who run that website have about why monorails are not more popular.
00:03:53,00:03:55,Why we're not all on a monorail all the time.
00:03:55,00:03:59,"And they've said that, like, there is one theory that they espouse,"
00:03:59,00:04:02,"that people actually make a lot more money out of railways,"
00:04:02,00:04:07,or that more groups of people stand to make a profit out of railways.
00:04:07,00:04:09,So that's why they've been keeping monorails down.
00:04:09,00:04:12,It's the same reason we don't have those everlasting light bulbs.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"Right, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:14,00:04:16,The light bulb manufacturers will go out of business.
00:04:16,00:04:20,"Or the idea that Gillette supposedly have come up with a blade that never dullens,"
00:04:20,00:04:23,"but they won't sell it, because then people stop buying blades."
00:04:23,00:04:24,"Yeah, I don't buy it myself."
00:04:24,00:04:29,But they also say that another problem is that people think of monorails as being a bit eccentric or quaint.
00:04:29,00:04:33,"So the Disney problem is what you've got to know, that they go around Disney World,"
00:04:33,00:04:36,"or Chessington World of Adventures, and they're not serious."
00:04:36,00:04:39,"They aren't that serious, so are they really?"
00:04:39,00:04:40,"I like them, though."
00:04:40,00:04:44,"But it's like someone who rides a unicycle just going,"
00:04:44,00:04:47,"""I don't know why everyone's riding unicycles."""
00:04:47,00:04:51,It's because they make money out of that extra wheel.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"It's also because it's much easier to ride a bicycle, mate,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,and it's much easier to make a train.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"It is more than really unbalanced, like unicycles."
00:04:58,00:05:00,"Well, they were very hard to balance."
00:05:00,00:05:04,"They're not, because they have saddlebags kind of below the level of the track."
00:05:04,00:05:09,So you have to admit that it's more complicated and difficult than just having to get ready.
00:05:09,00:05:11,So the trains people have got to you.
00:05:11,00:05:17,Winston Churchill once drove a monorail.
00:05:17,00:05:18,Did he?
00:05:18,00:05:19,Yeah.
00:05:19,00:05:20,For a job?
00:05:20,00:05:21,"No, for a job, no."
00:05:21,00:05:26,"In 1910, before he was Prime Minister, was it a British exhibition?"
00:05:26,00:05:31,And the Daily Mail wrote it up and said it was as interesting to him as a new toy would be to a child.
00:05:31,00:05:36,And he liked it so much that he then persuaded the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to come and have a go.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"And he put loads of money into developing it, and he was hugely enthused."
00:05:39,00:05:41,"Now the money ran out, eventually."
00:05:41,00:05:45,"That was a nice simile, as interesting as a toy to a child."
00:05:45,00:05:47,And I have some other similes here.
00:05:47,00:05:53,"As useful as a coal man on a maglev monorail means, like, as useful as a chocolate tea pot."
00:05:53,00:05:54,Or something like that.
00:05:54,00:05:56,A coal man on a maglev monorail.
00:05:56,00:06:00,"Yeah, because you don't need to put coal into a monorail because they run on magnets."
00:06:00,00:06:01,See?
00:06:01,00:06:05,"There's a list of some other as useful as a, which I found online."
00:06:05,00:06:07,"So, these are all things that are useless."
00:06:07,00:06:10,As useful as a warm bucket of spit.
00:06:10,00:06:13,Like one of those really handy cold buckets of spit.
00:06:13,00:06:16,"And another one, this is my favourite."
00:06:16,00:06:19,As useful as a hat full of busted assholes.
00:06:19,00:06:24,"So that's a little hat full of busted ass, a little phrase that you could use."
00:06:24,00:06:25,Wow.
00:06:25,00:06:27,Have you guys heard of tumor monorails?
00:06:27,00:06:30,There's a medical innovation they've come up with.
00:06:30,00:06:32,So it's still in the very early days.
00:06:32,00:06:40,But they're very tiny nano fibers which scientists want to use to put into the body to persuade cancer cells to move along them.
00:06:40,00:06:44,Because it mimics the past that cancers use to get around inside the body.
00:06:44,00:06:46,So they latch on the cancerous cells.
00:06:46,00:06:51,"They get them to other bits of the body, which is either where scientists can cut them out more safely,"
00:06:51,00:06:53,as well as less dangerous to operate.
00:06:53,00:06:57,"Or they can even, they've tried experiments actually moving them out of the body."
00:06:57,00:06:58,And this is just on rats.
00:06:58,00:07:00,They've tried an into a toxic gel.
00:07:00,00:07:02,Isn't that incredible?
00:07:02,00:07:05,Do you look really real comics coming out of your face?
00:07:05,00:07:08,And you just watch the little train total out.
00:07:08,00:07:09,Wow.
00:07:09,00:07:12,Have they persuade the cancer cells to get on board?
00:07:12,00:07:13,Do they have a very cheap fare?
00:07:13,00:07:19,"It just looks like, it looks to the cancer cells, I think, like the way that they get around."
00:07:19,00:07:22,"So they're just assuming, oh, this is the route that we're going to go on."
00:07:22,00:07:23,That's unbelievable.
00:07:23,00:07:24,That's so cool.
00:07:24,00:07:25,And you thought Monorail's were bad.
00:07:25,00:07:28,They take it back.
00:07:28,00:07:29,That's awesome.
00:07:29,00:07:30,All right.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Anyone got anything else?
00:07:31,00:07:39,"San Diego World Animal Park opened in 1972 with a Monorail around the park, like a lot of things do."
00:07:39,00:07:42,The railway was called the Wagasa Busch Line.
00:07:42,00:07:46,Everyone thought Wagasa was like an African name or whatever.
00:07:46,00:07:49,"But it actually stood for, who gives a shit anyway?"
00:07:49,00:07:52,"Oh, I couldn't think of a name."
00:07:52,00:07:53,"Oh, wow."
00:07:53,00:07:58,That feels like the end of a long meeting.
00:07:58,00:08:01,"OK, time for fact number two."
00:08:01,00:08:02,Andy Murray.
00:08:02,00:08:10,My fact is that the great smog of 1952 was so bad that blind people led sighted people home from the train station.
00:08:10,00:08:13,The sighted people just could not see where they were going.
00:08:13,00:08:14,It was completely impossible.
00:08:14,00:08:20,"So the great smog is the most extraordinary, I think it was a five-day stretch in London specifically,"
00:08:20,00:08:22,but it later spread across the whole of the UK.
00:08:22,00:08:25,"OK, so what was it like people burning things in their houses or factories?"
00:08:25,00:08:26,"Yeah, a bit of a mix."
00:08:26,00:08:30,"So people were using coal, but they were using very dirty coal, which had lots of sulfur in it."
00:08:30,00:08:36,"And factories were also belching out lots of sulfur dioxide, which then turned into sulfuric acid in the air."
00:08:36,00:08:41,"And all the dirty coal, normally, the coal fumes would have just gone into the atmosphere and spread out."
00:08:41,00:08:48,"But there was this layer of coal there above London, which sort of formed this bubble, if you like, of warmer air inside."
00:08:48,00:08:51,And everything just turned back towards the ground and mixed with moisture.
00:08:51,00:08:55,So it would have been hazardous to your health to breathe in this small.
00:08:55,00:08:56,"Yes, very so."
00:08:56,00:08:57,"So, right."
00:08:57,00:09:02,"I think they think now that 12,000 people died and 100,000 became ill."
00:09:02,00:09:03,"Wow, yeah."
00:09:03,00:09:04,Oh my god.
00:09:04,00:09:08,"There were 19 people, I'm not sure if this was the same great smog it might have been."
00:09:08,00:09:14,"19 people were drowned after unwittingly walking into the Thames, because they couldn't see where they were going."
00:09:14,00:09:16,"So you couldn't see your feet, could you?"
00:09:16,00:09:17,At the end of it.
00:09:17,00:09:26,"And bus conductors had to get out of buses and have flames in front of buses to guide them down the street, because it was, I mean, it was about three feet of visibility."
00:09:26,00:09:28,"And librarians, I find this a really funny image."
00:09:28,00:09:36,So it got inside buildings and library workers reported walking through stacks of libraries and turning a corner along the library corridor
00:09:36,00:09:40,and suddenly bumping into a huge waft of smog that was just sitting in their library.
00:09:40,00:09:41,Yeah.
00:09:41,00:09:42,Just hanging in as a column.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Just hanging out.
00:09:43,00:09:44,It sounds like something.
00:09:44,00:09:45,It's amazing trying to check out a book.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Yeah.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Yeah.
00:09:47,00:09:51,"Because like, so I read the Sadler's Wells, they had to stop a play midway through because so much smog entered."
00:09:51,00:09:52,But I love that idea of that.
00:09:52,00:09:54,"It's that suddenly being like, whoa, the production levels of this."
00:09:54,00:09:56,"Wait, it's phenomenal."
00:09:56,00:09:57,Look at this.
00:09:57,00:10:00,And they had to abandon dog racing because the dogs couldn't see the hair.
00:10:00,00:10:01,So they just had to go.
00:10:01,00:10:03,And presumably the people couldn't see what his dog wanted.
00:10:03,00:10:04,Yeah.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Everyone's waiting.
00:10:05,00:10:06,Nobody can see anything.
00:10:06,00:10:07,Yeah.
00:10:07,00:10:10,And they had to cancel football matches because nobody could see the ball.
00:10:10,00:10:12,"You just kick the ball and you, that's it."
00:10:12,00:10:13,Everyone's looking for the ball.
00:10:13,00:10:14,"And then, you know, for half an hour."
00:10:14,00:10:17,I've been to football matches where they had to be cancelled for fog.
00:10:17,00:10:18,Really?
00:10:18,00:10:19,Yeah.
00:10:19,00:10:22,And it's interesting when you're like a fan because often you're behind the goal.
00:10:22,00:10:25,And you just can't see anything on the other side of the pitch.
00:10:25,00:10:28,And you just hear a massive cheer from the other side.
00:10:28,00:10:31,You've got no idea whether it's a goal or that it's valuable.
00:10:31,00:10:33,I like this as well.
00:10:33,00:10:36,"So, obviously, very dangerous on the railway lines because, you know,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,there were workers on the railway lines and if you can't see a train.
00:10:38,00:10:43,"So train engineers, what they would do, they put little explosives on the line itself,"
00:10:43,00:10:46,which would go off as the train went over them like a cap gun basically.
00:10:46,00:10:48,I like those things that kids throw on the floor.
00:10:48,00:10:49,"Yeah, exactly."
00:10:49,00:10:50,Yeah.
00:10:50,00:10:53,And then that would make a noise so that they would notify the workers that there was a train
00:10:53,00:10:55,coming slowly along the tracks and they could get out of the way.
00:10:55,00:10:56,"Oh, wow."
00:10:56,00:11:02,"But that must have been because a small like that when this must have been a really productive time of people going,"
00:11:02,00:11:07,"OK, buying people are now offering their services to walk people home at tube stations."
00:11:07,00:11:12,"The train people are going, OK, we're going to lay down like it's very home alone, isn't it?"
00:11:12,00:11:19,Like everyone's like trying to reinvent how you can get by in a city where you can't like a 1980s movie to use.
00:11:19,00:11:21,"Well, just think about it."
00:11:21,00:11:26,Like no one would have been prepared for an entire city to be totally just.
00:11:26,00:11:29,"Actually, it was kind of semi-common, wasn't it?"
00:11:29,00:11:31,That they would have these kind of things.
00:11:31,00:11:34,"This was the worst by miles, but peace supers were kind of common at the time."
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yeah.
00:11:35,00:11:38,"Peace super being, peace super just being the nickname for the, for the fog,"
00:11:38,00:11:40,because it was as thick as peace soup.
00:11:40,00:11:42,"And it was greenish, apparently."
00:11:42,00:11:43,Was it?
00:11:43,00:11:45,The greenish yellow has lots of commonit.
00:11:45,00:11:46,Yeah.
00:11:46,00:11:48,The licking the air.
00:11:48,00:11:53,"No, you're right. It would have been a time of ingenuity, but also like the roads were covered in abandoned cars,"
00:11:53,00:11:56,because people just could not see you to drive.
00:11:56,00:12:02,"Speaking of ingenuity, they have quite bad smog in China at the moment, especially in Beijing."
00:12:02,00:12:07,And the Chinese state media came up with a number of benefits of smog in China.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Has anyone seen these?
00:12:08,00:12:09,"Yeah, they're really good."
00:12:09,00:12:12,"So one, it unifies the Chinese people."
00:12:12,00:12:13,Which is quite good.
00:12:13,00:12:18,"It's kind of what you were saying, Dan, about, you know, everyone gets together and has to, it's like against a common enemy."
00:12:18,00:12:19,Yeah.
00:12:19,00:12:22,"If you excuse the 12,000 or so deaths, it's kind of a party."
00:12:22,00:12:23,Yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:24,What do you think about it?
00:12:24,00:12:25,"It's my big, massive smoke machine."
00:12:25,00:12:26,Yeah.
00:12:26,00:12:30,It's like the beginning of Matthew Kelly's stars in their eyes.
00:12:30,00:12:31,That's what it is.
00:12:31,00:12:34,"Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be falling in the tent."
00:12:34,00:12:41,Another one was it makes people more knowledgeable brackets of things like fog.
00:12:41,00:12:42,Sure.
00:12:42,00:12:45,And also apparently it makes people funnier.
00:12:45,00:12:48,"Oh, it's because of the dark humour that comes with it."
00:12:48,00:12:52,"But obviously, if you do come up with any jokes, don't put them online because the party will find you."
00:12:52,00:12:53,Yes.
00:12:53,00:12:54,Right in the smog.
00:12:54,00:12:58,"Actually, there was a fire in Beijing in 2013 at a furniture factory."
00:12:58,00:13:02,And no one noticed it was on fire because the smog in the city was so bad.
00:13:02,00:13:03,Wow.
00:13:03,00:13:04,That's terrible.
00:13:04,00:13:10,"Well, the thing in China as well, in Beijing particularly, is that the goby is kind of really encroaching"
00:13:10,00:13:11,on China at the moment.
00:13:11,00:13:16,"So not only so smog and fog must be a massive one, but they get huge sandstorms now."
00:13:16,00:13:19,They have sandstorm warnings on the weather now.
00:13:19,00:13:20,And they started this plan.
00:13:20,00:13:23,Did you know about the great green wall of China?
00:13:23,00:13:24,I do not.
00:13:24,00:13:28,"Yeah, they've been building this huge wall of effectively a forest wall."
00:13:28,00:13:29,Yeah.
00:13:29,00:13:33,Where they're going to try and stop the desert from encroaching and capture all the sand as it comes in.
00:13:33,00:13:36,So it's like sand versus smog at the moment.
00:13:36,00:13:39,Like an alien versus predator for the 21st century China.
00:13:39,00:13:40,Yeah.
00:13:40,00:13:41,They're taking each other on.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Yeah.
00:13:42,00:13:46,You compare everything to bad 2010 films.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Yeah.
00:13:47,00:13:48,Like shock to pusversus.
00:13:48,00:13:49,Yeah.
00:13:49,00:13:50,Yeah.
00:13:50,00:13:57,"In China, in 2013, alone Chinese consumers spent the equivalent of $140 million on anti smog devices,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,which is not great because I think--
00:13:59,00:14:00,"One day, anti smog."
00:14:00,00:14:01,"Oh, they're sorry."
00:14:01,00:14:03,They're just those smog masks that you see.
00:14:03,00:14:07,"A lot of people in China were only about a fifth of them work, so which is kind of a shame."
00:14:07,00:14:12,"But it's been adopted into their fashions because a couple of years ago on the catwalk,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,the people on the catwalk had to wear smog masks just because--
00:14:15,00:14:16,Oh.
00:14:16,00:14:19,And a designer decided to make smog masks suddenly fashionable.
00:14:19,00:14:24,So he's called Yin Peng and his 2015 collection includes fashionable smog masks.
00:14:24,00:14:25,And they look so cool.
00:14:25,00:14:26,So that's--
00:14:26,00:14:27,One of them looks like the shredder.
00:14:27,00:14:28,Is it the shredder who has--
00:14:28,00:14:29,Yeah.
00:14:29,00:14:30,From Tinian tradition.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Yeah.
00:14:31,00:14:32,One of them looks a bit like Darth Vader.
00:14:32,00:14:33,Yeah.
00:14:33,00:14:34,Are they all films from the '70s and '80s?
00:14:34,00:14:35,Yeah.
00:14:35,00:14:36,I think that's the thing he's going for.
00:14:36,00:14:37,Yeah.
00:14:37,00:14:38,This is the thing.
00:14:38,00:14:42,Hong Kong and China are very good at doing that kind of thing where they try and convince the
00:14:42,00:14:44,public that it's now fashionable.
00:14:44,00:14:47,"And when SARS came out, very similar."
00:14:47,00:14:49,When SARS-- remember when SARS came out?
00:14:49,00:14:50,That was first release.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Is that on the '90s film?
00:14:51,00:14:52,Yeah.
00:14:52,00:14:56,So everyone was wearing the masks to stop themselves from having the cops.
00:14:56,00:15:00,And there were like huge wrappers singing about SARS and stuff.
00:15:00,00:15:05,They tried to make it a pop culture thing so that people felt comfortable and cool wearing
00:15:05,00:15:06,SARS in your eyes.
00:15:06,00:15:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:07,00:15:10,It's better than dancing with the SARS.
00:15:10,00:15:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:11,00:15:13,"On Clayton, I think about sight."
00:15:13,00:15:14,Yes.
00:15:14,00:15:15,Vision.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Do you guys know about forbidden colours?
00:15:16,00:15:17,No.
00:15:17,00:15:19,I can't really if I didn't know this.
00:15:19,00:15:22,So we can't see all the colours that are available for us to see.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"For instance, reddish green."
00:15:24,00:15:26,You can't see reddish green with your eyes.
00:15:26,00:15:27,But that does exist.
00:15:27,00:15:29,And you also can't see yellowish blue.
00:15:29,00:15:34,So that means that you can't see a colour which is in equal parts getting more red and more green.
00:15:34,00:15:36,And more green at the same time.
00:15:36,00:15:40,"Because our cones, which are our receptors, which see these colours,"
00:15:40,00:15:44,"will, if they're exposing themselves to, let's say, the red part of reddish green,"
00:15:44,00:15:50,then they will shut down the green bits of the receptor to allow you to properly see the red and vice versa.
00:15:50,00:15:53,But we could have eyes that could allow us to see both.
00:15:53,00:15:57,"And some people think there was an experiment done in 1983, which tried to make people see both."
00:15:57,00:15:59,And there is a test you can do.
00:15:59,00:16:03,"And some people claim that they can see these never before seen, never before described colours."
00:16:03,00:16:08,"So if you look up for bidden colours or impossible colours test, you'll see it online."
00:16:08,00:16:13,"And it's a yellow square, an extra blue square, and there are two white crosses in the middle of each one."
00:16:13,00:16:18,"And if you stare at that for long enough, apparently you'll see a colour that has never before been seen."
00:16:18,00:16:19,Wow.
00:16:19,00:16:25,"I read a great thing about Tigre beetles, which apparently is that they can run so fast that they go blind."
00:16:25,00:16:26,Is that one?
00:16:26,00:16:27,What?
00:16:27,00:16:28,Yeah.
00:16:28,00:16:30,Is that like exceeding the speed of light?
00:16:30,00:16:34,"No, they exceed the speed of information, I guess, to their brain."
00:16:34,00:16:35,That's really funny.
00:16:35,00:16:39,"Yeah, they don't gather enough photons to make a picture of their prey."
00:16:39,00:16:45,"So they end up having to stop to let their brain catch up so that like, in pursuit running, and then they'd have to just pause."
00:16:45,00:16:48,So their brain can suddenly bring the visuals back.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Yeah.
00:16:49,00:16:54,Sometimes they'll stop three to four times before they actually catch their prey.
00:16:54,00:16:59,"They're like the opposite of pigeons, because pigeons could see a huge number of, as it were, frames per second."
00:16:59,00:17:00,Yeah.
00:17:00,00:17:04,"So we did that thing ages ago on QI, that a film in a cinema to them would look like a slideshow."
00:17:04,00:17:06,They would find it incredibly boring.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Yeah.
00:17:07,00:17:11,"And this has been used by some people to explain why pigeons don't get out the way as fast as we think they should,"
00:17:11,00:17:14,"if we're driving towards them or cycling towards them, it's because they're seeing stuff more frames per second."
00:17:14,00:17:19,"So they can wait for longer, because we slide there in the matrix."
00:17:19,00:17:20,Yeah.
00:17:20,00:17:21,But that's not true.
00:17:21,00:17:23,I crash into them all the time.
00:17:23,00:17:28,"So whatever this amazing senses, which means they can escape quicker, it's not working."
00:17:28,00:17:29,They're cycling pigeons.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Okay.
00:17:30,00:17:38,"So I'm from fact number three, and that is James."
00:17:38,00:17:39,Okay.
00:17:39,00:17:49,"My fact this week is that on the 24th of March 2015, the temperature in Antarctica was higher than in Malta, Madrid and Marrakesh."
00:17:49,00:17:52,It's a book you're flight now.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"No, that is extraordinary."
00:17:54,00:18:01,"This was the record temperature in Antarctica so far, and it was 17.5 degrees Celsius."
00:18:01,00:18:04,"And in all those three places, it was around 16 degrees."
00:18:04,00:18:05,Wow.
00:18:05,00:18:07,So does that mean you could go out in a T-shirt?
00:18:07,00:18:08,Yeah.
00:18:08,00:18:09,You could.
00:18:09,00:18:10,This was in the corner.
00:18:10,00:18:12,It's not like in the absolute South Pole.
00:18:12,00:18:16,"It was on Antarctica, but not right down in the centre where it probably was pretty cold."
00:18:16,00:18:18,You can always go out in a T-shirt.
00:18:18,00:18:19,That's true.
00:18:19,00:18:20,No one's stopping you.
00:18:20,00:18:21,No one's stopping you.
00:18:21,00:18:22,It's true.
00:18:22,00:18:24,"They have that thing called the 300 club, don't they?"
00:18:24,00:18:25,Do you know that?
00:18:25,00:18:32,"You sit in a sauna at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for as long as you can stand, and then you go out and run around the pole naked."
00:18:32,00:18:42,And the idea is that the difference in temperature is 300 degrees Fahrenheit and also that you pass through all 24 time zones in your imminent.
00:18:42,00:18:47,Do you need to do passport checks at all of those different borders?
00:18:47,00:18:48,"No, obviously not."
00:18:48,00:18:50,You don't get passport checks at time zones.
00:18:50,00:18:57,"No, but the parts of Antarctica are claimed by different countries, so theoretically they could follow barriers."
00:18:57,00:18:59,No one respects that though.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"Like no country that will be like this is ours and everyone's going, it's not."
00:19:03,00:19:04,But that's true.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"It's like Britain saying, oh, this bit's ours, and then everyone else is going, no, it's not."
00:19:08,00:19:09,But this is ours.
00:19:09,00:19:10,No way.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"No, this bit's ours."
00:19:11,00:19:12,"No, not really."
00:19:12,00:19:13,But this is ours.
00:19:13,00:19:18,"I thought there was a treaty of the Antarctic, which said no one owns it, but only about 50 countries have signed it,"
00:19:18,00:19:21,and it's probably countries which don't have large claims stakes.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"Yeah, equatorial guinea."
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Yeah, that's cool."
00:19:23,00:19:25,"We'll sign it, we'll call that."
00:19:25,00:19:27,We'll be the bigger person here.
00:19:27,00:19:35,"In order to bolster their claim to the Antarctic, Argentina sent a seven-month pregnant woman to Antarctica to give birth."
00:19:35,00:19:43,"So the first baby born in Antarctica was an Argentinian baby called Emil Marco Palma,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,and that was in '78 or possibly '79.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Yeah.
00:19:46,00:19:49,"I remember it was '78, I think, because it was the same year I was born."
00:19:49,00:19:52,"I mean, I don't remember it from when I was born."
00:19:52,00:19:55,"Even then, James was finding facts."
00:19:55,00:20:00,"I remember even thinking that could have been me, because the first test tube baby was in the same year."
00:20:00,00:20:01,We'll be spread on.
00:20:01,00:20:03,It was a big year for celebrity babies.
00:20:03,00:20:04,It's out.
00:20:04,00:20:05,"Oh, you could have been so special, James."
00:20:05,00:20:06,I know.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"Well, some people say I am."
00:20:07,00:20:08,Your mum.
00:20:08,00:20:09,She's a good woman.
00:20:09,00:20:17,So it's this idea that it's hotter in Antarctica isn't to say that it's always hotter in Antarctica.
00:20:17,00:20:21,They logged the record cold temperature last year as well.
00:20:21,00:20:25,So it's not to say that everything's warming up exactly by that amount.
00:20:25,00:20:29,"It's a lot more complicated than that, but of course this is all probably down to climate change."
00:20:29,00:20:30,Right.
00:20:30,00:20:34,"Oh, the big year Frank Dox took her breaking its own records constantly."
00:20:34,00:20:40,"And there's a guy online, he's called Maximiliano Herrera and he's a climatologist."
00:20:40,00:20:45,And he has a list of all the extreme temperature records for every nation on earth.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"It's a brilliant website, you know, if you like data go there."
00:20:48,00:20:56,And he's found that in 2015 so far five nations or territories have set or tied all-time records for the hottest temperature.
00:20:56,00:20:57,Wow.
00:20:57,00:21:03,"And they are Antarctica, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Wallis and Fortuna territory and Samoa."
00:21:03,00:21:07,"Have you seen the hottest temperature ever recorded was in America, I think."
00:21:07,00:21:12,"It was it's somewhat called Furnace Creek Ranch, but on the Wikipedia it says..."
00:21:12,00:21:14,"Is that just a coincidence, I'm name?"
00:21:14,00:21:18,"Well, on the Wikipedia it says in brackets after it, formally Greenland Ranch."
00:21:18,00:21:22,"I assume that they changed it after that, but I'm not sure."
00:21:22,00:21:24,"Come on, I've been there, is that not in Death Valley?"
00:21:24,00:21:25,Yeah.
00:21:25,00:21:26,"Yeah, I've been there, yeah."
00:21:26,00:21:27,It was hot.
00:21:27,00:21:36,"It was a sign saying you must not go out of your car as after 10 AM or something, because it was so hot, everyone was ignoring it of course."
00:21:36,00:21:39,And the people were like frying eggs on the floor and stuff like that.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Not hygienic.
00:21:40,00:21:43,That's something people never talk about when you talk about frying eggs on a car bonnet.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"It may work, but it's not hygienic at all."
00:21:45,00:21:48,"No, I don't think they generally eat them straight afterwards."
00:21:48,00:21:49,"Oh, do they not?"
00:21:49,00:21:50,What do they do with the eggs?
00:21:50,00:21:51,"Throw them away, maybe?"
00:21:51,00:21:52,It's the point of that.
00:21:52,00:21:58,"I know, it's a waste."
00:21:58,00:22:00,"You could eat something in a wrapper, like a microwave meal, for example, on the bonnet of your car."
00:22:00,00:22:03,"And then at least it would be hygienic, that's dealing with Anna's problem."
00:22:03,00:22:06,"Dad, please tell us the microwave fact that you told me yesterday."
00:22:06,00:22:09,"Oh, yeah, I saw this online on National Geographic."
00:22:09,00:22:12,There's been a pulse that's been detected.
00:22:12,00:22:13,A microwave...
00:22:13,00:22:17,"A space, supposedly, it could be a pulsar or aliens even?"
00:22:17,00:22:20,"Since the 90s, they've been thinking what the hell is this thing?"
00:22:20,00:22:23,"It's been a big mystery, and it would come by every so often."
00:22:23,00:22:25,"They'd log it, and no one would know what it was."
00:22:25,00:22:29,"And they've dealt with this kind of thing with space before, mysterious signals that they eventually find out."
00:22:29,00:22:32,"So they've continued the search to find out what it was, and they've had a breakthrough."
00:22:32,00:22:33,They now know what it is.
00:22:33,00:22:39,"The microwave signals were coming from a microwave, basically, on premise."
00:22:39,00:22:42,"Anytime somebody used it, it would send out microwave signals."
00:22:42,00:22:44,"It would register it, and that was mystery solved."
00:22:44,00:22:49,"They would always send the same pulses that were two minutes long, and then a 30 second gap."
00:22:49,00:22:51,And then another two minutes.
00:22:51,00:22:53,In a mysterious...
00:22:53,00:22:55,In every time.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"Is that, did you say, since the 90s?"
00:22:57,00:23:01,"Yeah, and I think it's neighbouring microwaves as well from houses around."
00:23:01,00:23:02,It was at Parks Observatory.
00:23:02,00:23:03,That's where it was.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Such a good fact.
00:23:04,00:23:06,I love that.
00:23:06,00:23:10,"So there has been some really weird weather this year in America, especially."
00:23:10,00:23:13,"So they've had down the West Coast, for instance, San Francisco."
00:23:13,00:23:16,"It was recorded at its first ever January without rain, I think."
00:23:16,00:23:18,"And then on the East Coast, it's been ridiculously snowy."
00:23:18,00:23:21,This everlasting snow in places like Boston.
00:23:21,00:23:25,"And they've realised, scientists have realised it's because of the blob."
00:23:25,00:23:26,What?
00:23:26,00:23:27,Which is...
00:23:27,00:23:28,It's this warm mass of water.
00:23:28,00:23:33,"It's a thousand miles long, and it's sitting off the west coast of America in the Pacific Ocean."
00:23:33,00:23:34,It's 300 feet deep.
00:23:34,00:23:37,"And it's not cooling off, and it's been there for about a year and a half."
00:23:37,00:23:40,"And it's just sitting there, like hot, not hot."
00:23:40,00:23:43,It's about seven degrees Fahrenheit above the water around it.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"And not cooling, like it usually would."
00:23:46,00:23:51,And so this is causing these crazy weather phenomena all across America because of the blob.
00:23:51,00:23:52,That's amazing.
00:23:52,00:23:53,"I've never heard that, that's amazing."
00:23:53,00:23:54,"Yeah, that's cool."
00:23:54,00:23:56,"So, here's a weather thing for you."
00:23:56,00:23:57,Go on.
00:23:57,00:24:01,What killed a third of Napoleon's army on his way to Moscow in 1812?
00:24:01,00:24:03,"Yes, it was the cold snap."
00:24:03,00:24:04,Was it?
00:24:04,00:24:05,"It wasn't, it was heatstroke."
00:24:05,00:24:06,What?
00:24:06,00:24:07,Yes.
00:24:07,00:24:08,No.
00:24:08,00:24:09,Yeah?
00:24:09,00:24:10,That's not what I learned in school.
00:24:10,00:24:11,It was just as much of a problem.
00:24:11,00:24:12,Seriously?
00:24:12,00:24:18,"The cold was also a big problem later on, but no, there was an enormous heat wave which killed a lot of the soldiers who died."
00:24:18,00:24:20,Was this going for an Antarctic style?
00:24:20,00:24:22,Let's break two records in one year.
00:24:22,00:24:26,How do you know what to wear in the morning?
00:24:26,00:24:27,"Yeah, it's quite."
00:24:27,00:24:29,It's a nightmare.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"You go invading Russia in layers, always."
00:24:32,00:24:33,That's what you're saying.
00:24:33,00:24:34,So you can take them off if you have to.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"I've got a fleece, but there's a crop top underneath here."
00:24:37,00:24:38,"That's right, I'll be fine."
00:24:38,00:24:41,"There's an incredible image of the journey, too, and from Moscow."
00:24:41,00:24:45,"And he starts out with 400,000 men, a very, very thick line, and it shows where he goes geographically."
00:24:45,00:24:47,What the temperature is along the way.
00:24:47,00:24:49,"By the time he gets there, he's got 100,000 men."
00:24:49,00:24:51,"By the time he gets back, he has 10,000 men."
00:24:51,00:24:52,"Yeah, that's incredible."
00:24:52,00:24:57,"It's one of the best infographics they would call them these days, but it's a very, very classic chart."
00:24:57,00:24:58,I'll try and put it up on my Twitter.
00:24:58,00:24:59,Yeah.
00:24:59,00:25:01,Because it looks unbelievably cool.
00:25:01,00:25:02,Wow.
00:25:02,00:25:03,"Oh, sorry."
00:25:03,00:25:04,No.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"I was just going to say, I do love how weather in places that you..."
00:25:07,00:25:13,It's hard to guess the one place that on this podcast is constantly mentioned that blows me away in terms of the facts.
00:25:13,00:25:14,Yeah.
00:25:14,00:25:15,Like the fact that fires...
00:25:15,00:25:16,Fire's a problem there.
00:25:16,00:25:19,"Yes, it's a problem, so they have a fire service there."
00:25:19,00:25:21,"Interesting, you say blows me away."
00:25:21,00:25:24,It's got a serious wind problem at the moment because of global issues as well.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"Oh, does it?"
00:25:25,00:25:26,Yeah.
00:25:26,00:25:32,"I read that it suffers from horizontal avalanches, but I think that's a kind of a description that people who are out there."
00:25:32,00:25:36,"It's not as dangerous or as crazy as it sounds, but they describe the idea of the horizontal avalanche."
00:25:36,00:25:39,I'm guessing it must be wind smashing...
00:25:39,00:25:40,That's weird.
00:25:40,00:25:42,So this is another thing that's happened in America.
00:25:42,00:25:43,I think that's called an ice shove.
00:25:43,00:25:47,Or it's also known as an ice tsunami.
00:25:47,00:25:52,"And it is where wind will, for instance, in a frozen lake,"
00:25:52,00:25:58,wind or weird water movements cause the ice to just move like a very slow tsunami onto the land.
00:25:58,00:26:01,But it happened last year in Minnesota.
00:26:01,00:26:02,And it's so weird.
00:26:02,00:26:07,People just woke up and this huge wall of ice was just creeping into their houses and creeping up.
00:26:07,00:26:11,"If you watch it, it moves at about a centimeter every couple of seconds."
00:26:11,00:26:14,"That is still scarier than smug, though, isn't it?"
00:26:14,00:26:15,Yeah.
00:26:15,00:26:18,Imagine walking through a library and there's a big load of ice.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Yeah.
00:26:19,00:26:21,Have you heard of spontaneous snowballs?
00:26:21,00:26:22,No.
00:26:22,00:26:24,This is a very similar thing.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Right.
00:26:25,00:26:29,"Basically, it's when snow rolls up and forms a snowball on the ground spontaneously because of the wind."
00:26:29,00:26:32,"And they have a hollow center and there can be, there can be huge."
00:26:32,00:26:34,There can be up to a foot in diameter.
00:26:34,00:26:39,And it's when you have a crust of old snow which is covered by a thin layer of new snow on top.
00:26:39,00:26:44,"And if the conditions are right, a small bit of snow gets rolled along by the wind and it gathers more as it goes."
00:26:44,00:26:46,And they have a hollow center.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Yeah.
00:26:47,00:26:48,That's amazing.
00:26:48,00:26:49,Very cool.
00:26:49,00:26:51,I was looking at places in Antarctica.
00:26:51,00:26:53,There are some quite good place names.
00:26:53,00:26:54,"Oh, I was literally just about to say this."
00:26:54,00:26:55,"Oh, we go from there."
00:26:55,00:26:56,"No, no, you go from there."
00:26:56,00:26:57,Take it and says do one each.
00:26:57,00:26:58,Okay.
00:26:58,00:26:59,Let's see who runs out first.
00:26:59,00:27:00,Okay.
00:27:00,00:27:01,All right.
00:27:01,00:27:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:02,00:27:03,Let's go.
00:27:03,00:27:04,So come to put my favourites now.
00:27:04,00:27:05,Nipple peak.
00:27:05,00:27:06,That's going to be hard to peak.
00:27:06,00:27:07,Yep.
00:27:07,00:27:08,Nobhead.
00:27:08,00:27:09,Wait a minute.
00:27:09,00:27:10,Are we doing names?
00:27:10,00:27:11,"Oh, just insults here."
00:27:11,00:27:13,Nobhead's good.
00:27:13,00:27:15,I will raise you dick peaks.
00:27:15,00:27:16,Similar theme.
00:27:16,00:27:17,Asses ears.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Nice.
00:27:18,00:27:20,The office girls.
00:27:20,00:27:22,I want to know why.
00:27:22,00:27:24,Shagnasty Island.
00:27:24,00:27:25,Football mountain.
00:27:25,00:27:27,Football mountain.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"A shapeless mountain, which is really interesting, because it was named that."
00:27:30,00:27:31,Like a mountain.
00:27:31,00:27:37,It was named that because of the inability of the discovering team to agree on what its actual shape was.
00:27:37,00:27:42,"So much so that shapeless mountain was a confusing thing that when they went to climb shapeless mountain,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,they climbed the wrong mountain.
00:27:44,00:27:49,Because they assumed it was shapeless mountain and they ended up naming that mountain that they mistakenly climbed.
00:27:49,00:27:50,Mistake peak.
00:27:50,00:27:51,Yeah.
00:27:51,00:27:55,I think I've only got mount cocks left and then I'm out.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"Guys, these names are about as much use as a hat full of busted assholes."
00:27:58,00:28:08,"Okay, time for our final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky."
00:28:08,00:28:15,My fact is that Tonga's official finance minister was also its official court jester.
00:28:15,00:28:21,"This is this guy Jesse Bogdanov, who was employed as a financial adviser in 1994,"
00:28:21,00:28:23,financial adviser to the government of Tonga.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"And he was, I guess, he got a promotion."
00:28:25,00:28:27,"Actually, he decided he to be court jester."
00:28:27,00:28:30,"It was at his own suggestion, as financial adviser said,"
00:28:30,00:28:33,"""Why don't you make me your court jester because my birthday is April 1st."""
00:28:33,00:28:35,"So, it seems like the obvious thing to do."
00:28:35,00:28:37,"It's not much of CV, that is it."
00:28:37,00:28:38,Why should you get this job?
00:28:38,00:28:40,"Well, my birthday is on April 1st."
00:28:40,00:28:43,It would have been better if it turned out his birthday wasn't on April 1st.
00:28:43,00:28:45,It was a trade.
00:28:45,00:28:47,Maybe it was.
00:28:47,00:28:51,"He wasn't a very trustworthy character at Slanderer, so I hope he's not listening."
00:28:51,00:28:55,He did lose the country about $25 million as their financial adviser.
00:28:55,00:28:56,"Wow, really?"
00:28:56,00:28:59,"Yeah, there was the Tonga Trust Fund, which he was given to manage,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,and he invested it all in...
00:29:01,00:29:03,Squirty flowers.
00:29:03,00:29:05,Massive shoes.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"Yeah, and the big shoe index fell off a cliff a few months later."
00:29:08,00:29:11,"So, what were those little cars all of it?"
00:29:11,00:29:13,It was basically that.
00:29:13,00:29:16,"He invested it in questionable places, and it disappeared."
00:29:16,00:29:17,Lost all their money.
00:29:17,00:29:18,He had to flee the country.
00:29:18,00:29:19,"Well, he fled the country."
00:29:19,00:29:22,"He left the country, and he can't return now, because he says he fears his life."
00:29:22,00:29:25,I think some Tonga and Sue put their money into this fund.
00:29:25,00:29:27,We're pretty angry when he lost it all.
00:29:27,00:29:29,"As court jester, he was quite fun."
00:29:29,00:29:35,"He used to play saxophone at royal events, and he wrote a poem about the king."
00:29:35,00:29:39,"And, yeah, he was generally an entertaining chap in that part of his life."
00:29:39,00:29:42,That doesn't sound like a lot.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Saxophone.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Saxophone, I haven't seen."
00:29:44,00:29:46,The funniest of all instruments.
00:29:46,00:29:48,"So, where is this guy now?"
00:29:48,00:29:49,He's in America.
00:29:49,00:29:51,He's changed his name to Jesse Dean.
00:29:51,00:29:58,"He's the founder and sole practitioner of a company called the Open Window Institute of Emotional Freedom in California,"
00:29:58,00:30:00,and he does offer hypnosis as part of it.
00:30:00,00:30:03,"So, he can't go back, because he's terrified for his life,"
00:30:03,00:30:05,"but is he a wanted man there, or is he...?"
00:30:05,00:30:07,I did not openly.
00:30:07,00:30:10,I thought he was forced to pay back a million dollars.
00:30:10,00:30:12,"He was forced to pay back a lot of money,"
00:30:12,00:30:14,"and he still has to pay part of his income to Tonga,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,but he never admitted any liability.
00:30:16,00:30:19,"That's very nice of him to pay back, then, isn't it?"
00:30:19,00:30:20,He's nice.
00:30:20,00:30:22,That's the goodness of my heart.
00:30:22,00:30:23,I totally get it.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"So, we should tell you Tonga, because a lot of people won't know much about Tonga."
00:30:26,00:30:27,Yeah.
00:30:27,00:30:29,Tonga is 171 different islands.
00:30:29,00:30:30,Okay.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"And they're spread over 700,000 square kilometres of ocean."
00:30:33,00:30:34,It's hugely spread out.
00:30:34,00:30:38,But only 36 of the islands actually got permanent inhabitants on them.
00:30:38,00:30:39,Right.
00:30:39,00:30:40,Okay.
00:30:40,00:30:41,"So, lots and lots of them are empty."
00:30:41,00:30:43,"They used to be called the friendly islands, didn't they?"
00:30:43,00:30:44,It was nice.
00:30:44,00:30:48,"They originally called that, because James Cook was given such a friendly welcome"
00:30:48,00:30:51,when he arrived there in 1773.
00:30:51,00:30:55,"But legend tells that unbeknownst to him when they were having a big feast,"
00:30:55,00:30:59,the only reason he departed unscathed was because the chiefs could not agree a plan
00:30:59,00:31:00,on how to kill him.
00:31:00,00:31:03,"So, I've been to parties like that."
00:31:03,00:31:06,They must have been kicking themselves after he left.
00:31:06,00:31:07,Yeah.
00:31:07,00:31:08,They must have been so close.
00:31:08,00:31:11,"Okay, so we're five to four in favour of decapitation."
00:31:11,00:31:12,Please.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Can we?
00:31:13,00:31:16,"Yeah, it's amazing that there isn't just, okay, if we don't decide on anything,"
00:31:16,00:31:17,here's our fallback.
00:31:17,00:31:20,"Like, how do you not have a plan V of basic death?"
00:31:20,00:31:24,"Between 1918 and 2006, Tonga had only two monarchs."
00:31:24,00:31:25,Very amazing.
00:31:25,00:31:26,Do we know who the current one is?
00:31:26,00:31:27,"No, nobody knows."
00:31:27,00:31:32,It's just people have been looking into it.
00:31:32,00:31:34,The current one is George Tupor the sixth.
00:31:34,00:31:36,What do we know about George Tupor the sixth?
00:31:36,00:31:37,Almost nothing.
00:31:37,00:31:38,Oh.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"But I believe we know some interesting stuff about George Tupor the fifth,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,who was quite a fun character.
00:31:43,00:31:50,"He used to own the island's only power company, brewery and mobile phone company."
00:31:50,00:31:52,He got rid of them eventually.
00:31:52,00:31:53,That sounds like he was having a fun time.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"Sounds like an entrepreneur, I like him."
00:31:55,00:31:57,Was he just making drunken phone calls all the time?
00:31:57,00:31:58,Is that his life?
00:31:58,00:32:00,"Oh, no, no."
00:32:00,00:32:06,"Oh, he also, I think it was him, wasn't it, who insisted on being driven round in a London black cab everywhere?"
00:32:06,00:32:14,And the reason that he gave it this was because a London taxi has the right proportions to make it easy for you to get in and out whilst wearing spurs and a sword.
00:32:14,00:32:15,Wow.
00:32:15,00:32:17,Which I think is why we all ride around in them sometimes.
00:32:17,00:32:18,That's why I never use Uber.
00:32:18,00:32:22,I can't get my sword out of there.
00:32:22,00:32:25,I've got a couple of things on gestures.
00:32:25,00:32:27,I don't know if anyone does.
00:32:27,00:32:39,"So one thing that surprised me is that I just probably very stupidly assumed that all gestures were male back in the 1500s, the old times."
00:32:39,00:32:42,But gestress was an occupation as well.
00:32:42,00:32:43,"Oh, that's cool."
00:32:43,00:32:48,I can't just say that is definitely not the stupidest thing you've ever assumed in.
00:32:48,00:32:49,"Okay, good."
00:32:49,00:32:50,Keep going.
00:32:50,00:32:57,So Le Jardinier served as Mary Stewart's gestress in 1543.
00:32:57,00:33:00,And she was there for a very long time.
00:33:00,00:33:02,And she got paid very well.
00:33:02,00:33:05,She even got paid four pounds of snow every summer.
00:33:05,00:33:07,I think paid very well.
00:33:07,00:33:09,I reckon you believe the P.R. that she believes.
00:33:09,00:33:11,"I think that wasn't cocaine, was it?"
00:33:11,00:33:15,"Because if it's cocaine, then four pounds is a lot, I believe."
00:33:15,00:33:17,I think that was bonus money.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Four pounds of snow.
00:33:18,00:33:20,Three pounds of scag.
00:33:20,00:33:21,Yeah.
00:33:21,00:33:22,It was seen as a refrigeration.
00:33:22,00:33:23,Yeah.
00:33:23,00:33:31,"I can see that that's useful, especially in the spring, having a bit of, you know, a bit of snow in your, in your underhouses."
00:33:31,00:33:32,Yeah.
00:33:32,00:33:33,To keep things cold.
00:33:33,00:33:34,Yeah.
00:33:34,00:33:35,"It's like a brahi, we've mentioned him before."
00:33:35,00:33:40,"He had his own gesture, who was a little person."
00:33:40,00:33:49,"And it was his own personal gesture, who brahi thought possessed psychic powers, and he used to make him sit under the dinner table while he ate dinner."
00:33:49,00:33:55,"And in the source I read, I think it was an I.O.9, which I do like the source, but it said he's just had to sit under the table while he ate dinner."
00:33:55,00:33:58,Probably best not to speculate why he had to do this.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Oh.
00:33:59,00:34:01,I don't think that was a necessary comment.
00:34:01,00:34:02,Yeah.
00:34:02,00:34:06,Didn't take a brahi die because he refused to leave the table.
00:34:06,00:34:09,Yeah.
00:34:09,00:34:11,When he needed some pee and he never left.
00:34:11,00:34:17,So maybe the gesture had enough of him and then kind of held on to him and stopped him from leaving.
00:34:17,00:34:18,I made him die.
00:34:18,00:34:19,"Oh, that's what he was thinking."
00:34:19,00:34:20,He was speculating a little here.
00:34:20,00:34:24,"My other, my favorite gesture that I've learned about recently."
00:34:24,00:34:26,Perkyo of Heidelberg.
00:34:26,00:34:27,I'm here at a minute.
00:34:27,00:34:28,No.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"Perkyo of Heidelberg, 18th century in Germany."
00:34:30,00:34:34,His name actually was a shortening of an Italian for why not?
00:34:34,00:34:35,It's a Perkyo.
00:34:35,00:34:39,So he was a dwarf and he was famous for his ability to drink.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"And any time he was offered a drink, he would say."
00:34:42,00:34:44,"Perkyo, which was his name."
00:34:44,00:34:45,Why not?
00:34:45,00:34:46,And he would keep drinking.
00:34:46,00:34:48,That was basically his main entertainment.
00:34:48,00:34:51,He would just be drunk the whole time and he supposedly lived into his 80s.
00:34:51,00:34:53,So it didn't kill him.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"But yeah, that was his one main thing."
00:34:56,00:35:03,There must have been times where his name was and where his catchphrase was quite annoying to him.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"Hey, do you want to put this snake on your leg?"
00:35:05,00:35:06,Perkyo.
00:35:06,00:35:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:09,00:35:10,Do you want to punch in the face?
00:35:10,00:35:11,Perkyo.
00:35:11,00:35:17,Because St. Chrysostom defined the fool as he who gets slapped.
00:35:17,00:35:18,Really?
00:35:18,00:35:19,Wow.
00:35:19,00:35:20,That's a good definition.
00:35:20,00:35:26,"It's also kind of misleading because the role of fools in, let's say, Tudor Courts and Late Medieval Courts"
00:35:26,00:35:30,"was to be the person who could insult the monarch, but get away with it, wasn't it?"
00:35:30,00:35:35,I like the trick that King James is sixth of Scotland's Jester George Buchanan played on him.
00:35:35,00:35:39,So James is sixth was really lazy about signing official documents and he just signed them without reading them.
00:35:39,00:35:43,"And you know, George kept nagging him like someone knowing why I've actually read the documents."
00:35:43,00:35:44,And he wouldn't learn.
00:35:44,00:35:48,"So George the Jester eventually went to James and made him sign this document,"
00:35:48,00:35:52,which had tricked him into advocating the throne and giving it up to his Jester.
00:35:52,00:35:53,And then he took the document away.
00:35:53,00:35:58,"He walked back into the room, said to the king, ""Oh, could you just get up or feel throne for a second?"""
00:35:58,00:36:03,"And then he, the Jester sat down on it and said, ""I'm king now, by the way, showed in the document."""
00:36:03,00:36:07,And apparently King James is sixth always read his official documents after that.
00:36:07,00:36:10,But the Jester was brutally capitulated.
00:36:10,00:36:18,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening."
