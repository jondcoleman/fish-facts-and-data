00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting with Anne Chazinski, James Harkin and Andy Murray.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 in the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Starting with fact number one, that's my fact.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 My fact this week is that monorails were originally horse-drawn.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 That's really great. It's like the ultra-modern with not very modern at all.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Yeah, exactly. It's the future, but there's a horse attack.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 It's like everything. I always wonder.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Spaceships of the same thing, I think.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Yeah, exactly. I've always wanted to, though, if back in that period there were books

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 called "When Will I Get My Hover Horse?"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 They hadn't yet known about the next bit of technology.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 The thing I really love about it is all the main new inventions coming out of that time.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Even household stuff that was run on QI that vacuumed cleaners used to be horse-drawn as well.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Just everything was horse-drawn. We should say why, because that sounds insane.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 They were really, really, really big is the idea.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 The vacuum cleaner would pull up outside your house and they would send in tubes

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 to who were inside the house, and it would suck all the dust.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 And the tubes were see-through, so you could see all of the crap coming out of the house.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 It was quite cool, because then you just like see what your neighbours, all the crap that's in that house.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 You don't want to put embarrassing stuff on your floor.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 So you might end up doing that thing of making sure all the stuff that's vacuumed

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 looks really expensive and nice, you know, just for a nosy neighbours.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I mean, masks, yeah.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Got a few more, doesn't matter.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 I don't know if you've seen it, but the Jackson's have some very expensive looking dust.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 So when are we talking? What era?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 This was in 1820, and it was a guy called Ivan Elmanov, and this was in Russia.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 The 1800s, like when you think about all of these horse-powered things,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 it just feels like it was such a productive time for horses.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 They had a lot of jobs that they seemed to have gone through like a job recession recently,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 because they were doing monorails, they were doing obviously fire engines,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 they were doing trains, they were, I mean, they were everywhere and there was this amazing robot.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Actually, before I mentioned this bit, they were used in plays with the first Ben Hur play

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 that they did on Broadway was done using real horses on treadmills on the stage.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Yeah, on these treadmills.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And they were attached to these poles so that the horses couldn't get loose and go into the crowd.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 But they wanted to make it as spectacle when the audience was watching the chariot races.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 That's quite as spectacle, isn't it?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Yeah. So all these horses were lined, bolting like crazy on a movable floor,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 so they weren't making any ground, and it toured the world.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 It was a huge, huge place, so they were in plays as well.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Do you think the Grand National will ever just be on treadmills?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Wow, it's not a bad idea, yeah.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Well, it's not a great idea, is it?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 That's wrong with it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 One disadvantage, for instance, is you only have a very small amount of place

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 where people couldn't watch.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 But on the other hand, everyone there gets a really good view of the whole race.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 You don't see the horses go by a flap, and then you have to wait on a five minutes.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 You watch the whole race, yeah.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 You see the whole race.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 No jumps.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 That's a problem.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Not with my revolutionary moving hedge treadmills.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Maybe like an OK-go video, don't you?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Monorails are very old-fashioned, in a way.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 So the official monorail, well, I don't know how official it is, but the Monorail's website, I looked at.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 What was the website?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 It's monorails.org, I think, on monorails.com.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 It's one of the two.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 But there are lots of theories that the guys who run that website have about why monorails are not more popular.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Why we're not all on a monorail all the time.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And they've said that, like, there is one theory that they espouse,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 that people actually make a lot more money out of railways,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 or that more groups of people stand to make a profit out of railways.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 So that's why they've been keeping monorails down.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 It's the same reason we don't have those everlasting light bulbs.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 The light bulb manufacturers will go out of business.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Or the idea that Gillette supposedly have come up with a blade that never dullens,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 but they won't sell it, because then people stop buying blades.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Yeah, I don't buy it myself.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 But they also say that another problem is that people think of monorails as being a bit eccentric or quaint.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 So the Disney problem is what you've got to know, that they go around Disney World,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 or Chessington World of Adventures, and they're not serious.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 They aren't that serious, so are they really?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 I like them, though.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 But it's like someone who rides a unicycle just going,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 "I don't know why everyone's riding unicycles."

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 It's because they make money out of that extra wheel.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 It's also because it's much easier to ride a bicycle, mate,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 and it's much easier to make a train.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 It is more than really unbalanced, like unicycles.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Well, they were very hard to balance.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 They're not, because they have saddlebags kind of below the level of the track.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 So you have to admit that it's more complicated and difficult than just having to get ready.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 So the trains people have got to you.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Winston Churchill once drove a monorail.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Did he?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Yeah.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 For a job?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 No, for a job, no.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 In 1910, before he was Prime Minister, was it a British exhibition?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And the Daily Mail wrote it up and said it was as interesting to him as a new toy would be to a child.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 And he liked it so much that he then persuaded the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to come and have a go.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And he put loads of money into developing it, and he was hugely enthused.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Now the money ran out, eventually.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 That was a nice simile, as interesting as a toy to a child.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 And I have some other similes here.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 As useful as a coal man on a maglev monorail means, like, as useful as a chocolate tea pot.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Or something like that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 A coal man on a maglev monorail.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Yeah, because you don't need to put coal into a monorail because they run on magnets.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 See?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 There's a list of some other as useful as a, which I found online.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 So, these are all things that are useless.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 As useful as a warm bucket of spit.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Like one of those really handy cold buckets of spit.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 And another one, this is my favourite.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 As useful as a hat full of busted assholes.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 So that's a little hat full of busted ass, a little phrase that you could use.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Wow.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Have you guys heard of tumor monorails?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 There's a medical innovation they've come up with.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 So it's still in the very early days.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 But they're very tiny nano fibers which scientists want to use to put into the body to persuade cancer cells to move along them.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Because it mimics the past that cancers use to get around inside the body.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 So they latch on the cancerous cells.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 They get them to other bits of the body, which is either where scientists can cut them out more safely,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 as well as less dangerous to operate.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Or they can even, they've tried experiments actually moving them out of the body.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And this is just on rats.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 They've tried an into a toxic gel.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Isn't that incredible?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Do you look really real comics coming out of your face?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 And you just watch the little train total out.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Wow.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Have they persuade the cancer cells to get on board?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Do they have a very cheap fare?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 It just looks like, it looks to the cancer cells, I think, like the way that they get around.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 So they're just assuming, oh, this is the route that we're going to go on.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 That's unbelievable.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 That's so cool.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 And you thought Monorail's were bad.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 They take it back.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 That's awesome.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 All right.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Anyone got anything else?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 San Diego World Animal Park opened in 1972 with a Monorail around the park, like a lot of things do.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 The railway was called the Wagasa Busch Line.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Everyone thought Wagasa was like an African name or whatever.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 But it actually stood for, who gives a shit anyway?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Oh, I couldn't think of a name.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Oh, wow.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 That feels like the end of a long meeting.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 OK, time for fact number two.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Andy Murray.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 My fact is that the great smog of 1952 was so bad that blind people led sighted people home from the train station.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 The sighted people just could not see where they were going.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 It was completely impossible.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 So the great smog is the most extraordinary, I think it was a five-day stretch in London specifically,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 but it later spread across the whole of the UK.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 OK, so what was it like people burning things in their houses or factories?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Yeah, a bit of a mix.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 So people were using coal, but they were using very dirty coal, which had lots of sulfur in it.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And factories were also belching out lots of sulfur dioxide, which then turned into sulfuric acid in the air.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 And all the dirty coal, normally, the coal fumes would have just gone into the atmosphere and spread out.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 But there was this layer of coal there above London, which sort of formed this bubble, if you like, of warmer air inside.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 And everything just turned back towards the ground and mixed with moisture.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 So it would have been hazardous to your health to breathe in this small.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Yes, very so.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 So, right.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 I think they think now that 12,000 people died and 100,000 became ill.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Wow, yeah.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Oh my god.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 There were 19 people, I'm not sure if this was the same great smog it might have been.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 19 people were drowned after unwittingly walking into the Thames, because they couldn't see where they were going.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 So you couldn't see your feet, could you?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 At the end of it.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And bus conductors had to get out of buses and have flames in front of buses to guide them down the street, because it was, I mean, it was about three feet of visibility.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 And librarians, I find this a really funny image.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 So it got inside buildings and library workers reported walking through stacks of libraries and turning a corner along the library corridor

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 and suddenly bumping into a huge waft of smog that was just sitting in their library.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Yeah.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Just hanging in as a column.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Just hanging out.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 It sounds like something.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 It's amazing trying to check out a book.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Yeah.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Yeah.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Because like, so I read the Sadler's Wells, they had to stop a play midway through because so much smog entered.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 But I love that idea of that.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 It's that suddenly being like, whoa, the production levels of this.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Wait, it's phenomenal.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Look at this.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 And they had to abandon dog racing because the dogs couldn't see the hair.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 So they just had to go.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 And presumably the people couldn't see what his dog wanted.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Yeah.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Everyone's waiting.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Nobody can see anything.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Yeah.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And they had to cancel football matches because nobody could see the ball.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 You just kick the ball and you, that's it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Everyone's looking for the ball.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 And then, you know, for half an hour.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 I've been to football matches where they had to be cancelled for fog.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Really?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Yeah.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 And it's interesting when you're like a fan because often you're behind the goal.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And you just can't see anything on the other side of the pitch.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And you just hear a massive cheer from the other side.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 You've got no idea whether it's a goal or that it's valuable.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 I like this as well.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 So, obviously, very dangerous on the railway lines because, you know,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 there were workers on the railway lines and if you can't see a train.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 So train engineers, what they would do, they put little explosives on the line itself,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 which would go off as the train went over them like a cap gun basically.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 I like those things that kids throw on the floor.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Yeah.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 And then that would make a noise so that they would notify the workers that there was a train

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 coming slowly along the tracks and they could get out of the way.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Oh, wow.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 But that must have been because a small like that when this must have been a really productive time of people going,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 OK, buying people are now offering their services to walk people home at tube stations.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 The train people are going, OK, we're going to lay down like it's very home alone, isn't it?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Like everyone's like trying to reinvent how you can get by in a city where you can't like a 1980s movie to use.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Well, just think about it.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Like no one would have been prepared for an entire city to be totally just.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Actually, it was kind of semi-common, wasn't it?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 That they would have these kind of things.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 This was the worst by miles, but peace supers were kind of common at the time.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Yeah.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Peace super being, peace super just being the nickname for the, for the fog,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 because it was as thick as peace soup.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And it was greenish, apparently.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Was it?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 The greenish yellow has lots of commonit.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Yeah.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 The licking the air.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 No, you're right. It would have been a time of ingenuity, but also like the roads were covered in abandoned cars,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 because people just could not see you to drive.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Speaking of ingenuity, they have quite bad smog in China at the moment, especially in Beijing.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And the Chinese state media came up with a number of benefits of smog in China.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Has anyone seen these?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Yeah, they're really good.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 So one, it unifies the Chinese people.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Which is quite good.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 It's kind of what you were saying, Dan, about, you know, everyone gets together and has to, it's like against a common enemy.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Yeah.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 If you excuse the 12,000 or so deaths, it's kind of a party.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Yeah.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 What do you think about it?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 It's my big, massive smoke machine.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Yeah.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 It's like the beginning of Matthew Kelly's stars in their eyes.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 That's what it is.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be falling in the tent.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Another one was it makes people more knowledgeable brackets of things like fog.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Sure.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And also apparently it makes people funnier.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Oh, it's because of the dark humour that comes with it.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 But obviously, if you do come up with any jokes, don't put them online because the party will find you.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Yes.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Right in the smog.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Actually, there was a fire in Beijing in 2013 at a furniture factory.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 And no one noticed it was on fire because the smog in the city was so bad.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Wow.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 That's terrible.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Well, the thing in China as well, in Beijing particularly, is that the goby is kind of really encroaching

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 on China at the moment.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 So not only so smog and fog must be a massive one, but they get huge sandstorms now.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 They have sandstorm warnings on the weather now.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 And they started this plan.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Did you know about the great green wall of China?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 I do not.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Yeah, they've been building this huge wall of effectively a forest wall.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Yeah.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Where they're going to try and stop the desert from encroaching and capture all the sand as it comes in.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 So it's like sand versus smog at the moment.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Like an alien versus predator for the 21st century China.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Yeah.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 They're taking each other on.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Yeah.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 You compare everything to bad 2010 films.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Yeah.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Like shock to pusversus.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Yeah.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Yeah.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 In China, in 2013, alone Chinese consumers spent the equivalent of $140 million on anti smog devices,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 which is not great because I think--

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 One day, anti smog.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Oh, they're sorry.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 They're just those smog masks that you see.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 A lot of people in China were only about a fifth of them work, so which is kind of a shame.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 But it's been adopted into their fashions because a couple of years ago on the catwalk,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 the people on the catwalk had to wear smog masks just because--

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 Oh.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 And a designer decided to make smog masks suddenly fashionable.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 So he's called Yin Peng and his 2015 collection includes fashionable smog masks.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 And they look so cool.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 So that's--

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 One of them looks like the shredder.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Is it the shredder who has--

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Yeah.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 From Tinian tradition.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Yeah.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 One of them looks a bit like Darth Vader.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Yeah.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Are they all films from the '70s and '80s?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Yeah.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 I think that's the thing he's going for.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Yeah.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 This is the thing.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Hong Kong and China are very good at doing that kind of thing where they try and convince the

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 public that it's now fashionable.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 And when SARS came out, very similar.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 When SARS-- remember when SARS came out?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 That was first release.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Is that on the '90s film?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Yeah.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 So everyone was wearing the masks to stop themselves from having the cops.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 And there were like huge wrappers singing about SARS and stuff.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 They tried to make it a pop culture thing so that people felt comfortable and cool wearing

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 SARS in your eyes.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 It's better than dancing with the SARS.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 On Clayton, I think about sight.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Yes.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Vision.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Do you guys know about forbidden colours?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 No.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 I can't really if I didn't know this.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 So we can't see all the colours that are available for us to see.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 For instance, reddish green.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 You can't see reddish green with your eyes.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 But that does exist.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 And you also can't see yellowish blue.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 So that means that you can't see a colour which is in equal parts getting more red and more green.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And more green at the same time.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Because our cones, which are our receptors, which see these colours,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 will, if they're exposing themselves to, let's say, the red part of reddish green,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 then they will shut down the green bits of the receptor to allow you to properly see the red and vice versa.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 But we could have eyes that could allow us to see both.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 And some people think there was an experiment done in 1983, which tried to make people see both.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 And there is a test you can do.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 And some people claim that they can see these never before seen, never before described colours.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 So if you look up for bidden colours or impossible colours test, you'll see it online.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 And it's a yellow square, an extra blue square, and there are two white crosses in the middle of each one.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 And if you stare at that for long enough, apparently you'll see a colour that has never before been seen.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Wow.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 I read a great thing about Tigre beetles, which apparently is that they can run so fast that they go blind.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Is that one?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 What?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Yeah.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Is that like exceeding the speed of light?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 No, they exceed the speed of information, I guess, to their brain.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 That's really funny.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Yeah, they don't gather enough photons to make a picture of their prey.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 So they end up having to stop to let their brain catch up so that like, in pursuit running, and then they'd have to just pause.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 So their brain can suddenly bring the visuals back.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 Yeah.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Sometimes they'll stop three to four times before they actually catch their prey.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 They're like the opposite of pigeons, because pigeons could see a huge number of, as it were, frames per second.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Yeah.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 So we did that thing ages ago on QI, that a film in a cinema to them would look like a slideshow.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 They would find it incredibly boring.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Yeah.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 And this has been used by some people to explain why pigeons don't get out the way as fast as we think they should,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 if we're driving towards them or cycling towards them, it's because they're seeing stuff more frames per second.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 So they can wait for longer, because we slide there in the matrix.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Yeah.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 But that's not true.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 I crash into them all the time.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 So whatever this amazing senses, which means they can escape quicker, it's not working.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 They're cycling pigeons.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Okay.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 So I'm from fact number three, and that is James.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Okay.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 My fact this week is that on the 24th of March 2015, the temperature in Antarctica was higher than in Malta, Madrid and Marrakesh.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 It's a book you're flight now.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 No, that is extraordinary.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 This was the record temperature in Antarctica so far, and it was 17.5 degrees Celsius.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And in all those three places, it was around 16 degrees.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Wow.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 So does that mean you could go out in a T-shirt?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Yeah.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 You could.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 This was in the corner.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 It's not like in the absolute South Pole.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 It was on Antarctica, but not right down in the centre where it probably was pretty cold.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 You can always go out in a T-shirt.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 That's true.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 No one's stopping you.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 No one's stopping you.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 It's true.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 They have that thing called the 300 club, don't they?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Do you know that?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 You sit in a sauna at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for as long as you can stand, and then you go out and run around the pole naked.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 And the idea is that the difference in temperature is 300 degrees Fahrenheit and also that you pass through all 24 time zones in your imminent.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Do you need to do passport checks at all of those different borders?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 No, obviously not.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 You don't get passport checks at time zones.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 No, but the parts of Antarctica are claimed by different countries, so theoretically they could follow barriers.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 No one respects that though.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Like no country that will be like this is ours and everyone's going, it's not.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 But that's true.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 It's like Britain saying, oh, this bit's ours, and then everyone else is going, no, it's not.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 But this is ours.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 No way.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 No, this bit's ours.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 No, not really.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 But this is ours.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 I thought there was a treaty of the Antarctic, which said no one owns it, but only about 50 countries have signed it,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 and it's probably countries which don't have large claims stakes.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Yeah, equatorial guinea.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 We'll sign it, we'll call that.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 We'll be the bigger person here.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 In order to bolster their claim to the Antarctic, Argentina sent a seven-month pregnant woman to Antarctica to give birth.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 So the first baby born in Antarctica was an Argentinian baby called Emil Marco Palma,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 and that was in '78 or possibly '79.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Yeah.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 I remember it was '78, I think, because it was the same year I was born.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 I mean, I don't remember it from when I was born.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Even then, James was finding facts.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 I remember even thinking that could have been me, because the first test tube baby was in the same year.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 We'll be spread on.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 It was a big year for celebrity babies.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 It's out.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Oh, you could have been so special, James.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 I know.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Well, some people say I am.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Your mum.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 She's a good woman.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 So it's this idea that it's hotter in Antarctica isn't to say that it's always hotter in Antarctica.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 They logged the record cold temperature last year as well.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 So it's not to say that everything's warming up exactly by that amount.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 It's a lot more complicated than that, but of course this is all probably down to climate change.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Right.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Oh, the big year Frank Dox took her breaking its own records constantly.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 And there's a guy online, he's called Maximiliano Herrera and he's a climatologist.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And he has a list of all the extreme temperature records for every nation on earth.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 It's a brilliant website, you know, if you like data go there.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And he's found that in 2015 so far five nations or territories have set or tied all-time records for the hottest temperature.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Wow.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And they are Antarctica, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Wallis and Fortuna territory and Samoa.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Have you seen the hottest temperature ever recorded was in America, I think.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 It was it's somewhat called Furnace Creek Ranch, but on the Wikipedia it says...

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Is that just a coincidence, I'm name?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Well, on the Wikipedia it says in brackets after it, formally Greenland Ranch.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 I assume that they changed it after that, but I'm not sure.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Come on, I've been there, is that not in Death Valley?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Yeah.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Yeah, I've been there, yeah.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 It was hot.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 It was a sign saying you must not go out of your car as after 10 AM or something, because it was so hot, everyone was ignoring it of course.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And the people were like frying eggs on the floor and stuff like that.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Not hygienic.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 That's something people never talk about when you talk about frying eggs on a car bonnet.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 It may work, but it's not hygienic at all.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 No, I don't think they generally eat them straight afterwards.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Oh, do they not?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 What do they do with the eggs?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Throw them away, maybe?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 It's the point of that.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 I know, it's a waste.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 You could eat something in a wrapper, like a microwave meal, for example, on the bonnet of your car.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 And then at least it would be hygienic, that's dealing with Anna's problem.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Dad, please tell us the microwave fact that you told me yesterday.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Oh, yeah, I saw this online on National Geographic.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 There's been a pulse that's been detected.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 A microwave...

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 A space, supposedly, it could be a pulsar or aliens even?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Since the 90s, they've been thinking what the hell is this thing?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 It's been a big mystery, and it would come by every so often.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 They'd log it, and no one would know what it was.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 And they've dealt with this kind of thing with space before, mysterious signals that they eventually find out.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 So they've continued the search to find out what it was, and they've had a breakthrough.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 They now know what it is.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 The microwave signals were coming from a microwave, basically, on premise.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Anytime somebody used it, it would send out microwave signals.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 It would register it, and that was mystery solved.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 They would always send the same pulses that were two minutes long, and then a 30 second gap.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 And then another two minutes.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 In a mysterious...

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 In every time.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Is that, did you say, since the 90s?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Yeah, and I think it's neighbouring microwaves as well from houses around.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 It was at Parks Observatory.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 That's where it was.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Such a good fact.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 I love that.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 So there has been some really weird weather this year in America, especially.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 So they've had down the West Coast, for instance, San Francisco.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 It was recorded at its first ever January without rain, I think.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 And then on the East Coast, it's been ridiculously snowy.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 This everlasting snow in places like Boston.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And they've realised, scientists have realised it's because of the blob.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 What?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Which is...

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 It's this warm mass of water.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 It's a thousand miles long, and it's sitting off the west coast of America in the Pacific Ocean.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 It's 300 feet deep.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 And it's not cooling off, and it's been there for about a year and a half.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 And it's just sitting there, like hot, not hot.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 It's about seven degrees Fahrenheit above the water around it.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 And not cooling, like it usually would.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And so this is causing these crazy weather phenomena all across America because of the blob.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 That's amazing.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 I've never heard that, that's amazing.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 So, here's a weather thing for you.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Go on.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 What killed a third of Napoleon's army on his way to Moscow in 1812?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Yes, it was the cold snap.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Was it?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 It wasn't, it was heatstroke.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 What?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Yes.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 No.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Yeah?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 That's not what I learned in school.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 It was just as much of a problem.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Seriously?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 The cold was also a big problem later on, but no, there was an enormous heat wave which killed a lot of the soldiers who died.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Was this going for an Antarctic style?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Let's break two records in one year.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 How do you know what to wear in the morning?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Yeah, it's quite.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 It's a nightmare.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 You go invading Russia in layers, always.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 That's what you're saying.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 So you can take them off if you have to.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 I've got a fleece, but there's a crop top underneath here.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 That's right, I'll be fine.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 There's an incredible image of the journey, too, and from Moscow.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And he starts out with 400,000 men, a very, very thick line, and it shows where he goes geographically.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 What the temperature is along the way.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 By the time he gets there, he's got 100,000 men.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 By the time he gets back, he has 10,000 men.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Yeah, that's incredible.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 It's one of the best infographics they would call them these days, but it's a very, very classic chart.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 I'll try and put it up on my Twitter.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Yeah.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Because it looks unbelievably cool.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Wow.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 No.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 I was just going to say, I do love how weather in places that you...

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 It's hard to guess the one place that on this podcast is constantly mentioned that blows me away in terms of the facts.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Yeah.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Like the fact that fires...

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Fire's a problem there.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Yes, it's a problem, so they have a fire service there.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Interesting, you say blows me away.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 It's got a serious wind problem at the moment because of global issues as well.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Oh, does it?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Yeah.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 I read that it suffers from horizontal avalanches, but I think that's a kind of a description that people who are out there.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 It's not as dangerous or as crazy as it sounds, but they describe the idea of the horizontal avalanche.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 I'm guessing it must be wind smashing...

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 That's weird.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 So this is another thing that's happened in America.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 I think that's called an ice shove.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Or it's also known as an ice tsunami.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 And it is where wind will, for instance, in a frozen lake,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 wind or weird water movements cause the ice to just move like a very slow tsunami onto the land.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 But it happened last year in Minnesota.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 And it's so weird.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 People just woke up and this huge wall of ice was just creeping into their houses and creeping up.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 If you watch it, it moves at about a centimeter every couple of seconds.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 That is still scarier than smug, though, isn't it?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Yeah.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Imagine walking through a library and there's a big load of ice.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 Yeah.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Have you heard of spontaneous snowballs?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 No.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 This is a very similar thing.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Right.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 Basically, it's when snow rolls up and forms a snowball on the ground spontaneously because of the wind.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 And they have a hollow center and there can be, there can be huge.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 There can be up to a foot in diameter.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And it's when you have a crust of old snow which is covered by a thin layer of new snow on top.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 And if the conditions are right, a small bit of snow gets rolled along by the wind and it gathers more as it goes.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 And they have a hollow center.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Yeah.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 That's amazing.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Very cool.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 I was looking at places in Antarctica.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 There are some quite good place names.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Oh, I was literally just about to say this.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Oh, we go from there.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 No, no, you go from there.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Take it and says do one each.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Okay.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Let's see who runs out first.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Okay.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 All right.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Let's go.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 So come to put my favourites now.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Nipple peak.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 That's going to be hard to peak.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Yep.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Nobhead.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Wait a minute.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Are we doing names?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Oh, just insults here.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Nobhead's good.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 I will raise you dick peaks.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Similar theme.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Asses ears.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Nice.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 The office girls.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 I want to know why.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Shagnasty Island.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Football mountain.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Football mountain.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 A shapeless mountain, which is really interesting, because it was named that.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Like a mountain.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 It was named that because of the inability of the discovering team to agree on what its actual shape was.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 So much so that shapeless mountain was a confusing thing that when they went to climb shapeless mountain,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 they climbed the wrong mountain.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Because they assumed it was shapeless mountain and they ended up naming that mountain that they mistakenly climbed.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Mistake peak.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Yeah.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 I think I've only got mount cocks left and then I'm out.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 Guys, these names are about as much use as a hat full of busted assholes.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 My fact is that Tonga's official finance minister was also its official court jester.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 This is this guy Jesse Bogdanov, who was employed as a financial adviser in 1994,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 financial adviser to the government of Tonga.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 And he was, I guess, he got a promotion.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Actually, he decided he to be court jester.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 It was at his own suggestion, as financial adviser said,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 "Why don't you make me your court jester because my birthday is April 1st."

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 So, it seems like the obvious thing to do.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 It's not much of CV, that is it.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Why should you get this job?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Well, my birthday is on April 1st.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 It would have been better if it turned out his birthday wasn't on April 1st.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 It was a trade.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Maybe it was.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 He wasn't a very trustworthy character at Slanderer, so I hope he's not listening.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 He did lose the country about $25 million as their financial adviser.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Wow, really?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Yeah, there was the Tonga Trust Fund, which he was given to manage,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 and he invested it all in...

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Squirty flowers.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Massive shoes.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Yeah, and the big shoe index fell off a cliff a few months later.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 So, what were those little cars all of it?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 It was basically that.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 He invested it in questionable places, and it disappeared.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Lost all their money.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 He had to flee the country.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Well, he fled the country.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 He left the country, and he can't return now, because he says he fears his life.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 I think some Tonga and Sue put their money into this fund.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 We're pretty angry when he lost it all.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 As court jester, he was quite fun.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 He used to play saxophone at royal events, and he wrote a poem about the king.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 And, yeah, he was generally an entertaining chap in that part of his life.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 That doesn't sound like a lot.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Saxophone.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Saxophone, I haven't seen.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 The funniest of all instruments.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 So, where is this guy now?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 He's in America.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 He's changed his name to Jesse Dean.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 He's the founder and sole practitioner of a company called the Open Window Institute of Emotional Freedom in California,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 and he does offer hypnosis as part of it.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 So, he can't go back, because he's terrified for his life,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 but is he a wanted man there, or is he...?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 I did not openly.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 I thought he was forced to pay back a million dollars.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 He was forced to pay back a lot of money,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 and he still has to pay part of his income to Tonga,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 but he never admitted any liability.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 That's very nice of him to pay back, then, isn't it?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 He's nice.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 That's the goodness of my heart.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 I totally get it.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 So, we should tell you Tonga, because a lot of people won't know much about Tonga.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Yeah.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Tonga is 171 different islands.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Okay.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 And they're spread over 700,000 square kilometres of ocean.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 It's hugely spread out.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 But only 36 of the islands actually got permanent inhabitants on them.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Right.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Okay.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 So, lots and lots of them are empty.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 They used to be called the friendly islands, didn't they?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 It was nice.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 They originally called that, because James Cook was given such a friendly welcome

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 when he arrived there in 1773.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 But legend tells that unbeknownst to him when they were having a big feast,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 the only reason he departed unscathed was because the chiefs could not agree a plan

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 on how to kill him.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 So, I've been to parties like that.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 They must have been kicking themselves after he left.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Yeah.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 They must have been so close.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Okay, so we're five to four in favour of decapitation.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Please.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Can we?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Yeah, it's amazing that there isn't just, okay, if we don't decide on anything,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 here's our fallback.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Like, how do you not have a plan V of basic death?

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Between 1918 and 2006, Tonga had only two monarchs.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 Very amazing.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Do we know who the current one is?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 No, nobody knows.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 It's just people have been looking into it.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 The current one is George Tupor the sixth.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 What do we know about George Tupor the sixth?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 Almost nothing.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Oh.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 But I believe we know some interesting stuff about George Tupor the fifth,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 who was quite a fun character.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 He used to own the island's only power company, brewery and mobile phone company.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 He got rid of them eventually.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 That sounds like he was having a fun time.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Sounds like an entrepreneur, I like him.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Was he just making drunken phone calls all the time?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Is that his life?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Oh, no, no.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Oh, he also, I think it was him, wasn't it, who insisted on being driven round in a London black cab everywhere?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 And the reason that he gave it this was because a London taxi has the right proportions to make it easy for you to get in and out whilst wearing spurs and a sword.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Wow.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Which I think is why we all ride around in them sometimes.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 That's why I never use Uber.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 I can't get my sword out of there.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 I've got a couple of things on gestures.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 I don't know if anyone does.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 So one thing that surprised me is that I just probably very stupidly assumed that all gestures were male back in the 1500s, the old times.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 But gestress was an occupation as well.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Oh, that's cool.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 I can't just say that is definitely not the stupidest thing you've ever assumed in.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Okay, good.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Keep going.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 So Le Jardinier served as Mary Stewart's gestress in 1543.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 And she was there for a very long time.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 And she got paid very well.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 She even got paid four pounds of snow every summer.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 I think paid very well.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 I reckon you believe the P.R. that she believes.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 I think that wasn't cocaine, was it?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Because if it's cocaine, then four pounds is a lot, I believe.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 I think that was bonus money.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Four pounds of snow.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Three pounds of scag.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Yeah.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 It was seen as a refrigeration.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Yeah.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 I can see that that's useful, especially in the spring, having a bit of, you know, a bit of snow in your, in your underhouses.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Yeah.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 To keep things cold.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Yeah.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 It's like a brahi, we've mentioned him before.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 He had his own gesture, who was a little person.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 And it was his own personal gesture, who brahi thought possessed psychic powers, and he used to make him sit under the dinner table while he ate dinner.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 And in the source I read, I think it was an I.O.9, which I do like the source, but it said he's just had to sit under the table while he ate dinner.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Probably best not to speculate why he had to do this.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Oh.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 I don't think that was a necessary comment.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Yeah.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Didn't take a brahi die because he refused to leave the table.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Yeah.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 When he needed some pee and he never left.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 So maybe the gesture had enough of him and then kind of held on to him and stopped him from leaving.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 I made him die.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Oh, that's what he was thinking.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 He was speculating a little here.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 My other, my favorite gesture that I've learned about recently.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Perkyo of Heidelberg.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 I'm here at a minute.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 No.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Perkyo of Heidelberg, 18th century in Germany.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 His name actually was a shortening of an Italian for why not?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 It's a Perkyo.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 So he was a dwarf and he was famous for his ability to drink.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 And any time he was offered a drink, he would say.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Perkyo, which was his name.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Why not?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 And he would keep drinking.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 That was basically his main entertainment.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 He would just be drunk the whole time and he supposedly lived into his 80s.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 So it didn't kill him.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 But yeah, that was his one main thing.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 There must have been times where his name was and where his catchphrase was quite annoying to him.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Hey, do you want to put this snake on your leg?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Perkyo.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Do you want to punch in the face?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Perkyo.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Because St. Chrysostom defined the fool as he who gets slapped.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Really?

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Wow.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 That's a good definition.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 It's also kind of misleading because the role of fools in, let's say, Tudor Courts and Late Medieval Courts

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 was to be the person who could insult the monarch, but get away with it, wasn't it?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 I like the trick that King James is sixth of Scotland's Jester George Buchanan played on him.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 So James is sixth was really lazy about signing official documents and he just signed them without reading them.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 And you know, George kept nagging him like someone knowing why I've actually read the documents.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 And he wouldn't learn.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 So George the Jester eventually went to James and made him sign this document,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 which had tricked him into advocating the throne and giving it up to his Jester.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 And then he took the document away.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 He walked back into the room, said to the king, "Oh, could you just get up or feel throne for a second?"

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 And then he, the Jester sat down on it and said, "I'm king now, by the way, showed in the document."

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 And apparently King James is sixth always read his official documents after that.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 But the Jester was brutally capitulated.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening.
