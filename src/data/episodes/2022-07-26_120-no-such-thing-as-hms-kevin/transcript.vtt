00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
 (harmonica playing)

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.140
 - Do you know what it is?

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.400
 I don't know what it is, but...

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.420
 (harmonica playing)

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.720
 Do you know what it is?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.720
 (harmonica playing)

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.460
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.160
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish A Weekly Podcast"

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.860
 coming to you from the Otter Belly in London, South Bank.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.440
 My name is Dan Shriver, and please welcome to the stage

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.400
 in his Etich Zitsky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.820
 (harmonica playing)

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:48.660
 - And once again, we have gathered around the table

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.540
 Starting with my fact this week,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.700
 my fact is that the way to defeat the British Royal Navy's

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.860
 most advanced destroyer ship is to put it in warm water.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.620
 (audience laughing)

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.780
 So the British have spent a billion

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.220
 on six massive destroyer ships.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.860
 These are ships that, in their press release,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.060
 said this is the most advanced technology.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.940
 These are the most advanced ships of all time

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.220
 going into the oceans.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 It turns out that their engines can't take warm water.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.060
 And so if they go to the Persian Gulf, for example,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 the whole ship just makes it just completely wet.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.300
 - Would we ever want to go to the Persian Gulf?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.900
 It's dangerous there.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.740
 (audience laughing)

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.700
 - We should just start wars in Iceland.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.540
 - Yeah.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.940
 (audience laughing)

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.660
 - The defense was that they weren't anticipating

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.220
 having to go somewhere like the Gulf.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.940
 So John Hunson, who's a managing director of BAE system,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.700
 said the operating profile at the time

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.860
 was that there would not be continuous operations

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.780
 in the Gulf.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.220
 As if that was just out of the question at the time

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.580
 that we'd end up there.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.180
 So yeah, they didn't expect to have to go anywhere.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.300
 - There was a response from the MOD.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.420
 They said, this is quote from the FD article.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.140
 The MOD added that the ships remained

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.420
 one of the most capable warships on the planet.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.180
 (audience laughing)

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.500
 - But only parts of the planet.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 (audience laughing)

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.180
 The Rolls-Royce booksman said,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.220
 this is not the fault of Rolls-Royce.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.260
 It is the laws of physics.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
 (audience laughing)

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.900
 Can't do anything about those.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.740
 - That's insane.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.580
 - Yep.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.420
 - It's amazing.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.100
 - Is it the fault of the Rolls-Royce and so on

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.300
 for making the engines better?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.620
 Is it the fault of the MOD for not telling them

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.460
 why we're doing this?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.580
 - Rolls-Royce certainly claims it's the fault of the MOD.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.420
 - Yeah.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.540
 - And the MOD probably says it's Rolls-Royce's fault,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.540
 and everyone says it's Isaac Newton's fault.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.820
 (audience laughing)

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.380
 - Yeah, to fix these ships actually,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.460
 when they do replace the engines,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.340
 they're going to have to drill a huge hole

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.780
 in the underside of the boats, I think.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.500
 So you've really got to tell the whole thing apart

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500
 at this point. - Wow.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.660
 And it's a billion pounds each, I think.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.500
 - Yeah.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.100
 - And it is, of course, only three months of the money

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.060
 that we're going to get back from Europe.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.460
 (audience laughing)

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.060
 - Did you know there's one vertical shipwreck in the world,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.300
 which is just sticking up completely vertically,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.260
 at a 90 degree angle to the seabed.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.100
 - Wow.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.260
 - And this is HMS Victoria,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.300
 and it's a really interesting story.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.860
 So this was a battleship in the late 19th century,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.980
 and it was one of the biggest battleship wrecks

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.580
 that the UK suffered.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.060
 And it was because of this guy Admiral Trion,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.620
 which feels like a... (audience laughing)

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.660
 - He just turned up at the Admiralty one day.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.300
 - Just trying that on, and it did not go well for him.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.100
 So he gave this bizarre order in 1893.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.020
 He was a really well-decorated Admiral in the Royal Navy,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.820
 and he was just off the coast of Lebanon,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.860
 and there were two main ships leading his big fleet,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.380
 the HMS Victoria and HMS Campodown.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.460
 And he, suddenly via Semaphore,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.020
 gave the instruction to campodown

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.100
 that those two ships that were running parallel

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.940
 to each other had to turn inwards towards each other

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.940
 and do a full circle in order to come back.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.860
 And the turning circle of those ships

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.180
 was collectively two kilometers,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.180
 and there was one kilometer between them.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.740
 So it was physically impossible.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.700
 Again, it's a law of physics issue.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.820
 It was physically impossible for them not to crash into each other.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.380
 So that captain of HMS Campodown ignored that,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.380
 the first time around.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.980
 But when he gave the order a second time,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.460
 he just had to obey, 'cause that was what you did in the 1890s.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.020
 And so they did this turn,

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.700
 and they were holding these two ships,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.660
 both just captain by the same guy,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.860
 crashed straight into each other.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.340
 One of them was like plummeted to the bottom of the ocean.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.540
 Yeah, his last words were, "It's all my fault."

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.860
 - Whoa! - Yeah.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.260
 - His last words, "What on his deathbed?"

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
 Or on his... - What he died in the shipwreck.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.100
 A lot of people died.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.780
 So it was only 357 people were rescued,

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.860
 but sadly, 358 people were drowned.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.980
 And so it just hit it over the edge.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.220
 And so as he was going down, he said, "It's all my fault."

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.220
 To which I guess everyone on board his ship replied, "Yes, it is."

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.820
 - Wow, that's great. - His name was Trion, wasn't it?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.540
 - Trion, Admiral Trion? - Yeah.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.180
 My favourite kind of nominatively determined captain of a ship

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.860
 was Captain Schlitt.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.140
 And he was a captain of a German U-boat.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.940
 It was U-1206, and it sank off the coast of Scotland

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.060
 because the toilets flooded.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.140
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.700
 I don't know what caused the original blockage,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.620
 but what happened was they flushed it a couple of times

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.820
 and it overflowed, but the batteries were underneath the toilet.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.180
 So it wasn't a very well-designed submarine.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.140
 And so the water went into the batteries,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.660
 that released a load of chlorine gas.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.380
 And then they were like, "Oh, shit, there's chlorine gas everywhere."

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.940
 So they had to go to the surface,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.180
 and then when they got to the surface,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.940
 the British just went, "Oh, there's a submarine.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.180
 Let's shoot it."

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.260
 - Oh, god. - There's a thing, really early submarines.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.780
 They were basically at the surface almost all the time.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.140
 They were pretty much surface ships

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.220
 that had the capacity to dive.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.180
 But the really odd thing is that even in the Second World War,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.380
 to have extra observation, a German U-boat would surface,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.980
 and then it would send up a kite with a man in a little seat,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.780
 and he would look around.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.140
 That's truly happening.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.580
 This is within living memory.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.940
 He would look around, and he could,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.180
 because obviously you can see dozens of miles in a direction.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.980
 You can see any ships.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.980
 And then 53 kilometers, apparently,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.820
 was the maximum you could see.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.500
 And the only disadvantage was, obviously,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.220
 it immediately gave away your position.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.020
 And you would then have to dive really quickly,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.780
 once you've seen who's in the area.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.780
 Yeah.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.100
 And the guy is still attached to the submarine,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.340
 being pulled down, is he?

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.980
 He, I think, I think that--

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.580
 I think they get him back on board.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.140
 And then they go, "Deep breath, we're going under."

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.380
 When the battleship arrived, when the British warship arrived,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.700
 it was just a bloke in a kite, some rain.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.700
 No.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.460
 That means so.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.020
 I'm sure I've heard of noted that.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.740
 So the US Navy's most advanced new battleship.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.700
 It's called the USS Zomvolt.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.700
 And it is so advanced.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.060
 It is so stealthy that, in fact, it's too stealthy.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.220
 And it's going to have to carry big reflective pads,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.460
 so other things don't bump into it.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.140
 It's about 400 feet long, and it can make itself

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.020
 look on radar like a 50-foot-long fishing boat.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.260
 Well, and a quick last thing.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.660
 You know, the ceremony, the launching ceremonies of boats.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.500
 So every time a new rule boat is launched,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.060
 then we smash a champagne bottle.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.180
 Or a woman customarily smashes a champagne bottle into it.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.300
 And I didn't realize the first instance in this

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.300
 was in the 18th century.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.460
 And the person who first smashed a champagne bottle

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.460
 onto a ship's hull was the princess of Hannover.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.740
 And she, according to reports of the time,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.060
 threw the bottle at it.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.860
 So now we smash it.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.140
 But she threw the bottle at it with more energy than accuracy,

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.100
 missing the ship entirely and injuring one of the spectators.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.220
 Who put in a claim for damages against the Admiralty.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.340
 Does that mean that he was technically the ship?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.260
 Does that go worse?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.660
 Does the Navy have to use him?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.660
 Yep.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.660
 This is HMS Destroyer.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.220
 This is HMS Arrogant, the HMS Kevin.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.020
 HMS Bloodiemut Bloodface.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.700
 OK, it's time for a second fact.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.580
 And that is James Harkin.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.380
 OK, my fact this week is that in 1988, Singapore held a beauty

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.860
 contest where 60% of the judging marks were

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.940
 awarded for how good a contestant's website was.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.100
 So this was a way to promote the internet in Singapore

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.340
 in the '90s.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.900
 And it was the leading internet service provider

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.740
 cost signnet, and they had a competition

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.420
 to find intellectual beauty.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.620
 60% of the marks were awarded for internet knowledge,

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.660
 which was producing your own home page and also

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.860
 sitting at a laptop answering internet trivia questions.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.660
 Yeah.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.460
 Wow.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.220
 And designing, like it was just a laptop on stage.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.660
 And they came out and designed a website.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.820
 Also, do they have to design it on the spot?

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.820
 Yeah.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.620
 Doesn't it take days?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.660
 Not if you use Squarespace.com.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.100
 So obviously, beauty contest, we probably all

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.740
 think they're a little bit sexist.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.220
 But according to Miss America Organization,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.020
 they claim to be the largest scholarship organization

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.100
 solely for women in the whole of America.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.740
 I think that's been debunked.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.020
 Yeah, by John Oliver, yeah.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.220
 It's a shame because it got such a rigorous round

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.340
 of support from the audience here.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.980
 I think they do give out some scholarships,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.100
 but they don't give out nearly as many as were originally claimed.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.500
 So modern beauty contests were invented by Petey Barnum,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.540
 who we must all know.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.740
 He is the guy who kind of started circuses.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.980
 He was a big kind of circus king of America.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.220
 And he started them in Delaware in 1880.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.900
 And it was a panel of judges who chose,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.060
 and one of the judges was Thomas Edison.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.820
 Really?

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.020
 Yeah.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.660
 And it was to promote a beach resort outside

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.780
 of the normal kind of time that people would go to beaches.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.100
 In 1955, America had a sausage queen.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.020
 That was a competition.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.060
 There was a huge rash in the '50s, especially,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.300
 of really, really heavily sponsored competitions.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.540
 If you Google Image Search, I've done this.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.940
 It's safe, so don't worry.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.020
 Took a risk.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.420
 If you Google Image Search sausage queen, you'll find--

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.940
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.140
 Find the picture of this poor woman.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.420
 She's wearing a bikini, but she's also covered in sausages.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.900
 Well, in Colombia, there are loads and loads of beauty pageants.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.620
 So I think the BBC worked out that Colombia holds 3,794

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.860
 beauty pageants a year.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.460
 A year.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.020
 Calm down.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.460
 You're all beautiful.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.820
 But there's more than 10 a day.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.820
 And so they've had to branch out.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.460
 So they have Miss Onyun.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.300
 And that's where you have to prove your extensive knowledge

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.700
 of Onyun's.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.140
 They have the International Coffee Pageant, which

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.980
 similarly missed coffee as someone from Japan,

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.620
 bizarrely, who proved her knowledge

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.780
 of Colombian coffee well enough.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.620
 They have donkey pageants, which are really popular,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.180
 which is where you dress up donkeys.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.780
 And this takes place in rural Colombia.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.980
 And it's where you dress up your donkeys

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.900
 as political or famous figures.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.740
 And you prance them around.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.500
 So at the last donkey pageant, I think, one of them

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.660
 was Barack Obama.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.780
 He was straight in an American flag.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.100
 So he was wearing an American flag of sort of a dress.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.180
 And he had a USA tie on him.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.340
 And in the end, the prize actually

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.900
 went to a donkey dressed as a Colombian preacher.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.300
 And Barack Obama's handler apparently

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.780
 was seen storming off in outrage.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.540
 I would have--

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.700
 I'd put a bag of oats on my donkeys' nose,

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.220
 and then it would be donkey-ooty.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.280
 I think--

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.220
 Mix, mix, mix.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.940
 On the flip side, I was reading about--

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.740
 and it's terrible that this exists, but this does exist.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.340
 In Zimbabwe, there's an annual Mr. Ugly competition.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.940
 And it's been going for four years.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.620
 This will be the fifth year, 2016.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.060
 Last year, they had a situation, a huge controversy,

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.020
 because the person who was awarded the top prize

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:09.540
 of Mr. Ugly in the country was deemed too handsome by most

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.020
 of the people who were in it.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.260
 Mainly, it was the guy who's won it three years in a row

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.580
 who was like, this guy's not ugly.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.860
 He's just missing teeth.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.660
 Apparently, he just--

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.660
 I can't believe the contest got ugly.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.820
 They really stuck to their guns.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.380
 The guy, one of the main judges, said,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.540
 Sierra made a tremendous-- this is the guy who won.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.860
 Sierra made a tremendous effort to enhance his ugliness

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.860
 by pulling facial stunts.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.380
 Massvenou, who was the former champion,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.060
 thought he was so ugly that he didn't even

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.300
 need to try hard.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.740
 That cost him the crown.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.700
 And so, yeah, he's--

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.500
 So none of the judging panel said,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.940
 oh, I just thought voting him would be a protest.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.940
 I didn't think he'd actually win.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.940
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.780
 [APPLAUSE]

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.260
 Yeah, this is a satirical show we do.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.180
 Yeah, this is the most satirical we've ever made.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.620
 Yeah, so I think about the internet in Singapore.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.620
 Yeah.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.980
 OK, so in 2001, the Singapore banned campaigning

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.860
 on the internet during its election.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.620
 So Minister for Information and Arts, Li Yoxuan,

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.340
 said, "A free-for-all internet

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.380
 campaigning environment without rules

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.100
 is not advisable.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.260
 On the internet, once a false story

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.740
 or rumor is started, it's like water

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.020
 that has been spilled.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.580
 It's almost impossible to reign in the matters,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.900
 especially in the limited period of an election campaign."

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.420
 I think we can all agree he was way off the mark there.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.940
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.860
 They were quite interpromote in the internet

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.860
 around that period, weren't they?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.940
 Because they had an internet festival in the year 2000.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.460
 And that was-- so the centerpiece of this festival

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.340
 was this guy called Nicholas Eng,

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.700
 who was a computer engineer who'd

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.220
 founded this company called Wave New World.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.380
 And this was all the talk of the millennial Singaporean

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.660
 internet festival.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.420
 And as the BBC reported, he said that the internet

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.140
 and this new media explosion in the year 2000

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.500
 have brought us email e-commerce, DVD movies, interactive games.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.380
 But something is missing, the sense of smell.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.740
 And he was starting up a company called DigiSense, which

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.500
 allowed you to use the internet, but smell, as you were doing it,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.220
 the sense that it would be appropriate to the website

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.460
 that you were searching.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.460
 And I think--

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.380
 You don't always want to smell the thing that you're looking up up.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.660
 If it's sausage queen, you don't really have that.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.660
 If you Google the phrase, smell the sausage queen.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.620
 We cannot guarantee that that's safe.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.540
 It is crazy, though, because I remember the internet in 1998,

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.260
 which was pretty basic.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.340
 So the idea that there would be a massive competition

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.300
 at that time seems ridiculous.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.380
 I went to a judgeal bank, which is in Cheshire's

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.020
 big sort of, what is it, a big--

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.140
 They look for aliens, do you?

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.620
 Yeah, they telescope.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.220
 Sorry.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.500
 So it was in the '90s, and we didn't know

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.340
 one had the internet.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.540
 We didn't have it in our school.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.780
 So we all went there to kind of look at the internet.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.660
 And I remember going in that.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.660
 I know it's amazing.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.460
 But I went in there and kind of searched

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.580
 for fancy football, which I was into at the time.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.260
 And it kind of just picked up the word fantasy

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.780
 and gave me lots of things that as a young teenage boy,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.180
 I'd never really seen before.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.180
 Whoa.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.420
 A judgeal bank?

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:18.940
 Yeah.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.460
 That's what I want to consider in the rhyming slang

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.740
 that a judgeal bank is.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:27.140
 Guys, we need to move on in a second.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.980
 So we ought to, yeah.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.420
 OK, I have one little thing about contest in Singapore.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.340
 So in 2009, men's spot in Singapore

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.260
 was so bad that they couldn't find a sportsman of the year.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.660
 So 2008 was an Olympic year as well.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.620
 The president of the Olympic Council said,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.220
 unfortunately, it was a bad year.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.940
 None of them really achieved anything not worth it.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.420
 So I had a look at what they did in the Olympics.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.900
 And the table tennis team went out in the group stage.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.180
 None of the sailors made the top 20.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.900
 They're only track half wheat went out in the first round.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.260
 They're only shooter lost in the first round.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.100
 They're only swimmer lost in the first round.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.940
 And they're only male badminton player

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.460
 lost in the second round.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.780
 So you think you might have won.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.620
 Boy, he had a buy in the first round.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.060
 Time for fact number three.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.460
 And that is Anich Zinski.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.900
 My fact this week is that there is a network of fully furnished

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.180
 fake apartments in the UK, whose sole purpose

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.380
 is to get burgled.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.380
 Wow.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.940
 That's a name that is amazing.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.620
 When you say a network, how many--

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.420
 I'm so bizarre that that's your first question.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.100
 Who owns them?

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.100
 So they are owned by the government.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.180
 So this is-- there are a lot to answer your question, apparently.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.980
 That helps.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.220
 They exist in every major city in the UK.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.660
 There are a few of these.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.940
 And I found this out in a new book.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.220
 It's come out this year called A Burgler's Guide to the City.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.580
 It's by Jeff Mannow.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.740
 And it's so good.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.060
 And yeah, there's this capture house program

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.420
 that the government runs, which is

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.180
 where you build a completely fake apartment that's totally

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.780
 kitted out with a lot of nice technology

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.500
 with some furniture that's often donated

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.900
 by the local police force, apparently, that they didn't want.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.300
 And you build this apartment in a way

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.380
 that will hopefully lure burglarers to burglar it.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.260
 And unbeknownst to them, they're all covered

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.900
 in this chemical agent, which can only be seen under UV light.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.180
 So whenever the burglar is burglary,

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.140
 it touches a handle, or walks across the floor.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.140
 Then he's covering himself in this chemical agent,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.940
 which then needs a trace of where he's been,

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.380
 and also their full of cameras.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.300
 So basically, they're there as traps

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.860
 so that burglar's come in and then the police follow

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.780
 immediately afterwards.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.220
 And they're all over the place, and you wouldn't know

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.860
 if there was one in your apartment building.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.100
 They're everywhere.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.700
 So you wouldn't know if your home was one of these.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.380
 If you've been burgled, maybe it is.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.340
 I wanted to know how they lure burglarers to burglar them.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.540
 Do they have people sort of ostentatiously

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.380
 carrying in, you know, really nice tellies and stuff?

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.420
 Saying, oh, I must get a second lock for this door

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.700
 one of these days.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.860
 As soon as I get back from that long holiday,

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.180
 that's a guy.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.500
 Thank god we got rid of the dog.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.860
 Yeah, it's basically that.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.020
 No, they're often targeting one specific burglar.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.020
 So they'll be--

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.020
 Oh, of course.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.860
 It's amazing.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.860
 It's genuinely incredible.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.580
 They target that particular burglar's motor operandi.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.140
 So if he only robs first floor flats, for example,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.540
 they'll try and make sure that one of the capture houses

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.500
 is a first floor flat, if they can.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.340
 And then they walk around as I was shouting,

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.340
 "Marjorie, can you remind me to open all the windows?"

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.860
 It's so warm.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.540
 And then they'll leave a window open, and they'll try and get them in.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.780
 It's true, it's that police thing where you pick up so many clues

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.140
 from it, the way a burglar operates.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.300
 And you really can't rig up a house or a flat

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.220
 so that it is going to attract that one burglar in the area.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.140
 And one burglar can raise the crime rates of one area

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.020
 massively, because he and his gang, or she and her gang,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.100
 will just be operating on lots of houses every day of the week.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.300
 I was looking into-- so police having to fake things

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.900
 in order to get results.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.420
 Confessions.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.580
 Yes.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.420
 So one of the things I write about is that

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.220
 bomb and drug-sniffing dogs, when they go around looking

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.420
 for any-- there are airports trying to sniff out the drugs

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.220
 and so on-- apparently, if they don't get a win,

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.500
 if they don't manage to smell out some drugs,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.380
 they get quite depressed.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.780
 Psychologically, sniffer dogs actually get depressed,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.780
 that they don't have a sort of--

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.900
 they've done a good job.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.500
 So what the police will do is they'll fake a situation.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.180
 Yeah, yeah, honestly, where the dog can then sniff out some

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.580
 one and be like, oh, I need--

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.860
 they just get members of the public.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.340
 They pay them to do it, and they bust out.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.860
 They pay, that's what it's happening.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.300
 I don't know if they pay them, but they've set up fake drug

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.500
 vests for dogs so that dogs can feel better.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.100
 It's a great fact.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.740
 So these guys always have to tell me

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.620
 what I've actually got a good fact.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.620
 You've done very well.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.460
 Have a biscuit.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:03.380
 Do you want to hear about a couple of things, though?

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.300
 Do you want to hear about a couple of cool devices

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.220
 that you can get if you don't want to be birgled?

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:07.980
 Yes, please.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.940
 Show a thing.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.940
 A lock.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.260
 A lock, yeah.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.220
 So you can get a thing called fake TV, which is very cool.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.860
 And it's this panel, which is just flashing LED lights.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.020
 But from the outside, it looks exactly

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.060
 like someone's indoors and watching Telly.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.660
 Why don't you just leave your TV on?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.380
 Good point.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.900
 Great.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.220
 That's stuff there, business model.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.620
 No, it's-- I think the idea is it uses a lot less energy

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.500
 than just leaving your Telly on all the time.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.940
 Did someone watch Home Alone?

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.140
 Did you see the Christmas scene?

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.540
 That's a business model.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.860
 That is a thing you can buy.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.340
 It's called fake TV.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.300
 And I've seen it.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.540
 It looks right.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.540
 I didn't burgle the house.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.540
 And there's no thing you can get.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.380
 You can get an anti-theft security smog jet machine.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.700
 This is for things like banks and things like that.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.340
 But if there's a break in, it just floods the entire room

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.660
 with smog.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.660
 Wow.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.620
 That's very cool.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.460
 And the burglar goes in and goes, oh, I'm in the 19th century.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.340
 Just on the subject, I was looking for fake things and police.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.740
 And I just found a story that I'd rather like from last year.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.700
 This is from Sutton, so not too far from here.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.500
 And it's that in June of last year, police and Sutton

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.300
 turned up to a house because they'd

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.420
 had a tip off from the RSPCA.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.860
 And they had a standoff over a snake, which

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.500
 was loose in someone's garden.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.460
 And they had a reasonably long standoff

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.500
 until it was pointed out to them that it was a garden

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.020
 ornament snake.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.940
 But they were standing really still, watching it.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.780
 And it wasn't moving.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.420
 And they weren't moving.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.100
 And then a resident told them, it's not real.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.540
 And I just love the quote.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.980
 It was a neighbor who was called Gary Hollins, a 43-year-old

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.020
 who lived nearby.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.300
 And he said, I could have told you it was a fake snake

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.740
 because the paint is peeling off it.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.140
 Hey, snake shed that skin.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.980
 True, good point.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.820
 Oh, we need to move on to the final fact.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.780
 OK, maybe we should do some hilarious burglary stories,

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.300
 shall we?

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.500
 So I went on the internet and looked

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.020
 for some burglar headlines from the last few months.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.260
 So a burglar was caught after knocking

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.060
 over a tent of white paint during a break in

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.860
 and leaving footsteps, leading all the way to his door.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.580
 Oh, man.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.380
 There was another one who was caught by police

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.860
 after having a bite out of a cucumber

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.060
 and leaving his DNA inside the cucumber.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.060
 Wow.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.100
 There was a post office burglar who was caught

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.900
 after he tried to buy a car with 1,000 pounds in 1 pound coins.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:44.620
 And there was a Kentucky burglar who was arrested after accidentally

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.260
 dialing his phone 9-1-1 while he was talking

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.460
 to whether it's complex about the burglary

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.140
 that he was just about to do.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.100
 Oh, my God.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:53.940
 What?

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.980
 And they just overheard him saying what he was going to do

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.820
 and then they caught him.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.340
 Wow.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.620
 Do you remember there was that story about there was a couple

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.580
 who were downstairs and they'd ride back home

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.820
 and some two people were in their house robbing the house.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.660
 Sorry, no, it was one person.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.860
 One person was in the house.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.460
 So he quickly ran upstairs and hid

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.580
 and was trying to plan his escape route.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.380
 And according to this story, the burglar is upstairs

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.540
 and he's just sitting there kind of going, OK, what do I do?

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.420
 They're downstairs.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.860
 And one of the couple says, oh, I heard a hilarious joke today.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.540
 Told the joke.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.860
 They live with a punchline, the recipient just in laugh.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.220
 And then they just heard this.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.140
 And the burglar couldn't help but go,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.340
 I wonder what happens if that knock-knock joke.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.140
 This is himself.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.940
 And then they bust it, but they call it the cops.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.500
 You know what I'm saying?

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.540
 That's the truth, sir.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.020
 We need to move on to the final fact.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.500
 OK.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.260
 OK, it's time for a final fact of the show.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.340
 And that is James Harkin.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.300
 I don't think he did.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.700
 James has done this.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.300
 It's my first time.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.300
 Oh, sorry.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.060
 Sorry.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.260
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.340
 And that is Additch.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:55.860
 OK.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.980
 Final fact of the show.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.220
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.660
 Thank you, Dan.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.780
 My fact is that the world's biggest skywriting firm

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.700
 recently turned down a request to draw

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.380
 the largest ever penis in the sky.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.700
 That was worth wasting for.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.500
 So skywriting, we all know, is where planes loop the loop.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.820
 And they release smoke in various patterns

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.660
 to make letters or shapes or whatever it is.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.380
 And the really cool thing is there are only

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.580
 five full-time skywriters on the planet.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.140
 Only five people who make a full-time living.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.540
 A lot of sort of freelance people at part-time

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.740
 has amazing article on the website Quartz about this,

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.260
 because there's a family firm of people who do it.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.020
 And they have various rules.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.540
 So they turn down swear words.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.020
 They won't write really rude things in this guy.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.420
 And they've also turned down someone

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.580
 who wanted to get the largest ever penis drawn in this guy.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.980
 But they did earlier this year, right over California,

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.500
 the words Trump is disgusting.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.820
 But they're now regress it.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.140
 And they say they wish they hadn't taken it,

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.340
 because they want to be able to take it.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.180
 So by writing the word Trump, they did kind of

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.780
 have the world's biggest penis in this guy.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:15.420
 Yeah, so the other cool thing is there are two--

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:15.940
 I didn't know.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.220
 There are two main ways of making letters in this guy.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.220
 You can either do it with one plane, which

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.460
 is where you have-- and you have a sort of smoke jet,

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.660
 basically, it's an adapted exhaust out of the back of the plane.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.820
 And you can either have one plane, but it takes ages.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.780
 And you can only write about 12 letters maximum.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.180
 And it takes a couple of minutes to write a single letter.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:33.980
 Because letters are huge.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.180
 Each of the letters is as tall as the Empire State Building.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.900
 Whoa!

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.860
 Yeah, they're massive.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.780
 And a single message is at least five miles long in the sky.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.060
 This is very exciting, because there's now

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.740
 a new thing you can do called sky typing, which

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.580
 is where you have five planes next to each other,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.140
 and they're all flying in formation.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.260
 And they have a computer-controlled system, which

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.020
 releases puffs of smoke at exactly the right moment.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.420
 So they're all writing either on or off in the sky,

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.460
 and that produces--

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.220
 Like a name jet printer, kind of thing.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.540
 Like a name jet printer, yeah, yeah.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.500
 And it slowly produces the word like that as they fly across.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.460
 So you can do longer messages now using sky typing.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.500
 But that's the old new divide in sky writing.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.060
 That's amazing.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.020
 I really-- my favorite one was from a few years ago,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.340
 and it was just suddenly appeared in the air.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.300
 How do I land?

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.340
 And it was a comedian who did that.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.220
 It was a Kickstarter.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.580
 He decided he just-- he wanted to help sky writing come back.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.540
 He thought it'd be a great place to put a joke up.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.420
 And so he did a Kickstarter, and they raised $4,000 American dollars.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.020
 That's how much it cost to have something like how do I land?

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.860
 Question mark.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.180
 Do you know that actually it was a really windy day?

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.260
 And so they did the H. And then by the time they'd done the O,

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.420
 the H had already gone.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.420
 Oh!

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.100
 But W, the H and the O had already gone.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.460
 And he said, if you watch the sky for 20 minutes,

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.780
 you could probably piece it together.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:57.620
 Oh!

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.180
 This is a guy called-- he was a comedian called Kurt Bronola.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.180
 Yeah, he still is a comedian called Kurt Bronola.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.340
 And he's just so people know who he is.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.660
 Kristen Scholl, Kristen Scholl, sorry,

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.140
 who is in Flight the Concords, and so on.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.140
 It's her comedy partner.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.860
 So he's very big in the sense.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.220
 But when he did this, unless you really,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.020
 you really watched and saw each letter go.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.780
 You couldn't really tell what was happening.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.500
 So what he did was he took a photo of each letter

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.140
 before it blew away.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.940
 And then he put them all together in a composite photo

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.020
 and then put it online saying, this is what it would have looked like.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.540
 I know.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.460
 I thought he could have just photoshopped the whole thing.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.660
 It would have been--

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.660
 Yeah.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.500
 I really like-- so back in the sort of '60s,

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.220
 it was used.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.980
 There was so many plans at sky writing

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.060
 was going to be the main way that you would advertise your company.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:44.740
 I think you're right.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.660
 And pretty much it was when TV came in.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.620
 And suddenly we could get advertising to everyone's homes immediately.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.620
 And that was when sky writing's like, oh, we don't really need this anymore.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.580
 And it didn't need to be a cloudless, sunny day for advertising

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.100
 to reach your home, which it did.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.380
 But there was a lot of alarmism about sky writing

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.980
 in the early days of it, that it was just going to be this--

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.780
 like all new technologies, it was going to be this awful thing.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.860
 So I was looking in the newspaper archives

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.740
 and people were writing things about it in 1932.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.020
 There was a debate in the House of Commons as to whether we should allow advertisers

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.780
 free use of the sky to do this sky writing.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.700
 And those MPs are against it, said it was a desecration of the sky.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.700
 So monstrous, it should be completely prohibited.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.340
 And it was decided the inventor would promise not to do it in their cathedrals

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:38.700
 or monuments and would agree not to vulgarize the sky.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.060
 But people thought it was going to ruin it.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.340
 People thought it would just spiral out of control.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.380
 And the entire sky would be occupied by constant adverts.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.700
 Well, they kept saying, yeah, New York, they were worried that people living

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.980
 high-rise buildings would be pummeled by the smoke that was coming down.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:57.420
 So they were recommending close your windows so that you don't die effectively,

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.500
 which was not true at all.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.100
 But-- and it was a sloppy business as well.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:05.140
 1961, I read this amazing report where someone went up, did the message,

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.460
 came back down, looked up, saw that they did it wrong.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.300
 It was because it was very hard to do, made a mistake, went back up,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.820
 put a cross through it, and re-did the whole thing again.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.420
 Do you know what the first ever sky writing message said?

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:18.940
 No.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.020
 It said daily mail.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.940
 It was an advert for the daily mail.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.620
 It was in 1922.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.300
 And it was invented.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.660
 Skywriting was invented by this guy called John Savage.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:35.020
 He was a pilot and the war was over and he sort of started experimenting.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.060
 So this is cool.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.180
 He had been an agent to a chap called BC Hux, who was the first Englishman

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.100
 to do a loop, the loop, in a plane.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.620
 Oh, wow.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.340
 What?

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.620
 Yeah, he had a flying agent, apparently.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.100
 And then, so after he'd experimented with this daily mail advert,

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.220
 he went to the USA and he wrote in the sky above New York, Hello USA.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.660
 But no explanation.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:56.620
 Nothing.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.580
 Then the next day, he sent someone else back up another pilot.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:05.500
 And the message he wrote in the sky was call Vanderbilt 7100,

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.420
 which is the hotel he was staying at.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.060
 As soon as people saw that, they started phoning the hotel by the hundreds,

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.580
 saying, I must buy this as an advert.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.580
 That was his only advertising method.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.420
 I think he was proving the effectiveness, wasn't he?

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.060
 So I think 47,000 people called within three hours.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.340
 And it was sort of the effectiveness of this advertising that they all called.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.340
 Yeah.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.420
 But someone, I liked this in 1961.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:33.420
 There was a guy who was in one of the very few people who was employed as a skywriter.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.420
 And he had hated his math teacher at school, he said.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.540
 And so he did the sky writing with the advertisement that he'd been employed to write in the sky.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.940
 And then he had some spare ink in his tank.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:53.380
 And so at the end of his working day, he screwed 4 plus 1 equals 6 in the sky

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.580
 as revenge against his high school nurse teacher.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.580
 Is that nice?

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.660
 That's amazing.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.260
 How is that revenge?

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.100
 But yeah, it relies on a lot of things.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.420
 The master teacher is seeing it.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.100
 The master is knowing it's him.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.220
 The master teacher giving a shit about him anyway.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.940
 Also, it's not a revenge to still be enumerous.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:17.460
 I'll show my English teacher by unlearning reading.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.260
 I was reading a few years ago, and I can't read out the whole passage,

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.820
 but it's really worth reading this person's account about how, when in, I think it's around 2008,

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:31.900
 they were doing a, someone hired a skywriting team to write peace now across the sky.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.940
 So there was a protest going because Obama was doing some sort of talk, and they just wanted to say,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.380
 we want peace, no more war, all that sort of stuff.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:43.100
 So the big problem that the pilot had is that they misjudged the size of the word.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.540
 And as they were finishing up the words, they were heading directly into territory

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.940
 that the military said, this is not an aerospace you're allowed into,

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.780
 because we have the president down there, and you will be shot down.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.780
 That's amazing.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.500
 Yeah, someone in the plane going, we need to turn around.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.740
 We need to turn around. They're going, I need to get there so I can make the turn up

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.260
 to finish the W on the now.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.140
 So in the end of the read, peace, no.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:08.060
 We even need to wrap up really soon.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.100
 Can I quickly tell you about a chap in Melbourne, this was a couple of years ago.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.980
 He wrote, he proposed his girlfriend in the sky with skywriting.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:21.140
 He wrote Marie, that was her name, Marry Me, across the sky, and she said, no, when she saw it.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.140
 No.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.980
 She also sent the plane up to say, no.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.860
 He said, because they'd been together for years and years, and then they'd broken up,

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.500
 and then they were getting back together, and they were thinking, I think this will clinch it.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.940
 And he said, at least I know I've tried my best.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.460
 Do you know that's so weird, because there's another guy in Melbourne recently who got

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.980
 involved in skywriting, because he had a girlfriend called Prue,

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:52.140
 and he wanted to send her a Valentine's Day message in the sky saying, happy Valentine's Day Prue,

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.420
 but couldn't afford it.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:58.820
 So he started a kickstarter for everyone else who had a girlfriend called Prue in the world,

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:03.940
 and said, if you all contribute to this, then we'll put the message, happy Valentine's Day Prue,

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.940
 love me, so no one knows which one it was.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:11.060
 Oh, there was a guy who wrote, sorry, in the sky above, I was an American city,

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:16.340
 and no one knows who it was, but I imagine a lot of people will have been using that.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.940
 That's for me to do, and I am sorry.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.820
 Boris Johnson's already got a second round of the game.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.300
 OK, OK, that's it, that's all of our facts.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.820
