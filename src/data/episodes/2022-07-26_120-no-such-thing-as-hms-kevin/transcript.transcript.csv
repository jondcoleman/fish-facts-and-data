00:00:02,00:00:03,- Do you know what it is?
00:00:03,00:00:04,"I don't know what it is, but..."
00:00:04,00:00:07,(harmonica playing)
00:00:07,00:00:08,Do you know what it is?
00:00:08,00:00:11,(harmonica playing)
00:00:11,00:00:14,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:14,00:00:17,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish A Weekly Podcast"""
00:00:17,00:00:19,"coming to you from the Otter Belly in London, South Bank."
00:00:19,00:00:22,"My name is Dan Shriver, and please welcome to the stage"
00:00:22,00:00:26,"in his Etich Zitsky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin!"
00:00:26,00:00:29,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:32,(harmonica playing)
00:00:32,00:00:48,"- And once again, we have gathered around the table"
00:00:48,00:00:51,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:51,00:00:54,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:54,00:00:56,"Starting with my fact this week,"
00:00:56,00:01:00,my fact is that the way to defeat the British Royal Navy's
00:01:00,00:01:04,most advanced destroyer ship is to put it in warm water.
00:01:04,00:01:06,(audience laughing)
00:01:06,00:01:08,So the British have spent a billion
00:01:08,00:01:11,on six massive destroyer ships.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"These are ships that, in their press release,"
00:01:13,00:01:16,said this is the most advanced technology.
00:01:16,00:01:18,These are the most advanced ships of all time
00:01:18,00:01:20,going into the oceans.
00:01:20,00:01:24,It turns out that their engines can't take warm water.
00:01:24,00:01:27,"And so if they go to the Persian Gulf, for example,"
00:01:27,00:01:30,the whole ship just makes it just completely wet.
00:01:30,00:01:33,- Would we ever want to go to the Persian Gulf?
00:01:33,00:01:34,It's dangerous there.
00:01:34,00:01:35,(audience laughing)
00:01:35,00:01:37,- We should just start wars in Iceland.
00:01:37,00:01:38,- Yeah.
00:01:38,00:01:39,(audience laughing)
00:01:39,00:01:41,- The defense was that they weren't anticipating
00:01:41,00:01:43,having to go somewhere like the Gulf.
00:01:43,00:01:46,"So John Hunson, who's a managing director of BAE system,"
00:01:46,00:01:49,said the operating profile at the time
00:01:49,00:01:51,was that there would not be continuous operations
00:01:51,00:01:52,in the Gulf.
00:01:52,00:01:55,As if that was just out of the question at the time
00:01:55,00:01:56,that we'd end up there.
00:01:56,00:01:59,"So yeah, they didn't expect to have to go anywhere."
00:01:59,00:02:00,- There was a response from the MOD.
00:02:00,00:02:03,"They said, this is quote from the FD article."
00:02:03,00:02:05,The MOD added that the ships remained
00:02:05,00:02:07,one of the most capable warships on the planet.
00:02:07,00:02:09,(audience laughing)
00:02:09,00:02:10,- But only parts of the planet.
00:02:10,00:02:11,(audience laughing)
00:02:11,00:02:13,"The Rolls-Royce booksman said,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,this is not the fault of Rolls-Royce.
00:02:15,00:02:17,It is the laws of physics.
00:02:17,00:02:19,(audience laughing)
00:02:19,00:02:20,Can't do anything about those.
00:02:20,00:02:21,- That's insane.
00:02:21,00:02:22,- Yep.
00:02:22,00:02:23,- It's amazing.
00:02:23,00:02:26,- Is it the fault of the Rolls-Royce and so on
00:02:26,00:02:27,for making the engines better?
00:02:27,00:02:29,Is it the fault of the MOD for not telling them
00:02:29,00:02:30,why we're doing this?
00:02:30,00:02:31,- Rolls-Royce certainly claims it's the fault of the MOD.
00:02:31,00:02:32,- Yeah.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"- And the MOD probably says it's Rolls-Royce's fault,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,and everyone says it's Isaac Newton's fault.
00:02:36,00:02:38,(audience laughing)
00:02:38,00:02:40,"- Yeah, to fix these ships actually,"
00:02:40,00:02:41,"when they do replace the engines,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,they're going to have to drill a huge hole
00:02:43,00:02:45,"in the underside of the boats, I think."
00:02:45,00:02:47,So you've really got to tell the whole thing apart
00:02:47,00:02:48,at this point. - Wow.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"And it's a billion pounds each, I think."
00:02:50,00:02:51,- Yeah.
00:02:51,00:02:53,"- And it is, of course, only three months of the money"
00:02:53,00:02:55,that we're going to get back from Europe.
00:02:55,00:02:57,(audience laughing)
00:02:57,00:03:01,"- Did you know there's one vertical shipwreck in the world,"
00:03:01,00:03:03,"which is just sticking up completely vertically,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,at a 90 degree angle to the seabed.
00:03:05,00:03:06,- Wow.
00:03:06,00:03:08,"- And this is HMS Victoria,"
00:03:08,00:03:09,and it's a really interesting story.
00:03:09,00:03:12,"So this was a battleship in the late 19th century,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,and it was one of the biggest battleship wrecks
00:03:14,00:03:16,that the UK suffered.
00:03:16,00:03:19,"And it was because of this guy Admiral Trion,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,which feels like a... (audience laughing)
00:03:21,00:03:23,- He just turned up at the Admiralty one day.
00:03:23,00:03:28,"- Just trying that on, and it did not go well for him."
00:03:28,00:03:32,So he gave this bizarre order in 1893.
00:03:32,00:03:36,"He was a really well-decorated Admiral in the Royal Navy,"
00:03:36,00:03:37,"and he was just off the coast of Lebanon,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"and there were two main ships leading his big fleet,"
00:03:39,00:03:42,the HMS Victoria and HMS Campodown.
00:03:42,00:03:44,"And he, suddenly via Semaphore,"
00:03:44,00:03:46,gave the instruction to campodown
00:03:46,00:03:48,that those two ships that were running parallel
00:03:48,00:03:50,to each other had to turn inwards towards each other
00:03:50,00:03:52,and do a full circle in order to come back.
00:03:52,00:03:54,And the turning circle of those ships
00:03:54,00:03:57,"was collectively two kilometers,"
00:03:57,00:03:59,and there was one kilometer between them.
00:03:59,00:04:00,So it was physically impossible.
00:04:00,00:04:02,"Again, it's a law of physics issue."
00:04:02,00:04:05,It was physically impossible for them not to crash into each other.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"So that captain of HMS Campodown ignored that,"
00:04:08,00:04:09,the first time around.
00:04:09,00:04:10,"But when he gave the order a second time,"
00:04:10,00:04:14,"he just had to obey, 'cause that was what you did in the 1890s."
00:04:14,00:04:16,"And so they did this turn,"
00:04:16,00:04:17,"and they were holding these two ships,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,"both just captain by the same guy,"
00:04:19,00:04:21,crashed straight into each other.
00:04:21,00:04:24,One of them was like plummeted to the bottom of the ocean.
00:04:24,00:04:28,"Yeah, his last words were, ""It's all my fault."""
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Whoa! - Yeah.
00:04:29,00:04:31,"- His last words, ""What on his deathbed?"""
00:04:31,00:04:33,Or on his... - What he died in the shipwreck.
00:04:33,00:04:34,A lot of people died.
00:04:34,00:04:37,"So it was only 357 people were rescued,"
00:04:37,00:04:41,"but sadly, 358 people were drowned."
00:04:41,00:04:43,And so it just hit it over the edge.
00:04:43,00:04:46,"And so as he was going down, he said, ""It's all my fault."""
00:04:46,00:04:49,"To which I guess everyone on board his ship replied, ""Yes, it is."""
00:04:49,00:04:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:51,00:04:53,"- Wow, that's great. - His name was Trion, wasn't it?"
00:04:53,00:04:55,"- Trion, Admiral Trion? - Yeah."
00:04:55,00:05:00,My favourite kind of nominatively determined captain of a ship
00:05:00,00:05:02,was Captain Schlitt.
00:05:02,00:05:06,And he was a captain of a German U-boat.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"It was U-1206, and it sank off the coast of Scotland"
00:05:09,00:05:12,because the toilets flooded.
00:05:12,00:05:14,- Really? - Yeah.
00:05:14,00:05:16,"I don't know what caused the original blockage,"
00:05:16,00:05:20,but what happened was they flushed it a couple of times
00:05:20,00:05:23,"and it overflowed, but the batteries were underneath the toilet."
00:05:23,00:05:26,So it wasn't a very well-designed submarine.
00:05:26,00:05:29,"And so the water went into the batteries,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,that released a load of chlorine gas.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"And then they were like, ""Oh, shit, there's chlorine gas everywhere."""
00:05:34,00:05:35,"So they had to go to the surface,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"and then when they got to the surface,"
00:05:37,00:05:38,"the British just went, ""Oh, there's a submarine."
00:05:38,00:05:40,"Let's shoot it."""
00:05:40,00:05:43,"- Oh, god. - There's a thing, really early submarines."
00:05:43,00:05:45,They were basically at the surface almost all the time.
00:05:45,00:05:47,They were pretty much surface ships
00:05:47,00:05:49,that had the capacity to dive.
00:05:49,00:05:53,"But the really odd thing is that even in the Second World War,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,"to have extra observation, a German U-boat would surface,"
00:05:56,00:05:59,"and then it would send up a kite with a man in a little seat,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,and he would look around.
00:06:01,00:06:03,That's truly happening.
00:06:03,00:06:04,This is within living memory.
00:06:04,00:06:05,"He would look around, and he could,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,because obviously you can see dozens of miles in a direction.
00:06:08,00:06:09,You can see any ships.
00:06:09,00:06:11,"And then 53 kilometers, apparently,"
00:06:11,00:06:13,was the maximum you could see.
00:06:13,00:06:15,"And the only disadvantage was, obviously,"
00:06:15,00:06:18,it immediately gave away your position.
00:06:18,00:06:20,"And you would then have to dive really quickly,"
00:06:20,00:06:21,once you've seen who's in the area.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Yeah.
00:06:22,00:06:24,"And the guy is still attached to the submarine,"
00:06:24,00:06:25,"being pulled down, is he?"
00:06:25,00:06:26,"He, I think, I think that--"
00:06:26,00:06:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:29,00:06:31,I think they get him back on board.
00:06:31,00:06:34,"And then they go, ""Deep breath, we're going under."""
00:06:34,00:06:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:37,00:06:39,"When the battleship arrived, when the British warship arrived,"
00:06:39,00:06:42,"it was just a bloke in a kite, some rain."
00:06:42,00:06:43,No.
00:06:43,00:06:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:45,00:06:47,That means so.
00:06:47,00:06:51,I'm sure I've heard of noted that.
00:06:51,00:06:53,So the US Navy's most advanced new battleship.
00:06:53,00:06:55,It's called the USS Zomvolt.
00:06:55,00:06:57,And it is so advanced.
00:06:57,00:07:01,"It is so stealthy that, in fact, it's too stealthy."
00:07:01,00:07:03,"And it's going to have to carry big reflective pads,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,so other things don't bump into it.
00:07:05,00:07:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:06,00:07:09,"It's about 400 feet long, and it can make itself"
00:07:09,00:07:12,look on radar like a 50-foot-long fishing boat.
00:07:12,00:07:13,"Well, and a quick last thing."
00:07:13,00:07:15,"You know, the ceremony, the launching ceremonies of boats."
00:07:15,00:07:17,"So every time a new rule boat is launched,"
00:07:17,00:07:19,then we smash a champagne bottle.
00:07:19,00:07:22,Or a woman customarily smashes a champagne bottle into it.
00:07:22,00:07:24,And I didn't realize the first instance in this
00:07:24,00:07:26,was in the 18th century.
00:07:26,00:07:29,And the person who first smashed a champagne bottle
00:07:29,00:07:32,onto a ship's hull was the princess of Hannover.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"And she, according to reports of the time,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,threw the bottle at it.
00:07:37,00:07:37,So now we smash it.
00:07:37,00:07:41,"But she threw the bottle at it with more energy than accuracy,"
00:07:41,00:07:44,missing the ship entirely and injuring one of the spectators.
00:07:44,00:07:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:45,00:07:49,Who put in a claim for damages against the Admiralty.
00:07:49,00:07:51,Does that mean that he was technically the ship?
00:07:51,00:07:53,Does that go worse?
00:07:53,00:07:55,Does the Navy have to use him?
00:07:55,00:07:56,Yep.
00:07:56,00:07:58,This is HMS Destroyer.
00:07:58,00:08:02,"This is HMS Arrogant, the HMS Kevin."
00:08:02,00:08:06,HMS Bloodiemut Bloodface.
00:08:06,00:08:07,"OK, it's time for a second fact."
00:08:07,00:08:09,And that is James Harkin.
00:08:09,00:08:14,"OK, my fact this week is that in 1988, Singapore held a beauty"
00:08:14,00:08:17,contest where 60% of the judging marks were
00:08:17,00:08:20,awarded for how good a contestant's website was.
00:08:20,00:08:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:23,00:08:27,So this was a way to promote the internet in Singapore
00:08:27,00:08:28,in the '90s.
00:08:28,00:08:30,And it was the leading internet service provider
00:08:30,00:08:32,"cost signnet, and they had a competition"
00:08:32,00:08:35,to find intellectual beauty.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"60% of the marks were awarded for internet knowledge,"
00:08:38,00:08:41,which was producing your own home page and also
00:08:41,00:08:44,sitting at a laptop answering internet trivia questions.
00:08:44,00:08:45,Yeah.
00:08:45,00:08:46,Wow.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"And designing, like it was just a laptop on stage."
00:08:49,00:08:51,And they came out and designed a website.
00:08:51,00:08:53,"Also, do they have to design it on the spot?"
00:08:53,00:08:54,Yeah.
00:08:54,00:08:56,Doesn't it take days?
00:08:56,00:08:58,Not if you use Squarespace.com.
00:08:58,00:09:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:01,00:09:05,"So obviously, beauty contest, we probably all"
00:09:05,00:09:06,think they're a little bit sexist.
00:09:06,00:09:10,"But according to Miss America Organization,"
00:09:10,00:09:13,they claim to be the largest scholarship organization
00:09:13,00:09:15,solely for women in the whole of America.
00:09:15,00:09:19,I think that's been debunked.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"Yeah, by John Oliver, yeah."
00:09:22,00:09:24,It's a shame because it got such a rigorous round
00:09:24,00:09:26,of support from the audience here.
00:09:26,00:09:27,"I think they do give out some scholarships,"
00:09:27,00:09:31,but they don't give out nearly as many as were originally claimed.
00:09:31,00:09:34,"So modern beauty contests were invented by Petey Barnum,"
00:09:34,00:09:35,who we must all know.
00:09:35,00:09:37,He is the guy who kind of started circuses.
00:09:37,00:09:40,He was a big kind of circus king of America.
00:09:40,00:09:44,And he started them in Delaware in 1880.
00:09:44,00:09:45,"And it was a panel of judges who chose,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,and one of the judges was Thomas Edison.
00:09:48,00:09:48,Really?
00:09:48,00:09:50,Yeah.
00:09:50,00:09:52,And it was to promote a beach resort outside
00:09:52,00:09:55,of the normal kind of time that people would go to beaches.
00:09:55,00:09:59,"In 1955, America had a sausage queen."
00:09:59,00:10:00,That was a competition.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"There was a huge rash in the '50s, especially,"
00:10:02,00:10:05,"of really, really heavily sponsored competitions."
00:10:05,00:10:07,"If you Google Image Search, I've done this."
00:10:07,00:10:10,"It's safe, so don't worry."
00:10:10,00:10:12,Took a risk.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"If you Google Image Search sausage queen, you'll find--"
00:10:14,00:10:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:16,00:10:20,Find the picture of this poor woman.
00:10:20,00:10:23,"She's wearing a bikini, but she's also covered in sausages."
00:10:23,00:10:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:25,00:10:29,"Well, in Colombia, there are loads and loads of beauty pageants."
00:10:29,00:10:33,"So I think the BBC worked out that Colombia holds 3,794"
00:10:33,00:10:35,beauty pageants a year.
00:10:35,00:10:37,A year.
00:10:37,00:10:39,Calm down.
00:10:39,00:10:41,You're all beautiful.
00:10:41,00:10:42,But there's more than 10 a day.
00:10:42,00:10:43,And so they've had to branch out.
00:10:43,00:10:45,So they have Miss Onyun.
00:10:45,00:10:47,And that's where you have to prove your extensive knowledge
00:10:47,00:10:48,of Onyun's.
00:10:48,00:10:51,"They have the International Coffee Pageant, which"
00:10:51,00:10:53,"similarly missed coffee as someone from Japan,"
00:10:53,00:10:55,"bizarrely, who proved her knowledge"
00:10:55,00:10:57,of Colombian coffee well enough.
00:10:57,00:11:00,"They have donkey pageants, which are really popular,"
00:11:00,00:11:02,which is where you dress up donkeys.
00:11:02,00:11:05,And this takes place in rural Colombia.
00:11:05,00:11:06,And it's where you dress up your donkeys
00:11:06,00:11:08,as political or famous figures.
00:11:08,00:11:10,And you prance them around.
00:11:10,00:11:12,"So at the last donkey pageant, I think, one of them"
00:11:12,00:11:13,was Barack Obama.
00:11:13,00:11:15,He was straight in an American flag.
00:11:15,00:11:18,So he was wearing an American flag of sort of a dress.
00:11:18,00:11:20,And he had a USA tie on him.
00:11:20,00:11:21,"And in the end, the prize actually"
00:11:21,00:11:23,went to a donkey dressed as a Colombian preacher.
00:11:23,00:11:26,And Barack Obama's handler apparently
00:11:26,00:11:29,was seen storming off in outrage.
00:11:29,00:11:30,I would have--
00:11:30,00:11:32,"I'd put a bag of oats on my donkeys' nose,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,and then it would be donkey-ooty.
00:11:34,00:11:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:36,00:11:38,I think--
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Mix, mix, mix."
00:11:39,00:11:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:41,00:11:44,"On the flip side, I was reading about--"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"and it's terrible that this exists, but this does exist."
00:11:47,00:11:52,"In Zimbabwe, there's an annual Mr. Ugly competition."
00:11:52,00:11:53,And it's been going for four years.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"This will be the fifth year, 2016."
00:11:55,00:12:00,"Last year, they had a situation, a huge controversy,"
00:12:00,00:12:04,because the person who was awarded the top prize
00:12:04,00:12:09,of Mr. Ugly in the country was deemed too handsome by most
00:12:09,00:12:11,of the people who were in it.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"Mainly, it was the guy who's won it three years in a row"
00:12:14,00:12:15,"who was like, this guy's not ugly."
00:12:15,00:12:17,He's just missing teeth.
00:12:17,00:12:18,"Apparently, he just--"
00:12:18,00:12:22,I can't believe the contest got ugly.
00:12:22,00:12:23,They really stuck to their guns.
00:12:23,00:12:26,"The guy, one of the main judges, said,"
00:12:26,00:12:28,Sierra made a tremendous-- this is the guy who won.
00:12:28,00:12:30,Sierra made a tremendous effort to enhance his ugliness
00:12:30,00:12:32,by pulling facial stunts.
00:12:32,00:12:35,"Massvenou, who was the former champion,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,thought he was so ugly that he didn't even
00:12:37,00:12:39,need to try hard.
00:12:39,00:12:42,That cost him the crown.
00:12:42,00:12:43,"And so, yeah, he's--"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"So none of the judging panel said,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"oh, I just thought voting him would be a protest."
00:12:47,00:12:49,I didn't think he'd actually win.
00:12:49,00:12:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:51,00:12:53,[APPLAUSE]
00:12:53,00:12:56,"Yeah, this is a satirical show we do."
00:12:56,00:12:59,"Yeah, this is the most satirical we've ever made."
00:12:59,00:13:03,"Yeah, so I think about the internet in Singapore."
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:07,"OK, so in 2001, the Singapore banned campaigning"
00:13:07,00:13:09,on the internet during its election.
00:13:09,00:13:13,"So Minister for Information and Arts, Li Yoxuan,"
00:13:13,00:13:15,"said, ""A free-for-all internet"
00:13:15,00:13:17,campaigning environment without rules
00:13:17,00:13:19,is not advisable.
00:13:19,00:13:21,"On the internet, once a false story"
00:13:21,00:13:23,"or rumor is started, it's like water"
00:13:23,00:13:25,that has been spilled.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"It's almost impossible to reign in the matters,"
00:13:27,00:13:31,"especially in the limited period of an election campaign."""
00:13:31,00:13:34,I think we can all agree he was way off the mark there.
00:13:34,00:13:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:35,00:13:37,They were quite interpromote in the internet
00:13:37,00:13:38,"around that period, weren't they?"
00:13:38,00:13:43,Because they had an internet festival in the year 2000.
00:13:43,00:13:46,And that was-- so the centerpiece of this festival
00:13:46,00:13:48,"was this guy called Nicholas Eng,"
00:13:48,00:13:49,who was a computer engineer who'd
00:13:49,00:13:52,founded this company called Wave New World.
00:13:52,00:13:55,And this was all the talk of the millennial Singaporean
00:13:55,00:13:56,internet festival.
00:13:56,00:14:00,"And as the BBC reported, he said that the internet"
00:14:00,00:14:02,and this new media explosion in the year 2000
00:14:02,00:14:06,"have brought us email e-commerce, DVD movies, interactive games."
00:14:06,00:14:10,"But something is missing, the sense of smell."
00:14:10,00:14:15,"And he was starting up a company called DigiSense, which"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"allowed you to use the internet, but smell, as you were doing it,"
00:14:18,00:14:20,the sense that it would be appropriate to the website
00:14:20,00:14:21,that you were searching.
00:14:21,00:14:22,And I think--
00:14:22,00:14:24,You don't always want to smell the thing that you're looking up up.
00:14:24,00:14:28,"If it's sausage queen, you don't really have that."
00:14:28,00:14:31,"If you Google the phrase, smell the sausage queen."
00:14:31,00:14:35,We cannot guarantee that that's safe.
00:14:35,00:14:38,"It is crazy, though, because I remember the internet in 1998,"
00:14:38,00:14:40,which was pretty basic.
00:14:40,00:14:42,So the idea that there would be a massive competition
00:14:42,00:14:44,at that time seems ridiculous.
00:14:44,00:14:47,"I went to a judgeal bank, which is in Cheshire's"
00:14:47,00:14:49,"big sort of, what is it, a big--"
00:14:49,00:14:50,"They look for aliens, do you?"
00:14:50,00:14:51,"Yeah, they telescope."
00:14:51,00:14:54,Sorry.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"So it was in the '90s, and we didn't know"
00:14:56,00:14:57,one had the internet.
00:14:57,00:14:58,We didn't have it in our school.
00:14:58,00:15:01,So we all went there to kind of look at the internet.
00:15:01,00:15:03,And I remember going in that.
00:15:03,00:15:04,I know it's amazing.
00:15:04,00:15:06,But I went in there and kind of searched
00:15:06,00:15:09,"for fancy football, which I was into at the time."
00:15:09,00:15:12,And it kind of just picked up the word fantasy
00:15:12,00:15:14,"and gave me lots of things that as a young teenage boy,"
00:15:14,00:15:16,I'd never really seen before.
00:15:16,00:15:17,Whoa.
00:15:17,00:15:18,A judgeal bank?
00:15:18,00:15:18,Yeah.
00:15:18,00:15:20,That's what I want to consider in the rhyming slang
00:15:20,00:15:21,that a judgeal bank is.
00:15:21,00:15:27,"Guys, we need to move on in a second."
00:15:27,00:15:28,"So we ought to, yeah."
00:15:28,00:15:32,"OK, I have one little thing about contest in Singapore."
00:15:32,00:15:36,"So in 2009, men's spot in Singapore"
00:15:36,00:15:40,was so bad that they couldn't find a sportsman of the year.
00:15:40,00:15:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:42,00:15:45,So 2008 was an Olympic year as well.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"The president of the Olympic Council said,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,"unfortunately, it was a bad year."
00:15:49,00:15:52,None of them really achieved anything not worth it.
00:15:52,00:15:55,So I had a look at what they did in the Olympics.
00:15:55,00:15:58,And the table tennis team went out in the group stage.
00:15:58,00:16:01,None of the sailors made the top 20.
00:16:01,00:16:03,They're only track half wheat went out in the first round.
00:16:03,00:16:06,They're only shooter lost in the first round.
00:16:06,00:16:09,They're only swimmer lost in the first round.
00:16:09,00:16:10,And they're only male badminton player
00:16:10,00:16:12,lost in the second round.
00:16:12,00:16:13,So you think you might have won.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"Boy, he had a buy in the first round."
00:16:15,00:16:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:18,00:16:20,Time for fact number three.
00:16:20,00:16:22,And that is Anich Zinski.
00:16:22,00:16:25,My fact this week is that there is a network of fully furnished
00:16:25,00:16:29,"fake apartments in the UK, whose sole purpose"
00:16:29,00:16:30,is to get burgled.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Wow.
00:16:31,00:16:32,That's a name that is amazing.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"When you say a network, how many--"
00:16:34,00:16:38,I'm so bizarre that that's your first question.
00:16:38,00:16:40,Who owns them?
00:16:40,00:16:42,So they are owned by the government.
00:16:42,00:16:45,"So this is-- there are a lot to answer your question, apparently."
00:16:45,00:16:46,That helps.
00:16:46,00:16:49,They exist in every major city in the UK.
00:16:49,00:16:50,There are a few of these.
00:16:50,00:16:52,And I found this out in a new book.
00:16:52,00:16:55,It's come out this year called A Burgler's Guide to the City.
00:16:55,00:16:56,It's by Jeff Mannow.
00:16:56,00:16:58,And it's so good.
00:16:58,00:17:02,"And yeah, there's this capture house program"
00:17:02,00:17:03,"that the government runs, which is"
00:17:03,00:17:07,where you build a completely fake apartment that's totally
00:17:07,00:17:09,kitted out with a lot of nice technology
00:17:09,00:17:11,with some furniture that's often donated
00:17:11,00:17:14,"by the local police force, apparently, that they didn't want."
00:17:14,00:17:17,And you build this apartment in a way
00:17:17,00:17:20,that will hopefully lure burglarers to burglar it.
00:17:20,00:17:23,"And unbeknownst to them, they're all covered"
00:17:23,00:17:26,"in this chemical agent, which can only be seen under UV light."
00:17:26,00:17:28,"So whenever the burglar is burglary,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"it touches a handle, or walks across the floor."
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Then he's covering himself in this chemical agent,"
00:17:32,00:17:33,"which then needs a trace of where he's been,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,and also their full of cameras.
00:17:35,00:17:37,"So basically, they're there as traps"
00:17:37,00:17:39,so that burglar's come in and then the police follow
00:17:39,00:17:40,immediately afterwards.
00:17:40,00:17:42,"And they're all over the place, and you wouldn't know"
00:17:42,00:17:43,if there was one in your apartment building.
00:17:43,00:17:45,They're everywhere.
00:17:45,00:17:48,So you wouldn't know if your home was one of these.
00:17:48,00:17:51,"If you've been burgled, maybe it is."
00:17:51,00:17:54,I wanted to know how they lure burglarers to burglar them.
00:17:54,00:17:56,Do they have people sort of ostentatiously
00:17:56,00:18:00,"carrying in, you know, really nice tellies and stuff?"
00:18:00,00:18:03,"Saying, oh, I must get a second lock for this door"
00:18:03,00:18:04,one of these days.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"As soon as I get back from that long holiday,"
00:18:06,00:18:08,that's a guy.
00:18:08,00:18:12,Thank god we got rid of the dog.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"Yeah, it's basically that."
00:18:13,00:18:17,"No, they're often targeting one specific burglar."
00:18:17,00:18:18,So they'll be--
00:18:18,00:18:19,"Oh, of course."
00:18:19,00:18:19,It's amazing.
00:18:19,00:18:20,It's genuinely incredible.
00:18:20,00:18:23,They target that particular burglar's motor operandi.
00:18:23,00:18:27,"So if he only robs first floor flats, for example,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,they'll try and make sure that one of the capture houses
00:18:29,00:18:31,"is a first floor flat, if they can."
00:18:31,00:18:33,"And then they walk around as I was shouting,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,"""Marjorie, can you remind me to open all the windows?"""
00:18:35,00:18:37,It's so warm.
00:18:37,00:18:40,"And then they'll leave a window open, and they'll try and get them in."
00:18:40,00:18:43,"It's true, it's that police thing where you pick up so many clues"
00:18:43,00:18:45,"from it, the way a burglar operates."
00:18:45,00:18:47,And you really can't rig up a house or a flat
00:18:47,00:18:50,so that it is going to attract that one burglar in the area.
00:18:50,00:18:53,And one burglar can raise the crime rates of one area
00:18:53,00:18:57,"massively, because he and his gang, or she and her gang,"
00:18:57,00:19:00,will just be operating on lots of houses every day of the week.
00:19:00,00:19:03,I was looking into-- so police having to fake things
00:19:03,00:19:04,in order to get results.
00:19:04,00:19:06,Confessions.
00:19:06,00:19:08,Yes.
00:19:08,00:19:11,So one of the things I write about is that
00:19:11,00:19:15,"bomb and drug-sniffing dogs, when they go around looking"
00:19:15,00:19:18,for any-- there are airports trying to sniff out the drugs
00:19:18,00:19:22,"and so on-- apparently, if they don't get a win,"
00:19:22,00:19:25,"if they don't manage to smell out some drugs,"
00:19:25,00:19:26,they get quite depressed.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"Psychologically, sniffer dogs actually get depressed,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,that they don't have a sort of--
00:19:30,00:19:31,they've done a good job.
00:19:31,00:19:35,So what the police will do is they'll fake a situation.
00:19:35,00:19:38,"Yeah, yeah, honestly, where the dog can then sniff out some"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"one and be like, oh, I need--"
00:19:40,00:19:41,they just get members of the public.
00:19:41,00:19:43,"They pay them to do it, and they bust out."
00:19:43,00:19:45,"They pay, that's what it's happening."
00:19:45,00:19:48,"I don't know if they pay them, but they've set up fake drug"
00:19:48,00:19:50,vests for dogs so that dogs can feel better.
00:19:50,00:19:52,It's a great fact.
00:19:52,00:19:53,So these guys always have to tell me
00:19:53,00:19:55,what I've actually got a good fact.
00:19:55,00:19:57,You've done very well.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Have a biscuit.
00:19:58,00:20:03,"Do you want to hear about a couple of things, though?"
00:20:03,00:20:05,Do you want to hear about a couple of cool devices
00:20:05,00:20:07,that you can get if you don't want to be birgled?
00:20:07,00:20:07,"Yes, please."
00:20:07,00:20:08,Show a thing.
00:20:08,00:20:09,A lock.
00:20:09,00:20:12,"A lock, yeah."
00:20:12,00:20:15,"So you can get a thing called fake TV, which is very cool."
00:20:15,00:20:18,"And it's this panel, which is just flashing LED lights."
00:20:18,00:20:21,"But from the outside, it looks exactly"
00:20:21,00:20:23,like someone's indoors and watching Telly.
00:20:23,00:20:24,Why don't you just leave your TV on?
00:20:24,00:20:25,Good point.
00:20:25,00:20:26,Great.
00:20:26,00:20:29,"That's stuff there, business model."
00:20:29,00:20:32,"No, it's-- I think the idea is it uses a lot less energy"
00:20:32,00:20:35,than just leaving your Telly on all the time.
00:20:35,00:20:36,Did someone watch Home Alone?
00:20:36,00:20:39,Did you see the Christmas scene?
00:20:39,00:20:41,That's a business model.
00:20:41,00:20:42,That is a thing you can buy.
00:20:42,00:20:44,It's called fake TV.
00:20:44,00:20:45,And I've seen it.
00:20:45,00:20:46,It looks right.
00:20:46,00:20:48,I didn't burgle the house.
00:20:48,00:20:49,And there's no thing you can get.
00:20:49,00:20:53,You can get an anti-theft security smog jet machine.
00:20:53,00:20:55,This is for things like banks and things like that.
00:20:55,00:20:58,"But if there's a break in, it just floods the entire room"
00:20:58,00:20:59,with smog.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Wow.
00:21:00,00:21:01,That's very cool.
00:21:01,00:21:06,"And the burglar goes in and goes, oh, I'm in the 19th century."
00:21:06,00:21:11,"Just on the subject, I was looking for fake things and police."
00:21:11,00:21:13,And I just found a story that I'd rather like from last year.
00:21:13,00:21:16,"This is from Sutton, so not too far from here."
00:21:16,00:21:19,"And it's that in June of last year, police and Sutton"
00:21:19,00:21:21,turned up to a house because they'd
00:21:21,00:21:23,had a tip off from the RSPCA.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"And they had a standoff over a snake, which"
00:21:25,00:21:27,was loose in someone's garden.
00:21:27,00:21:29,And they had a reasonably long standoff
00:21:29,00:21:31,until it was pointed out to them that it was a garden
00:21:31,00:21:34,ornament snake.
00:21:34,00:21:35,"But they were standing really still, watching it."
00:21:35,00:21:36,And it wasn't moving.
00:21:36,00:21:39,And they weren't moving.
00:21:39,00:21:43,"And then a resident told them, it's not real."
00:21:43,00:21:44,And I just love the quote.
00:21:44,00:21:47,"It was a neighbor who was called Gary Hollins, a 43-year-old"
00:21:47,00:21:49,who lived nearby.
00:21:49,00:21:51,"And he said, I could have told you it was a fake snake"
00:21:51,00:21:54,because the paint is peeling off it.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"Hey, snake shed that skin."
00:21:56,00:21:57,"True, good point."
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Oh, we need to move on to the final fact."
00:21:59,00:22:03,"OK, maybe we should do some hilarious burglary stories,"
00:22:03,00:22:05,shall we?
00:22:05,00:22:07,So I went on the internet and looked
00:22:07,00:22:11,for some burglar headlines from the last few months.
00:22:11,00:22:14,So a burglar was caught after knocking
00:22:14,00:22:17,over a tent of white paint during a break in
00:22:17,00:22:20,"and leaving footsteps, leading all the way to his door."
00:22:20,00:22:23,"Oh, man."
00:22:23,00:22:25,There was another one who was caught by police
00:22:25,00:22:27,after having a bite out of a cucumber
00:22:27,00:22:30,and leaving his DNA inside the cucumber.
00:22:30,00:22:32,Wow.
00:22:32,00:22:34,There was a post office burglar who was caught
00:22:34,00:22:37,"after he tried to buy a car with 1,000 pounds in 1 pound coins."
00:22:37,00:22:44,And there was a Kentucky burglar who was arrested after accidentally
00:22:44,00:22:48,dialing his phone 9-1-1 while he was talking
00:22:48,00:22:50,to whether it's complex about the burglary
00:22:50,00:22:52,that he was just about to do.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Oh, my God."
00:22:53,00:22:53,What?
00:22:53,00:22:55,And they just overheard him saying what he was going to do
00:22:55,00:22:56,and then they caught him.
00:22:56,00:22:57,Wow.
00:22:57,00:23:00,Do you remember there was that story about there was a couple
00:23:00,00:23:03,who were downstairs and they'd ride back home
00:23:03,00:23:06,and some two people were in their house robbing the house.
00:23:06,00:23:07,"Sorry, no, it was one person."
00:23:07,00:23:08,One person was in the house.
00:23:08,00:23:10,So he quickly ran upstairs and hid
00:23:10,00:23:12,and was trying to plan his escape route.
00:23:12,00:23:15,"And according to this story, the burglar is upstairs"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"and he's just sitting there kind of going, OK, what do I do?"
00:23:17,00:23:18,They're downstairs.
00:23:18,00:23:21,"And one of the couple says, oh, I heard a hilarious joke today."
00:23:21,00:23:23,Told the joke.
00:23:23,00:23:26,"They live with a punchline, the recipient just in laugh."
00:23:26,00:23:30,And then they just heard this.
00:23:30,00:23:33,"And the burglar couldn't help but go,"
00:23:33,00:23:36,I wonder what happens if that knock-knock joke.
00:23:36,00:23:37,This is himself.
00:23:37,00:23:38,"And then they bust it, but they call it the cops."
00:23:38,00:23:40,You know what I'm saying?
00:23:40,00:23:42,"That's the truth, sir."
00:23:42,00:23:44,We need to move on to the final fact.
00:23:44,00:23:44,OK.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"OK, it's time for a final fact of the show."
00:23:46,00:23:48,And that is James Harkin.
00:23:48,00:23:49,I don't think he did.
00:23:49,00:23:49,James has done this.
00:23:49,00:23:50,It's my first time.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"Oh, sorry."
00:23:51,00:23:52,Sorry.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:23:54,00:23:55,And that is Additch.
00:23:55,00:23:55,OK.
00:23:55,00:23:57,Final fact of the show.
00:23:57,00:24:00,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:24:00,00:24:01,"Thank you, Dan."
00:24:01,00:24:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:04,00:24:07,My fact is that the world's biggest skywriting firm
00:24:07,00:24:09,recently turned down a request to draw
00:24:09,00:24:13,the largest ever penis in the sky.
00:24:13,00:24:14,That was worth wasting for.
00:24:14,00:24:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:17,00:24:21,"So skywriting, we all know, is where planes loop the loop."
00:24:21,00:24:23,And they release smoke in various patterns
00:24:23,00:24:25,to make letters or shapes or whatever it is.
00:24:25,00:24:27,And the really cool thing is there are only
00:24:27,00:24:32,five full-time skywriters on the planet.
00:24:32,00:24:34,Only five people who make a full-time living.
00:24:34,00:24:37,A lot of sort of freelance people at part-time
00:24:37,00:24:40,"has amazing article on the website Quartz about this,"
00:24:40,00:24:43,because there's a family firm of people who do it.
00:24:43,00:24:45,And they have various rules.
00:24:45,00:24:47,So they turn down swear words.
00:24:47,00:24:50,They won't write really rude things in this guy.
00:24:50,00:24:51,And they've also turned down someone
00:24:51,00:24:54,who wanted to get the largest ever penis drawn in this guy.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"But they did earlier this year, right over California,"
00:24:56,00:24:59,the words Trump is disgusting.
00:24:59,00:25:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:00,00:25:01,But they're now regress it.
00:25:01,00:25:03,"And they say they wish they hadn't taken it,"
00:25:03,00:25:04,because they want to be able to take it.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"So by writing the word Trump, they did kind of"
00:25:06,00:25:07,have the world's biggest penis in this guy.
00:25:07,00:25:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:09,00:25:15,"Yeah, so the other cool thing is there are two--"
00:25:15,00:25:15,I didn't know.
00:25:15,00:25:19,There are two main ways of making letters in this guy.
00:25:19,00:25:21,"You can either do it with one plane, which"
00:25:21,00:25:23,"is where you have-- and you have a sort of smoke jet,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,"basically, it's an adapted exhaust out of the back of the plane."
00:25:26,00:25:28,"And you can either have one plane, but it takes ages."
00:25:28,00:25:30,And you can only write about 12 letters maximum.
00:25:30,00:25:33,And it takes a couple of minutes to write a single letter.
00:25:33,00:25:33,Because letters are huge.
00:25:33,00:25:37,Each of the letters is as tall as the Empire State Building.
00:25:37,00:25:37,Whoa!
00:25:37,00:25:39,"Yeah, they're massive."
00:25:39,00:25:43,And a single message is at least five miles long in the sky.
00:25:43,00:25:45,"This is very exciting, because there's now"
00:25:45,00:25:47,"a new thing you can do called sky typing, which"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"is where you have five planes next to each other,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,and they're all flying in formation.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"And they have a computer-controlled system, which"
00:25:54,00:25:57,releases puffs of smoke at exactly the right moment.
00:25:57,00:26:00,"So they're all writing either on or off in the sky,"
00:26:00,00:26:01,and that produces--
00:26:01,00:26:03,"Like a name jet printer, kind of thing."
00:26:03,00:26:04,"Like a name jet printer, yeah, yeah."
00:26:04,00:26:07,And it slowly produces the word like that as they fly across.
00:26:07,00:26:10,So you can do longer messages now using sky typing.
00:26:10,00:26:13,But that's the old new divide in sky writing.
00:26:13,00:26:15,That's amazing.
00:26:15,00:26:18,"I really-- my favorite one was from a few years ago,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,and it was just suddenly appeared in the air.
00:26:20,00:26:23,How do I land?
00:26:23,00:26:25,And it was a comedian who did that.
00:26:25,00:26:26,It was a Kickstarter.
00:26:26,00:26:29,He decided he just-- he wanted to help sky writing come back.
00:26:29,00:26:31,He thought it'd be a great place to put a joke up.
00:26:31,00:26:34,"And so he did a Kickstarter, and they raised $4,000 American dollars."
00:26:34,00:26:38,That's how much it cost to have something like how do I land?
00:26:38,00:26:38,Question mark.
00:26:38,00:26:42,Do you know that actually it was a really windy day?
00:26:42,00:26:45,"And so they did the H. And then by the time they'd done the O,"
00:26:45,00:26:46,the H had already gone.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Oh!
00:26:47,00:26:51,"But W, the H and the O had already gone."
00:26:51,00:26:54,"And he said, if you watch the sky for 20 minutes,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,you could probably piece it together.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Oh!
00:26:57,00:27:01,This is a guy called-- he was a comedian called Kurt Bronola.
00:27:01,00:27:04,"Yeah, he still is a comedian called Kurt Bronola."
00:27:04,00:27:07,And he's just so people know who he is.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"Kristen Scholl, Kristen Scholl, sorry,"
00:27:09,00:27:12,"who is in Flight the Concords, and so on."
00:27:12,00:27:13,It's her comedy partner.
00:27:13,00:27:14,So he's very big in the sense.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"But when he did this, unless you really,"
00:27:17,00:27:19,you really watched and saw each letter go.
00:27:19,00:27:20,You couldn't really tell what was happening.
00:27:20,00:27:23,So what he did was he took a photo of each letter
00:27:23,00:27:25,before it blew away.
00:27:25,00:27:27,And then he put them all together in a composite photo
00:27:27,00:27:31,"and then put it online saying, this is what it would have looked like."
00:27:31,00:27:31,I know.
00:27:31,00:27:33,I thought he could have just photoshopped the whole thing.
00:27:33,00:27:34,It would have been--
00:27:34,00:27:35,Yeah.
00:27:35,00:27:38,"I really like-- so back in the sort of '60s,"
00:27:38,00:27:39,it was used.
00:27:39,00:27:40,There was so many plans at sky writing
00:27:40,00:27:44,was going to be the main way that you would advertise your company.
00:27:44,00:27:44,I think you're right.
00:27:44,00:27:47,And pretty much it was when TV came in.
00:27:47,00:27:51,And suddenly we could get advertising to everyone's homes immediately.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"And that was when sky writing's like, oh, we don't really need this anymore."
00:27:54,00:27:58,"And it didn't need to be a cloudless, sunny day for advertising"
00:27:58,00:28:01,"to reach your home, which it did."
00:28:01,00:28:04,But there was a lot of alarmism about sky writing
00:28:04,00:28:07,"in the early days of it, that it was just going to be this--"
00:28:07,00:28:10,"like all new technologies, it was going to be this awful thing."
00:28:10,00:28:12,So I was looking in the newspaper archives
00:28:12,00:28:17,and people were writing things about it in 1932.
00:28:17,00:28:21,There was a debate in the House of Commons as to whether we should allow advertisers
00:28:21,00:28:23,free use of the sky to do this sky writing.
00:28:23,00:28:27,"And those MPs are against it, said it was a desecration of the sky."
00:28:27,00:28:30,"So monstrous, it should be completely prohibited."
00:28:30,00:28:33,And it was decided the inventor would promise not to do it in their cathedrals
00:28:33,00:28:38,or monuments and would agree not to vulgarize the sky.
00:28:38,00:28:40,But people thought it was going to ruin it.
00:28:40,00:28:42,People thought it would just spiral out of control.
00:28:42,00:28:45,And the entire sky would be occupied by constant adverts.
00:28:45,00:28:48,"Well, they kept saying, yeah, New York, they were worried that people living"
00:28:48,00:28:51,high-rise buildings would be pummeled by the smoke that was coming down.
00:28:51,00:28:57,"So they were recommending close your windows so that you don't die effectively,"
00:28:57,00:28:58,which was not true at all.
00:28:58,00:29:00,But-- and it was a sloppy business as well.
00:29:00,00:29:05,"1961, I read this amazing report where someone went up, did the message,"
00:29:05,00:29:08,"came back down, looked up, saw that they did it wrong."
00:29:08,00:29:11,"It was because it was very hard to do, made a mistake, went back up,"
00:29:11,00:29:15,"put a cross through it, and re-did the whole thing again."
00:29:15,00:29:18,Do you know what the first ever sky writing message said?
00:29:18,00:29:18,No.
00:29:18,00:29:21,It said daily mail.
00:29:21,00:29:22,It was an advert for the daily mail.
00:29:22,00:29:24,It was in 1922.
00:29:24,00:29:26,And it was invented.
00:29:26,00:29:29,Skywriting was invented by this guy called John Savage.
00:29:29,00:29:35,He was a pilot and the war was over and he sort of started experimenting.
00:29:35,00:29:36,So this is cool.
00:29:36,00:29:40,"He had been an agent to a chap called BC Hux, who was the first Englishman"
00:29:40,00:29:42,"to do a loop, the loop, in a plane."
00:29:42,00:29:42,"Oh, wow."
00:29:42,00:29:43,What?
00:29:43,00:29:46,"Yeah, he had a flying agent, apparently."
00:29:46,00:29:50,"And then, so after he'd experimented with this daily mail advert,"
00:29:50,00:29:54,"he went to the USA and he wrote in the sky above New York, Hello USA."
00:29:54,00:29:55,But no explanation.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Nothing.
00:29:56,00:30:00,"Then the next day, he sent someone else back up another pilot."
00:30:00,00:30:05,"And the message he wrote in the sky was call Vanderbilt 7100,"
00:30:05,00:30:08,which is the hotel he was staying at.
00:30:08,00:30:12,"As soon as people saw that, they started phoning the hotel by the hundreds,"
00:30:12,00:30:14,"saying, I must buy this as an advert."
00:30:14,00:30:16,That was his only advertising method.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"I think he was proving the effectiveness, wasn't he?"
00:30:18,00:30:21,"So I think 47,000 people called within three hours."
00:30:21,00:30:25,And it was sort of the effectiveness of this advertising that they all called.
00:30:25,00:30:26,Yeah.
00:30:26,00:30:29,"But someone, I liked this in 1961."
00:30:29,00:30:33,There was a guy who was in one of the very few people who was employed as a skywriter.
00:30:33,00:30:37,"And he had hated his math teacher at school, he said."
00:30:37,00:30:42,And so he did the sky writing with the advertisement that he'd been employed to write in the sky.
00:30:42,00:30:45,And then he had some spare ink in his tank.
00:30:45,00:30:53,"And so at the end of his working day, he screwed 4 plus 1 equals 6 in the sky"
00:30:53,00:30:56,as revenge against his high school nurse teacher.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Is that nice?
00:30:57,00:30:58,That's amazing.
00:30:58,00:31:00,How is that revenge?
00:31:00,00:31:02,"But yeah, it relies on a lot of things."
00:31:02,00:31:03,The master teacher is seeing it.
00:31:03,00:31:05,The master is knowing it's him.
00:31:05,00:31:08,The master teacher giving a shit about him anyway.
00:31:08,00:31:11,"Also, it's not a revenge to still be enumerous."
00:31:11,00:31:17,I'll show my English teacher by unlearning reading.
00:31:17,00:31:21,"I was reading a few years ago, and I can't read out the whole passage,"
00:31:21,00:31:25,"but it's really worth reading this person's account about how, when in, I think it's around 2008,"
00:31:25,00:31:31,"they were doing a, someone hired a skywriting team to write peace now across the sky."
00:31:31,00:31:36,"So there was a protest going because Obama was doing some sort of talk, and they just wanted to say,"
00:31:36,00:31:39,"we want peace, no more war, all that sort of stuff."
00:31:39,00:31:43,So the big problem that the pilot had is that they misjudged the size of the word.
00:31:43,00:31:46,"And as they were finishing up the words, they were heading directly into territory"
00:31:46,00:31:49,"that the military said, this is not an aerospace you're allowed into,"
00:31:49,00:31:52,"because we have the president down there, and you will be shot down."
00:31:52,00:31:53,That's amazing.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"Yeah, someone in the plane going, we need to turn around."
00:31:55,00:31:58,"We need to turn around. They're going, I need to get there so I can make the turn up"
00:31:58,00:32:00,to finish the W on the now.
00:32:00,00:32:03,"So in the end of the read, peace, no."
00:32:03,00:32:08,We even need to wrap up really soon.
00:32:08,00:32:11,"Can I quickly tell you about a chap in Melbourne, this was a couple of years ago."
00:32:11,00:32:14,"He wrote, he proposed his girlfriend in the sky with skywriting."
00:32:14,00:32:21,"He wrote Marie, that was her name, Marry Me, across the sky, and she said, no, when she saw it."
00:32:21,00:32:22,No.
00:32:22,00:32:25,"She also sent the plane up to say, no."
00:32:25,00:32:29,"He said, because they'd been together for years and years, and then they'd broken up,"
00:32:29,00:32:34,"and then they were getting back together, and they were thinking, I think this will clinch it."
00:32:34,00:32:39,"And he said, at least I know I've tried my best."
00:32:39,00:32:43,"Do you know that's so weird, because there's another guy in Melbourne recently who got"
00:32:43,00:32:46,"involved in skywriting, because he had a girlfriend called Prue,"
00:32:46,00:32:52,"and he wanted to send her a Valentine's Day message in the sky saying, happy Valentine's Day Prue,"
00:32:52,00:32:53,but couldn't afford it.
00:32:53,00:32:58,"So he started a kickstarter for everyone else who had a girlfriend called Prue in the world,"
00:32:58,00:33:03,"and said, if you all contribute to this, then we'll put the message, happy Valentine's Day Prue,"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"love me, so no one knows which one it was."
00:33:06,00:33:11,"Oh, there was a guy who wrote, sorry, in the sky above, I was an American city,"
00:33:11,00:33:16,"and no one knows who it was, but I imagine a lot of people will have been using that."
00:33:16,00:33:18,"That's for me to do, and I am sorry."
00:33:18,00:33:22,Boris Johnson's already got a second round of the game.
00:33:22,00:33:25,"OK, OK, that's it, that's all of our facts."
