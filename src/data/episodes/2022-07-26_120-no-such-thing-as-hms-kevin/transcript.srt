1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 (harmonica playing)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,140
 - Do you know what it is?

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,400
 I don't know what it is, but...

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,420
 (harmonica playing)

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,720
 Do you know what it is?

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,720
 (harmonica playing)

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,460
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,160
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish A Weekly Podcast"

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,860
 coming to you from the Otter Belly in London, South Bank.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,440
 My name is Dan Shriver, and please welcome to the stage

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,400
 in his Etich Zitsky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin!

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,400
 (audience cheering)

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,820
 (harmonica playing)

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:48,660
 - And once again, we have gathered around the table

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,300
 and in no particular order, here we go.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,540
 Starting with my fact this week,

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,700
 my fact is that the way to defeat the British Royal Navy's

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,860
 most advanced destroyer ship is to put it in warm water.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,620
 (audience laughing)

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,780
 So the British have spent a billion

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,220
 on six massive destroyer ships.

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,860
 These are ships that, in their press release,

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,060
 said this is the most advanced technology.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,940
 These are the most advanced ships of all time

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,220
 going into the oceans.

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,420
 It turns out that their engines can't take warm water.

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,060
 And so if they go to the Persian Gulf, for example,

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,340
 the whole ship just makes it just completely wet.

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,300
 - Would we ever want to go to the Persian Gulf?

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,900
 It's dangerous there.

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,740
 (audience laughing)

33
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,700
 - We should just start wars in Iceland.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,540
 - Yeah.

35
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,940
 (audience laughing)

36
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,660
 - The defense was that they weren't anticipating

37
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,220
 having to go somewhere like the Gulf.

38
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,940
 So John Hunson, who's a managing director of BAE system,

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,700
 said the operating profile at the time

40
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,860
 was that there would not be continuous operations

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,780
 in the Gulf.

42
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,220
 As if that was just out of the question at the time

43
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,580
 that we'd end up there.

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,180
 So yeah, they didn't expect to have to go anywhere.

45
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,300
 - There was a response from the MOD.

46
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,420
 They said, this is quote from the FD article.

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,140
 The MOD added that the ships remained

48
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,420
 one of the most capable warships on the planet.

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,180
 (audience laughing)

50
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,500
 - But only parts of the planet.

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
 (audience laughing)

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,180
 The Rolls-Royce booksman said,

53
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,220
 this is not the fault of Rolls-Royce.

54
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,260
 It is the laws of physics.

55
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,260
 (audience laughing)

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,900
 Can't do anything about those.

57
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,740
 - That's insane.

58
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,580
 - Yep.

59
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,420
 - It's amazing.

60
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,100
 - Is it the fault of the Rolls-Royce and so on

61
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,300
 for making the engines better?

62
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,620
 Is it the fault of the MOD for not telling them

63
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,460
 why we're doing this?

64
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,580
 - Rolls-Royce certainly claims it's the fault of the MOD.

65
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,420
 - Yeah.

66
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,540
 - And the MOD probably says it's Rolls-Royce's fault,

67
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,540
 and everyone says it's Isaac Newton's fault.

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,820
 (audience laughing)

69
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,380
 - Yeah, to fix these ships actually,

70
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,460
 when they do replace the engines,

71
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,340
 they're going to have to drill a huge hole

72
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,780
 in the underside of the boats, I think.

73
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,500
 So you've really got to tell the whole thing apart

74
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
 at this point. - Wow.

75
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,660
 And it's a billion pounds each, I think.

76
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,500
 - Yeah.

77
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,100
 - And it is, of course, only three months of the money

78
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,060
 that we're going to get back from Europe.

79
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,460
 (audience laughing)

80
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,060
 - Did you know there's one vertical shipwreck in the world,

81
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,300
 which is just sticking up completely vertically,

82
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,260
 at a 90 degree angle to the seabed.

83
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,100
 - Wow.

84
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,260
 - And this is HMS Victoria,

85
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,300
 and it's a really interesting story.

86
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,860
 So this was a battleship in the late 19th century,

87
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,980
 and it was one of the biggest battleship wrecks

88
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,580
 that the UK suffered.

89
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,060
 And it was because of this guy Admiral Trion,

90
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,620
 which feels like a... (audience laughing)

91
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,660
 - He just turned up at the Admiralty one day.

92
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,300
 - Just trying that on, and it did not go well for him.

93
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,100
 So he gave this bizarre order in 1893.

94
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,020
 He was a really well-decorated Admiral in the Royal Navy,

95
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,820
 and he was just off the coast of Lebanon,

96
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,860
 and there were two main ships leading his big fleet,

97
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,380
 the HMS Victoria and HMS Campodown.

98
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,460
 And he, suddenly via Semaphore,

99
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,020
 gave the instruction to campodown

100
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,100
 that those two ships that were running parallel

101
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,940
 to each other had to turn inwards towards each other

102
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,940
 and do a full circle in order to come back.

103
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,860
 And the turning circle of those ships

104
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,180
 was collectively two kilometers,

105
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,180
 and there was one kilometer between them.

106
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,740
 So it was physically impossible.

107
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,700
 Again, it's a law of physics issue.

108
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,820
 It was physically impossible for them not to crash into each other.

109
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,380
 So that captain of HMS Campodown ignored that,

110
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,380
 the first time around.

111
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,980
 But when he gave the order a second time,

112
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,460
 he just had to obey, 'cause that was what you did in the 1890s.

113
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,020
 And so they did this turn,

114
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,700
 and they were holding these two ships,

115
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,660
 both just captain by the same guy,

116
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,860
 crashed straight into each other.

117
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,340
 One of them was like plummeted to the bottom of the ocean.

118
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,540
 Yeah, his last words were, "It's all my fault."

119
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,860
 - Whoa! - Yeah.

120
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,260
 - His last words, "What on his deathbed?"

121
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,260
 Or on his... - What he died in the shipwreck.

122
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,100
 A lot of people died.

123
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,780
 So it was only 357 people were rescued,

124
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,860
 but sadly, 358 people were drowned.

125
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,980
 And so it just hit it over the edge.

126
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,220
 And so as he was going down, he said, "It's all my fault."

127
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,220
 To which I guess everyone on board his ship replied, "Yes, it is."

128
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,100
 [LAUGHTER]

129
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,820
 - Wow, that's great. - His name was Trion, wasn't it?

130
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,540
 - Trion, Admiral Trion? - Yeah.

131
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,180
 My favourite kind of nominatively determined captain of a ship

132
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,860
 was Captain Schlitt.

133
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,140
 And he was a captain of a German U-boat.

134
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,940
 It was U-1206, and it sank off the coast of Scotland

135
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,060
 because the toilets flooded.

136
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,140
 - Really? - Yeah.

137
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,700
 I don't know what caused the original blockage,

138
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,620
 but what happened was they flushed it a couple of times

139
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,820
 and it overflowed, but the batteries were underneath the toilet.

140
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,180
 So it wasn't a very well-designed submarine.

141
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,140
 And so the water went into the batteries,

142
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,660
 that released a load of chlorine gas.

143
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,380
 And then they were like, "Oh, shit, there's chlorine gas everywhere."

144
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,940
 So they had to go to the surface,

145
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,180
 and then when they got to the surface,

146
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,940
 the British just went, "Oh, there's a submarine.

147
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,180
 Let's shoot it."

148
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,260
 - Oh, god. - There's a thing, really early submarines.

149
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,780
 They were basically at the surface almost all the time.

150
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,140
 They were pretty much surface ships

151
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,220
 that had the capacity to dive.

152
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,180
 But the really odd thing is that even in the Second World War,

153
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,380
 to have extra observation, a German U-boat would surface,

154
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,980
 and then it would send up a kite with a man in a little seat,

155
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,780
 and he would look around.

156
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,140
 That's truly happening.

157
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,580
 This is within living memory.

158
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,940
 He would look around, and he could,

159
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,180
 because obviously you can see dozens of miles in a direction.

160
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,980
 You can see any ships.

161
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,980
 And then 53 kilometers, apparently,

162
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,820
 was the maximum you could see.

163
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,500
 And the only disadvantage was, obviously,

164
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,220
 it immediately gave away your position.

165
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,020
 And you would then have to dive really quickly,

166
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,780
 once you've seen who's in the area.

167
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
 Yeah.

168
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,100
 And the guy is still attached to the submarine,

169
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,340
 being pulled down, is he?

170
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,980
 He, I think, I think that--

171
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,300
 [LAUGHTER]

172
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,580
 I think they get him back on board.

173
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,140
 And then they go, "Deep breath, we're going under."

174
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,060
 [LAUGHTER]

175
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,380
 When the battleship arrived, when the British warship arrived,

176
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,700
 it was just a bloke in a kite, some rain.

177
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,700
 No.

178
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,020
 [LAUGHTER]

179
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,460
 That means so.

180
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,020
 I'm sure I've heard of noted that.

181
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,740
 So the US Navy's most advanced new battleship.

182
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,700
 It's called the USS Zomvolt.

183
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
 And it is so advanced.

184
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,060
 It is so stealthy that, in fact, it's too stealthy.

185
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,220
 And it's going to have to carry big reflective pads,

186
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,460
 so other things don't bump into it.

187
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,380
 [LAUGHTER]

188
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,140
 It's about 400 feet long, and it can make itself

189
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,020
 look on radar like a 50-foot-long fishing boat.

190
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,260
 Well, and a quick last thing.

191
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,660
 You know, the ceremony, the launching ceremonies of boats.

192
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,500
 So every time a new rule boat is launched,

193
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,060
 then we smash a champagne bottle.

194
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,180
 Or a woman customarily smashes a champagne bottle into it.

195
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,300
 And I didn't realize the first instance in this

196
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
 was in the 18th century.

197
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,460
 And the person who first smashed a champagne bottle

198
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,460
 onto a ship's hull was the princess of Hannover.

199
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,740
 And she, according to reports of the time,

200
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,060
 threw the bottle at it.

201
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,860
 So now we smash it.

202
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,140
 But she threw the bottle at it with more energy than accuracy,

203
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,100
 missing the ship entirely and injuring one of the spectators.

204
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,740
 [LAUGHTER]

205
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,220
 Who put in a claim for damages against the Admiralty.

206
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,340
 Does that mean that he was technically the ship?

207
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,260
 Does that go worse?

208
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,660
 Does the Navy have to use him?

209
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
 Yep.

210
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
 This is HMS Destroyer.

211
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,220
 This is HMS Arrogant, the HMS Kevin.

212
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,020
 HMS Bloodiemut Bloodface.

213
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,700
 OK, it's time for a second fact.

214
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,580
 And that is James Harkin.

215
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,380
 OK, my fact this week is that in 1988, Singapore held a beauty

216
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,860
 contest where 60% of the judging marks were

217
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,940
 awarded for how good a contestant's website was.

218
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,700
 [LAUGHTER]

219
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,100
 So this was a way to promote the internet in Singapore

220
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,340
 in the '90s.

221
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,900
 And it was the leading internet service provider

222
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,740
 cost signnet, and they had a competition

223
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,420
 to find intellectual beauty.

224
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,620
 60% of the marks were awarded for internet knowledge,

225
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,660
 which was producing your own home page and also

226
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,860
 sitting at a laptop answering internet trivia questions.

227
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,660
 Yeah.

228
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,460
 Wow.

229
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,220
 And designing, like it was just a laptop on stage.

230
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,660
 And they came out and designed a website.

231
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,820
 Also, do they have to design it on the spot?

232
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
 Yeah.

233
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,620
 Doesn't it take days?

234
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,660
 Not if you use Squarespace.com.

235
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,700
 [LAUGHTER]

236
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,100
 So obviously, beauty contest, we probably all

237
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,740
 think they're a little bit sexist.

238
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,220
 But according to Miss America Organization,

239
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,020
 they claim to be the largest scholarship organization

240
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,100
 solely for women in the whole of America.

241
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,740
 I think that's been debunked.

242
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,020
 Yeah, by John Oliver, yeah.

243
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,220
 It's a shame because it got such a rigorous round

244
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,340
 of support from the audience here.

245
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,980
 I think they do give out some scholarships,

246
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,100
 but they don't give out nearly as many as were originally claimed.

247
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,500
 So modern beauty contests were invented by Petey Barnum,

248
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,540
 who we must all know.

249
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,740
 He is the guy who kind of started circuses.

250
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,980
 He was a big kind of circus king of America.

251
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,220
 And he started them in Delaware in 1880.

252
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,900
 And it was a panel of judges who chose,

253
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,060
 and one of the judges was Thomas Edison.

254
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,820
 Really?

255
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,020
 Yeah.

256
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,660
 And it was to promote a beach resort outside

257
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,780
 of the normal kind of time that people would go to beaches.

258
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,100
 In 1955, America had a sausage queen.

259
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,020
 That was a competition.

260
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,060
 There was a huge rash in the '50s, especially,

261
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,300
 of really, really heavily sponsored competitions.

262
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,540
 If you Google Image Search, I've done this.

263
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,940
 It's safe, so don't worry.

264
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,020
 Took a risk.

265
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,420
 If you Google Image Search sausage queen, you'll find--

266
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,940
 [LAUGHTER]

267
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,140
 Find the picture of this poor woman.

268
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,420
 She's wearing a bikini, but she's also covered in sausages.

269
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
 [LAUGHTER]

270
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,900
 Well, in Colombia, there are loads and loads of beauty pageants.

271
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,620
 So I think the BBC worked out that Colombia holds 3,794

272
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,860
 beauty pageants a year.

273
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,460
 A year.

274
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,020
 Calm down.

275
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,460
 You're all beautiful.

276
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,820
 But there's more than 10 a day.

277
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,820
 And so they've had to branch out.

278
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,460
 So they have Miss Onyun.

279
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,300
 And that's where you have to prove your extensive knowledge

280
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,700
 of Onyun's.

281
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,140
 They have the International Coffee Pageant, which

282
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,980
 similarly missed coffee as someone from Japan,

283
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,620
 bizarrely, who proved her knowledge

284
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,780
 of Colombian coffee well enough.

285
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,620
 They have donkey pageants, which are really popular,

286
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,180
 which is where you dress up donkeys.

287
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,780
 And this takes place in rural Colombia.

288
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,980
 And it's where you dress up your donkeys

289
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,900
 as political or famous figures.

290
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,740
 And you prance them around.

291
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,500
 So at the last donkey pageant, I think, one of them

292
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,660
 was Barack Obama.

293
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,780
 He was straight in an American flag.

294
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,100
 So he was wearing an American flag of sort of a dress.

295
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,180
 And he had a USA tie on him.

296
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,340
 And in the end, the prize actually

297
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,900
 went to a donkey dressed as a Colombian preacher.

298
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,300
 And Barack Obama's handler apparently

299
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,780
 was seen storming off in outrage.

300
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,540
 I would have--

301
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,700
 I'd put a bag of oats on my donkeys' nose,

302
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,220
 and then it would be donkey-ooty.

303
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,820
 [LAUGHTER]

304
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,280
 I think--

305
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,220
 Mix, mix, mix.

306
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,740
 [LAUGHTER]

307
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,940
 On the flip side, I was reading about--

308
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,740
 and it's terrible that this exists, but this does exist.

309
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,340
 In Zimbabwe, there's an annual Mr. Ugly competition.

310
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,940
 And it's been going for four years.

311
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,620
 This will be the fifth year, 2016.

312
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,060
 Last year, they had a situation, a huge controversy,

313
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,020
 because the person who was awarded the top prize

314
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,540
 of Mr. Ugly in the country was deemed too handsome by most

315
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,020
 of the people who were in it.

316
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,260
 Mainly, it was the guy who's won it three years in a row

317
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,580
 who was like, this guy's not ugly.

318
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,860
 He's just missing teeth.

319
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,660
 Apparently, he just--

320
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,660
 I can't believe the contest got ugly.

321
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,820
 They really stuck to their guns.

322
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,380
 The guy, one of the main judges, said,

323
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,540
 Sierra made a tremendous-- this is the guy who won.

324
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,860
 Sierra made a tremendous effort to enhance his ugliness

325
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,860
 by pulling facial stunts.

326
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,380
 Massvenou, who was the former champion,

327
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,060
 thought he was so ugly that he didn't even

328
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,300
 need to try hard.

329
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,740
 That cost him the crown.

330
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,700
 And so, yeah, he's--

331
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,500
 So none of the judging panel said,

332
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,940
 oh, I just thought voting him would be a protest.

333
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
 I didn't think he'd actually win.

334
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
 [LAUGHTER]

335
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,780
 [APPLAUSE]

336
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,260
 Yeah, this is a satirical show we do.

337
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,180
 Yeah, this is the most satirical we've ever made.

338
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,620
 Yeah, so I think about the internet in Singapore.

339
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,620
 Yeah.

340
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,980
 OK, so in 2001, the Singapore banned campaigning

341
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,860
 on the internet during its election.

342
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,620
 So Minister for Information and Arts, Li Yoxuan,

343
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,340
 said, "A free-for-all internet

344
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,380
 campaigning environment without rules

345
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,100
 is not advisable.

346
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,260
 On the internet, once a false story

347
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,740
 or rumor is started, it's like water

348
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,020
 that has been spilled.

349
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,580
 It's almost impossible to reign in the matters,

350
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,900
 especially in the limited period of an election campaign."

351
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,420
 I think we can all agree he was way off the mark there.

352
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,940
 [LAUGHTER]

353
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,860
 They were quite interpromote in the internet

354
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
 around that period, weren't they?

355
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,940
 Because they had an internet festival in the year 2000.

356
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,460
 And that was-- so the centerpiece of this festival

357
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,340
 was this guy called Nicholas Eng,

358
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,700
 who was a computer engineer who'd

359
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,220
 founded this company called Wave New World.

360
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,380
 And this was all the talk of the millennial Singaporean

361
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,660
 internet festival.

362
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,420
 And as the BBC reported, he said that the internet

363
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,140
 and this new media explosion in the year 2000

364
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,500
 have brought us email e-commerce, DVD movies, interactive games.

365
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,380
 But something is missing, the sense of smell.

366
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,740
 And he was starting up a company called DigiSense, which

367
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,500
 allowed you to use the internet, but smell, as you were doing it,

368
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,220
 the sense that it would be appropriate to the website

369
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,460
 that you were searching.

370
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
 And I think--

371
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,380
 You don't always want to smell the thing that you're looking up up.

372
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,660
 If it's sausage queen, you don't really have that.

373
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,660
 If you Google the phrase, smell the sausage queen.

374
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,620
 We cannot guarantee that that's safe.

375
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,540
 It is crazy, though, because I remember the internet in 1998,

376
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,260
 which was pretty basic.

377
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,340
 So the idea that there would be a massive competition

378
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,300
 at that time seems ridiculous.

379
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,380
 I went to a judgeal bank, which is in Cheshire's

380
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,020
 big sort of, what is it, a big--

381
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,140
 They look for aliens, do you?

382
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,620
 Yeah, they telescope.

383
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,220
 Sorry.

384
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,500
 So it was in the '90s, and we didn't know

385
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,340
 one had the internet.

386
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,540
 We didn't have it in our school.

387
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,780
 So we all went there to kind of look at the internet.

388
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,660
 And I remember going in that.

389
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
 I know it's amazing.

390
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,460
 But I went in there and kind of searched

391
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,580
 for fancy football, which I was into at the time.

392
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,260
 And it kind of just picked up the word fantasy

393
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,780
 and gave me lots of things that as a young teenage boy,

394
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,180
 I'd never really seen before.

395
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,180
 Whoa.

396
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,420
 A judgeal bank?

397
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:18,940
 Yeah.

398
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,460
 That's what I want to consider in the rhyming slang

399
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,740
 that a judgeal bank is.

400
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,140
 Guys, we need to move on in a second.

401
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,980
 So we ought to, yeah.

402
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,420
 OK, I have one little thing about contest in Singapore.

403
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,340
 So in 2009, men's spot in Singapore

404
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,260
 was so bad that they couldn't find a sportsman of the year.

405
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260
 Oh, yeah.

406
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,660
 So 2008 was an Olympic year as well.

407
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,620
 The president of the Olympic Council said,

408
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,220
 unfortunately, it was a bad year.

409
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,940
 None of them really achieved anything not worth it.

410
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,420
 So I had a look at what they did in the Olympics.

411
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,900
 And the table tennis team went out in the group stage.

412
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,180
 None of the sailors made the top 20.

413
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,900
 They're only track half wheat went out in the first round.

414
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,260
 They're only shooter lost in the first round.

415
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,100
 They're only swimmer lost in the first round.

416
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,940
 And they're only male badminton player

417
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,460
 lost in the second round.

418
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,780
 So you think you might have won.

419
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,620
 Boy, he had a buy in the first round.

420
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,580
 [LAUGHTER]

421
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,060
 Time for fact number three.

422
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,460
 And that is Anich Zinski.

423
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,900
 My fact this week is that there is a network of fully furnished

424
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,180
 fake apartments in the UK, whose sole purpose

425
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,380
 is to get burgled.

426
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
 Wow.

427
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,940
 That's a name that is amazing.

428
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,620
 When you say a network, how many--

429
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,420
 I'm so bizarre that that's your first question.

430
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,100
 Who owns them?

431
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
 So they are owned by the government.

432
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,180
 So this is-- there are a lot to answer your question, apparently.

433
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,980
 That helps.

434
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,220
 They exist in every major city in the UK.

435
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,660
 There are a few of these.

436
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,940
 And I found this out in a new book.

437
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,220
 It's come out this year called A Burgler's Guide to the City.

438
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,580
 It's by Jeff Mannow.

439
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,740
 And it's so good.

440
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,060
 And yeah, there's this capture house program

441
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,420
 that the government runs, which is

442
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,180
 where you build a completely fake apartment that's totally

443
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,780
 kitted out with a lot of nice technology

444
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,500
 with some furniture that's often donated

445
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,900
 by the local police force, apparently, that they didn't want.

446
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,300
 And you build this apartment in a way

447
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,380
 that will hopefully lure burglarers to burglar it.

448
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,260
 And unbeknownst to them, they're all covered

449
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,900
 in this chemical agent, which can only be seen under UV light.

450
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,180
 So whenever the burglar is burglary,

451
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,140
 it touches a handle, or walks across the floor.

452
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,140
 Then he's covering himself in this chemical agent,

453
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,940
 which then needs a trace of where he's been,

454
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,380
 and also their full of cameras.

455
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,300
 So basically, they're there as traps

456
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,860
 so that burglar's come in and then the police follow

457
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,780
 immediately afterwards.

458
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,220
 And they're all over the place, and you wouldn't know

459
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,860
 if there was one in your apartment building.

460
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,100
 They're everywhere.

461
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,700
 So you wouldn't know if your home was one of these.

462
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,380
 If you've been burgled, maybe it is.

463
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,340
 I wanted to know how they lure burglarers to burglar them.

464
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,540
 Do they have people sort of ostentatiously

465
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,380
 carrying in, you know, really nice tellies and stuff?

466
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,420
 Saying, oh, I must get a second lock for this door

467
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,700
 one of these days.

468
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,860
 As soon as I get back from that long holiday,

469
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,180
 that's a guy.

470
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,500
 Thank god we got rid of the dog.

471
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,860
 Yeah, it's basically that.

472
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,020
 No, they're often targeting one specific burglar.

473
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
 So they'll be--

474
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,020
 Oh, of course.

475
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,860
 It's amazing.

476
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
 It's genuinely incredible.

477
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,580
 They target that particular burglar's motor operandi.

478
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,140
 So if he only robs first floor flats, for example,

479
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,540
 they'll try and make sure that one of the capture houses

480
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,500
 is a first floor flat, if they can.

481
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,340
 And then they walk around as I was shouting,

482
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,340
 "Marjorie, can you remind me to open all the windows?"

483
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,860
 It's so warm.

484
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,540
 And then they'll leave a window open, and they'll try and get them in.

485
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,780
 It's true, it's that police thing where you pick up so many clues

486
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,140
 from it, the way a burglar operates.

487
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,300
 And you really can't rig up a house or a flat

488
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,220
 so that it is going to attract that one burglar in the area.

489
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,140
 And one burglar can raise the crime rates of one area

490
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,020
 massively, because he and his gang, or she and her gang,

491
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,100
 will just be operating on lots of houses every day of the week.

492
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,300
 I was looking into-- so police having to fake things

493
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,900
 in order to get results.

494
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,420
 Confessions.

495
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,580
 Yes.

496
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,420
 So one of the things I write about is that

497
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,220
 bomb and drug-sniffing dogs, when they go around looking

498
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,420
 for any-- there are airports trying to sniff out the drugs

499
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,220
 and so on-- apparently, if they don't get a win,

500
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,500
 if they don't manage to smell out some drugs,

501
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,380
 they get quite depressed.

502
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,780
 Psychologically, sniffer dogs actually get depressed,

503
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,780
 that they don't have a sort of--

504
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,900
 they've done a good job.

505
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,500
 So what the police will do is they'll fake a situation.

506
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,180
 Yeah, yeah, honestly, where the dog can then sniff out some

507
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,580
 one and be like, oh, I need--

508
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,860
 they just get members of the public.

509
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,340
 They pay them to do it, and they bust out.

510
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,860
 They pay, that's what it's happening.

511
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,300
 I don't know if they pay them, but they've set up fake drug

512
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,500
 vests for dogs so that dogs can feel better.

513
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,100
 It's a great fact.

514
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,740
 So these guys always have to tell me

515
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,620
 what I've actually got a good fact.

516
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,620
 You've done very well.

517
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,460
 Have a biscuit.

518
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,380
 Do you want to hear about a couple of things, though?

519
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,300
 Do you want to hear about a couple of cool devices

520
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,220
 that you can get if you don't want to be birgled?

521
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,980
 Yes, please.

522
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,940
 Show a thing.

523
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
 A lock.

524
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,260
 A lock, yeah.

525
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,220
 So you can get a thing called fake TV, which is very cool.

526
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,860
 And it's this panel, which is just flashing LED lights.

527
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,020
 But from the outside, it looks exactly

528
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,060
 like someone's indoors and watching Telly.

529
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,660
 Why don't you just leave your TV on?

530
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,380
 Good point.

531
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,900
 Great.

532
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,220
 That's stuff there, business model.

533
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,620
 No, it's-- I think the idea is it uses a lot less energy

534
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,500
 than just leaving your Telly on all the time.

535
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,940
 Did someone watch Home Alone?

536
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,140
 Did you see the Christmas scene?

537
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,540
 That's a business model.

538
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,860
 That is a thing you can buy.

539
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,340
 It's called fake TV.

540
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,300
 And I've seen it.

541
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,540
 It looks right.

542
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,540
 I didn't burgle the house.

543
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
 And there's no thing you can get.

544
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,380
 You can get an anti-theft security smog jet machine.

545
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,700
 This is for things like banks and things like that.

546
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,340
 But if there's a break in, it just floods the entire room

547
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,660
 with smog.

548
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
 Wow.

549
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,620
 That's very cool.

550
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:06,460
 And the burglar goes in and goes, oh, I'm in the 19th century.

551
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,340
 Just on the subject, I was looking for fake things and police.

552
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,740
 And I just found a story that I'd rather like from last year.

553
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,700
 This is from Sutton, so not too far from here.

554
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,500
 And it's that in June of last year, police and Sutton

555
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,300
 turned up to a house because they'd

556
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,420
 had a tip off from the RSPCA.

557
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,860
 And they had a standoff over a snake, which

558
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,500
 was loose in someone's garden.

559
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,460
 And they had a reasonably long standoff

560
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,500
 until it was pointed out to them that it was a garden

561
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,020
 ornament snake.

562
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,940
 But they were standing really still, watching it.

563
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,780
 And it wasn't moving.

564
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,420
 And they weren't moving.

565
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,100
 And then a resident told them, it's not real.

566
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,540
 And I just love the quote.

567
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,980
 It was a neighbor who was called Gary Hollins, a 43-year-old

568
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,020
 who lived nearby.

569
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,300
 And he said, I could have told you it was a fake snake

570
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,740
 because the paint is peeling off it.

571
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,140
 Hey, snake shed that skin.

572
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,980
 True, good point.

573
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,820
 Oh, we need to move on to the final fact.

574
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,780
 OK, maybe we should do some hilarious burglary stories,

575
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,300
 shall we?

576
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,500
 So I went on the internet and looked

577
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,020
 for some burglar headlines from the last few months.

578
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,260
 So a burglar was caught after knocking

579
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,060
 over a tent of white paint during a break in

580
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,860
 and leaving footsteps, leading all the way to his door.

581
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,580
 Oh, man.

582
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,380
 There was another one who was caught by police

583
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,860
 after having a bite out of a cucumber

584
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,060
 and leaving his DNA inside the cucumber.

585
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
 Wow.

586
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,100
 There was a post office burglar who was caught

587
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,900
 after he tried to buy a car with 1,000 pounds in 1 pound coins.

588
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:44,620
 And there was a Kentucky burglar who was arrested after accidentally

589
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,260
 dialing his phone 9-1-1 while he was talking

590
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,460
 to whether it's complex about the burglary

591
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,140
 that he was just about to do.

592
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,100
 Oh, my God.

593
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,940
 What?

594
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,980
 And they just overheard him saying what he was going to do

595
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,820
 and then they caught him.

596
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,340
 Wow.

597
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,620
 Do you remember there was that story about there was a couple

598
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,580
 who were downstairs and they'd ride back home

599
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,820
 and some two people were in their house robbing the house.

600
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,660
 Sorry, no, it was one person.

601
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,860
 One person was in the house.

602
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,460
 So he quickly ran upstairs and hid

603
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,580
 and was trying to plan his escape route.

604
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,380
 And according to this story, the burglar is upstairs

605
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,540
 and he's just sitting there kind of going, OK, what do I do?

606
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,420
 They're downstairs.

607
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,860
 And one of the couple says, oh, I heard a hilarious joke today.

608
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,540
 Told the joke.

609
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,860
 They live with a punchline, the recipient just in laugh.

610
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,220
 And then they just heard this.

611
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,140
 And the burglar couldn't help but go,

612
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,340
 I wonder what happens if that knock-knock joke.

613
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,140
 This is himself.

614
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,940
 And then they bust it, but they call it the cops.

615
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,500
 You know what I'm saying?

616
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,540
 That's the truth, sir.

617
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,020
 We need to move on to the final fact.

618
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,500
 OK.

619
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,260
 OK, it's time for a final fact of the show.

620
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,340
 And that is James Harkin.

621
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,300
 I don't think he did.

622
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,700
 James has done this.

623
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,300
 It's my first time.

624
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
 Oh, sorry.

625
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,060
 Sorry.

626
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

627
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,340
 And that is Additch.

628
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,860
 OK.

629
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,980
 Final fact of the show.

630
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,220
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

631
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,660
 Thank you, Dan.

632
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,900
 [LAUGHTER]

633
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,780
 My fact is that the world's biggest skywriting firm

634
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,700
 recently turned down a request to draw

635
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,380
 the largest ever penis in the sky.

636
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,700
 That was worth wasting for.

637
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,780
 [LAUGHTER]

638
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,500
 So skywriting, we all know, is where planes loop the loop.

639
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,820
 And they release smoke in various patterns

640
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,660
 to make letters or shapes or whatever it is.

641
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,380
 And the really cool thing is there are only

642
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,580
 five full-time skywriters on the planet.

643
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,140
 Only five people who make a full-time living.

644
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,540
 A lot of sort of freelance people at part-time

645
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,740
 has amazing article on the website Quartz about this,

646
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,260
 because there's a family firm of people who do it.

647
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,020
 And they have various rules.

648
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,540
 So they turn down swear words.

649
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,020
 They won't write really rude things in this guy.

650
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,420
 And they've also turned down someone

651
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,580
 who wanted to get the largest ever penis drawn in this guy.

652
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,980
 But they did earlier this year, right over California,

653
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,500
 the words Trump is disgusting.

654
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 [LAUGHTER]

655
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,820
 But they're now regress it.

656
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,140
 And they say they wish they hadn't taken it,

657
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,340
 because they want to be able to take it.

658
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,180
 So by writing the word Trump, they did kind of

659
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,780
 have the world's biggest penis in this guy.

660
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,900
 [LAUGHTER]

661
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,420
 Yeah, so the other cool thing is there are two--

662
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:15,940
 I didn't know.

663
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,220
 There are two main ways of making letters in this guy.

664
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
 You can either do it with one plane, which

665
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,460
 is where you have-- and you have a sort of smoke jet,

666
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,660
 basically, it's an adapted exhaust out of the back of the plane.

667
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,820
 And you can either have one plane, but it takes ages.

668
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,780
 And you can only write about 12 letters maximum.

669
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,180
 And it takes a couple of minutes to write a single letter.

670
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,980
 Because letters are huge.

671
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,180
 Each of the letters is as tall as the Empire State Building.

672
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,900
 Whoa!

673
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,860
 Yeah, they're massive.

674
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,780
 And a single message is at least five miles long in the sky.

675
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,060
 This is very exciting, because there's now

676
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,740
 a new thing you can do called sky typing, which

677
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,580
 is where you have five planes next to each other,

678
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,140
 and they're all flying in formation.

679
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,260
 And they have a computer-controlled system, which

680
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,020
 releases puffs of smoke at exactly the right moment.

681
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,420
 So they're all writing either on or off in the sky,

682
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,460
 and that produces--

683
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,220
 Like a name jet printer, kind of thing.

684
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,540
 Like a name jet printer, yeah, yeah.

685
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,500
 And it slowly produces the word like that as they fly across.

686
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,460
 So you can do longer messages now using sky typing.

687
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,500
 But that's the old new divide in sky writing.

688
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,060
 That's amazing.

689
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,020
 I really-- my favorite one was from a few years ago,

690
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,340
 and it was just suddenly appeared in the air.

691
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,300
 How do I land?

692
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,340
 And it was a comedian who did that.

693
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,220
 It was a Kickstarter.

694
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,580
 He decided he just-- he wanted to help sky writing come back.

695
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,540
 He thought it'd be a great place to put a joke up.

696
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,420
 And so he did a Kickstarter, and they raised $4,000 American dollars.

697
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,020
 That's how much it cost to have something like how do I land?

698
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,860
 Question mark.

699
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,180
 Do you know that actually it was a really windy day?

700
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,260
 And so they did the H. And then by the time they'd done the O,

701
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,420
 the H had already gone.

702
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,420
 Oh!

703
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,100
 But W, the H and the O had already gone.

704
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,460
 And he said, if you watch the sky for 20 minutes,

705
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,780
 you could probably piece it together.

706
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,620
 Oh!

707
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,180
 This is a guy called-- he was a comedian called Kurt Bronola.

708
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,180
 Yeah, he still is a comedian called Kurt Bronola.

709
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,340
 And he's just so people know who he is.

710
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,660
 Kristen Scholl, Kristen Scholl, sorry,

711
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,140
 who is in Flight the Concords, and so on.

712
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
 It's her comedy partner.

713
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,860
 So he's very big in the sense.

714
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,220
 But when he did this, unless you really,

715
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,020
 you really watched and saw each letter go.

716
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,780
 You couldn't really tell what was happening.

717
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,500
 So what he did was he took a photo of each letter

718
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,140
 before it blew away.

719
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,940
 And then he put them all together in a composite photo

720
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,020
 and then put it online saying, this is what it would have looked like.

721
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,540
 I know.

722
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,460
 I thought he could have just photoshopped the whole thing.

723
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,660
 It would have been--

724
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,660
 Yeah.

725
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,500
 I really like-- so back in the sort of '60s,

726
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,220
 it was used.

727
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,980
 There was so many plans at sky writing

728
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,060
 was going to be the main way that you would advertise your company.

729
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,740
 I think you're right.

730
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,660
 And pretty much it was when TV came in.

731
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,620
 And suddenly we could get advertising to everyone's homes immediately.

732
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,620
 And that was when sky writing's like, oh, we don't really need this anymore.

733
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,580
 And it didn't need to be a cloudless, sunny day for advertising

734
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,100
 to reach your home, which it did.

735
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,380
 But there was a lot of alarmism about sky writing

736
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,980
 in the early days of it, that it was just going to be this--

737
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,780
 like all new technologies, it was going to be this awful thing.

738
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,860
 So I was looking in the newspaper archives

739
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,740
 and people were writing things about it in 1932.

740
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,020
 There was a debate in the House of Commons as to whether we should allow advertisers

741
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,780
 free use of the sky to do this sky writing.

742
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,700
 And those MPs are against it, said it was a desecration of the sky.

743
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,700
 So monstrous, it should be completely prohibited.

744
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,340
 And it was decided the inventor would promise not to do it in their cathedrals

745
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,700
 or monuments and would agree not to vulgarize the sky.

746
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,060
 But people thought it was going to ruin it.

747
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,340
 People thought it would just spiral out of control.

748
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,380
 And the entire sky would be occupied by constant adverts.

749
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,700
 Well, they kept saying, yeah, New York, they were worried that people living

750
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,980
 high-rise buildings would be pummeled by the smoke that was coming down.

751
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,420
 So they were recommending close your windows so that you don't die effectively,

752
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,500
 which was not true at all.

753
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,100
 But-- and it was a sloppy business as well.

754
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,140
 1961, I read this amazing report where someone went up, did the message,

755
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,460
 came back down, looked up, saw that they did it wrong.

756
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,300
 It was because it was very hard to do, made a mistake, went back up,

757
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,820
 put a cross through it, and re-did the whole thing again.

758
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,420
 Do you know what the first ever sky writing message said?

759
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,940
 No.

760
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,020
 It said daily mail.

761
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,940
 It was an advert for the daily mail.

762
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,620
 It was in 1922.

763
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,300
 And it was invented.

764
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,660
 Skywriting was invented by this guy called John Savage.

765
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,020
 He was a pilot and the war was over and he sort of started experimenting.

766
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,060
 So this is cool.

767
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,180
 He had been an agent to a chap called BC Hux, who was the first Englishman

768
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,100
 to do a loop, the loop, in a plane.

769
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,620
 Oh, wow.

770
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,340
 What?

771
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,620
 Yeah, he had a flying agent, apparently.

772
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,100
 And then, so after he'd experimented with this daily mail advert,

773
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,220
 he went to the USA and he wrote in the sky above New York, Hello USA.

774
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,660
 But no explanation.

775
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,620
 Nothing.

776
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,580
 Then the next day, he sent someone else back up another pilot.

777
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,500
 And the message he wrote in the sky was call Vanderbilt 7100,

778
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,420
 which is the hotel he was staying at.

779
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,060
 As soon as people saw that, they started phoning the hotel by the hundreds,

780
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,580
 saying, I must buy this as an advert.

781
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
 That was his only advertising method.

782
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,420
 I think he was proving the effectiveness, wasn't he?

783
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,060
 So I think 47,000 people called within three hours.

784
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,340
 And it was sort of the effectiveness of this advertising that they all called.

785
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
 Yeah.

786
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,420
 But someone, I liked this in 1961.

787
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,420
 There was a guy who was in one of the very few people who was employed as a skywriter.

788
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,420
 And he had hated his math teacher at school, he said.

789
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,540
 And so he did the sky writing with the advertisement that he'd been employed to write in the sky.

790
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,940
 And then he had some spare ink in his tank.

791
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:53,380
 And so at the end of his working day, he screwed 4 plus 1 equals 6 in the sky

792
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,580
 as revenge against his high school nurse teacher.

793
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
 Is that nice?

794
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,660
 That's amazing.

795
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,260
 How is that revenge?

796
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,100
 But yeah, it relies on a lot of things.

797
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,420
 The master teacher is seeing it.

798
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,100
 The master is knowing it's him.

799
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,220
 The master teacher giving a shit about him anyway.

800
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,940
 Also, it's not a revenge to still be enumerous.

801
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:17,460
 I'll show my English teacher by unlearning reading.

802
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,260
 I was reading a few years ago, and I can't read out the whole passage,

803
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,820
 but it's really worth reading this person's account about how, when in, I think it's around 2008,

804
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:31,900
 they were doing a, someone hired a skywriting team to write peace now across the sky.

805
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,940
 So there was a protest going because Obama was doing some sort of talk, and they just wanted to say,

806
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,380
 we want peace, no more war, all that sort of stuff.

807
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,100
 So the big problem that the pilot had is that they misjudged the size of the word.

808
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,540
 And as they were finishing up the words, they were heading directly into territory

809
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,940
 that the military said, this is not an aerospace you're allowed into,

810
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,780
 because we have the president down there, and you will be shot down.

811
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
 That's amazing.

812
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,500
 Yeah, someone in the plane going, we need to turn around.

813
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,740
 We need to turn around. They're going, I need to get there so I can make the turn up

814
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,260
 to finish the W on the now.

815
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,140
 So in the end of the read, peace, no.

816
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,060
 We even need to wrap up really soon.

817
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,100
 Can I quickly tell you about a chap in Melbourne, this was a couple of years ago.

818
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,980
 He wrote, he proposed his girlfriend in the sky with skywriting.

819
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:21,140
 He wrote Marie, that was her name, Marry Me, across the sky, and she said, no, when she saw it.

820
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,140
 No.

821
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,980
 She also sent the plane up to say, no.

822
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,860
 He said, because they'd been together for years and years, and then they'd broken up,

823
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,500
 and then they were getting back together, and they were thinking, I think this will clinch it.

824
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,940
 And he said, at least I know I've tried my best.

825
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,460
 Do you know that's so weird, because there's another guy in Melbourne recently who got

826
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,980
 involved in skywriting, because he had a girlfriend called Prue,

827
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:52,140
 and he wanted to send her a Valentine's Day message in the sky saying, happy Valentine's Day Prue,

828
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,420
 but couldn't afford it.

829
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:58,820
 So he started a kickstarter for everyone else who had a girlfriend called Prue in the world,

830
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,940
 and said, if you all contribute to this, then we'll put the message, happy Valentine's Day Prue,

831
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,940
 love me, so no one knows which one it was.

832
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,060
 Oh, there was a guy who wrote, sorry, in the sky above, I was an American city,

833
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:16,340
 and no one knows who it was, but I imagine a lot of people will have been using that.

834
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,940
 That's for me to do, and I am sorry.

835
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,820
 Boris Johnson's already got a second round of the game.

836
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,300
 OK, OK, that's it, that's all of our facts.

837
