00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:23,480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Coventry!

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,680
 [APPLAUSE]

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:42,920
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Annotzzynski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin, and once again someone is still clapping.

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,960
 What is going on there?

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:53,000
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Starting this week with my fact, my fact this week is that in the annual Lady Godiva parade, which famously celebrates a lady who rode naked through Coventry, not only does the rider always wear clothes, but one year even the horse wore trousers.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 [LAUGHTER]

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It's the trousered horse.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 How did the horse wear the trousers? Did it wear them over its back end, or did it wear them on all four legs?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 It had all four legs.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 There's a photo, you can see it.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So it actually wore two pairs of trousers?

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Yeah, it wore two pairs of trousers.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Yeah, that's true.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 That's amazing, and it was in the early 20th century, right?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 It was 1919.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It was a Lady Godiva parade, and amazingly these beautiful photos that you can see of the event.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 They are. I think she was an actress called Gladys Mann, which is ironic because she's a woman, and she...

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Actually, wasn't it true that the first Lady Godiva's who did these things were all men?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Why didn't I?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I think they were. Yeah, the first one was we know he was the son of James Swinnerton.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Don't know what his name was.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Wow. Do you know what it was?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 What an irritating thing to be called, going through life.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Hello, I'm the son of James Swinnerton.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Do you have a name?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Yes, that's my name.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 He was paid 15 shillings to do that.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But it's been kind of sporadic, hasn't it, that Lady Godiva parades throughout history,

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 and they've been variously banned and then dropped, and they've come back.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 In the 19th century, I think they really caught on them.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 People were parading through the streets, and in the 1840s, they really became a big thing again,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 and there'd be someone cast as Lady Godiva every time.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And at first, it would be someone who was made to appear like she was naked.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 In 1842, there was an actress or a performer who was wearing a tight-fitting, flesh-colored dress,

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 like a kind of a onesie, but to make it look like she's naked.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And then people were outraged. They were all these complaints.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And I was looking in the British newspaper archive, and they were saying it's depraved, you know,

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 it's encouraged the profligate youth of Coventry to gratify a depraved taste.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Only profligate youth of Coventry in tonight?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 They referred to her as a brazen harlot, the poor poor woman who dressed in a onesie on horseback.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I read someone referred to, it was a bishop of Worcester, who referred to her as a Birmingham whore

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 being paraded through the streets.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And it seemed like he was more bothered that she was from Birmingham than anything.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 We should very quickly say who Lady Godiva was or wasn't.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 So the idea is just for anyone listening overseas, she was a noble woman,

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 and in protest against her husband raising taxes, she rode through the streets of Coventry,

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 naked, except for her very long hair, which she had woven into a kind of hair bikini.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 No, that's not true.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 [LAUGHTER]

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 So that's the idea, and that she was trying to persuade him to lower the taxes.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Well, we don't think it happened.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 No.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 It's probably a myth. It was in the 11th century, but I think the first reference to it was about 200 years later.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 But it's a myth that's, you know, very much still celebrated.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 In the Olympics, there was a 20-foot tall Lady Godiva built.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And it traveled on a purpose built 50-seat bicycle.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Because it was transported down to London.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Wow.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And then back again, it briefly got stuck going around the ring road on a tight bend.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 [LAUGHTER]

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And the woman who ran the company said that Lady Godiva had suffered a little bit of whiplash from tree branches

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 and suffered rain damage and some scratches.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And she added, she looked like she'd had the best night out.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 [LAUGHTER]

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 The other thing about it being a myth is that basically it was against taxes.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 But people have looked back at what Coventry was like back then.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And probably the people who were here weren't really bothered about taxes.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 One person said that in those days, Coventry was just an inconsequential group of surfs living in single-story hovels.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Whereas Coventry now has two-story buildings, I think.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Very bold.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I know.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So brave.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I literally was about to pack my stuff up and go, OK, that's the evening over.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So you were saying about the skin type clothing being seen as a bit of a disgrace.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I read a story that it caused a lot of chaos because people thought that she was naked.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Therefore, everyone who came to see the parade suddenly really wanted to get close to see the parade.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And riots sort of broke out and people fought each other because they thought there was a naked person on the horse.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Yeah.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 That was one of the reasons I think it was considered so immoral in Victorian era.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Yeah, because these riots started.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Everyone got really pissed and they stared at this maybe naked woman.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And then they all got really drunk and descended into debauchery at night, apparently.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Wow.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And every year they'd be like, this year she's definitely going to be naked as she never was.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 You heard of a pruporetta?

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 No.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Is that only heard of pruporetta?

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Yeah.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 So for 25 years in a row, she was the same Lady Godiva.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 She was the Lady Godiva more than the original Lady Godiva who only did it once.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Pruporetta did it 25 times.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Or even no times.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Lady Godiva didn't even do it.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Pruporetta is the real Lady Godiva.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And she got an MBE for her troubles.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Yeah.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 She's only recently retired from the game.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 What did they pin it to?

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I guess that there might be quite a lot of Godiva businesses in Coventry.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 So I checked on the internet and I was not disappointed.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 There is Godiva fire extinguishers.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Godiva granite.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Godiva insurance.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Godiva windows.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Godiva fish shop.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Godiva dentists.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Animal care.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Chiropractors.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Glass wines.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Hypnotherapy.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Plumbing.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Fencing.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Cafe.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Barbers.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Carpets.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And Godiva tailoring.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Wow.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Which I love.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It's somebody who has no clothes.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I think it's brilliant.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Yeah.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Let's get your clothes off to get those measurements.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 You're done.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I also think a very clever thing.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I don't know if Godiva windows has done this.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 But what I would have done is the whole point of Godiva was that all the people who lived in Coventry

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 had to go inside and not look at her, right?

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And the story of peeping Tom comes from the Lady Godiva story because he snuck out

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 and did try to catch a glimpse and then he was blinded.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And so, if you were making Godiva windows, you should actually make opaque windows.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And I don't know if they do that as a business.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I don't know if that would be particularly fruitful, but that's what I would do.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 So, like doors, basically.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 (Laughter)

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Those door windows.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I mean, that's what they call doors in Coventry.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I did a little bit on naked protests.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Oh, okay.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 So, because people keep on protesting as Lady Godiva.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 So, this May in Gloucester, a woman called Anna Dart, rode a horse dressed only in body paint.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 She was dressed in body paint.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Not the horse.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 The horse didn't even bother wearing body paint, disgusting.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 To protest against Gloucestershire County Council's planned new incinerator.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 (Laughter)

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 In 2011, a man dressed as Lady Godiva and he rode through the Lancashire village of Holtan

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 to protest against new Haitian to M6 Link Road.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And, my favourite one, in 2006, a dozen people in a Canadian town,

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 it's called Lida, in Saskatchewan.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 They posed naked in potholes on a local highway

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 and then made a calendar, a nude calendar of themselves,

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 in these potholes to spread the message that they wanted the council to fix the potholes.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 (Laughter)

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And the local organizer, the organizer, the guy behind it,

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 said that most of the people in the calendar were very reluctant,

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 but he did add there was one guy, we couldn't get him to keep his clothes on.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 (Laughter)

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And the Guardian reported that just four years later, the highway was repaired.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 (Laughter)

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 So, it absolutely works like a charm.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I read a thing about in France, there's a small town that has been having a problem with their naked hero,

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 which is Heracles, and basically they have a statue of him naked,

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 but the town seems to have a lot of cheeky vandals who keep chiseling the penis off of the naked god.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And so, what they did was they kept replacing it,

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 and then they'd come back a few days later or whatever,

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 someone again, cheeky chiseler comes along and takes away the penis,

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 and they were like, we don't know what to do.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So, what they ended up doing, because it was a very important spot where they do a lot of ceremonies,

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 they made a sort of extra special penis that they then, whenever they do a ceremony,

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 just before the ceremony starts, they come up to it, put the penis on,

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 and they're like, there's going to be a ceremony today, and they guard it,

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 and then they do the ceremony, and once whatever the ribbons been cut or whatever,

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 they go, thank you all good night, and then they take the penis off again,

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and bring it back to the office.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 So, it's a ceremonial penis that is constantly attached for important days.

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Did you say that was in France?

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Yeah, it was. It was a town called Arcacheon.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Sure.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Just because I just have just a coincidence about France and Germany,

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and that is that the pioneers of the natureist movements in France were called Albert and Christine LeCoc,

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 and one of the leading lights of German natureism was called Adolf Coc.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 No way!

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And they're both basically the most important natureists in France and Germany,

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 a called Coc and LeCoc.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Wow.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 That's great.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Do you know how she's speaking of Adolfs?

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Ah, we've reached the Hitler point in the show, ladies and gentlemen.

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I'm trying to get it into every live show of our tour.

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Hitler banned nudism, and then immediately reintroduced it.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So, it was quite a big thing in Germany in the early 20th century,

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 and the Nazis still, it wasn't very good, and so they banned it in 1933,

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 and then they shut down all the nudist clubs across Germany.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And then in 1934, they immediately changed their mind,

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 and allowed people to just attend Nazi-approved nudist clubs.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 So, even he's softened on that one thing.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 What?

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Yeah, I think it's a bit late to reclaim the reputation, Emma.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Okay, why don't we move on to our second fact of the night,

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 and that is James Harkin.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the worst basketball coach

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 in the history of the University of Kansas

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 is James Naesmith, the man who invented basketball.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It's amazing.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 He is the only coach of that university who has a losing record.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Every single other person was a winner, and he invented the game.

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Yeah.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 But he was just learning how to do it.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 But so was everyone.

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Yeah, it's free.

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 He was against coaching, wasn't he?

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Which partly explains it.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So one of his students went on to be one of the greatest basketball coaches ever.

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Someone called Fog Allen.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And when he told his tutor, Naesmith, who invented basketball,

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 that he was going to try and coach it,

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Naesmith just said, "You cannot coach basketball, you just play it."

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And so, yeah, he didn't believe in it.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It was a slightly different game in those days.

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 There was nine against nine, and they used a football, a soccer ball,

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 instead of a basketball, because they haven't been invented yet.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And dribbling wasn't allowed.

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 So he's a bit more like netball, actually.

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And there was no hole in the bottom of the basket, was there?

227
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Yeah.

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 They just put a load of peach baskets up there,

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 and they put it through it in, and then he had to climb up and get it out,

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 and then play again.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Yeah.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And he thought, Naesmith thought the introduction of the hole in the basket was a grave error.

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 He thought that was a mistake.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Yeah.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Can you imagine Michael Jordan getting a ladder every time he gets a fight?

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 The first ever game of basketball ended in a massive brawl.

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 In fact, I had a brawl after about five minutes.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So he invented it because he was teaching school boys,

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 and his class were really badly behaved, they were very naughty,

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 and the weather was bad, so they couldn't go outside and let off steam.

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 So he invented the game, and he just gave them one rule.

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So the only rule is to get the ball in the basket,

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 and immediately they started a fight with each other.

244
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 He said they started tackling kicking and punching,

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 and before he managed to intercede, several had black eyes,

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 one had dislocated his shoulder, and another had literally been knocked out.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Oh, my God.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So in America at the moment, there's quite a lot of controversy with basketball in schools,

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 and the reason for that is coaches keep getting fired for their teams winning by so much.

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Really?

251
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So they have this thing in American sports,

252
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 where once you're winning by a certain amount, you should really stop trying,

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 and you shouldn't keep what they call it as running up the score.

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So there was a guy who won 100 nil recently, who was the head of his team, he got fired.

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 There was someone who won 161-2, and they got fired as well.

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And is the idea that you're not teaching them to be good sportsmen basically?

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Exactly, yeah.

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I love it.

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I really like that.

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Yeah.

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I can see who was shit at Spartan school.

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 You know, we think of basketball as an American sport predominantly,

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 but there's so many countries around the world that play it.

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 In a very big way, and the one that surprised me most when I was looking into this is Bhutan.

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 The royal family of Bhutan are obsessed with basketball,

266
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 and I read an article where the current queen of Bhutan,

267
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 they followed a match that she played.

268
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 So she's in a team, and when she comes to the match,

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 when she comes out through the locker rooms to the main court,

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 they roll out a red carpet.

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Yeah, and they have a like a thrown-like thing there.

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Did they have to roll out the red carpet all over the court as she moves around?

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Yes, they got to stay in front of her.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Just peddling it out.

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Yeah.

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 No, and so she played a match.

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 This is the match they observed, and she scored 34 points in that match.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Three rebounds and four assists.

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 If you know the scoring system of basketball, that's incredibly high.

280
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And so they were like, either she's incredibly amazing at basketball,

281
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 or it may have something to do with the fact that Bhutan is custom for Bid's citizens

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 from touching the royals without any invitation.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Therefore, any time she's got the ball, people have to be like, "Oh, no!"

284
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 But isn't basketball a non-contact spot?

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I mean, you're hitting it.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Technically it is, but it's a very aggressive sport,

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 and there's a lot of blocking, and there's a lot of stuff like that.

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And there's a quote from someone who they interviewed afterwards saying,

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 "You know, the queen's really good, and how did you find it?"

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Because the one person they interviewed actually fouled the queen,

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 which goes against the rules of the country.

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And yet, as she said, I fouled the queen once.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I was a little scared, but she said it was okay.

294
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And she said, "She wants us to check her, and she gets mad if we don't.

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 She thinks we're scared of her. We are very scared of her."

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But do you know that that's not the Bhutanese royal family's favourite sport?

297
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Actually, their favourite sport is darts.

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Is it?

299
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Yeah, because in Bhutan, darts is like the national sport,

300
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 but they are massive darts.

301
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 They're about, "You hold them in your hand like this."

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 I mean, not great for a podcast.

303
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 But you hold them with your full palm, and then you launch them,

304
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 and it's about the same distance as this stage,

305
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 and you throw it from one side to the other,

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 and they have an archery target that you have to throw it into.

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And one team stands next to the target and tries to insult the other guys before you throw it.

308
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Why don't you do that?

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 I don't do that at all.

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I know. It's unbelievably dangerous.

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 They encourage things to them to encourage them to keep on aim.

312
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Yeah, but then you want to win as well, right?

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Yeah, I can think of a way of winning.

314
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Kill the other guys with your darts. What are they going to do?

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 At worst, that's a foul, you know.

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Do you guys remember the film Space Jam?

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Yeah, Michael Jordan.

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny.

319
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 It's a Looney Tunes film with some humans in, like Who Frame Roger Rabbit.

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Last year, there was a journalist called Jalen Cook

321
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 who analysed the Space Jam film through actual NBA rules,

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 and it's just a very funny write-up.

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So he said, "One minute 31.

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Silvestre the Cat tries to swallow Tweety Bird, his own teammate, Hall."

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 There is nothing in the NBA rulebook that explicitly says,

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 "You can't eat your teammate's while a game is in progress."

327
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 One minute 50.

328
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Foghorn Leghorn is incinerated by Barry.

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 That is easily a flagrant two-fowl.

330
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 It is also attempted murder.

331
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 You know, it's that Michael Jordan was in that film, obviously,

332
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 and is, people say, the greatest possible playable time.

333
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 But he's also a great leader in basketball fashion,

334
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 because if you watch basketball now, they've all got these really baggy shorts on,

335
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 and that's because of him.

336
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 So until he played, then everyone wore tight shorts,

337
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 and then he thought that it was good luck for him to wear his old uni,

338
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 his old college shorts underneath his basketball shorts.

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 So he never played a single game without wearing two pairs of shorts.

340
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And I imagine boxes, which I count as shorts,

341
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 so three pairs of shorts, Michael Jordan's always wearing.

342
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And that meant that the NBA had to make his shorts baggy,

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 so they could fit these, you know, two other pairs of shorts underneath it.

344
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Yeah, I am wearing three pairs of pants now.

345
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Yeah, two right. Otherwise.

346
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Otherwise, people aren't safe.

347
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 I was reading about someone else called Jason Terry,

348
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 who is an NBA player,

349
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 and he's a lot of superstition in sport, obviously,

350
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 and Jason Terry plays at the moment,

351
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 but he has to sleep in his opponent's shorts the night before a match.

352
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Well, while the opponent's wearing them are...

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Well, they need to be shorts from the opposing team that have been played in.

354
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 And so apparently, he has contacts throughout the NBA,

355
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 so he can email them and be like,

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 "Sorry, could you send me your shorts, you know my thing?"

357
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And he has shorts from all the opposing teams,

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 so he can sleep in them before the match.

359
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I'd like to clarify, I'm not wearing anyone else's pants right now.

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Is it kind of so that once he's been in their shorts,

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 he knows how to beat them?

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I don't know. Let's not talk about beating in someone else's shorts.

363
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I don't know.

364
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 He didn't justify it.

365
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Just quickly, a weird thing that I saw in Canada this year,

366
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 a basketball player finally got the right to use his surname on his jersey,

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 which has been very contentious. He's from Brazil.

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 He got transferred over, and there's been huge problems with it.

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And yeah, he's been in the news for it as a result.

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 The quote he said is, "It's my last name, I'm proud of it.

371
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 It doesn't matter if it means something bad."

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 He says it's pronounced Fouquet,

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 and that's how he's trying to get...

374
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I mean, maybe it definitely probably is, right?

375
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I think he knows his name, but he was censored for ages,

376
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 so he wasn't allowed to wear a jersey.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And finally, because the team's doing well, they're like,

378
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 "Okay, you can have it."

379
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 So now that's going back and forth on a basketball court.

380
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Wow. Yeah.

381
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It just reminds me just slightly off topic,

382
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 but there is a college footballer who will probably go into NFL soon

383
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 in America whose name is Lion King.

384
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Oh, that's so cool.

385
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Imagine if you're Mr. and Mrs. King.

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Yeah. What should we call our son, Mufasa?

387
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 We should move on to our dayx factor, right?

388
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

389
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 My factor is that blowing out the candles on a birthday cake

390
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 increases the number of bacteria on it by 1,400%.

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Yeah.

392
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Next time you have a birthday, think about this.

393
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 So there were a lot of scientists who wanted to test that, you know,

394
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 what happens when you breathe out,

395
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 and whether, as they said, bio-era souls in human breath

396
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 expelled from the mouth may be a source of bacteria.

397
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So they simulated a birthday party among themselves,

398
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 which I would kill to have been at.

399
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 They ate some pizza to get their salivary glands going,

400
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 and then they had a cake set up and they blew all over it,

401
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 blowing the candles out.

402
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And that's just the average was 1,400%.

403
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 So that's not the worst.

404
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 In one case, someone breathing out and blowing out all the candles

405
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 increased the bacteria on the cake by 12,000%.

406
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Wow. 120 times as much.

407
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I mean, how is that guy blowing?

408
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Yeah.

409
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But then we don't think that this is that dangerous, do we?

410
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 No, we don't.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Yeah.

412
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Well, just because basically these are bacteria probably

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 that unless someone's got the plague or something,

414
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 or someone's really ill, these are just bacteria

415
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 that we all have that kind of, you know,

416
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 just because there's more bacteria on something

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 doesn't necessarily mean it's more dangerous.

418
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And a lot of the scientists who were told about this said,

419
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 actually, you know, the fact that you're reaching a lot of cake

420
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 is a lot more important than the fact it's the bacteria.

421
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Right.

422
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Yeah, like obesity is obviously more of a problem

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 than just the odd little bacterium.

424
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Yeah.

425
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 But there is a solution to it, which there's a lady in America

426
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 who's selling this now.

427
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And she was at her aunt's 100th birthday.

428
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And as a result, when they were blowing out candles.

429
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 A lot of candles.

430
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 A lot of candles.

431
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And as a result of the lot of candles,

432
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 they had three generations of family members blow out the candles.

433
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And so she was stood watching it.

434
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 She just saw a sort of tidal wave of spit just come over the cake.

435
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And thought, oh, that's, I'll have the piece of that.

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And then later thought, I need to solve what this thing is.

437
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And so what you can buy in America now is a sort of,

438
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 before you blow out the candles,

439
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 it's like a cake plastic sheet that you put over your cake.

440
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Yeah.

441
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 So what you do is you place that over the cake,

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 you blow out the candles, and then you take that off.

443
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 But it's see through.

444
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 So you can see your cake underneath it.

445
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 So it stops all the bacteria from going on it.

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 That is, I know people say health and safety gone mad.

447
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And they're annoying.

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 But I find that that is health and safety gone mad.

449
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It's not dangerous.

450
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 I mean, so it's something like 12% of bacteria

451
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 are related to being harmful at all to us, isn't it?

452
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And a lot of bacteria are good.

453
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 You have, in the average hair brush,

454
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 you have 3,500 bacteria colonies per square inch.

455
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So different colonies of different types of bacteria.

456
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 One hair follicle contains 50,000 individual bacteria.

457
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Wow.

458
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But they're mainly fine.

459
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 They are fine.

460
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 The important thing to remember is the bacteria are basically fine.

461
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 So there were loads of headlines this year saying,

462
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 "Beards are full of fecal bacteria."

463
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 So 20 beard owners in the room,

464
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 the kinds of bacteria they're finding are absolutely not harmful.

465
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 They're the kind of bacteria that might be found in the gut,

466
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 but they might also not be found in the gut.

467
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And also, everything is covered in fecal bacteria.

468
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 There's one message you take away from tonight.

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 That's true, actually.

470
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 I read that study about tooth brushes.

471
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Do you know when they say,

472
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 don't keep your tooth brush in the bathroom

473
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 because you might get that fecal bacteria stuff on it?

474
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Well, it turns out that the fecal bacteria is everywhere anyway.

475
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 It's all over the back.

476
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 You can keep your tooth brush in the toilet if you use those truths.

477
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 That's the other thing.

478
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 It always says there is more bacteria here than in your toilet,

479
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 like on your chopping board or something like that.

480
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 But you don't use bleach on your chopping board, do you?

481
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And you use bleach on your toilet.

482
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 So you're basically killing all the bacteria all the time.

483
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 But a lot of people use bleach on their bum.

484
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And so probably it's removed bacteria before it's just...

485
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 What?

486
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Sorry.

487
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

488
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Who has ever put bleach on their bum?

489
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Oh, this guy's hugged him, no.

490
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 What are you talking about?

491
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 I thought that was a thing.

492
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 It's an only way as Essex thing, isn't it?

493
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Yeah, I thought...

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Oh, that's completely different then to just having a...

495
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 There's not why there's a bottle by the Lou, you know that?

496
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Oh, wait.

497
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I mean, bleach is very toxic.

498
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Don't do that.

499
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 It's not a Louro replacement thing.

500
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 No.

501
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 I'll stop, Jesus.

502
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Actually, if you're going to take anything away from tonight's show,

503
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 that's the thing you need to do.

504
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 James told me a fact ages ago.

505
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 It was probably my favourite fact of all time.

506
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 We're talking about bacteria in the gut.

507
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Apparently, bacteria inside your gut are farting all the time.

508
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 They lit out little, little farts, tiny little farts.

509
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And when you, I'm talking about everyone listening

510
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 and everyone here in the room.

511
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 When you fart, you're not farting.

512
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 All you've done is collected a huge batch of bacteria fart

513
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 and you've just released it in one massive go.

514
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Isn't that insane?

515
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Isn't that nuts?

516
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 That's like that, you know the scene in the Death Star

517
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 when they're about to shoot and kill a planet

518
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 and it's all those lasers going, "Brrrr."

519
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 That's that inside you.

520
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 What are you talking about?

521
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And there you go.

522
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And you let out.

523
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 What?

524
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 It's true.

525
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 What?

526
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 James told me.

527
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Don't applaud that.

528
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Don't applaud it.

529
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 James absolutely denies telling you the death star bit of the fact.

530
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Which need to sleep out.

531
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 We get it.

532
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 It's like sweat.

533
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I mean, yeah.

534
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 So, bacteria are things that make us smell not arse.

535
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 It doesn't go down well on a date when you explain that.

536
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 So, it's a pointless piece of information you don't have.

537
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 There's these little things farting at you and then...

538
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And then, Justin, what are you collected?

539
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And then you release it.

540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Sure, sure.

541
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Has anyone got stuff on birthday cakes?

542
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Literally nothing.

543
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Let's hear it.

544
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 So, okay.

545
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Here's the thing.

546
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 When you blow out a candle,

547
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 what is the mechanism that's making it go out?

548
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 You blow and the flame falls over.

549
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And it dies.

550
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 It's the...

551
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 You're rejecting carbon dioxide into the air and sucking the O2 away from it.

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 It's a good guess, but it's not right.

553
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Okay.

554
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 So...

555
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Don't let's hear your extremely intelligent guess.

556
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 There's definitely going to be correct.

557
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 What's the soul's analogy that's like blowing out a birthday cake?

558
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 It's like the reverse of a lightsaber whereby you're bringing it...

559
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 No, I don't know.

560
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It's pretty simple, actually.

561
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 So, fire needs three things.

562
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 It needs oxygen, fuel and heat.

563
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And when you blow, it's the temperature going down enough.

564
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So, the air pressure is causing the temperature to go down,

565
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 which causes the fire to extinguish.

566
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 So, how come when people do that thing where they go...

567
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And they can put it out with just like a judo chop?

568
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Again, it's just moving the air, isn't it, which changes the pressure levels.

569
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And the idea of blowing out candles...

570
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 It has happened quite a lot, but it only really became a proper thing

571
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 after a codec advertisement showed some people blowing out some candles.

572
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I think it was in the '50s or '60s.

573
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Yeah. That's only when it became absolutely massive.

574
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 That's amazing.

575
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Oh, yeah, because there used to be those sort of candle thimbles

576
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 that you would sort of say, "Goodnight."

577
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And you would put out the candle...

578
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 You said it at birthday parties.

579
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 People would ceremonially drench each candle in order on the cake.

580
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 No, you know, it's like on a stick.

581
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I don't know what they're talking about.

582
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 We still use them.

583
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 What?

584
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Well, that was a thing.

585
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 You're advised to use them because it's less dangerous.

586
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 You're advised to use...

587
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Yeah, but fire safety officials.

588
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I've read that somewhere.

589
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I mean, not on a birthday cake.

590
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Yeah.

591
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 But fire safety...

592
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Fire officials don't use that to fight fire.

593
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Do that.

594
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Oh, it's a big one.

595
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 All right.

596
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 We need longer sticks and bigger thimbles.

597
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 That's just one more thing on birthday cakes.

598
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Yeah.

599
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Most expensive birthday cake of all time.

600
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 $75 million.

601
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Whoa!

602
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 It was bought by an unnamed buyer in the United Arab Emirates

603
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 for his daughter's birthday party.

604
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Actually, it was a joint birthday and engagement party.

605
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Also, really, it was only $37.5 million each time.

606
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Great.

607
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Yeah.

608
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 But it's a bit of a trick because the cake is pretty big

609
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 and obviously did cost a little bit of money.

610
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 But it also has 4,000 diamonds on it.

611
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Yeah.

612
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 So, I mean, if you're just going to pour diamonds on something to say,

613
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 that's the most expensive...

614
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 You know, this is my most expensive shoe of all time

615
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 because I poured a load of diamonds in it.

616
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 It's not part of the cake.

617
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 If you can't eat it, it's not part of the cake.

618
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Yeah.

619
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Do you know that there's a fish you can use as candles?

620
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 What? What?

621
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Yeah.

622
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 There's a fish called the Eulicon Fish,

623
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 which some people say is where the word "hooligan" comes from,

624
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 although that is quite dodgy atomology.

625
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Yeah, no, it's not.

626
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 But it's also called the candlefish.

627
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And that's because it's got so much fat in its body

628
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 and during spawning that you can literally light one end of it.

629
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And it burns like a weight like a candle.

630
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And so, like when we first went to North America,

631
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and when it was first discovered by Westerners,

632
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 then people used to catch these fish and use them as candles.

633
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Imagine the kid's birthday party

634
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 where you come into the room with that.

635
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Eight fish of light on the top of your cake.

636
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 But didn't they also have birds that they used as...

637
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Yeah.

638
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Are they full-mars or...?

639
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 No, Venezuela.

640
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 In Venezuela.

641
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And they're called oil birds.

642
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And they used to just light one end.

643
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Yeah.

644
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 They're so fatty.

645
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Oh, is that because Brian Blessed told me about this?

646
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Because he explored Venezuela.

647
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And he said, if you run out of wood or anything,

648
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 you grab one of these birds and you ring them like a wet cloth.

649
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And they leak the oils.

650
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And then you light so you don't actually have to hurt...

651
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 You probably hurt the bird in the ringing process, actually.

652
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 But that's doable.

653
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 I have a fact that combines birthdays and bacteria

654
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 that's not the original fact.

655
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Wow.

656
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 All right.

657
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Just that there was a doctor being interviewed by the telegraph.

658
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 This is a few years ago.

659
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 But he was giving health advice for how to avoid the spread of bacteria.

660
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 He recommended that the best place to sneeze is into your sleeve.

661
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Because that's hygienic.

662
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And also that while washing your hands,

663
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 you should sing happy birthday twice over.

664
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And I can confirm that if you do that in any kind of public bathroom,

665
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 you get really weird looks.

666
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 But when it got to the bit, happy birthday there,

667
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 what did you say?

668
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 My hands.

669
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 That's great because the second time round,

670
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 the guy next to you could be like,

671
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 "My hands."

672
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 It's both of our hands birthdays on the same day.

673
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 The chances.

674
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 We should move on to our final facts.

675
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Don't you want to go for something for me?

676
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I've got some interesting stuff.

677
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Okay, let's move on to our final facts.

678
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Yeah, go for it.

679
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Well, there's a bacteria called Palagi back to Ubeek.

680
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And there are so many of these things.

681
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 It is unreal.

682
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 If you take part of the ocean,

683
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 at least some parts of the ocean,

684
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 half of all the living cells will be this particular bacteria.

685
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Okay, there are two times 10 to the power of 28 of them in the world,

686
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 which means if every grain of sand on earth was a planet,

687
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 which contained the same number of humans as the rare on earth,

688
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 that would be how many of the bacteria there are on earth at the moment.

689
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 If every grain of sand on earth was a planet,

690
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 which had 7 billion people on it,

691
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 then the total number of all of those people on all of those...

692
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 It's a number of bacteria that there are of this species in the world.

693
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 What are you saying?

694
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 He's saying this a lot.

695
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Thank you, Anna, for putting it into terms I can understand.

696
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Can I just... My favourite bacteria is this...

697
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 We've all got one.

698
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 But bacteria are amazing, but they're quite hard to envisage sometimes,

699
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 but this is the second largest bacteria on earth.

700
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 People usually think it was the largest.

701
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 It's about the size of a full stop if you're reading a word document.

702
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 So that's... You can imagine that.

703
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 We're just quite exciting.

704
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And it's called the official Sony bacteria.

705
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 It's called Epilopiscum Fischal Sony.

706
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And the reason it's called Epilopiscum is because it only exists

707
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 in the intestines of surgeon fish.

708
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 So bacteria are very specific.

709
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 They only live in very specific environments.

710
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 So this one only lives in fish.

711
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 So that's why it's called Epilopiscum,

712
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 because Piscase means fish in that in.

713
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 But its other name is Fischal Sony.

714
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And by sheer coincidence, that's because it was discovered by a man called Lev Fischalson.

715
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 So it's the bacteria that lives solely in fish.

716
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And then it was named by someone called Peggy Pollock.

717
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 No!

718
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 That is amazing.

719
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And did you know this first paper that we were just talking about,

720
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 about the birthday cakes?

721
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 One of the authors of that paper was called Jonathan Baker.

722
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Oh!

723
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 What almost bookend to this fax part?

724
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Yeah, it'd be nice to have had a laugh, but...

725
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Oh, there we go. All right.

726
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 OK, it is time for a final fact of the show,

727
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 and that is Chazinski.

728
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 My fact this week is that the first person to swim the Atlantic said,

729
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 "Never again, as soon as he was finished.

730
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 He is now planning to swim the Pacific."

731
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 This is amazing.

732
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 It's this guy called Benoit Le Comte, and this is in 1998.

733
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 He swam the Atlantic, and he came ashore in Brittany.

734
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 In Brittany, he'd swam 3,800 miles basically from Cape Cod in Massachusetts.

735
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And literally his first words, I see a merge on the waterward, never again.

736
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And now he's planning his Pacific trip.

737
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 It's going to happen in the next couple of years.

738
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Now, do we think he actually did the Atlantic thing?

739
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 It's a little bit controversial, isn't it?

740
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 How far is that?

741
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 It's literally the number of miles that Anna just read out.

742
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 So if you rewind quickly on the podcast when you're listening back...

743
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Yeah, that's a lot.

744
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Oh, if you just listen in the first place, then that will also tell you how far it is.

745
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 It's 3,800 miles.

746
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Thank you, Anna.

747
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 So there's a bit of controversy about whether he swam the whole thing,

748
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 because obviously there are currents which might have helped him along a bit.

749
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And his average speed was 8 miles an hour, the whole way,

750
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 which is about three times as fast as other swimmers manage over long distances.

751
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 He did so far.

752
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 He may have been helped a bit.

753
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 But he was definitely in the water for a very long time.

754
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 He did well. And he was raising money for charity.

755
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 So he's raised a huge amount of money for charity.

756
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And that's what he's doing again now.

757
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And the way he does it is that he stops for the night.

758
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 He spends about eight hours a day.

759
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 He stops for the night.

760
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 The boat takes a GPS position of where he was.

761
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 And then no matter how far the boat's drifted,

762
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 it has to go back to the position he was at,

763
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 and then drop him in the next morning.

764
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Because there was a guy called Guy Delage,

765
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 who was the first to swim across with the help of a kickboard.

766
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And a kickboard is one of those floats that you have in the swimming pool,

767
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 and you hold them, and then you, you know,

768
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 when you can't do the armpits of your swimming,

769
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 but you're just pressing the leg bit.

770
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 So he did it with that.

771
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 But when he wasn't swimming, he was sleeping on a raft,

772
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 which didn't have this GPS thing.

773
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And the raft would just float towards where he needed to go all the time.

774
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 And basically, the longer he was sleeping,

775
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 the longer he didn't have to swim.

776
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Which if it was me, I would just have slept the whole way.

777
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 That's the thing.

778
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And he had a, I think, he guy had a small sail on his raft as well.

779
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Yes.

780
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 But he was still cool.

781
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And I think he's great as well, a bit of a hero,

782
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 because he did it to escape debt.

783
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 So he basically had no money left.

784
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And he was like, what can I do?

785
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 What's the obvious way I can raise money?

786
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Swim the Atlantic.

787
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And when--

788
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Oh, he wasn't just leaving the country to escape the--

789
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 That's what I thought.

790
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Yeah.

791
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Sorry.

792
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 No, he was good.

793
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And he had a shark phobia, Guy Delage.

794
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 So--

795
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 I don't know.

796
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 I think shark phobia is the wrong way of putting that, isn't it?

797
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Because a phobia has to be something that, you know,

798
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 there's no real reason you should be scared of it.

799
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Whereas sharks, if you're swimming in the Atlantic,

800
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 you're quite right to be scared of sharks.

801
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Yeah, if you don't have shark phobia, you would say,

802
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 he is an insane man.

803
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Do you know how marathon swimmers keep themselves going

804
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 during the race?

805
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 No, you mean because they get tired or--

806
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 They get tired.

807
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And so if you're swimming a marathon, you know,

808
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 there's lots of kilometers.

809
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 There was an interview with a Russian open-wall swimmer,

810
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 an open-water swimming champion called Yevgeny Bezruzhenko.

811
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And he wrote an article sharing the secrets of marathon swimming.

812
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 And he revealed that you need food

813
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 and you normally need a concentrated gel, you know,

814
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 a really, really massive dose of sugar.

815
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 But the only place, obviously, you're swimming, you're in trunks.

816
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 There is only one place you can keep it.

817
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And that is inside your trunks as you swim.

818
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 So all the swimmers you see doing marathons

819
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 have little packets of food basically tucked into their pants.

820
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 No way!

821
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 And they have to get them out over the course of the race.

822
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 That's awesome.

823
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 They should invent, like, trunks with pockets.

824
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 That would be good.

825
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Do they not have pockets?

826
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Yeah.

827
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 There's normally a little one for your locker key.

828
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 But I think at the competitive level,

829
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 they may not even have those.

830
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Did you know that the US Navy have their own secret military swimming stroke?

831
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Yes.

832
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 They do.

833
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 They do.

834
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 They don't do.

835
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 They do.

836
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 They do.

837
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 They do.

838
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 They don't mate.

839
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 So US Navy seals, they have this stroke

840
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 called the combat swimmer stroke.

841
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 And it looks so daft.

842
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 But it's a combination of breaststroke and freestyle,

843
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 which I did not know was a thing.

844
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 But...

845
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Is it breaststroke legs and freestyle arms?

846
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Basically, you have to go on your side in the water

847
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 and then you kick in an odd way.

848
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 And then you use your arms in another way.

849
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 But basically, it makes you harder to spot underwater.

850
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 And it's called the combat swimmer stroke.

851
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Wow!

852
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 It means that if you're trying to infiltrate...

853
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 You're harder to spot because you're basically sinking

854
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 because you can't swim like that.

855
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Yes.

856
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Can I just say a combination of breaststroke and freestyle

857
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 is just freestyle because the whole point of freestyle

858
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 is that it's anything you want.

859
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 That's true.

860
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 It just happens that freestyle is the fastest stroke.

861
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 So if I'm swimming breaststroke, am I also swimming freestyle?

862
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 You sure are.

863
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 If you're swimming that in a race, you're a swimming freestyle

864
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 and be an absolute idiot.

865
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 But yeah.

866
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 In a freestyle race, you're allowed to go anywhere you want.

867
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Really?

868
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 So what you're thinking of is Sprunk Crull.

869
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 That's what I thought I thought freestyle was, Frank Crull.

870
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 It is Frank Crull because that's the fastest.

871
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 But why do you think it was called freestyle?

872
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Oh, yeah.

873
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 You're not going to go...

874
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 I'll do breaststroke on this one.

875
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Yeah.

876
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Can I stick up for breaststroke?

877
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Well, as the fastest swimmings have the fastest,

878
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 but as the nicest.

879
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Yeah, but where do you mean the Olympics?

880
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 There's no points for niceness.

881
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 You're joking.

882
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 You were shit at Sparta School.

883
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Do you know bats, when they swim,

884
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 they tested to see if bats could swim.

885
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 First of all, yeah, I didn't know this one.

886
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Yeah, so bats can swim.

887
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Obviously, they don't do it out of just a daily exercise.

888
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 They do it in circumstances where they're suddenly in water

889
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 for a reason they shouldn't be.

890
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Right.

891
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Have I explained myself well enough?

892
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Perfectly.

893
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 They do the butterfly.

894
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 So they... when they're winged.

895
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 That's due butterfly.

896
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Do butterflies.

897
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Do that.

898
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Do the bats.

899
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 They do batstroke.

900
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Yeah.

901
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 Oh.

902
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Yeah.

903
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 So the longest ever journey swimming was 5,268 kilometers.

904
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 And it was down the Amazon River through Peru and Brazil.

905
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 And it was done by a guy called Martin Strrell,

906
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 who's from Slovenia.

907
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 And he is pretty awesome.

908
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Atri, he did it.

909
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 They asked him about it.

910
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 And he said, you know, they're like, how did you manage this?

911
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 And he says, well, my body is pretty special.

912
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Wow.

913
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 He says, I never hurt or sick.

914
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 And if everyone were like me, all of the hospitals around the world

915
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 would be completely empty.

916
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 And he says he drinks either one or two bottles of wine every day.

917
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 But it's special Slovenian wine that you can't buy outside Slovenia.

918
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 And it just helps you be an awesome swimmer.

919
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 Does it?

920
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 Yeah.

921
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 And he said, do you know what the worst thing is

922
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 if you're swimming the Amazon, what the biggest danger is?

923
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Getting your legs chewed off by piranhas.

924
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 By piranhas.

925
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 So he was attacked by piranhas a few times.

926
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And he found a good way of preventing them

927
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 by pouring buckets of putrid blood into the water.

928
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 And they went for the putrid blood instead.

929
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 He also said, and I don't really believe this because he said,

930
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 I learned not to pee in the water because there are kandiru.

931
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And you guys probably know kandiru.

932
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 They're the tiny fish that are supposed to swim up into your penis

933
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 if you're swimming.

934
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 But they don't, do they?

935
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 But they don't.

936
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 So I think he's been told a bit of a--

937
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 I thought they did.

938
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 No, they didn't.

939
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 I thought the thing they didn't do was

940
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 if you're having a pee into the Amazon off the bank,

941
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 they don't swim up the urine.

942
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Yeah.

943
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 I think we can all agree they definitely don't do that.

944
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 OK, so it's common ground.

945
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 But anyway, he said the kandiru was bad.

946
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 But the worst thing apparently was the women of the Amazon.

947
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 And he said, you can often see 15 to 20 times more women than men.

948
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 And the women are very aggressive

949
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 and they try and catch you and marry you.

950
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 This-- and they're worse than the piranhas.

951
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 This guy has a-- I must say a very high opinion of himself.

952
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 My body's great.

953
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 I've got magic wine.

954
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 And the ladies of the Amazon cannot get enough.

955
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Hey, we need to wrap up shortly.

956
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Do you guys have anything before we do?

957
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Can I just say a fact that we got sent actually in the interval

958
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 and it's amazing and it's about swimming.

959
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 And it's from a guy called Theo,

960
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 who all I know is you're called Theo on your age 12.

961
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Yeah.

962
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Are you here?

963
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 OK, great.

964
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Hi, Theo.

965
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 So this fact is incredible.

966
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Tigers always get in the water backwards

967
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 because they love swimming, but they hate getting their eyes wet.

968
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 Isn't that amazing?

969
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 I checked it.

970
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 I was like, that must not be true.

971
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 I must know it.

972
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 So they put their paws up on the bank

973
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 and then just kick with their back legs.

974
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Like old ladies at the swimming pool.

975
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 All right, amazing flag for you.

976
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Should we wrap up?

977
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 OK, that's it.

978
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 That is all of our facts.

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000

 We also have a link to our book, The Book of the Year,

 which is out now and we're about to give a copy away

996
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 to one of the members of this audience here in Coventry,

997
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 who's sent us a fact that we have picked out.

998
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 Who's got the fact?

999
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 I have it.

1000
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 It's a shame after you just read out that really cool tiger one,

1001
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 because this is quite low-brow.

1002
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 But I can only blame the people of Coventry.

1003
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 And it is that places in Canada include

1004
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 Shaga's Cove, Dildo, and Balls Falls.
