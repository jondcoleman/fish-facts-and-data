00:00:13,00:00:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Coventry!"
00:00:23,00:00:30,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:30,00:00:42,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Annotzzynski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin, and once again someone is still clapping."
00:00:42,00:00:44,What is going on there?
00:00:44,00:00:53,"And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:53,00:01:09,"Starting this week with my fact, my fact this week is that in the annual Lady Godiva parade, which famously celebrates a lady who rode naked through Coventry, not only does the rider always wear clothes, but one year even the horse wore trousers."
00:01:09,00:01:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:11,00:01:13,It's the trousered horse.
00:01:13,00:01:21,"How did the horse wear the trousers? Did it wear them over its back end, or did it wear them on all four legs?"
00:01:21,00:01:23,It had all four legs.
00:01:23,00:01:25,"There's a photo, you can see it."
00:01:25,00:01:27,So it actually wore two pairs of trousers?
00:01:27,00:01:29,"Yeah, it wore two pairs of trousers."
00:01:29,00:01:31,"Yeah, that's true."
00:01:31,00:01:34,"That's amazing, and it was in the early 20th century, right?"
00:01:34,00:01:36,It was 1919.
00:01:36,00:01:42,"It was a Lady Godiva parade, and amazingly these beautiful photos that you can see of the event."
00:01:42,00:01:48,"They are. I think she was an actress called Gladys Mann, which is ironic because she's a woman, and she..."
00:01:48,00:01:54,"Actually, wasn't it true that the first Lady Godiva's who did these things were all men?"
00:01:54,00:01:55,Why didn't I?
00:01:55,00:02:00,"I think they were. Yeah, the first one was we know he was the son of James Swinnerton."
00:02:00,00:02:02,Don't know what his name was.
00:02:02,00:02:04,Wow. Do you know what it was?
00:02:04,00:02:06,"What an irritating thing to be called, going through life."
00:02:06,00:02:08,"Hello, I'm the son of James Swinnerton."
00:02:08,00:02:10,Do you have a name?
00:02:10,00:02:11,"Yes, that's my name."
00:02:11,00:02:15,He was paid 15 shillings to do that.
00:02:15,00:02:19,"But it's been kind of sporadic, hasn't it, that Lady Godiva parades throughout history,"
00:02:19,00:02:23,"and they've been variously banned and then dropped, and they've come back."
00:02:23,00:02:25,"In the 19th century, I think they really caught on them."
00:02:25,00:02:31,"People were parading through the streets, and in the 1840s, they really became a big thing again,"
00:02:31,00:02:34,and there'd be someone cast as Lady Godiva every time.
00:02:34,00:02:38,"And at first, it would be someone who was made to appear like she was naked."
00:02:38,00:02:44,"In 1842, there was an actress or a performer who was wearing a tight-fitting, flesh-colored dress,"
00:02:44,00:02:47,"like a kind of a onesie, but to make it look like she's naked."
00:02:47,00:02:50,And then people were outraged. They were all these complaints.
00:02:50,00:02:55,"And I was looking in the British newspaper archive, and they were saying it's depraved, you know,"
00:02:55,00:03:00,it's encouraged the profligate youth of Coventry to gratify a depraved taste.
00:03:00,00:03:03,Only profligate youth of Coventry in tonight?
00:03:03,00:03:09,"They referred to her as a brazen harlot, the poor poor woman who dressed in a onesie on horseback."
00:03:09,00:03:14,"I read someone referred to, it was a bishop of Worcester, who referred to her as a Birmingham whore"
00:03:14,00:03:16,being paraded through the streets.
00:03:16,00:03:21,And it seemed like he was more bothered that she was from Birmingham than anything.
00:03:21,00:03:24,We should very quickly say who Lady Godiva was or wasn't.
00:03:24,00:03:29,"So the idea is just for anyone listening overseas, she was a noble woman,"
00:03:29,00:03:35,"and in protest against her husband raising taxes, she rode through the streets of Coventry,"
00:03:35,00:03:41,"naked, except for her very long hair, which she had woven into a kind of hair bikini."
00:03:41,00:03:42,"No, that's not true."
00:03:42,00:03:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:43,00:03:46,"So that's the idea, and that she was trying to persuade him to lower the taxes."
00:03:46,00:03:47,"Well, we don't think it happened."
00:03:47,00:03:48,No.
00:03:48,00:03:54,"It's probably a myth. It was in the 11th century, but I think the first reference to it was about 200 years later."
00:03:54,00:03:57,"But it's a myth that's, you know, very much still celebrated."
00:03:57,00:04:03,"In the Olympics, there was a 20-foot tall Lady Godiva built."
00:04:03,00:04:07,And it traveled on a purpose built 50-seat bicycle.
00:04:07,00:04:09,Because it was transported down to London.
00:04:09,00:04:10,Wow.
00:04:10,00:04:14,"And then back again, it briefly got stuck going around the ring road on a tight bend."
00:04:14,00:04:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:15,00:04:21,And the woman who ran the company said that Lady Godiva had suffered a little bit of whiplash from tree branches
00:04:21,00:04:23,and suffered rain damage and some scratches.
00:04:23,00:04:27,"And she added, she looked like she'd had the best night out."
00:04:27,00:04:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:29,00:04:33,The other thing about it being a myth is that basically it was against taxes.
00:04:33,00:04:36,But people have looked back at what Coventry was like back then.
00:04:36,00:04:40,And probably the people who were here weren't really bothered about taxes.
00:04:40,00:04:48,"One person said that in those days, Coventry was just an inconsequential group of surfs living in single-story hovels."
00:04:48,00:04:54,"Whereas Coventry now has two-story buildings, I think."
00:04:54,00:04:56,Very bold.
00:04:56,00:04:57,I know.
00:04:57,00:04:58,So brave.
00:04:58,00:05:03,"I literally was about to pack my stuff up and go, OK, that's the evening over."
00:05:03,00:05:08,So you were saying about the skin type clothing being seen as a bit of a disgrace.
00:05:08,00:05:14,I read a story that it caused a lot of chaos because people thought that she was naked.
00:05:14,00:05:19,"Therefore, everyone who came to see the parade suddenly really wanted to get close to see the parade."
00:05:19,00:05:24,And riots sort of broke out and people fought each other because they thought there was a naked person on the horse.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Yeah.
00:05:25,00:05:30,That was one of the reasons I think it was considered so immoral in Victorian era.
00:05:30,00:05:31,"Yeah, because these riots started."
00:05:31,00:05:34,Everyone got really pissed and they stared at this maybe naked woman.
00:05:34,00:05:38,"And then they all got really drunk and descended into debauchery at night, apparently."
00:05:38,00:05:39,Wow.
00:05:39,00:05:43,"And every year they'd be like, this year she's definitely going to be naked as she never was."
00:05:43,00:05:45,You heard of a pruporetta?
00:05:45,00:05:46,No.
00:05:46,00:05:48,Is that only heard of pruporetta?
00:05:48,00:05:49,Yeah.
00:05:49,00:05:52,"So for 25 years in a row, she was the same Lady Godiva."
00:05:52,00:05:56,She was the Lady Godiva more than the original Lady Godiva who only did it once.
00:05:56,00:05:58,Pruporetta did it 25 times.
00:05:58,00:05:59,Or even no times.
00:05:59,00:06:01,Lady Godiva didn't even do it.
00:06:01,00:06:03,Pruporetta is the real Lady Godiva.
00:06:03,00:06:05,And she got an MBE for her troubles.
00:06:05,00:06:06,Yeah.
00:06:06,00:06:08,She's only recently retired from the game.
00:06:08,00:06:09,What did they pin it to?
00:06:09,00:06:18,I guess that there might be quite a lot of Godiva businesses in Coventry.
00:06:18,00:06:22,So I checked on the internet and I was not disappointed.
00:06:22,00:06:25,There is Godiva fire extinguishers.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Godiva granite.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Godiva insurance.
00:06:27,00:06:28,Godiva windows.
00:06:28,00:06:29,Godiva fish shop.
00:06:29,00:06:31,Godiva dentists.
00:06:31,00:06:32,Animal care.
00:06:32,00:06:33,Chiropractors.
00:06:33,00:06:34,Glass wines.
00:06:34,00:06:35,Hypnotherapy.
00:06:35,00:06:36,Plumbing.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Fencing.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Cafe.
00:06:38,00:06:39,Barbers.
00:06:39,00:06:40,Carpets.
00:06:40,00:06:41,And Godiva tailoring.
00:06:41,00:06:42,Wow.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Which I love.
00:06:43,00:06:44,It's somebody who has no clothes.
00:06:44,00:06:45,I think it's brilliant.
00:06:45,00:06:46,Yeah.
00:06:46,00:06:48,Let's get your clothes off to get those measurements.
00:06:48,00:06:49,You're done.
00:06:49,00:06:51,I also think a very clever thing.
00:06:51,00:06:53,I don't know if Godiva windows has done this.
00:06:53,00:06:59,But what I would have done is the whole point of Godiva was that all the people who lived in Coventry
00:06:59,00:07:01,"had to go inside and not look at her, right?"
00:07:01,00:07:06,And the story of peeping Tom comes from the Lady Godiva story because he snuck out
00:07:06,00:07:09,and did try to catch a glimpse and then he was blinded.
00:07:09,00:07:16,"And so, if you were making Godiva windows, you should actually make opaque windows."
00:07:16,00:07:18,And I don't know if they do that as a business.
00:07:18,00:07:21,"I don't know if that would be particularly fruitful, but that's what I would do."
00:07:21,00:07:24,"So, like doors, basically."
00:07:24,00:07:27,(Laughter)
00:07:27,00:07:29,Those door windows.
00:07:29,00:07:33,"I mean, that's what they call doors in Coventry."
00:07:33,00:07:37,I did a little bit on naked protests.
00:07:37,00:07:38,"Oh, okay."
00:07:38,00:07:43,"So, because people keep on protesting as Lady Godiva."
00:07:43,00:07:48,"So, this May in Gloucester, a woman called Anna Dart, rode a horse dressed only in body paint."
00:07:48,00:07:50,She was dressed in body paint.
00:07:50,00:07:51,Not the horse.
00:07:51,00:07:55,"The horse didn't even bother wearing body paint, disgusting."
00:07:55,00:08:00,To protest against Gloucestershire County Council's planned new incinerator.
00:08:00,00:08:03,(Laughter)
00:08:03,00:08:07,"In 2011, a man dressed as Lady Godiva and he rode through the Lancashire village of Holtan"
00:08:07,00:08:12,to protest against new Haitian to M6 Link Road.
00:08:12,00:08:16,"And, my favourite one, in 2006, a dozen people in a Canadian town,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,"it's called Lida, in Saskatchewan."
00:08:18,00:08:22,They posed naked in potholes on a local highway
00:08:22,00:08:25,"and then made a calendar, a nude calendar of themselves,"
00:08:25,00:08:29,in these potholes to spread the message that they wanted the council to fix the potholes.
00:08:29,00:08:30,(Laughter)
00:08:30,00:08:33,"And the local organizer, the organizer, the guy behind it,"
00:08:33,00:08:36,"said that most of the people in the calendar were very reluctant,"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"but he did add there was one guy, we couldn't get him to keep his clothes on."
00:08:39,00:08:41,(Laughter)
00:08:41,00:08:46,"And the Guardian reported that just four years later, the highway was repaired."
00:08:46,00:08:47,(Laughter)
00:08:47,00:08:50,"So, it absolutely works like a charm."
00:08:50,00:08:55,"I read a thing about in France, there's a small town that has been having a problem with their naked hero,"
00:08:55,00:09:01,"which is Heracles, and basically they have a statue of him naked,"
00:09:01,00:09:08,but the town seems to have a lot of cheeky vandals who keep chiseling the penis off of the naked god.
00:09:08,00:09:11,"And so, what they did was they kept replacing it,"
00:09:11,00:09:15,"and then they'd come back a few days later or whatever,"
00:09:15,00:09:19,"someone again, cheeky chiseler comes along and takes away the penis,"
00:09:19,00:09:21,"and they were like, we don't know what to do."
00:09:21,00:09:24,"So, what they ended up doing, because it was a very important spot where they do a lot of ceremonies,"
00:09:24,00:09:31,"they made a sort of extra special penis that they then, whenever they do a ceremony,"
00:09:31,00:09:34,"just before the ceremony starts, they come up to it, put the penis on,"
00:09:34,00:09:38,"and they're like, there's going to be a ceremony today, and they guard it,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,"and then they do the ceremony, and once whatever the ribbons been cut or whatever,"
00:09:41,00:09:44,"they go, thank you all good night, and then they take the penis off again,"
00:09:44,00:09:45,and bring it back to the office.
00:09:45,00:09:50,"So, it's a ceremonial penis that is constantly attached for important days."
00:09:50,00:09:51,Did you say that was in France?
00:09:51,00:09:55,"Yeah, it was. It was a town called Arcacheon."
00:09:55,00:09:57,Sure.
00:09:57,00:10:02,"Just because I just have just a coincidence about France and Germany,"
00:10:02,00:10:10,"and that is that the pioneers of the natureist movements in France were called Albert and Christine LeCoc,"
00:10:10,00:10:15,and one of the leading lights of German natureism was called Adolf Coc.
00:10:15,00:10:16,No way!
00:10:16,00:10:20,"And they're both basically the most important natureists in France and Germany,"
00:10:20,00:10:22,a called Coc and LeCoc.
00:10:22,00:10:23,Wow.
00:10:23,00:10:24,That's great.
00:10:24,00:10:26,Do you know how she's speaking of Adolfs?
00:10:26,00:10:29,"Ah, we've reached the Hitler point in the show, ladies and gentlemen."
00:10:29,00:10:32,I'm trying to get it into every live show of our tour.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"Hitler banned nudism, and then immediately reintroduced it."
00:10:36,00:10:40,"So, it was quite a big thing in Germany in the early 20th century,"
00:10:40,00:10:44,"and the Nazis still, it wasn't very good, and so they banned it in 1933,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,and then they shut down all the nudist clubs across Germany.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"And then in 1934, they immediately changed their mind,"
00:10:49,00:10:53,and allowed people to just attend Nazi-approved nudist clubs.
00:10:53,00:10:57,"So, even he's softened on that one thing."
00:10:57,00:10:58,What?
00:10:58,00:11:02,"Yeah, I think it's a bit late to reclaim the reputation, Emma."
00:11:02,00:11:06,"Okay, why don't we move on to our second fact of the night,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,and that is James Harkin.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"Okay, my fact this week is that the worst basketball coach"
00:11:12,00:11:15,in the history of the University of Kansas
00:11:15,00:11:20,"is James Naesmith, the man who invented basketball."
00:11:20,00:11:22,It's amazing.
00:11:22,00:11:26,He is the only coach of that university who has a losing record.
00:11:26,00:11:30,"Every single other person was a winner, and he invented the game."
00:11:30,00:11:31,Yeah.
00:11:31,00:11:33,But he was just learning how to do it.
00:11:33,00:11:35,But so was everyone.
00:11:35,00:11:36,"Yeah, it's free."
00:11:36,00:11:38,"He was against coaching, wasn't he?"
00:11:38,00:11:40,Which partly explains it.
00:11:40,00:11:44,So one of his students went on to be one of the greatest basketball coaches ever.
00:11:44,00:11:46,Someone called Fog Allen.
00:11:46,00:11:49,"And when he told his tutor, Naesmith, who invented basketball,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"that he was going to try and coach it,"
00:11:51,00:11:55,"Naesmith just said, ""You cannot coach basketball, you just play it."""
00:11:55,00:11:57,"And so, yeah, he didn't believe in it."
00:11:57,00:12:00,It was a slightly different game in those days.
00:12:00,00:12:03,"There was nine against nine, and they used a football, a soccer ball,"
00:12:03,00:12:06,"instead of a basketball, because they haven't been invented yet."
00:12:06,00:12:08,And dribbling wasn't allowed.
00:12:08,00:12:10,"So he's a bit more like netball, actually."
00:12:10,00:12:13,"And there was no hole in the bottom of the basket, was there?"
00:12:13,00:12:14,Yeah.
00:12:14,00:12:16,"They just put a load of peach baskets up there,"
00:12:16,00:12:19,"and they put it through it in, and then he had to climb up and get it out,"
00:12:19,00:12:20,and then play again.
00:12:20,00:12:21,Yeah.
00:12:21,00:12:25,"And he thought, Naesmith thought the introduction of the hole in the basket was a grave error."
00:12:25,00:12:27,He thought that was a mistake.
00:12:27,00:12:28,Yeah.
00:12:28,00:12:32,Can you imagine Michael Jordan getting a ladder every time he gets a fight?
00:12:32,00:12:35,The first ever game of basketball ended in a massive brawl.
00:12:35,00:12:37,"In fact, I had a brawl after about five minutes."
00:12:37,00:12:40,"So he invented it because he was teaching school boys,"
00:12:40,00:12:43,"and his class were really badly behaved, they were very naughty,"
00:12:43,00:12:46,"and the weather was bad, so they couldn't go outside and let off steam."
00:12:46,00:12:49,"So he invented the game, and he just gave them one rule."
00:12:49,00:12:52,"So the only rule is to get the ball in the basket,"
00:12:52,00:12:55,and immediately they started a fight with each other.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"He said they started tackling kicking and punching,"
00:12:57,00:13:00,"and before he managed to intercede, several had black eyes,"
00:13:00,00:13:05,"one had dislocated his shoulder, and another had literally been knocked out."
00:13:05,00:13:08,"Oh, my God."
00:13:08,00:13:14,"So in America at the moment, there's quite a lot of controversy with basketball in schools,"
00:13:14,00:13:19,and the reason for that is coaches keep getting fired for their teams winning by so much.
00:13:19,00:13:20,Really?
00:13:20,00:13:23,"So they have this thing in American sports,"
00:13:23,00:13:26,"where once you're winning by a certain amount, you should really stop trying,"
00:13:26,00:13:31,and you shouldn't keep what they call it as running up the score.
00:13:31,00:13:36,"So there was a guy who won 100 nil recently, who was the head of his team, he got fired."
00:13:36,00:13:41,"There was someone who won 161-2, and they got fired as well."
00:13:41,00:13:44,And is the idea that you're not teaching them to be good sportsmen basically?
00:13:44,00:13:45,"Exactly, yeah."
00:13:45,00:13:46,I love it.
00:13:46,00:13:47,I really like that.
00:13:47,00:13:48,Yeah.
00:13:48,00:13:52,I can see who was shit at Spartan school.
00:13:52,00:13:56,"You know, we think of basketball as an American sport predominantly,"
00:13:56,00:13:59,but there's so many countries around the world that play it.
00:13:59,00:14:03,"In a very big way, and the one that surprised me most when I was looking into this is Bhutan."
00:14:03,00:14:08,"The royal family of Bhutan are obsessed with basketball,"
00:14:08,00:14:11,"and I read an article where the current queen of Bhutan,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,they followed a match that she played.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"So she's in a team, and when she comes to the match,"
00:14:16,00:14:20,"when she comes out through the locker rooms to the main court,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,they roll out a red carpet.
00:14:22,00:14:24,"Yeah, and they have a like a thrown-like thing there."
00:14:24,00:14:27,Did they have to roll out the red carpet all over the court as she moves around?
00:14:27,00:14:29,"Yes, they got to stay in front of her."
00:14:29,00:14:30,Just peddling it out.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Yeah.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"No, and so she played a match."
00:14:33,00:14:37,"This is the match they observed, and she scored 34 points in that match."
00:14:37,00:14:39,Three rebounds and four assists.
00:14:39,00:14:43,"If you know the scoring system of basketball, that's incredibly high."
00:14:43,00:14:47,"And so they were like, either she's incredibly amazing at basketball,"
00:14:47,00:14:52,or it may have something to do with the fact that Bhutan is custom for Bid's citizens
00:14:52,00:14:55,from touching the royals without any invitation.
00:14:55,00:14:59,"Therefore, any time she's got the ball, people have to be like, ""Oh, no!"""
00:14:59,00:15:01,But isn't basketball a non-contact spot?
00:15:01,00:15:03,"I mean, you're hitting it."
00:15:03,00:15:06,"Technically it is, but it's a very aggressive sport,"
00:15:06,00:15:09,"and there's a lot of blocking, and there's a lot of stuff like that."
00:15:09,00:15:12,"And there's a quote from someone who they interviewed afterwards saying,"
00:15:12,00:15:16,"""You know, the queen's really good, and how did you find it?"""
00:15:16,00:15:18,"Because the one person they interviewed actually fouled the queen,"
00:15:18,00:15:20,which goes against the rules of the country.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"And yet, as she said, I fouled the queen once."
00:15:23,00:15:26,"I was a little scared, but she said it was okay."
00:15:26,00:15:30,"And she said, ""She wants us to check her, and she gets mad if we don't."
00:15:30,00:15:34,"She thinks we're scared of her. We are very scared of her."""
00:15:34,00:15:38,But do you know that that's not the Bhutanese royal family's favourite sport?
00:15:38,00:15:40,"Actually, their favourite sport is darts."
00:15:40,00:15:41,Is it?
00:15:41,00:15:44,"Yeah, because in Bhutan, darts is like the national sport,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,but they are massive darts.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"They're about, ""You hold them in your hand like this."""
00:15:48,00:15:50,"I mean, not great for a podcast."
00:15:50,00:15:53,"But you hold them with your full palm, and then you launch them,"
00:15:53,00:15:55,"and it's about the same distance as this stage,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"and you throw it from one side to the other,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,and they have an archery target that you have to throw it into.
00:16:00,00:16:05,And one team stands next to the target and tries to insult the other guys before you throw it.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Why don't you do that?
00:16:06,00:16:07,I don't do that at all.
00:16:07,00:16:09,I know. It's unbelievably dangerous.
00:16:09,00:16:12,They encourage things to them to encourage them to keep on aim.
00:16:12,00:16:14,"Yeah, but then you want to win as well, right?"
00:16:14,00:16:16,"Yeah, I can think of a way of winning."
00:16:16,00:16:20,Kill the other guys with your darts. What are they going to do?
00:16:20,00:16:23,"At worst, that's a foul, you know."
00:16:23,00:16:25,Do you guys remember the film Space Jam?
00:16:25,00:16:27,"Yeah, Michael Jordan."
00:16:27,00:16:28,Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny.
00:16:28,00:16:32,"It's a Looney Tunes film with some humans in, like Who Frame Roger Rabbit."
00:16:32,00:16:35,"Last year, there was a journalist called Jalen Cook"
00:16:35,00:16:39,"who analysed the Space Jam film through actual NBA rules,"
00:16:39,00:16:40,and it's just a very funny write-up.
00:16:40,00:16:42,"So he said, ""One minute 31."
00:16:42,00:16:47,"Silvestre the Cat tries to swallow Tweety Bird, his own teammate, Hall."""
00:16:47,00:16:50,"There is nothing in the NBA rulebook that explicitly says,"
00:16:50,00:16:53,"""You can't eat your teammate's while a game is in progress."""
00:16:53,00:16:55,One minute 50.
00:16:55,00:16:58,Foghorn Leghorn is incinerated by Barry.
00:16:58,00:17:01,That is easily a flagrant two-fowl.
00:17:01,00:17:03,It is also attempted murder.
00:17:03,00:17:08,"You know, it's that Michael Jordan was in that film, obviously,"
00:17:08,00:17:11,"and is, people say, the greatest possible playable time."
00:17:11,00:17:15,"But he's also a great leader in basketball fashion,"
00:17:15,00:17:18,"because if you watch basketball now, they've all got these really baggy shorts on,"
00:17:18,00:17:20,and that's because of him.
00:17:20,00:17:23,"So until he played, then everyone wore tight shorts,"
00:17:23,00:17:27,"and then he thought that it was good luck for him to wear his old uni,"
00:17:27,00:17:30,his old college shorts underneath his basketball shorts.
00:17:30,00:17:34,So he never played a single game without wearing two pairs of shorts.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"And I imagine boxes, which I count as shorts,"
00:17:36,00:17:39,"so three pairs of shorts, Michael Jordan's always wearing."
00:17:39,00:17:42,"And that meant that the NBA had to make his shorts baggy,"
00:17:42,00:17:45,"so they could fit these, you know, two other pairs of shorts underneath it."
00:17:45,00:17:47,"Yeah, I am wearing three pairs of pants now."
00:17:47,00:17:49,"Yeah, two right. Otherwise."
00:17:49,00:17:51,"Otherwise, people aren't safe."
00:17:51,00:17:56,"I was reading about someone else called Jason Terry,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"who is an NBA player,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"and he's a lot of superstition in sport, obviously,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,"and Jason Terry plays at the moment,"
00:18:03,00:18:07,but he has to sleep in his opponent's shorts the night before a match.
00:18:07,00:18:10,"Well, while the opponent's wearing them are..."
00:18:10,00:18:15,"Well, they need to be shorts from the opposing team that have been played in."
00:18:15,00:18:18,"And so apparently, he has contacts throughout the NBA,"
00:18:18,00:18:20,"so he can email them and be like,"
00:18:20,00:18:23,"""Sorry, could you send me your shorts, you know my thing?"""
00:18:23,00:18:26,"And he has shorts from all the opposing teams,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,so he can sleep in them before the match.
00:18:28,00:18:31,"I'd like to clarify, I'm not wearing anyone else's pants right now."
00:18:31,00:18:34,"Is it kind of so that once he's been in their shorts,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,he knows how to beat them?
00:18:36,00:18:39,I don't know. Let's not talk about beating in someone else's shorts.
00:18:39,00:18:41,I don't know.
00:18:41,00:18:45,He didn't justify it.
00:18:45,00:18:48,"Just quickly, a weird thing that I saw in Canada this year,"
00:18:48,00:18:53,"a basketball player finally got the right to use his surname on his jersey,"
00:18:53,00:18:56,which has been very contentious. He's from Brazil.
00:18:56,00:19:00,"He got transferred over, and there's been huge problems with it."
00:19:00,00:19:04,"And yeah, he's been in the news for it as a result."
00:19:04,00:19:08,"The quote he said is, ""It's my last name, I'm proud of it."
00:19:08,00:19:10,"It doesn't matter if it means something bad."""
00:19:10,00:19:13,"He says it's pronounced Fouquet,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,and that's how he's trying to get...
00:19:15,00:19:17,"I mean, maybe it definitely probably is, right?"
00:19:17,00:19:20,"I think he knows his name, but he was censored for ages,"
00:19:20,00:19:22,so he wasn't allowed to wear a jersey.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"And finally, because the team's doing well, they're like,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,"""Okay, you can have it."""
00:19:25,00:19:28,So now that's going back and forth on a basketball court.
00:19:28,00:19:29,Wow. Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"It just reminds me just slightly off topic,"
00:19:32,00:19:36,but there is a college footballer who will probably go into NFL soon
00:19:36,00:19:39,in America whose name is Lion King.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"Oh, that's so cool."
00:19:41,00:19:44,Imagine if you're Mr. and Mrs. King.
00:19:44,00:19:47,"Yeah. What should we call our son, Mufasa?"
00:19:47,00:19:52,"We should move on to our dayx factor, right?"
00:19:52,00:19:56,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:19:56,00:19:59,My factor is that blowing out the candles on a birthday cake
00:19:59,00:20:04,"increases the number of bacteria on it by 1,400%."
00:20:04,00:20:06,Yeah.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"Next time you have a birthday, think about this."
00:20:08,00:20:12,"So there were a lot of scientists who wanted to test that, you know,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,"what happens when you breathe out,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,"and whether, as they said, bio-era souls in human breath"
00:20:17,00:20:20,expelled from the mouth may be a source of bacteria.
00:20:20,00:20:22,"So they simulated a birthday party among themselves,"
00:20:22,00:20:24,which I would kill to have been at.
00:20:24,00:20:29,"They ate some pizza to get their salivary glands going,"
00:20:29,00:20:33,"and then they had a cake set up and they blew all over it,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,blowing the candles out.
00:20:35,00:20:37,"And that's just the average was 1,400%."
00:20:37,00:20:39,So that's not the worst.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"In one case, someone breathing out and blowing out all the candles"
00:20:42,00:20:46,"increased the bacteria on the cake by 12,000%."
00:20:46,00:20:48,Wow. 120 times as much.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"I mean, how is that guy blowing?"
00:20:50,00:20:51,Yeah.
00:20:51,00:20:58,"But then we don't think that this is that dangerous, do we?"
00:20:58,00:20:59,"No, we don't."
00:20:59,00:21:00,Yeah.
00:21:00,00:21:03,"Well, just because basically these are bacteria probably"
00:21:03,00:21:06,"that unless someone's got the plague or something,"
00:21:06,00:21:08,"or someone's really ill, these are just bacteria"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"that we all have that kind of, you know,"
00:21:10,00:21:12,just because there's more bacteria on something
00:21:12,00:21:14,doesn't necessarily mean it's more dangerous.
00:21:14,00:21:17,"And a lot of the scientists who were told about this said,"
00:21:17,00:21:20,"actually, you know, the fact that you're reaching a lot of cake"
00:21:20,00:21:23,is a lot more important than the fact it's the bacteria.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Right.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"Yeah, like obesity is obviously more of a problem"
00:21:26,00:21:28,than just the odd little bacterium.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Yeah.
00:21:29,00:21:31,"But there is a solution to it, which there's a lady in America"
00:21:31,00:21:33,who's selling this now.
00:21:33,00:21:35,And she was at her aunt's 100th birthday.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"And as a result, when they were blowing out candles."
00:21:37,00:21:38,A lot of candles.
00:21:38,00:21:39,A lot of candles.
00:21:39,00:21:41,"And as a result of the lot of candles,"
00:21:41,00:21:44,they had three generations of family members blow out the candles.
00:21:44,00:21:46,And so she was stood watching it.
00:21:46,00:21:50,She just saw a sort of tidal wave of spit just come over the cake.
00:21:50,00:21:53,"And thought, oh, that's, I'll have the piece of that."
00:21:53,00:21:56,"And then later thought, I need to solve what this thing is."
00:21:56,00:21:59,"And so what you can buy in America now is a sort of,"
00:21:59,00:22:01,"before you blow out the candles,"
00:22:01,00:22:04,it's like a cake plastic sheet that you put over your cake.
00:22:04,00:22:05,Yeah.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"So what you do is you place that over the cake,"
00:22:07,00:22:09,"you blow out the candles, and then you take that off."
00:22:09,00:22:10,But it's see through.
00:22:10,00:22:12,So you can see your cake underneath it.
00:22:12,00:22:15,So it stops all the bacteria from going on it.
00:22:15,00:22:18,"That is, I know people say health and safety gone mad."
00:22:18,00:22:19,And they're annoying.
00:22:19,00:22:22,But I find that that is health and safety gone mad.
00:22:22,00:22:24,It's not dangerous.
00:22:24,00:22:26,"I mean, so it's something like 12% of bacteria"
00:22:26,00:22:29,"are related to being harmful at all to us, isn't it?"
00:22:29,00:22:31,And a lot of bacteria are good.
00:22:31,00:22:34,"You have, in the average hair brush,"
00:22:34,00:22:39,"you have 3,500 bacteria colonies per square inch."
00:22:39,00:22:41,So different colonies of different types of bacteria.
00:22:41,00:22:45,"One hair follicle contains 50,000 individual bacteria."
00:22:45,00:22:46,Wow.
00:22:46,00:22:47,But they're mainly fine.
00:22:47,00:22:48,They are fine.
00:22:48,00:22:50,The important thing to remember is the bacteria are basically fine.
00:22:50,00:22:52,"So there were loads of headlines this year saying,"
00:22:52,00:22:55,"""Beards are full of fecal bacteria."""
00:22:55,00:22:57,"So 20 beard owners in the room,"
00:22:57,00:23:00,the kinds of bacteria they're finding are absolutely not harmful.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"They're the kind of bacteria that might be found in the gut,"
00:23:02,00:23:05,but they might also not be found in the gut.
00:23:05,00:23:08,"And also, everything is covered in fecal bacteria."
00:23:08,00:23:11,There's one message you take away from tonight.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"That's true, actually."
00:23:13,00:23:15,I read that study about tooth brushes.
00:23:15,00:23:16,"Do you know when they say,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,don't keep your tooth brush in the bathroom
00:23:18,00:23:21,because you might get that fecal bacteria stuff on it?
00:23:21,00:23:24,"Well, it turns out that the fecal bacteria is everywhere anyway."
00:23:24,00:23:25,It's all over the back.
00:23:25,00:23:28,You can keep your tooth brush in the toilet if you use those truths.
00:23:28,00:23:29,That's the other thing.
00:23:29,00:23:33,"It always says there is more bacteria here than in your toilet,"
00:23:33,00:23:35,like on your chopping board or something like that.
00:23:35,00:23:37,"But you don't use bleach on your chopping board, do you?"
00:23:37,00:23:39,And you use bleach on your toilet.
00:23:39,00:23:41,So you're basically killing all the bacteria all the time.
00:23:41,00:23:44,But a lot of people use bleach on their bum.
00:23:44,00:23:46,And so probably it's removed bacteria before it's just...
00:23:46,00:23:47,What?
00:23:47,00:23:48,Sorry.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:23:50,00:23:53,Who has ever put bleach on their bum?
00:23:53,00:23:55,"Oh, this guy's hugged him, no."
00:23:55,00:24:01,What are you talking about?
00:24:01,00:24:02,I thought that was a thing.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"It's an only way as Essex thing, isn't it?"
00:24:04,00:24:06,"Yeah, I thought..."
00:24:06,00:24:09,"Oh, that's completely different then to just having a..."
00:24:09,00:24:12,"There's not why there's a bottle by the Lou, you know that?"
00:24:12,00:24:16,"Oh, wait."
00:24:16,00:24:17,"I mean, bleach is very toxic."
00:24:17,00:24:18,Don't do that.
00:24:18,00:24:20,It's not a Louro replacement thing.
00:24:20,00:24:21,No.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"I'll stop, Jesus."
00:24:23,00:24:26,"Actually, if you're going to take anything away from tonight's show,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,that's the thing you need to do.
00:24:28,00:24:30,James told me a fact ages ago.
00:24:30,00:24:32,It was probably my favourite fact of all time.
00:24:32,00:24:34,We're talking about bacteria in the gut.
00:24:34,00:24:39,"Apparently, bacteria inside your gut are farting all the time."
00:24:39,00:24:42,"They lit out little, little farts, tiny little farts."
00:24:42,00:24:45,"And when you, I'm talking about everyone listening"
00:24:45,00:24:46,and everyone here in the room.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"When you fart, you're not farting."
00:24:48,00:24:53,All you've done is collected a huge batch of bacteria fart
00:24:53,00:24:56,and you've just released it in one massive go.
00:24:56,00:24:58,Isn't that insane?
00:24:58,00:24:59,Isn't that nuts?
00:24:59,00:25:01,"That's like that, you know the scene in the Death Star"
00:25:01,00:25:03,when they're about to shoot and kill a planet
00:25:03,00:25:05,"and it's all those lasers going, ""Brrrr."""
00:25:05,00:25:07,That's that inside you.
00:25:07,00:25:09,What are you talking about?
00:25:09,00:25:10,And there you go.
00:25:10,00:25:12,And you let out.
00:25:12,00:25:13,What?
00:25:13,00:25:14,It's true.
00:25:14,00:25:15,What?
00:25:15,00:25:17,James told me.
00:25:17,00:25:18,Don't applaud that.
00:25:18,00:25:19,Don't applaud it.
00:25:19,00:25:22,James absolutely denies telling you the death star bit of the fact.
00:25:22,00:25:23,Which need to sleep out.
00:25:23,00:25:24,We get it.
00:25:24,00:25:25,It's like sweat.
00:25:25,00:25:26,"I mean, yeah."
00:25:26,00:25:28,"So, bacteria are things that make us smell not arse."
00:25:28,00:25:30,It doesn't go down well on a date when you explain that.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"So, it's a pointless piece of information you don't have."
00:25:33,00:25:36,There's these little things farting at you and then...
00:25:36,00:25:38,"And then, Justin, what are you collected?"
00:25:38,00:25:39,And then you release it.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"Sure, sure."
00:25:40,00:25:42,Has anyone got stuff on birthday cakes?
00:25:42,00:25:44,Literally nothing.
00:25:44,00:25:45,Let's hear it.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"So, okay."
00:25:47,00:25:48,Here's the thing.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"When you blow out a candle,"
00:25:50,00:25:53,what is the mechanism that's making it go out?
00:25:53,00:25:57,You blow and the flame falls over.
00:25:57,00:25:59,And it dies.
00:25:59,00:26:00,It's the...
00:26:00,00:26:04,You're rejecting carbon dioxide into the air and sucking the O2 away from it.
00:26:04,00:26:06,"It's a good guess, but it's not right."
00:26:06,00:26:07,Okay.
00:26:07,00:26:08,So...
00:26:08,00:26:09,Don't let's hear your extremely intelligent guess.
00:26:09,00:26:10,There's definitely going to be correct.
00:26:10,00:26:13,What's the soul's analogy that's like blowing out a birthday cake?
00:26:13,00:26:19,It's like the reverse of a lightsaber whereby you're bringing it...
00:26:19,00:26:20,"No, I don't know."
00:26:20,00:26:22,"It's pretty simple, actually."
00:26:22,00:26:23,"So, fire needs three things."
00:26:23,00:26:25,"It needs oxygen, fuel and heat."
00:26:25,00:26:28,"And when you blow, it's the temperature going down enough."
00:26:28,00:26:31,"So, the air pressure is causing the temperature to go down,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,which causes the fire to extinguish.
00:26:33,00:26:36,"So, how come when people do that thing where they go..."
00:26:36,00:26:39,And they can put it out with just like a judo chop?
00:26:39,00:26:42,"Again, it's just moving the air, isn't it, which changes the pressure levels."
00:26:42,00:26:45,And the idea of blowing out candles...
00:26:45,00:26:48,"It has happened quite a lot, but it only really became a proper thing"
00:26:48,00:26:53,after a codec advertisement showed some people blowing out some candles.
00:26:53,00:26:55,I think it was in the '50s or '60s.
00:26:55,00:26:58,Yeah. That's only when it became absolutely massive.
00:26:58,00:26:59,That's amazing.
00:26:59,00:27:01,"Oh, yeah, because there used to be those sort of candle thimbles"
00:27:01,00:27:03,"that you would sort of say, ""Goodnight."""
00:27:03,00:27:05,And you would put out the candle...
00:27:05,00:27:07,You said it at birthday parties.
00:27:07,00:27:11,People would ceremonially drench each candle in order on the cake.
00:27:11,00:27:13,"No, you know, it's like on a stick."
00:27:13,00:27:15,I don't know what they're talking about.
00:27:15,00:27:16,We still use them.
00:27:16,00:27:17,What?
00:27:17,00:27:18,"Well, that was a thing."
00:27:18,00:27:20,You're advised to use them because it's less dangerous.
00:27:20,00:27:21,You're advised to use...
00:27:21,00:27:23,"Yeah, but fire safety officials."
00:27:23,00:27:24,I've read that somewhere.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"I mean, not on a birthday cake."
00:27:26,00:27:27,Yeah.
00:27:27,00:27:28,But fire safety...
00:27:28,00:27:31,Fire officials don't use that to fight fire.
00:27:31,00:27:32,Do that.
00:27:32,00:27:33,"Oh, it's a big one."
00:27:33,00:27:34,All right.
00:27:34,00:27:37,We need longer sticks and bigger thimbles.
00:27:37,00:27:42,That's just one more thing on birthday cakes.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Yeah.
00:27:43,00:27:45,Most expensive birthday cake of all time.
00:27:45,00:27:47,$75 million.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Whoa!
00:27:48,00:27:53,It was bought by an unnamed buyer in the United Arab Emirates
00:27:53,00:27:55,for his daughter's birthday party.
00:27:55,00:27:57,"Actually, it was a joint birthday and engagement party."
00:27:57,00:28:00,"Also, really, it was only $37.5 million each time."
00:28:00,00:28:01,Great.
00:28:01,00:28:02,Yeah.
00:28:02,00:28:05,But it's a bit of a trick because the cake is pretty big
00:28:05,00:28:07,and obviously did cost a little bit of money.
00:28:07,00:28:10,"But it also has 4,000 diamonds on it."
00:28:10,00:28:11,Yeah.
00:28:11,00:28:13,"So, I mean, if you're just going to pour diamonds on something to say,"
00:28:13,00:28:14,that's the most expensive...
00:28:14,00:28:16,"You know, this is my most expensive shoe of all time"
00:28:16,00:28:18,because I poured a load of diamonds in it.
00:28:18,00:28:19,It's not part of the cake.
00:28:19,00:28:21,"If you can't eat it, it's not part of the cake."
00:28:21,00:28:22,Yeah.
00:28:22,00:28:25,Do you know that there's a fish you can use as candles?
00:28:25,00:28:26,What? What?
00:28:26,00:28:27,Yeah.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"There's a fish called the Eulicon Fish,"
00:28:30,00:28:34,"which some people say is where the word ""hooligan"" comes from,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,although that is quite dodgy atomology.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"Yeah, no, it's not."
00:28:38,00:28:40,But it's also called the candlefish.
00:28:40,00:28:43,And that's because it's got so much fat in its body
00:28:43,00:28:46,and during spawning that you can literally light one end of it.
00:28:46,00:28:48,And it burns like a weight like a candle.
00:28:48,00:28:50,"And so, like when we first went to North America,"
00:28:50,00:28:54,"and when it was first discovered by Westerners,"
00:28:54,00:28:58,then people used to catch these fish and use them as candles.
00:28:58,00:29:00,Imagine the kid's birthday party
00:29:00,00:29:02,where you come into the room with that.
00:29:02,00:29:05,Eight fish of light on the top of your cake.
00:29:05,00:29:08,But didn't they also have birds that they used as...
00:29:08,00:29:09,Yeah.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Are they full-mars or...?
00:29:10,00:29:11,"No, Venezuela."
00:29:11,00:29:12,In Venezuela.
00:29:12,00:29:14,And they're called oil birds.
00:29:14,00:29:16,And they used to just light one end.
00:29:16,00:29:17,Yeah.
00:29:17,00:29:18,They're so fatty.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"Oh, is that because Brian Blessed told me about this?"
00:29:21,00:29:22,Because he explored Venezuela.
00:29:22,00:29:25,"And he said, if you run out of wood or anything,"
00:29:25,00:29:28,you grab one of these birds and you ring them like a wet cloth.
00:29:28,00:29:30,And they leak the oils.
00:29:30,00:29:32,And then you light so you don't actually have to hurt...
00:29:32,00:29:35,"You probably hurt the bird in the ringing process, actually."
00:29:35,00:29:37,But that's doable.
00:29:37,00:29:40,I have a fact that combines birthdays and bacteria
00:29:40,00:29:42,that's not the original fact.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Wow.
00:29:43,00:29:44,All right.
00:29:44,00:29:49,Just that there was a doctor being interviewed by the telegraph.
00:29:49,00:29:50,This is a few years ago.
00:29:50,00:29:53,But he was giving health advice for how to avoid the spread of bacteria.
00:29:53,00:29:57,He recommended that the best place to sneeze is into your sleeve.
00:29:57,00:29:59,Because that's hygienic.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"And also that while washing your hands,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,you should sing happy birthday twice over.
00:30:04,00:30:09,"And I can confirm that if you do that in any kind of public bathroom,"
00:30:09,00:30:12,you get really weird looks.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"But when it got to the bit, happy birthday there,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,what did you say?
00:30:16,00:30:18,My hands.
00:30:18,00:30:25,"That's great because the second time round,"
00:30:25,00:30:26,"the guy next to you could be like,"
00:30:26,00:30:27,"""My hands."""
00:30:27,00:30:32,It's both of our hands birthdays on the same day.
00:30:32,00:30:34,The chances.
00:30:34,00:30:36,We should move on to our final facts.
00:30:36,00:30:38,Don't you want to go for something for me?
00:30:38,00:30:40,I've got some interesting stuff.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"Okay, let's move on to our final facts."
00:30:43,00:30:44,"Yeah, go for it."
00:30:44,00:30:48,"Well, there's a bacteria called Palagi back to Ubeek."
00:30:48,00:30:51,And there are so many of these things.
00:30:51,00:30:52,It is unreal.
00:30:52,00:30:55,"If you take part of the ocean,"
00:30:55,00:30:57,"at least some parts of the ocean,"
00:30:57,00:31:02,half of all the living cells will be this particular bacteria.
00:31:02,00:31:07,"Okay, there are two times 10 to the power of 28 of them in the world,"
00:31:07,00:31:11,"which means if every grain of sand on earth was a planet,"
00:31:11,00:31:14,"which contained the same number of humans as the rare on earth,"
00:31:14,00:31:18,that would be how many of the bacteria there are on earth at the moment.
00:31:18,00:31:22,"If every grain of sand on earth was a planet,"
00:31:22,00:31:24,"which had 7 billion people on it,"
00:31:24,00:31:27,then the total number of all of those people on all of those...
00:31:27,00:31:32,It's a number of bacteria that there are of this species in the world.
00:31:32,00:31:33,What are you saying?
00:31:33,00:31:35,He's saying this a lot.
00:31:35,00:31:39,"Thank you, Anna, for putting it into terms I can understand."
00:31:39,00:31:42,Can I just... My favourite bacteria is this...
00:31:42,00:31:44,We've all got one.
00:31:44,00:31:47,"But bacteria are amazing, but they're quite hard to envisage sometimes,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,but this is the second largest bacteria on earth.
00:31:49,00:31:51,People usually think it was the largest.
00:31:51,00:31:54,It's about the size of a full stop if you're reading a word document.
00:31:54,00:31:56,So that's... You can imagine that.
00:31:56,00:31:58,We're just quite exciting.
00:31:58,00:32:01,And it's called the official Sony bacteria.
00:32:01,00:32:04,It's called Epilopiscum Fischal Sony.
00:32:04,00:32:08,And the reason it's called Epilopiscum is because it only exists
00:32:08,00:32:11,in the intestines of surgeon fish.
00:32:11,00:32:13,So bacteria are very specific.
00:32:13,00:32:15,They only live in very specific environments.
00:32:15,00:32:17,So this one only lives in fish.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"So that's why it's called Epilopiscum,"
00:32:19,00:32:22,because Piscase means fish in that in.
00:32:22,00:32:25,But its other name is Fischal Sony.
00:32:25,00:32:30,"And by sheer coincidence, that's because it was discovered by a man called Lev Fischalson."
00:32:30,00:32:33,So it's the bacteria that lives solely in fish.
00:32:33,00:32:36,And then it was named by someone called Peggy Pollock.
00:32:36,00:32:38,No!
00:32:38,00:32:39,That is amazing.
00:32:39,00:32:42,"And did you know this first paper that we were just talking about,"
00:32:42,00:32:43,about the birthday cakes?
00:32:43,00:32:46,One of the authors of that paper was called Jonathan Baker.
00:32:46,00:32:48,Oh!
00:32:48,00:32:51,What almost bookend to this fax part?
00:32:51,00:32:54,"Yeah, it'd be nice to have had a laugh, but..."
00:32:54,00:32:57,"Oh, there we go. All right."
00:32:57,00:33:00,"OK, it is time for a final fact of the show,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,and that is Chazinski.
00:33:02,00:33:07,"My fact this week is that the first person to swim the Atlantic said,"
00:33:07,00:33:11,"""Never again, as soon as he was finished."
00:33:11,00:33:15,"He is now planning to swim the Pacific."""
00:33:15,00:33:17,This is amazing.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"It's this guy called Benoit Le Comte, and this is in 1998."
00:33:20,00:33:24,"He swam the Atlantic, and he came ashore in Brittany."
00:33:24,00:33:29,"In Brittany, he'd swam 3,800 miles basically from Cape Cod in Massachusetts."
00:33:29,00:33:33,"And literally his first words, I see a merge on the waterward, never again."
00:33:33,00:33:36,And now he's planning his Pacific trip.
00:33:36,00:33:38,It's going to happen in the next couple of years.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"Now, do we think he actually did the Atlantic thing?"
00:33:40,00:33:42,"It's a little bit controversial, isn't it?"
00:33:42,00:33:43,How far is that?
00:33:43,00:33:46,It's literally the number of miles that Anna just read out.
00:33:46,00:33:50,So if you rewind quickly on the podcast when you're listening back...
00:33:50,00:33:51,"Yeah, that's a lot."
00:33:51,00:33:56,"Oh, if you just listen in the first place, then that will also tell you how far it is."
00:33:56,00:33:58,"It's 3,800 miles."
00:33:58,00:33:59,"Thank you, Anna."
00:33:59,00:34:02,"So there's a bit of controversy about whether he swam the whole thing,"
00:34:02,00:34:05,because obviously there are currents which might have helped him along a bit.
00:34:05,00:34:08,"And his average speed was 8 miles an hour, the whole way,"
00:34:08,00:34:13,which is about three times as fast as other swimmers manage over long distances.
00:34:13,00:34:14,He did so far.
00:34:14,00:34:15,He may have been helped a bit.
00:34:15,00:34:18,But he was definitely in the water for a very long time.
00:34:18,00:34:21,He did well. And he was raising money for charity.
00:34:21,00:34:23,So he's raised a huge amount of money for charity.
00:34:23,00:34:25,And that's what he's doing again now.
00:34:25,00:34:29,And the way he does it is that he stops for the night.
00:34:29,00:34:30,He spends about eight hours a day.
00:34:30,00:34:31,He stops for the night.
00:34:31,00:34:33,The boat takes a GPS position of where he was.
00:34:33,00:34:35,"And then no matter how far the boat's drifted,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,"it has to go back to the position he was at,"
00:34:37,00:34:39,and then drop him in the next morning.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"Because there was a guy called Guy Delage,"
00:34:42,00:34:46,who was the first to swim across with the help of a kickboard.
00:34:46,00:34:49,"And a kickboard is one of those floats that you have in the swimming pool,"
00:34:49,00:34:51,"and you hold them, and then you, you know,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,"when you can't do the armpits of your swimming,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,but you're just pressing the leg bit.
00:34:55,00:34:56,So he did it with that.
00:34:56,00:34:59,"But when he wasn't swimming, he was sleeping on a raft,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,which didn't have this GPS thing.
00:35:01,00:35:05,And the raft would just float towards where he needed to go all the time.
00:35:05,00:35:07,"And basically, the longer he was sleeping,"
00:35:07,00:35:09,the longer he didn't have to swim.
00:35:09,00:35:13,"Which if it was me, I would just have slept the whole way."
00:35:13,00:35:14,That's the thing.
00:35:14,00:35:19,"And he had a, I think, he guy had a small sail on his raft as well."
00:35:19,00:35:20,Yes.
00:35:20,00:35:21,But he was still cool.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"And I think he's great as well, a bit of a hero,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,because he did it to escape debt.
00:35:25,00:35:27,So he basically had no money left.
00:35:27,00:35:28,"And he was like, what can I do?"
00:35:28,00:35:30,What's the obvious way I can raise money?
00:35:30,00:35:31,Swim the Atlantic.
00:35:31,00:35:32,And when--
00:35:32,00:35:34,"Oh, he wasn't just leaving the country to escape the--"
00:35:34,00:35:35,That's what I thought.
00:35:35,00:35:36,Yeah.
00:35:36,00:35:37,Sorry.
00:35:37,00:35:38,"No, he was good."
00:35:38,00:35:39,"And he had a shark phobia, Guy Delage."
00:35:39,00:35:40,So--
00:35:40,00:35:41,I don't know.
00:35:41,00:35:43,"I think shark phobia is the wrong way of putting that, isn't it?"
00:35:43,00:35:46,"Because a phobia has to be something that, you know,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,there's no real reason you should be scared of it.
00:35:48,00:35:51,"Whereas sharks, if you're swimming in the Atlantic,"
00:35:51,00:35:53,you're quite right to be scared of sharks.
00:35:53,00:35:55,"Yeah, if you don't have shark phobia, you would say,"
00:35:55,00:35:57,he is an insane man.
00:35:57,00:36:01,Do you know how marathon swimmers keep themselves going
00:36:01,00:36:03,during the race?
00:36:03,00:36:05,"No, you mean because they get tired or--"
00:36:05,00:36:06,They get tired.
00:36:06,00:36:08,"And so if you're swimming a marathon, you know,"
00:36:08,00:36:09,there's lots of kilometers.
00:36:09,00:36:12,"There was an interview with a Russian open-wall swimmer,"
00:36:12,00:36:16,an open-water swimming champion called Yevgeny Bezruzhenko.
00:36:16,00:36:19,And he wrote an article sharing the secrets of marathon swimming.
00:36:19,00:36:21,And he revealed that you need food
00:36:21,00:36:23,"and you normally need a concentrated gel, you know,"
00:36:23,00:36:26,"a really, really massive dose of sugar."
00:36:26,00:36:29,"But the only place, obviously, you're swimming, you're in trunks."
00:36:29,00:36:31,There is only one place you can keep it.
00:36:31,00:36:33,And that is inside your trunks as you swim.
00:36:33,00:36:35,So all the swimmers you see doing marathons
00:36:35,00:36:38,have little packets of food basically tucked into their pants.
00:36:38,00:36:39,No way!
00:36:39,00:36:41,And they have to get them out over the course of the race.
00:36:41,00:36:42,That's awesome.
00:36:42,00:36:44,"They should invent, like, trunks with pockets."
00:36:44,00:36:45,That would be good.
00:36:45,00:36:46,Do they not have pockets?
00:36:46,00:36:47,Yeah.
00:36:47,00:36:48,There's normally a little one for your locker key.
00:36:48,00:36:51,"But I think at the competitive level,"
00:36:51,00:36:53,they may not even have those.
00:36:53,00:36:59,Did you know that the US Navy have their own secret military swimming stroke?
00:36:59,00:37:00,Yes.
00:37:00,00:37:01,They do.
00:37:01,00:37:02,They do.
00:37:02,00:37:03,They don't do.
00:37:03,00:37:04,They do.
00:37:04,00:37:05,They do.
00:37:05,00:37:06,They do.
00:37:06,00:37:07,They don't mate.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"So US Navy seals, they have this stroke"
00:37:10,00:37:12,called the combat swimmer stroke.
00:37:12,00:37:14,And it looks so daft.
00:37:14,00:37:17,"But it's a combination of breaststroke and freestyle,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,which I did not know was a thing.
00:37:19,00:37:20,But...
00:37:20,00:37:22,Is it breaststroke legs and freestyle arms?
00:37:22,00:37:25,"Basically, you have to go on your side in the water"
00:37:25,00:37:27,and then you kick in an odd way.
00:37:27,00:37:28,And then you use your arms in another way.
00:37:28,00:37:31,"But basically, it makes you harder to spot underwater."
00:37:31,00:37:33,And it's called the combat swimmer stroke.
00:37:33,00:37:34,Wow!
00:37:34,00:37:35,It means that if you're trying to infiltrate...
00:37:35,00:37:37,You're harder to spot because you're basically sinking
00:37:37,00:37:39,because you can't swim like that.
00:37:39,00:37:40,Yes.
00:37:40,00:37:42,Can I just say a combination of breaststroke and freestyle
00:37:42,00:37:44,is just freestyle because the whole point of freestyle
00:37:44,00:37:45,is that it's anything you want.
00:37:45,00:37:46,That's true.
00:37:46,00:37:48,It just happens that freestyle is the fastest stroke.
00:37:48,00:37:51,"So if I'm swimming breaststroke, am I also swimming freestyle?"
00:37:51,00:37:52,You sure are.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"If you're swimming that in a race, you're a swimming freestyle"
00:37:54,00:37:55,and be an absolute idiot.
00:37:55,00:37:56,But yeah.
00:37:56,00:37:58,"In a freestyle race, you're allowed to go anywhere you want."
00:37:58,00:37:59,Really?
00:37:59,00:38:01,So what you're thinking of is Sprunk Crull.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"That's what I thought I thought freestyle was, Frank Crull."
00:38:03,00:38:05,It is Frank Crull because that's the fastest.
00:38:05,00:38:07,But why do you think it was called freestyle?
00:38:07,00:38:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:08,00:38:09,You're not going to go...
00:38:09,00:38:11,I'll do breaststroke on this one.
00:38:11,00:38:12,Yeah.
00:38:12,00:38:13,Can I stick up for breaststroke?
00:38:13,00:38:16,"Well, as the fastest swimmings have the fastest,"
00:38:16,00:38:17,but as the nicest.
00:38:17,00:38:19,"Yeah, but where do you mean the Olympics?"
00:38:19,00:38:21,There's no points for niceness.
00:38:21,00:38:23,You're joking.
00:38:23,00:38:27,You were shit at Sparta School.
00:38:27,00:38:31,"Do you know bats, when they swim,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,they tested to see if bats could swim.
00:38:33,00:38:34,"First of all, yeah, I didn't know this one."
00:38:34,00:38:36,"Yeah, so bats can swim."
00:38:36,00:38:39,"Obviously, they don't do it out of just a daily exercise."
00:38:39,00:38:42,They do it in circumstances where they're suddenly in water
00:38:42,00:38:43,for a reason they shouldn't be.
00:38:43,00:38:44,Right.
00:38:44,00:38:46,Have I explained myself well enough?
00:38:46,00:38:47,Perfectly.
00:38:47,00:38:49,They do the butterfly.
00:38:49,00:38:50,So they... when they're winged.
00:38:50,00:38:51,That's due butterfly.
00:38:51,00:38:52,Do butterflies.
00:38:52,00:38:53,Do that.
00:38:53,00:38:54,Do the bats.
00:38:54,00:38:57,They do batstroke.
00:38:57,00:38:58,Yeah.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Oh.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Yeah.
00:39:00,00:39:06,"So the longest ever journey swimming was 5,268 kilometers."
00:39:06,00:39:10,And it was down the Amazon River through Peru and Brazil.
00:39:10,00:39:12,"And it was done by a guy called Martin Strrell,"
00:39:12,00:39:13,who's from Slovenia.
00:39:13,00:39:15,And he is pretty awesome.
00:39:15,00:39:16,"Atri, he did it."
00:39:16,00:39:17,They asked him about it.
00:39:17,00:39:19,"And he said, you know, they're like, how did you manage this?"
00:39:19,00:39:23,"And he says, well, my body is pretty special."
00:39:23,00:39:24,Wow.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"He says, I never hurt or sick."
00:39:26,00:39:29,"And if everyone were like me, all of the hospitals around the world"
00:39:29,00:39:31,would be completely empty.
00:39:31,00:39:37,And he says he drinks either one or two bottles of wine every day.
00:39:37,00:39:41,But it's special Slovenian wine that you can't buy outside Slovenia.
00:39:41,00:39:43,And it just helps you be an awesome swimmer.
00:39:43,00:39:44,Does it?
00:39:44,00:39:45,Yeah.
00:39:45,00:39:47,"And he said, do you know what the worst thing is"
00:39:47,00:39:50,"if you're swimming the Amazon, what the biggest danger is?"
00:39:50,00:39:54,Getting your legs chewed off by piranhas.
00:39:54,00:39:55,By piranhas.
00:39:55,00:39:57,So he was attacked by piranhas a few times.
00:39:57,00:39:59,And he found a good way of preventing them
00:39:59,00:40:02,by pouring buckets of putrid blood into the water.
00:40:02,00:40:04,And they went for the putrid blood instead.
00:40:04,00:40:08,"He also said, and I don't really believe this because he said,"
00:40:08,00:40:11,I learned not to pee in the water because there are kandiru.
00:40:11,00:40:12,And you guys probably know kandiru.
00:40:12,00:40:15,They're the tiny fish that are supposed to swim up into your penis
00:40:15,00:40:16,if you're swimming.
00:40:16,00:40:17,"But they don't, do they?"
00:40:17,00:40:18,But they don't.
00:40:18,00:40:20,So I think he's been told a bit of a--
00:40:20,00:40:21,I thought they did.
00:40:21,00:40:22,"No, they didn't."
00:40:22,00:40:24,I thought the thing they didn't do was
00:40:24,00:40:26,"if you're having a pee into the Amazon off the bank,"
00:40:26,00:40:28,they don't swim up the urine.
00:40:28,00:40:29,Yeah.
00:40:29,00:40:31,I think we can all agree they definitely don't do that.
00:40:31,00:40:32,"OK, so it's common ground."
00:40:32,00:40:34,"But anyway, he said the kandiru was bad."
00:40:34,00:40:38,But the worst thing apparently was the women of the Amazon.
00:40:38,00:40:42,"And he said, you can often see 15 to 20 times more women than men."
00:40:42,00:40:44,And the women are very aggressive
00:40:44,00:40:47,and they try and catch you and marry you.
00:40:47,00:40:51,This-- and they're worse than the piranhas.
00:40:51,00:40:55,This guy has a-- I must say a very high opinion of himself.
00:40:55,00:40:56,My body's great.
00:40:56,00:40:57,I've got magic wine.
00:40:57,00:41:01,And the ladies of the Amazon cannot get enough.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"Hey, we need to wrap up shortly."
00:41:03,00:41:05,Do you guys have anything before we do?
00:41:05,00:41:09,Can I just say a fact that we got sent actually in the interval
00:41:09,00:41:12,and it's amazing and it's about swimming.
00:41:12,00:41:15,"And it's from a guy called Theo,"
00:41:15,00:41:18,who all I know is you're called Theo on your age 12.
00:41:18,00:41:19,Yeah.
00:41:19,00:41:20,Are you here?
00:41:20,00:41:21,"OK, great."
00:41:21,00:41:22,"Hi, Theo."
00:41:22,00:41:25,So this fact is incredible.
00:41:25,00:41:28,Tigers always get in the water backwards
00:41:28,00:41:33,"because they love swimming, but they hate getting their eyes wet."
00:41:33,00:41:34,Isn't that amazing?
00:41:34,00:41:35,I checked it.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"I was like, that must not be true."
00:41:37,00:41:38,I must know it.
00:41:38,00:41:40,So they put their paws up on the bank
00:41:40,00:41:42,and then just kick with their back legs.
00:41:42,00:41:46,Like old ladies at the swimming pool.
00:41:46,00:41:50,"All right, amazing flag for you."
00:41:50,00:41:51,Should we wrap up?
00:41:51,00:41:52,"OK, that's it."
00:41:52,00:41:53,That is all of our facts.
00:41:53,00:41:54,Thank you so much for listening.

00:42:20,00:42:22,"to one of the members of this audience here in Coventry,"
00:42:22,00:42:24,who's sent us a fact that we have picked out.
00:42:24,00:42:25,Who's got the fact?
00:42:25,00:42:26,I have it.
00:42:26,00:42:30,"It's a shame after you just read out that really cool tiger one,"
00:42:30,00:42:31,because this is quite low-brow.
00:42:31,00:42:35,But I can only blame the people of Coventry.
00:42:35,00:42:39,And it is that places in Canada include
00:42:39,00:42:44,"Shaga's Cove, Dildo, and Balls Falls."
