00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:23.480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Coventry!

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.680
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:42.920
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Annotzzynski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin, and once again someone is still clapping.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.960
 What is going on there?

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:53.000
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Starting this week with my fact, my fact this week is that in the annual Lady Godiva parade, which famously celebrates a lady who rode naked through Coventry, not only does the rider always wear clothes, but one year even the horse wore trousers.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 It's the trousered horse.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 How did the horse wear the trousers? Did it wear them over its back end, or did it wear them on all four legs?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 It had all four legs.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 There's a photo, you can see it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 So it actually wore two pairs of trousers?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Yeah, it wore two pairs of trousers.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 That's amazing, and it was in the early 20th century, right?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 It was 1919.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 It was a Lady Godiva parade, and amazingly these beautiful photos that you can see of the event.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 They are. I think she was an actress called Gladys Mann, which is ironic because she's a woman, and she...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Actually, wasn't it true that the first Lady Godiva's who did these things were all men?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Why didn't I?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 I think they were. Yeah, the first one was we know he was the son of James Swinnerton.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Don't know what his name was.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Wow. Do you know what it was?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 What an irritating thing to be called, going through life.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Hello, I'm the son of James Swinnerton.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Do you have a name?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Yes, that's my name.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 He was paid 15 shillings to do that.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 But it's been kind of sporadic, hasn't it, that Lady Godiva parades throughout history,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 and they've been variously banned and then dropped, and they've come back.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 In the 19th century, I think they really caught on them.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 People were parading through the streets, and in the 1840s, they really became a big thing again,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 and there'd be someone cast as Lady Godiva every time.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 And at first, it would be someone who was made to appear like she was naked.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 In 1842, there was an actress or a performer who was wearing a tight-fitting, flesh-colored dress,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 like a kind of a onesie, but to make it look like she's naked.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And then people were outraged. They were all these complaints.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And I was looking in the British newspaper archive, and they were saying it's depraved, you know,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 it's encouraged the profligate youth of Coventry to gratify a depraved taste.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Only profligate youth of Coventry in tonight?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 They referred to her as a brazen harlot, the poor poor woman who dressed in a onesie on horseback.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 I read someone referred to, it was a bishop of Worcester, who referred to her as a Birmingham whore

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 being paraded through the streets.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And it seemed like he was more bothered that she was from Birmingham than anything.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 We should very quickly say who Lady Godiva was or wasn't.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 So the idea is just for anyone listening overseas, she was a noble woman,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 and in protest against her husband raising taxes, she rode through the streets of Coventry,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 naked, except for her very long hair, which she had woven into a kind of hair bikini.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 No, that's not true.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So that's the idea, and that she was trying to persuade him to lower the taxes.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Well, we don't think it happened.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 No.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 It's probably a myth. It was in the 11th century, but I think the first reference to it was about 200 years later.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 But it's a myth that's, you know, very much still celebrated.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 In the Olympics, there was a 20-foot tall Lady Godiva built.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And it traveled on a purpose built 50-seat bicycle.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Because it was transported down to London.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Wow.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And then back again, it briefly got stuck going around the ring road on a tight bend.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And the woman who ran the company said that Lady Godiva had suffered a little bit of whiplash from tree branches

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 and suffered rain damage and some scratches.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And she added, she looked like she'd had the best night out.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 The other thing about it being a myth is that basically it was against taxes.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 But people have looked back at what Coventry was like back then.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 And probably the people who were here weren't really bothered about taxes.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 One person said that in those days, Coventry was just an inconsequential group of surfs living in single-story hovels.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Whereas Coventry now has two-story buildings, I think.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Very bold.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 I know.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 So brave.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 I literally was about to pack my stuff up and go, OK, that's the evening over.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 So you were saying about the skin type clothing being seen as a bit of a disgrace.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 I read a story that it caused a lot of chaos because people thought that she was naked.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Therefore, everyone who came to see the parade suddenly really wanted to get close to see the parade.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 And riots sort of broke out and people fought each other because they thought there was a naked person on the horse.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Yeah.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 That was one of the reasons I think it was considered so immoral in Victorian era.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Yeah, because these riots started.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Everyone got really pissed and they stared at this maybe naked woman.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 And then they all got really drunk and descended into debauchery at night, apparently.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Wow.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And every year they'd be like, this year she's definitely going to be naked as she never was.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 You heard of a pruporetta?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 No.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Is that only heard of pruporetta?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Yeah.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 So for 25 years in a row, she was the same Lady Godiva.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 She was the Lady Godiva more than the original Lady Godiva who only did it once.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Pruporetta did it 25 times.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Or even no times.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Lady Godiva didn't even do it.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Pruporetta is the real Lady Godiva.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 And she got an MBE for her troubles.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Yeah.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 She's only recently retired from the game.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 What did they pin it to?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 I guess that there might be quite a lot of Godiva businesses in Coventry.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 So I checked on the internet and I was not disappointed.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 There is Godiva fire extinguishers.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Godiva granite.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Godiva insurance.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Godiva windows.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Godiva fish shop.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Godiva dentists.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Animal care.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Chiropractors.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Glass wines.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Hypnotherapy.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Plumbing.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Fencing.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Cafe.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Barbers.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Carpets.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 And Godiva tailoring.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Wow.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Which I love.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 It's somebody who has no clothes.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 I think it's brilliant.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Yeah.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Let's get your clothes off to get those measurements.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 You're done.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 I also think a very clever thing.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 I don't know if Godiva windows has done this.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 But what I would have done is the whole point of Godiva was that all the people who lived in Coventry

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 had to go inside and not look at her, right?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 And the story of peeping Tom comes from the Lady Godiva story because he snuck out

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 and did try to catch a glimpse and then he was blinded.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 And so, if you were making Godiva windows, you should actually make opaque windows.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 And I don't know if they do that as a business.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 I don't know if that would be particularly fruitful, but that's what I would do.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 So, like doors, basically.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 (Laughter)

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Those door windows.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 I mean, that's what they call doors in Coventry.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 I did a little bit on naked protests.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Oh, okay.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 So, because people keep on protesting as Lady Godiva.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 So, this May in Gloucester, a woman called Anna Dart, rode a horse dressed only in body paint.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 She was dressed in body paint.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Not the horse.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 The horse didn't even bother wearing body paint, disgusting.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 To protest against Gloucestershire County Council's planned new incinerator.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 (Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 In 2011, a man dressed as Lady Godiva and he rode through the Lancashire village of Holtan

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 to protest against new Haitian to M6 Link Road.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And, my favourite one, in 2006, a dozen people in a Canadian town,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 it's called Lida, in Saskatchewan.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 They posed naked in potholes on a local highway

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 and then made a calendar, a nude calendar of themselves,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 in these potholes to spread the message that they wanted the council to fix the potholes.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 (Laughter)

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 And the local organizer, the organizer, the guy behind it,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 said that most of the people in the calendar were very reluctant,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 but he did add there was one guy, we couldn't get him to keep his clothes on.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 (Laughter)

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And the Guardian reported that just four years later, the highway was repaired.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 (Laughter)

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 So, it absolutely works like a charm.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 I read a thing about in France, there's a small town that has been having a problem with their naked hero,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 which is Heracles, and basically they have a statue of him naked,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 but the town seems to have a lot of cheeky vandals who keep chiseling the penis off of the naked god.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 And so, what they did was they kept replacing it,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 and then they'd come back a few days later or whatever,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 someone again, cheeky chiseler comes along and takes away the penis,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 and they were like, we don't know what to do.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 So, what they ended up doing, because it was a very important spot where they do a lot of ceremonies,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 they made a sort of extra special penis that they then, whenever they do a ceremony,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 just before the ceremony starts, they come up to it, put the penis on,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 and they're like, there's going to be a ceremony today, and they guard it,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 and then they do the ceremony, and once whatever the ribbons been cut or whatever,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 they go, thank you all good night, and then they take the penis off again,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 and bring it back to the office.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 So, it's a ceremonial penis that is constantly attached for important days.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Did you say that was in France?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Yeah, it was. It was a town called Arcacheon.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Sure.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Just because I just have just a coincidence about France and Germany,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 and that is that the pioneers of the natureist movements in France were called Albert and Christine LeCoc,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 and one of the leading lights of German natureism was called Adolf Coc.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 No way!

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 And they're both basically the most important natureists in France and Germany,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 a called Coc and LeCoc.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Wow.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 That's great.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Do you know how she's speaking of Adolfs?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Ah, we've reached the Hitler point in the show, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 I'm trying to get it into every live show of our tour.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Hitler banned nudism, and then immediately reintroduced it.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 So, it was quite a big thing in Germany in the early 20th century,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 and the Nazis still, it wasn't very good, and so they banned it in 1933,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 and then they shut down all the nudist clubs across Germany.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 And then in 1934, they immediately changed their mind,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 and allowed people to just attend Nazi-approved nudist clubs.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 So, even he's softened on that one thing.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 What?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Yeah, I think it's a bit late to reclaim the reputation, Emma.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Okay, why don't we move on to our second fact of the night,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 and that is James Harkin.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the worst basketball coach

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 in the history of the University of Kansas

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 is James Naesmith, the man who invented basketball.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 It's amazing.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 He is the only coach of that university who has a losing record.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 Every single other person was a winner, and he invented the game.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Yeah.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 But he was just learning how to do it.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 But so was everyone.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Yeah, it's free.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 He was against coaching, wasn't he?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Which partly explains it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 So one of his students went on to be one of the greatest basketball coaches ever.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Someone called Fog Allen.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 And when he told his tutor, Naesmith, who invented basketball,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 that he was going to try and coach it,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Naesmith just said, "You cannot coach basketball, you just play it."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 And so, yeah, he didn't believe in it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 It was a slightly different game in those days.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 There was nine against nine, and they used a football, a soccer ball,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 instead of a basketball, because they haven't been invented yet.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 And dribbling wasn't allowed.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 So he's a bit more like netball, actually.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 And there was no hole in the bottom of the basket, was there?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Yeah.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 They just put a load of peach baskets up there,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 and they put it through it in, and then he had to climb up and get it out,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 and then play again.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Yeah.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 And he thought, Naesmith thought the introduction of the hole in the basket was a grave error.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 He thought that was a mistake.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Yeah.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Can you imagine Michael Jordan getting a ladder every time he gets a fight?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 The first ever game of basketball ended in a massive brawl.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 In fact, I had a brawl after about five minutes.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 So he invented it because he was teaching school boys,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 and his class were really badly behaved, they were very naughty,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 and the weather was bad, so they couldn't go outside and let off steam.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 So he invented the game, and he just gave them one rule.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 So the only rule is to get the ball in the basket,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 and immediately they started a fight with each other.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 He said they started tackling kicking and punching,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 and before he managed to intercede, several had black eyes,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 one had dislocated his shoulder, and another had literally been knocked out.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Oh, my God.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 So in America at the moment, there's quite a lot of controversy with basketball in schools,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 and the reason for that is coaches keep getting fired for their teams winning by so much.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Really?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 So they have this thing in American sports,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 where once you're winning by a certain amount, you should really stop trying,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 and you shouldn't keep what they call it as running up the score.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 So there was a guy who won 100 nil recently, who was the head of his team, he got fired.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 There was someone who won 161-2, and they got fired as well.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 And is the idea that you're not teaching them to be good sportsmen basically?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Exactly, yeah.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 I love it.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 I really like that.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Yeah.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 I can see who was shit at Spartan school.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 You know, we think of basketball as an American sport predominantly,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 but there's so many countries around the world that play it.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 In a very big way, and the one that surprised me most when I was looking into this is Bhutan.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 The royal family of Bhutan are obsessed with basketball,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 and I read an article where the current queen of Bhutan,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 they followed a match that she played.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 So she's in a team, and when she comes to the match,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 when she comes out through the locker rooms to the main court,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 they roll out a red carpet.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Yeah, and they have a like a thrown-like thing there.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Did they have to roll out the red carpet all over the court as she moves around?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Yes, they got to stay in front of her.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Just peddling it out.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Yeah.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 No, and so she played a match.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 This is the match they observed, and she scored 34 points in that match.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Three rebounds and four assists.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 If you know the scoring system of basketball, that's incredibly high.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 And so they were like, either she's incredibly amazing at basketball,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 or it may have something to do with the fact that Bhutan is custom for Bid's citizens

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 from touching the royals without any invitation.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Therefore, any time she's got the ball, people have to be like, "Oh, no!"

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 But isn't basketball a non-contact spot?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 I mean, you're hitting it.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Technically it is, but it's a very aggressive sport,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 and there's a lot of blocking, and there's a lot of stuff like that.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 And there's a quote from someone who they interviewed afterwards saying,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 "You know, the queen's really good, and how did you find it?"

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Because the one person they interviewed actually fouled the queen,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 which goes against the rules of the country.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And yet, as she said, I fouled the queen once.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 I was a little scared, but she said it was okay.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 And she said, "She wants us to check her, and she gets mad if we don't.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 She thinks we're scared of her. We are very scared of her."

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 But do you know that that's not the Bhutanese royal family's favourite sport?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Actually, their favourite sport is darts.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Is it?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Yeah, because in Bhutan, darts is like the national sport,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 but they are massive darts.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 They're about, "You hold them in your hand like this."

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 I mean, not great for a podcast.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 But you hold them with your full palm, and then you launch them,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 and it's about the same distance as this stage,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 and you throw it from one side to the other,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 and they have an archery target that you have to throw it into.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 And one team stands next to the target and tries to insult the other guys before you throw it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Why don't you do that?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 I don't do that at all.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 I know. It's unbelievably dangerous.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 They encourage things to them to encourage them to keep on aim.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Yeah, but then you want to win as well, right?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Yeah, I can think of a way of winning.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Kill the other guys with your darts. What are they going to do?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 At worst, that's a foul, you know.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Do you guys remember the film Space Jam?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Yeah, Michael Jordan.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 It's a Looney Tunes film with some humans in, like Who Frame Roger Rabbit.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Last year, there was a journalist called Jalen Cook

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 who analysed the Space Jam film through actual NBA rules,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 and it's just a very funny write-up.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 So he said, "One minute 31.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Silvestre the Cat tries to swallow Tweety Bird, his own teammate, Hall."

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 There is nothing in the NBA rulebook that explicitly says,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 "You can't eat your teammate's while a game is in progress."

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 One minute 50.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Foghorn Leghorn is incinerated by Barry.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 That is easily a flagrant two-fowl.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 It is also attempted murder.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 You know, it's that Michael Jordan was in that film, obviously,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 and is, people say, the greatest possible playable time.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 But he's also a great leader in basketball fashion,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 because if you watch basketball now, they've all got these really baggy shorts on,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 and that's because of him.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 So until he played, then everyone wore tight shorts,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 and then he thought that it was good luck for him to wear his old uni,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 his old college shorts underneath his basketball shorts.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 So he never played a single game without wearing two pairs of shorts.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 And I imagine boxes, which I count as shorts,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 so three pairs of shorts, Michael Jordan's always wearing.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And that meant that the NBA had to make his shorts baggy,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 so they could fit these, you know, two other pairs of shorts underneath it.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Yeah, I am wearing three pairs of pants now.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Yeah, two right. Otherwise.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Otherwise, people aren't safe.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 I was reading about someone else called Jason Terry,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 who is an NBA player,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 and he's a lot of superstition in sport, obviously,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 and Jason Terry plays at the moment,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 but he has to sleep in his opponent's shorts the night before a match.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Well, while the opponent's wearing them are...

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Well, they need to be shorts from the opposing team that have been played in.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 And so apparently, he has contacts throughout the NBA,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 so he can email them and be like,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 "Sorry, could you send me your shorts, you know my thing?"

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 And he has shorts from all the opposing teams,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 so he can sleep in them before the match.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 I'd like to clarify, I'm not wearing anyone else's pants right now.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Is it kind of so that once he's been in their shorts,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 he knows how to beat them?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 I don't know. Let's not talk about beating in someone else's shorts.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 I don't know.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 He didn't justify it.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Just quickly, a weird thing that I saw in Canada this year,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 a basketball player finally got the right to use his surname on his jersey,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 which has been very contentious. He's from Brazil.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 He got transferred over, and there's been huge problems with it.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 And yeah, he's been in the news for it as a result.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 The quote he said is, "It's my last name, I'm proud of it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 It doesn't matter if it means something bad."

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 He says it's pronounced Fouquet,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 and that's how he's trying to get...

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 I mean, maybe it definitely probably is, right?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 I think he knows his name, but he was censored for ages,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 so he wasn't allowed to wear a jersey.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And finally, because the team's doing well, they're like,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 "Okay, you can have it."

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 So now that's going back and forth on a basketball court.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Wow. Yeah.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 It just reminds me just slightly off topic,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 but there is a college footballer who will probably go into NFL soon

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 in America whose name is Lion King.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Oh, that's so cool.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Imagine if you're Mr. and Mrs. King.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Yeah. What should we call our son, Mufasa?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 We should move on to our dayx factor, right?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 My factor is that blowing out the candles on a birthday cake

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 increases the number of bacteria on it by 1,400%.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Yeah.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Next time you have a birthday, think about this.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 So there were a lot of scientists who wanted to test that, you know,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 what happens when you breathe out,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 and whether, as they said, bio-era souls in human breath

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 expelled from the mouth may be a source of bacteria.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 So they simulated a birthday party among themselves,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 which I would kill to have been at.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 They ate some pizza to get their salivary glands going,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 and then they had a cake set up and they blew all over it,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 blowing the candles out.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And that's just the average was 1,400%.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 So that's not the worst.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 In one case, someone breathing out and blowing out all the candles

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 increased the bacteria on the cake by 12,000%.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Wow. 120 times as much.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 I mean, how is that guy blowing?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Yeah.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 But then we don't think that this is that dangerous, do we?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 No, we don't.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Yeah.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Well, just because basically these are bacteria probably

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 that unless someone's got the plague or something,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 or someone's really ill, these are just bacteria

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 that we all have that kind of, you know,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 just because there's more bacteria on something

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 doesn't necessarily mean it's more dangerous.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 And a lot of the scientists who were told about this said,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 actually, you know, the fact that you're reaching a lot of cake

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 is a lot more important than the fact it's the bacteria.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Right.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Yeah, like obesity is obviously more of a problem

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 than just the odd little bacterium.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Yeah.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 But there is a solution to it, which there's a lady in America

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 who's selling this now.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 And she was at her aunt's 100th birthday.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 And as a result, when they were blowing out candles.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 A lot of candles.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 A lot of candles.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And as a result of the lot of candles,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 they had three generations of family members blow out the candles.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 And so she was stood watching it.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 She just saw a sort of tidal wave of spit just come over the cake.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 And thought, oh, that's, I'll have the piece of that.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 And then later thought, I need to solve what this thing is.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 And so what you can buy in America now is a sort of,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 before you blow out the candles,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 it's like a cake plastic sheet that you put over your cake.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Yeah.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 So what you do is you place that over the cake,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 you blow out the candles, and then you take that off.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 But it's see through.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 So you can see your cake underneath it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 So it stops all the bacteria from going on it.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 That is, I know people say health and safety gone mad.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 And they're annoying.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 But I find that that is health and safety gone mad.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 It's not dangerous.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 I mean, so it's something like 12% of bacteria

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 are related to being harmful at all to us, isn't it?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 And a lot of bacteria are good.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 You have, in the average hair brush,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 you have 3,500 bacteria colonies per square inch.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 So different colonies of different types of bacteria.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 One hair follicle contains 50,000 individual bacteria.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Wow.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 But they're mainly fine.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 They are fine.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 The important thing to remember is the bacteria are basically fine.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 So there were loads of headlines this year saying,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 "Beards are full of fecal bacteria."

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 So 20 beard owners in the room,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 the kinds of bacteria they're finding are absolutely not harmful.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 They're the kind of bacteria that might be found in the gut,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 but they might also not be found in the gut.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 And also, everything is covered in fecal bacteria.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 There's one message you take away from tonight.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 That's true, actually.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 I read that study about tooth brushes.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Do you know when they say,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 don't keep your tooth brush in the bathroom

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 because you might get that fecal bacteria stuff on it?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Well, it turns out that the fecal bacteria is everywhere anyway.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 It's all over the back.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 You can keep your tooth brush in the toilet if you use those truths.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 That's the other thing.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 It always says there is more bacteria here than in your toilet,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 like on your chopping board or something like that.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 But you don't use bleach on your chopping board, do you?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And you use bleach on your toilet.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 So you're basically killing all the bacteria all the time.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 But a lot of people use bleach on their bum.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 And so probably it's removed bacteria before it's just...

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 What?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Sorry.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Who has ever put bleach on their bum?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Oh, this guy's hugged him, no.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 What are you talking about?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 I thought that was a thing.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 It's an only way as Essex thing, isn't it?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Yeah, I thought...

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Oh, that's completely different then to just having a...

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 There's not why there's a bottle by the Lou, you know that?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Oh, wait.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 I mean, bleach is very toxic.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 Don't do that.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 It's not a Louro replacement thing.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 No.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 I'll stop, Jesus.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Actually, if you're going to take anything away from tonight's show,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 that's the thing you need to do.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 James told me a fact ages ago.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 It was probably my favourite fact of all time.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 We're talking about bacteria in the gut.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Apparently, bacteria inside your gut are farting all the time.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 They lit out little, little farts, tiny little farts.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And when you, I'm talking about everyone listening

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 and everyone here in the room.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 When you fart, you're not farting.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 All you've done is collected a huge batch of bacteria fart

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 and you've just released it in one massive go.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Isn't that insane?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Isn't that nuts?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 That's like that, you know the scene in the Death Star

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 when they're about to shoot and kill a planet

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 and it's all those lasers going, "Brrrr."

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 That's that inside you.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 What are you talking about?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 And there you go.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 And you let out.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 What?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 It's true.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 What?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 James told me.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Don't applaud that.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Don't applaud it.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 James absolutely denies telling you the death star bit of the fact.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 Which need to sleep out.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 We get it.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 It's like sweat.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 I mean, yeah.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 So, bacteria are things that make us smell not arse.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 It doesn't go down well on a date when you explain that.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 So, it's a pointless piece of information you don't have.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 There's these little things farting at you and then...

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And then, Justin, what are you collected?

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 And then you release it.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Sure, sure.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Has anyone got stuff on birthday cakes?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Literally nothing.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Let's hear it.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 So, okay.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Here's the thing.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 When you blow out a candle,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 what is the mechanism that's making it go out?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 You blow and the flame falls over.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 And it dies.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 It's the...

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 You're rejecting carbon dioxide into the air and sucking the O2 away from it.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 It's a good guess, but it's not right.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 Okay.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 So...

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Don't let's hear your extremely intelligent guess.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 There's definitely going to be correct.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 What's the soul's analogy that's like blowing out a birthday cake?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 It's like the reverse of a lightsaber whereby you're bringing it...

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 No, I don't know.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 It's pretty simple, actually.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 So, fire needs three things.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 It needs oxygen, fuel and heat.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 And when you blow, it's the temperature going down enough.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 So, the air pressure is causing the temperature to go down,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 which causes the fire to extinguish.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 So, how come when people do that thing where they go...

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And they can put it out with just like a judo chop?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Again, it's just moving the air, isn't it, which changes the pressure levels.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 And the idea of blowing out candles...

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 It has happened quite a lot, but it only really became a proper thing

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 after a codec advertisement showed some people blowing out some candles.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 I think it was in the '50s or '60s.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Yeah. That's only when it became absolutely massive.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 That's amazing.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Oh, yeah, because there used to be those sort of candle thimbles

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 that you would sort of say, "Goodnight."

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And you would put out the candle...

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 You said it at birthday parties.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 People would ceremonially drench each candle in order on the cake.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 No, you know, it's like on a stick.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 I don't know what they're talking about.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 We still use them.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 What?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Well, that was a thing.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 You're advised to use them because it's less dangerous.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 You're advised to use...

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Yeah, but fire safety officials.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 I've read that somewhere.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 I mean, not on a birthday cake.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Yeah.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 But fire safety...

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Fire officials don't use that to fight fire.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Do that.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Oh, it's a big one.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 All right.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 We need longer sticks and bigger thimbles.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 That's just one more thing on birthday cakes.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Yeah.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Most expensive birthday cake of all time.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 $75 million.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Whoa!

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 It was bought by an unnamed buyer in the United Arab Emirates

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 for his daughter's birthday party.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Actually, it was a joint birthday and engagement party.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Also, really, it was only $37.5 million each time.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Great.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Yeah.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 But it's a bit of a trick because the cake is pretty big

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 and obviously did cost a little bit of money.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 But it also has 4,000 diamonds on it.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Yeah.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 So, I mean, if you're just going to pour diamonds on something to say,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 that's the most expensive...

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 You know, this is my most expensive shoe of all time

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 because I poured a load of diamonds in it.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 It's not part of the cake.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 If you can't eat it, it's not part of the cake.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Yeah.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Do you know that there's a fish you can use as candles?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 What? What?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Yeah.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 There's a fish called the Eulicon Fish,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 which some people say is where the word "hooligan" comes from,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 although that is quite dodgy atomology.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Yeah, no, it's not.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 But it's also called the candlefish.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 And that's because it's got so much fat in its body

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 and during spawning that you can literally light one end of it.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 And it burns like a weight like a candle.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And so, like when we first went to North America,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 and when it was first discovered by Westerners,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 then people used to catch these fish and use them as candles.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Imagine the kid's birthday party

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 where you come into the room with that.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Eight fish of light on the top of your cake.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 But didn't they also have birds that they used as...

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Yeah.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Are they full-mars or...?

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 No, Venezuela.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 In Venezuela.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And they're called oil birds.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 And they used to just light one end.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Yeah.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 They're so fatty.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Oh, is that because Brian Blessed told me about this?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Because he explored Venezuela.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 And he said, if you run out of wood or anything,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 you grab one of these birds and you ring them like a wet cloth.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And they leak the oils.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 And then you light so you don't actually have to hurt...

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 You probably hurt the bird in the ringing process, actually.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 But that's doable.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 I have a fact that combines birthdays and bacteria

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 that's not the original fact.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Wow.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 All right.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Just that there was a doctor being interviewed by the telegraph.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 This is a few years ago.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 But he was giving health advice for how to avoid the spread of bacteria.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 He recommended that the best place to sneeze is into your sleeve.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Because that's hygienic.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 And also that while washing your hands,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 you should sing happy birthday twice over.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And I can confirm that if you do that in any kind of public bathroom,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 you get really weird looks.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 But when it got to the bit, happy birthday there,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 what did you say?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 My hands.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 That's great because the second time round,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 the guy next to you could be like,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 "My hands."

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 It's both of our hands birthdays on the same day.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 The chances.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 We should move on to our final facts.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Don't you want to go for something for me?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 I've got some interesting stuff.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Okay, let's move on to our final facts.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Yeah, go for it.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Well, there's a bacteria called Palagi back to Ubeek.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 And there are so many of these things.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 It is unreal.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 If you take part of the ocean,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 at least some parts of the ocean,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 half of all the living cells will be this particular bacteria.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Okay, there are two times 10 to the power of 28 of them in the world,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 which means if every grain of sand on earth was a planet,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 which contained the same number of humans as the rare on earth,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 that would be how many of the bacteria there are on earth at the moment.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 If every grain of sand on earth was a planet,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 which had 7 billion people on it,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 then the total number of all of those people on all of those...

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 It's a number of bacteria that there are of this species in the world.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 What are you saying?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 He's saying this a lot.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Thank you, Anna, for putting it into terms I can understand.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Can I just... My favourite bacteria is this...

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 We've all got one.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 But bacteria are amazing, but they're quite hard to envisage sometimes,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 but this is the second largest bacteria on earth.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 People usually think it was the largest.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 It's about the size of a full stop if you're reading a word document.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 So that's... You can imagine that.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 We're just quite exciting.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 And it's called the official Sony bacteria.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 It's called Epilopiscum Fischal Sony.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 And the reason it's called Epilopiscum is because it only exists

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 in the intestines of surgeon fish.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 So bacteria are very specific.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 They only live in very specific environments.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 So this one only lives in fish.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 So that's why it's called Epilopiscum,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 because Piscase means fish in that in.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 But its other name is Fischal Sony.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 And by sheer coincidence, that's because it was discovered by a man called Lev Fischalson.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 So it's the bacteria that lives solely in fish.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 And then it was named by someone called Peggy Pollock.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 No!

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 That is amazing.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 And did you know this first paper that we were just talking about,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 about the birthday cakes?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 One of the authors of that paper was called Jonathan Baker.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Oh!

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 What almost bookend to this fax part?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Yeah, it'd be nice to have had a laugh, but...

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Oh, there we go. All right.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 OK, it is time for a final fact of the show,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 and that is Chazinski.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 My fact this week is that the first person to swim the Atlantic said,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 "Never again, as soon as he was finished.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 He is now planning to swim the Pacific."

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 This is amazing.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 It's this guy called Benoit Le Comte, and this is in 1998.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 He swam the Atlantic, and he came ashore in Brittany.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 In Brittany, he'd swam 3,800 miles basically from Cape Cod in Massachusetts.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 And literally his first words, I see a merge on the waterward, never again.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 And now he's planning his Pacific trip.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 It's going to happen in the next couple of years.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Now, do we think he actually did the Atlantic thing?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 It's a little bit controversial, isn't it?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 How far is that?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 It's literally the number of miles that Anna just read out.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 So if you rewind quickly on the podcast when you're listening back...

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Yeah, that's a lot.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Oh, if you just listen in the first place, then that will also tell you how far it is.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 It's 3,800 miles.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Thank you, Anna.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 So there's a bit of controversy about whether he swam the whole thing,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 because obviously there are currents which might have helped him along a bit.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 And his average speed was 8 miles an hour, the whole way,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 which is about three times as fast as other swimmers manage over long distances.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 He did so far.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 He may have been helped a bit.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 But he was definitely in the water for a very long time.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 He did well. And he was raising money for charity.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 So he's raised a huge amount of money for charity.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 And that's what he's doing again now.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 And the way he does it is that he stops for the night.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 He spends about eight hours a day.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 He stops for the night.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 The boat takes a GPS position of where he was.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 And then no matter how far the boat's drifted,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 it has to go back to the position he was at,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 and then drop him in the next morning.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Because there was a guy called Guy Delage,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 who was the first to swim across with the help of a kickboard.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 And a kickboard is one of those floats that you have in the swimming pool,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 and you hold them, and then you, you know,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 when you can't do the armpits of your swimming,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 but you're just pressing the leg bit.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 So he did it with that.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 But when he wasn't swimming, he was sleeping on a raft,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 which didn't have this GPS thing.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 And the raft would just float towards where he needed to go all the time.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 And basically, the longer he was sleeping,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 the longer he didn't have to swim.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Which if it was me, I would just have slept the whole way.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 That's the thing.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And he had a, I think, he guy had a small sail on his raft as well.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Yes.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 But he was still cool.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And I think he's great as well, a bit of a hero,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 because he did it to escape debt.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 So he basically had no money left.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 And he was like, what can I do?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 What's the obvious way I can raise money?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 Swim the Atlantic.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And when--

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 Oh, he wasn't just leaving the country to escape the--

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 That's what I thought.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Yeah.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Sorry.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 No, he was good.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 And he had a shark phobia, Guy Delage.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 So--

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 I don't know.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 I think shark phobia is the wrong way of putting that, isn't it?

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Because a phobia has to be something that, you know,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 there's no real reason you should be scared of it.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Whereas sharks, if you're swimming in the Atlantic,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 you're quite right to be scared of sharks.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Yeah, if you don't have shark phobia, you would say,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 he is an insane man.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 Do you know how marathon swimmers keep themselves going

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 during the race?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 No, you mean because they get tired or--

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 They get tired.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 And so if you're swimming a marathon, you know,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 there's lots of kilometers.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 There was an interview with a Russian open-wall swimmer,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 an open-water swimming champion called Yevgeny Bezruzhenko.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 And he wrote an article sharing the secrets of marathon swimming.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 And he revealed that you need food

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 and you normally need a concentrated gel, you know,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 a really, really massive dose of sugar.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 But the only place, obviously, you're swimming, you're in trunks.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 There is only one place you can keep it.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 And that is inside your trunks as you swim.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 So all the swimmers you see doing marathons

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 have little packets of food basically tucked into their pants.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 No way!

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 And they have to get them out over the course of the race.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 That's awesome.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 They should invent, like, trunks with pockets.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 That would be good.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 Do they not have pockets?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Yeah.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 There's normally a little one for your locker key.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 But I think at the competitive level,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 they may not even have those.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Did you know that the US Navy have their own secret military swimming stroke?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Yes.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 They do.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 They do.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 They don't do.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 They do.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 They do.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 They do.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 They don't mate.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 So US Navy seals, they have this stroke

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 called the combat swimmer stroke.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 And it looks so daft.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 But it's a combination of breaststroke and freestyle,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 which I did not know was a thing.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 But...

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Is it breaststroke legs and freestyle arms?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 Basically, you have to go on your side in the water

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 and then you kick in an odd way.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 And then you use your arms in another way.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 But basically, it makes you harder to spot underwater.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 And it's called the combat swimmer stroke.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Wow!

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 It means that if you're trying to infiltrate...

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 You're harder to spot because you're basically sinking

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 because you can't swim like that.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 Yes.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Can I just say a combination of breaststroke and freestyle

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 is just freestyle because the whole point of freestyle

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 is that it's anything you want.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 That's true.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 It just happens that freestyle is the fastest stroke.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 So if I'm swimming breaststroke, am I also swimming freestyle?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 You sure are.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 If you're swimming that in a race, you're a swimming freestyle

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 and be an absolute idiot.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 But yeah.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 In a freestyle race, you're allowed to go anywhere you want.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Really?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 So what you're thinking of is Sprunk Crull.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 That's what I thought I thought freestyle was, Frank Crull.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 It is Frank Crull because that's the fastest.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 But why do you think it was called freestyle?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 You're not going to go...

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 I'll do breaststroke on this one.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Yeah.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Can I stick up for breaststroke?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Well, as the fastest swimmings have the fastest,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 but as the nicest.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Yeah, but where do you mean the Olympics?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 There's no points for niceness.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 You're joking.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 You were shit at Sparta School.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Do you know bats, when they swim,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 they tested to see if bats could swim.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 First of all, yeah, I didn't know this one.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Yeah, so bats can swim.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 Obviously, they don't do it out of just a daily exercise.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 They do it in circumstances where they're suddenly in water

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 for a reason they shouldn't be.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 Right.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Have I explained myself well enough?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Perfectly.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 They do the butterfly.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 So they... when they're winged.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 That's due butterfly.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Do butterflies.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Do that.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 Do the bats.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 They do batstroke.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Yeah.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Oh.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Yeah.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 So the longest ever journey swimming was 5,268 kilometers.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 And it was down the Amazon River through Peru and Brazil.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 And it was done by a guy called Martin Strrell,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 who's from Slovenia.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 And he is pretty awesome.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 Atri, he did it.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 They asked him about it.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 And he said, you know, they're like, how did you manage this?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 And he says, well, my body is pretty special.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Wow.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 He says, I never hurt or sick.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 And if everyone were like me, all of the hospitals around the world

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 would be completely empty.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 And he says he drinks either one or two bottles of wine every day.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 But it's special Slovenian wine that you can't buy outside Slovenia.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 And it just helps you be an awesome swimmer.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Does it?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 Yeah.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 And he said, do you know what the worst thing is

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 if you're swimming the Amazon, what the biggest danger is?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 Getting your legs chewed off by piranhas.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 By piranhas.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 So he was attacked by piranhas a few times.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 And he found a good way of preventing them

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 by pouring buckets of putrid blood into the water.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 And they went for the putrid blood instead.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 He also said, and I don't really believe this because he said,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 I learned not to pee in the water because there are kandiru.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 And you guys probably know kandiru.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 They're the tiny fish that are supposed to swim up into your penis

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 if you're swimming.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 But they don't, do they?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 But they don't.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 So I think he's been told a bit of a--

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 I thought they did.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 No, they didn't.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 I thought the thing they didn't do was

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 if you're having a pee into the Amazon off the bank,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 they don't swim up the urine.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Yeah.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 I think we can all agree they definitely don't do that.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 OK, so it's common ground.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 But anyway, he said the kandiru was bad.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 But the worst thing apparently was the women of the Amazon.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 And he said, you can often see 15 to 20 times more women than men.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 And the women are very aggressive

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 and they try and catch you and marry you.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 This-- and they're worse than the piranhas.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 This guy has a-- I must say a very high opinion of himself.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 My body's great.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 I've got magic wine.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 And the ladies of the Amazon cannot get enough.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Hey, we need to wrap up shortly.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 Do you guys have anything before we do?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 Can I just say a fact that we got sent actually in the interval

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 and it's amazing and it's about swimming.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 And it's from a guy called Theo,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 who all I know is you're called Theo on your age 12.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Yeah.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Are you here?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 OK, great.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Hi, Theo.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 So this fact is incredible.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Tigers always get in the water backwards

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 because they love swimming, but they hate getting their eyes wet.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Isn't that amazing?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 I checked it.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 I was like, that must not be true.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 I must know it.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 So they put their paws up on the bank

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 and then just kick with their back legs.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Like old ladies at the swimming pool.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 All right, amazing flag for you.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Should we wrap up?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 OK, that's it.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 I'm on at Shriverland, Andy.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 At Andrew Hunter M. James.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 That's James Harkin.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 And Shazinski.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 You can email podcast at qi.com.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Yep.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Or you can go to our group Twitter account,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 which is @nosuchthing.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 You can also go to nosuchthing as a fish.com.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 That's our website.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 We have the links to all of our previous episodes.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 We also have a link to our book, The Book of the Year,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 which is out now and we're about to give a copy away

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 to one of the members of this audience here in Coventry,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 who's sent us a fact that we have picked out.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Who's got the fact?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 I have it.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 It's a shame after you just read out that really cool tiger one,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 because this is quite low-brow.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 But I can only blame the people of Coventry.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 And it is that places in Canada include

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 Shaga's Cove, Dildo, and Balls Falls.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 [ Laughter ]

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 Come and see us after the show and we have a book for you.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Yes.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Come and collect your free book.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 I want to have some words of advice about your vocabulary.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 [ Laughter ]

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 Thanks so much guys for being here.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 We see you again next week.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 Good bye.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 [ Cheers and applause ]

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 [ Cheers and applause ]

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
