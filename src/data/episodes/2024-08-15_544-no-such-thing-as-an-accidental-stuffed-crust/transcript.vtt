00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.320
 Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.080
 Before we begin this week's episode of Fish,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.120
 we just want to remind you that the four of us

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.920
 are heading back out on tour as of this September

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.080
 with our massive 10th anniversary show, "Thundernerds."

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.680
 It's going to be so good, guys.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.920
 We're going all over.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.400
 It's an earth sandwich tour.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.040
 We're doing the UK, we're doing Ireland,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.080
 and then we're going to the New World.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.960
 To Australia and New Zealand, those shows

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.120
 are almost entirely sold out in the New World.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.920
 But old world dates, there are some tickets left,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.760
 so we're going to be playing Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, New

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.120
 Castle, Cardiff, London, London again, and Manchester.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.720
 That's right.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.560
 So if you want to come and experience the dorkery in person,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.920
 it's a wild night.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 We record a live podcast.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.120
 We include extras.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.720
 We've just written and performed our first preview of it.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.600
 It was smashing, incredibly exciting.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.400
 You're going to meet characters from the archives of our show.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.200
 You're going to find out how we put all the show together.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.360
 We're going behind the scenes, and it's

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.400
 going to be a wild night.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.040
 So come, be with us in one of these big old rooms,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.120
 and let's have a massive night out together.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.080
 Just head to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.600
 You'll find the links to every single one of those shows

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 by ticket, and we'll see you there.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.800
 Yes, we cannot wait.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 It's so much fun.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.600
 Knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 It's the perfect thing to do or the perfect gift

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.520
 to buy someone you love who likes fish

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.120
 and is happy to see them us on stage.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.080
 Cool, on with the show.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 Bye.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.680
 Always end strong.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.120
 OK, on with the show.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:54.320
 Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.800
 of Knowsuchthingasafish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.520
 from four undisplosed locations around the UK.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.960
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.520
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.320
 Harkin, and Anna Tyshinski.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.560
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.800
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.160
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.880
 My fact this week is that in the swimming races

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.120
 at the first modern Olympics, the American competitor

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.960
 drops out because the water was too cold.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.040
 That is amazing.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.440
 And how things have changed now?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440
 Because they've had to change some of the swimming events

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.240
 because there's feces in the Sen.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.000
 Oh, yes.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.160
 Oh, wow.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.120
 Actually, well, similarly, now we

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.400
 have a lot of water events happening in the Sen,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.920
 which is natural water.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920
 And this was 1896.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.640
 And the swimming events happened in the Med.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.800
 So that was surprisingly chilly.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.520
 Very nice.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.720
 Yes, I think it was partly because the Olympics had gone

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.840
 three times over budget, and so they couldn't really

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.800
 afford to build proper swimming pools or set up those venues.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.440
 And so they thought--

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.040
 Or heat the entire Mediterranean.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.640
 Yeah.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.520
 All that.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.280
 The Med is, of course, hotter than your big oceans,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.040
 but this was happening earlier on in the year,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.040
 in March or April, depending on which calendar you were using.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.120
 And it was surprisingly cold.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.560
 It was surprisingly bad weather.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.240
 And this competitor was called Gardner Williams.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.920
 And this is all recounted by one of his fellow competitors

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.000
 who was there at the time.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.600
 So there's some question as to whether this definitely happened.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.760
 But his mate, who was there competing with him, said,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.920
 this is what happened.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.080
 And as this guy called Tom Curtis tells it,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.000
 this guy had won many races in warm American swimming pools.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.920
 And he was blissfully ignorant that the Mediterranean

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.840
 is bitterly cold in April.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.120
 So a boat took them out.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.920
 He dived headfirst into the icy water.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.560
 And in a split second, his head reappeared.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 He shouted, Jesus Christ, I'm freezing.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.000
 And with that shriek of astonished frenzy,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.160
 he lashed back to the float.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.440
 But it sounds like it wasn't even just the coldness.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.800
 It sounds like the waves were crazy as hell.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.520
 The winner of the match describes 12-foot waves crashing down

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.360
 onto him as he was swimming towards the ending.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.000
 Your lanes were only shown to you via hollowed out pumpkins

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.960
 that were floating in the ocean.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.320
 It sounded wild.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.240
 I think it genuinely was really cold,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.040
 because the guy who won was called Alfred Hajos, I think.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.200
 And he wrote of this event that the icy water

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.200
 almost cut into our stomachs.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.880
 We called him Hajos or Hajos or Hayos.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.680
 Oh, Hajos sounds actually like here.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 He was Hungarian, wasn't he?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.880
 He was actually known as the Hungarian dolphin.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.440
 So he could just call him that

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.440
 and save the pronunciation issue.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.400
 Brilliant. So the Hungarian dolphin,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.040
 he was also later the manager of the Hungarian football team.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.640
 He learned to swim when he was 13 years old

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.880
 after his father had drowned in the Danube

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.760
 and he decided that he should learn how to swim.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.800
 And when the Olympics started,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.000
 he was at the local university

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.440
 and he really, really struggled to get permission

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.440
 to leave and go to the Olympics.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.560
 And in fact, when he came back with his medals,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.160
 he said the dean did not congratulate me.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.400
 He said your medals are of no interest to me,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.320
 but I am eager to hear your replies

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.920
 in your next examination.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.920
 Well, of course, like in those days,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.080
 the Olympics wasn't that big a deal.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.080
 No, it wasn't. It didn't even exist.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.040
 It didn't. It's like the first,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.200
 if I just went off to a made up competition,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.840
 if I told you guys,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.040
 oh, I'm going to be away for three weeks

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.480
 because I'm going to the global haiku slam event.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.080
 We would totally believe it.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.720
 Yeah. But if you Google it and there was no evidence of it.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.160
 Yeah, exactly. I don't know.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.040
 I think I sort of understand it.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.320
 Although in fairness, Andy, it was in the newspapers.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.200
 If you look back in the newspaper archives,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.160
 you can see that in America, they were reporting on it.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.720
 They report on this guy that Anna

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.920
 and Richard Lee mentioned, Gardner Williams,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.440
 at the start that he's going.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.480
 And then you don't really see any mention of him

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.920
 in the results.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.800
 So that does bear credence to the idea

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.760
 that he jumped in the water.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.520
 It was too cold and he jumped out again.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.400
 Yeah. Yeah, I saw one amazing article in the Boston Globe.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.040
 This was from the 12th of April, 1896.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.240
 And they said that when Gardner Williams arrived

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.760
 on the boat in Athens,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.000
 he came on to land in his trunks and a purple robe.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.440
 And announced to the press,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.280
 "Leander swam the hellish pond and I will swim this here."

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.360
 Oh, sentences you regret.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.800
 I have a feeling it might have been satire.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.920
 They didn't admit at any stage that this was a satirical piece,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.440
 but I think it might have been.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.320
 Because they mentioned another guy called Hoyt,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.720
 who was a polevolter, and they said that he was practicing

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.760
 over a statue of Zeus outside his hotel.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.800
 And that he knocked the guard off his pedestal three times,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.680
 but cleared him at the fourth try.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.480
 Wow. So I can't tell if it's real or not.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.080
 I believe there was so much mad stuff happening

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.720
 at these, the first ever games.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.080
 As in the 1200 meter event, it wasn't like you started,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.840
 you got in the water and then you swam along the shore for 1200 meters.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.960
 You were taken 1200 meters away from land,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.680
 and then you were just ditched in the ocean.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.200
 So if you don't finish... It was about surviving.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.240
 Yeah, if you don't finish the race, you die. That's it.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.440
 It was only, because we are saying the water's quite cold,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.480
 it was only, I think, about 12 degrees, which is chilly.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.640
 But just if there are world swimmers out there,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.000
 they'll be like, "Come on, guys, you pussies."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.560
 I would say in the med, if people are swimming

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.680
 at the start of April in the med,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.800
 you usually look at them and go, "Oh, that's a hardy soul."

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.800
 Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.280
 Can I tell you guys about my favourite competitor

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.800
 from the 1896 Olympics?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.880
 Yeah, go for it. Please.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.640
 Have you heard of Italian runner Carlo Iroldi?

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.000
 I did not hear of him.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.840
 OK. Oh, great. OK.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.280
 So he walked to the games.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.680
 He was from Milan, and they were taking place in Athens.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.680
 And he was a great long-distance runner, right?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.880
 He'd done... The previous year, he'd done a 600-mile race

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.760
 in lots of different stages.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.320
 So really good at long-distance running.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.760
 He hears about this... He hears about this marathon.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.840
 He thinks, "That's a piece of piss.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.480
 It wasn't 26. Easy."

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.560
 So he thinks, "I'll do it."

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.240
 But he didn't have money for a train or a ship

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.240
 or whatever from Italy degrees.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.440
 So he thought, "I'll just walk. I'll just walk there."

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.720
 And he briefly got a boat at one stage,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.880
 but he did walk or run about 900 kilometres

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.120
 from his home to Athens, right?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.840
 So what's the comedy thing that happens at the end?

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.320
 If you're writing this as a script.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.160
 He arrives at the start line... Yeah.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.560
 ..and he's forgotten his shoes and has to go back.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.360
 That's good. That's good.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.320
 They've moved the venue back to where he'd originally walked from.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.320
 Yeah, it's in Milan. Yeah, yeah. It's in Milan, yeah.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.880
 No, what happened was he got there in time for the games,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.200
 amazingly impressive, and then he was asked,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.920
 "Oh, by the way, have you ever competed in one money for athletics?"

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.480
 And he said, "Oh, yeah, I did win the Milan to Barcelona race last year,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.440
 which was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of kilometres."

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.360
 And they said, "Oh, sorry. Well, you can't run then. Bye."

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.360
 No. Disqualified for being a professional.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.480
 That's really sad.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.600
 So your favourite competitor at the 1896 Olympics

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.640
 was not, in fact, a competitor. That's right, that's right.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.960
 He was a cheat. He was an attempted cheat.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.760
 Can I give you my favourite competitor for the 1896 Olympics?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.240
 This was Sum Napeen, who was a pistol-fireer.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.880
 He won the 30-metre free pistol.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.800
 And when he got home, he arrived a little bit early

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.920
 and surprised his wife with his medal.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.800
 "Hey, honey, I'm home early."

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.280
 And she was in bed with his daughter's Dutch music teacher.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.200
 Oh!

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.000
 And so he chased him out of the house, firing his gun,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.400
 bearing in mind that he's just won a gold medal at the 30-metre free pistol.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.640
 Chases this guy out of the house.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.480
 The guy runs away and the police arrest him and put him in jail.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.480
 And then in the court case later on, he was let off

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.920
 because they realised that he was such a good pistol-shooter

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.160
 that he obviously hadn't meant to shoot the guy.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.880
 Brilliant.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.560
 If he meant to shoot him, of course he would have hit him.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.600
 So they said that he's shown restraint and he got free.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.120
 I was... Because when you said he runs out of the house firing his first pistol,

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.960
 I'm thinking of him like being Yosemite Sam.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.920
 Do you know what I mean?

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.360
 I think there was some of that.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 Um...

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.640
 No, sorry, I was too distracting.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.000
 Sorry, what was that?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.280
 So, listener, what happened there is we are recording this over the internet

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.000
 on a particular system.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.760
 And when Addy did his Yosemite Sam shooting the guns in the air,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.320
 a load of balloons came up.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.560
 How do I make it happen again?

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.320
 I just... I was just like...

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.880
 You have to not be trying.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.560
 What?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.840
 It knows if you want it.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.520
 Wow.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.200
 What was that?

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.280
 Yeah, that was incredibly distracting.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.960
 That was wild.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.240
 I think if I do a thumbs up, it makes a thumbs up on the screen.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.800
 There we go.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.560
 It does.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560
 Let's not do too many...

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.560
 Oh, Addy, no, don't take your pants off.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.040
 Oh, Addy!

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.880
 Two other things from the original Olympics that I quite like.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.920
 The Greek team won gold in gymnastics

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.960
 and they would not win another gold in gymnastics for a hundred years.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.600
 So it wasn't until the 1996 Olympics that they got their next gold.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.000
 And the other thing is the hurdles.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.880
 They used to jump with two feet over it at the same time,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.920
 rather than doing that one leg and then the second leg coming over it.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.880
 Yeah, so according to what I was reading, I haven't seen any footage.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.920
 The Greeks did, I think.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.760
 I think the American hurdler rocked up and saw the Greek doing that

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.320
 and thought, "That's absolutely hilarious. You're screwed.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.120
 I'm going to win this."

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.840
 Which he did.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.080
 Because the Americans were all into college athletics at that time, weren't they?

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.200
 Competing for Harvard or Yale or whatever.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.120
 And they were really seasoned competitors

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.760
 compared to some of the other people who literally just rocked up

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.520
 and went, "Oh, I might just do this then."

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.080
 Yeah, in fact, they were largely from, as you say, Harvard.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.560
 And it was the Boston Athletics Association,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.000
 which was responsible for getting most of them there.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.240
 Which I mentioned because there's a really funny thing

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.040
 that was actually mentioned in this article by Tom Curtis,

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.720
 who was the hurdler who won gold.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.560
 He said that they had a chant, which it's hard to know how it went,

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.120
 but I think it was BAA, rah, rah, rah.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.920
 So Boston Athletics Association.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.160
 And according to him, no one in Europe had ever seen cheering in unison before.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.080
 So everyone was incredibly excited by this.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.800
 And King George, who the king was presiding over it all,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.120
 like he judged if there was a tie, he was there.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.240
 King George was so excited that the Americans did this chant.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.200
 And King George's aid came up to the Americans

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.800
 and saluted them solemnly.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.360
 And said, "His Majesty, the king, requests that you, for him,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.160
 will make one more that funny sound."

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.840
 As he wrote it.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.360
 And they had to do it again.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.080
 And then he gave them a celebratory breakfast the next day,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.000
 at which, again, he said to the Americans,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.800
 "Would you mind doing that funny chant you did again, please?"

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.560
 Wow, so funny.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.800
 Yeah, he was quite involved, wasn't he, the king?

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.880
 He decided that no one should measure any of the long jumps.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.480
 Because he thought that, oh, that's just the kind of thing professionals do.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.080
 So we don't want professionals at this.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.240
 It's an amateur athletics thing.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.960
 We'll work out who's the longest just through looking with our eyes,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.160
 but we're not actually going to measure it.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.720
 And so we don't know what the longest distance was

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.080
 and that Olympics, we know who won it.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.600
 We don't know what they jumped.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.800
 Really?

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.680
 That's really good.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.120
 I was actually reading up on how we do find if things are too close

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.880
 and like a photo finish, what technology is out there now.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.320
 But the swimming, they use a very interesting process in the pools,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.520
 which is they have a pad that the swimmers need to touch.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.440
 And I think I've worked out a hack, push out a wave

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.720
 that can move at a force of 3.3 pounds,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.440
 because that is the amount of poundage that you need

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.920
 in order to activate the pad to make it clock the timing.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.360
 Fortunately, they've worked out.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.880
 Sorry, Dan, just to say, the way that swimming works

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.000
 is you're kind of pushing the water backwards

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.760
 in so that you go forwards.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.080
 And if you push the water forwards and make a wave,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.160
 you're actually going to be sending yourself backwards.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.720
 Well, that's fine.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.200
 Because then you just stay at the back of the pool

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.880
 and you just concentrate all the afternoon

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.600
 blasting away a wall of water at that pad and then relax.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.120
 Or the final 10 meters turn around and swim the other way.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.320
 Yeah, that's good.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.440
 Yeah, that's OK.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.280
 That's enough of a try next time.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.480
 Add a beauty.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.640
 But it's pretty amazing how quickly these things are locked.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.160
 Yeah, the speed is extraordinary.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.520
 And I think it's completely pointless,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.400
 because when you're coming down to those five margins, who cares?

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.520
 You've, it's a draw.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.080
 Just, I just think if human eyes can't see it,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.360
 just call it a tie.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.160
 I agree.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.160
 If the King of Greece can't tell clearly who's ahead,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.120
 it's a tie.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.400
 You know, South America was thought not to have played

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.080
 a part in the first Olympics until very recently

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.760
 when we found evidence that they did.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.640
 Chile always claimed they'd sent one athlete.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.240
 It was very chilly in that water.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.800
 Go on, carry on.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.720
 You're joke signifier now, Andy.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.520
 That noise just so we thought it's happened.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.200
 Yeah, anything I say without that

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.280
 is actually meant to be taken deadly seriously.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.720
 That's really good to know.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.080
 There was a Chilean guy called Luis Subercasso.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.000
 And he didn't get any medals.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.320
 So there's no written evidence of him being there

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.520
 because they didn't keep very good records.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.280
 It was only if you got a medal, really.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.680
 And then I think in about 2014,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.280
 apparently the forensic Chilean police force

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.000
 examined, who are like facial recognisers,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.840
 examined a couple of photos from the 100 meter sprint.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.720
 And they confirmed using their facial recognition skills

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.080
 that that was in fact him.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.840
 Now it was the Chilean police.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.120
 What a load of nonsense.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.880
 Hey, just if you're a super recommender,

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.800
 you can just say, oh yeah, that's the guy.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's him, definitely.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.880
 It's so ripe for abuse, this system.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.280
 Secondly, slow crime day in Chile, wasn't it?

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.840
 It caught everybody, have you?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.440
 You caught every shoplifter or whatever.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.720
 You've cleared your backlog back to 1896.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.000
 My fact is that Japan is currently planning a 300 mile conveyor belt.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.560
 This is just for people who've done a huge supermarket show.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.360
 That's right, yeah, yeah.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.400
 How far into planning is it?

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.600
 Oh, it's early stages.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.960
 It's very early stages.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.840
 Oh, is it just someone, is it like a Boris Johnson saying,

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.960
 oh, let's do this?

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.160
 I don't think anyone in Japan is as unreliable as Boris Johnson.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.880
 So I think it's already a better plan than all of his.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.040
 But I think it's a very ambitious plan, definitely,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.360
 because I think the longest conveyor belt at the moment

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.120
 in the world is quite a lot shorter than this.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:33.640
 But the idea is that it would be effectively a road linking Tokyo and Osaka.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:39.080
 And the conveyor belts would be either along the hard shoulder of roads

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.880
 between these two places or in tunnels under the road.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.560
 And it would be in big pallets.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.920
 And it's really sensible, actually.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.560
 It's not just a sort of kind of wacky plan.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.160
 It's because--

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.720
 Another difference with the Boris Johnson approach.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.600
 It's because there's forecast to be a really big shortfall of drivers.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.560
 Like lorry drivers.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.640
 Lorry drivers, haulage and all of that.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.520
 In some remote areas, it's going to be a really acute problem

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.040
 because lots of bits of Japan have fallen populations

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.320
 and it's important to be able to keep supplies going, obviously,

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.440
 to all bits of the country.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.600
 So the idea is if you free up drivers between Tokyo and Osaka,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.840
 they're free to service lots of other bits of the country.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.920
 And also, it's a generally good idea to free up roads of freight

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.160
 because you've released pollution on the surface.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.400
 You reduce congestion, free up the roads for non-commercial travel,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.280
 all sorts of things.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.760
 So it is currently in the early state.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.960
 It's basically at the moment, it's a line.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.720
 It's a long line on a bit of paper.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.440
 Right.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.600
 Is it a conveyor belt that goes back around,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.840
 as in if you miss collecting your freight at the end,

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.200
 does it head back to Tokyo?

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.320
 It's like an airport one.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.960
 You have to wait at the end,

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.840
 looking out for your Amazon back-end.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.160
 Do we know how fast it's going to go?

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.320
 Incredibly fast, 400 miles an hour.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.360
 No, come on.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.720
 No, I don't know.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.440
 I don't know.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.080
 Because there is a limit of how fast a conveyor belt can go,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:17:59.480
 really.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.240
 Practically, there is, because if you put something on a conveyor belt

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.960
 that's going more than, let's say, 20 miles an hour,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.240
 the stuff's just going to fly off.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.720
 Yeah.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.200
 Yeah.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.720
 That's--

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.560
 I was thinking, I was wondering if it was going to go fast enough

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.400
 to be worth getting on it yourself

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.840
 if you needed to get from Tokyo to Osaka.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.640
 Yes.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.400
 And probably would be, wouldn't it?

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.280
 That would be incredibly cool.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.760
 I guess so.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.640
 The fastest conveyor belt, actually, I should say,

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.360
 is-- can you guess how fast it goes?

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:24.840
 Miles an hour.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.720
 Ooh.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.600
 Is it for people?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.960
 No, it's for redish lignite rocks.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.320
 Ooh.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.600
 OK, that changes my calculation.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.160
 OK, I think about 20 miles an hour.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:35.720
 It's miles.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.200
 OK.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.680
 It's miles.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:36.680
 50.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.720
 Any other plans?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:37.800
 50.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.280
 50?

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:38.920
 Yeah.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.880
 50 miles an hour.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.600
 50.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.640
 Well, it's going to be a lot, isn't it?

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.760
 Otherwise, it wouldn't have asked.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.040
 Dan, is it somewhere in between?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.760
 Or are you going to go massively high or massively low?

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.240
 400.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.840
 No, so I think it's got to be lower.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.880
 I think lower than Andy's.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.240
 I would say 15.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.000
 It's 33 miles per hour.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.480
 Wow.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.440
 15 minutes per second.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.800
 Wow.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.280
 And yeah, again, the reason that it can't go faster,

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.600
 presumably you could in theory make it go faster,

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.560
 but if you put the rocks on, they're just going to fly off.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:05.960
 Yeah.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.840
 How are you going to collect your sushi off that belt

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.280
 when you're sitting down for a meal?

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:10.600
 Yeah.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.720
 That sushi's breaking your teeth.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.480
 I think the longest one so far is about 100 kilometers.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.360
 It's about 60 miles, and it's in the Western Sahara.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.440
 Well, controversial, Andy.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.320
 Oh, great.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.960
 Can I just say, I always thought that was the longest conveyor belt.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.280
 As a UI researcher, you just kind of know these things.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:28.840
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.120
 That's in your induction pack, isn't it?

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.200
 But that's, okay, I'll just say what that one is.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.160
 So that's phosphate rock in Western Sahara,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.640
 and it's a 2,000 tons an hour of phosphate rock

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.240
 has moved along, and it's been mined,

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.600
 and now it's going to be refined.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.480
 So it is really, really long, but it is made of lots of units,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.240
 and each unit is only 11.7 kilometers long,

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.560
 and then they attach together a bit like Legos.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.560
 But the longest just one conveyor belt

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.280
 is between India and Bangladesh, and that goes 35 kilometers.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.760
 And it was the only man-made structure

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.800
 built after partition that links Bangladesh and India.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.120
 Wow.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.160
 The economists tried to follow it,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.480
 and what they do is they followed this conveyor belt,

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.520
 followed it, followed it, followed it,

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.560
 and they got to within like a few hundred meters of the border,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.000
 and the soldiers went, nope.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.640
 So actually no human can go that way.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.320
 You'd have to put yourself in a box

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.840
 if you ever wanted to make that journey.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.720
 Yeah, or a cake.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.560
 Big cake.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.920
 I do. It's not used for that.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.720
 I think that's going to stand out amongst whatever

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.480
 they're transporting from the market.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.960
 So it's like, lignite rock, lignite knock,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.280
 lignite rock, giant birthday cake.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.040
 Lignite rock, lignite rock.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.160
 Wait, hang on. Go back to.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.960
 I don't know you to say, oh, someone down the other end

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.080
 of the line is going to have a good birthday.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.640
 That's nice.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.280
 Well, you had to do an emergency stop on it,

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.880
 and Andy just flung out of the cake.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.840
 Fully naked.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.000
 So Andy, is yours a continuous conveyor belt then,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.080
 or should we alter your fact to planning

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.480
 a three-mile-long conveyor belt?

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.720
 I don't think the Japanese system will be one belt.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.160
 So it'll be a system, mind you.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.680
 I think as long as it doesn't have to dismount

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.560
 and then be remounted by a human, I would allow it.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.440
 OK, nice idea.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.080
 There's a pitch for one in Britain.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.600
 There's the film called Magway,

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.200
 who wants to do the same kind of thing.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.480
 It will be around London,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.280
 and it's on magnetic surfboards.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.040
 So I think this would be floating parcels

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.320
 to live in around London.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.360
 Don't put water on it.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.400
 That's a Magway, Magway joke.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.760
 Oh, that's good.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.320
 And it can't carry anything after midnight.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.280
 Isn't that Cinderella thing?

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.040
 Yeah, it's also a governance thing.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.240
 OK, cool.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.160
 The swimming at the Athens Olympics

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.760
 had to happen after midnight,

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.360
 because previously all the coaches

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.320
 were floating in the water.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.600
 That was laboured.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.920
 James, I'm a part of my joke noise for that.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.640
 What was that again?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:02.520
 So I was learning a bit about conveyor belt terminology,

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.120
 because I'm sure, as we all have,

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.960
 we've all spent a long time today

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.120
 on websites that sell conveyor belts.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.560
 And do you know what the most important bit

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.840
 of a conveyor belt is called?

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.200
 The rubber?

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.520
 The belt?

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.320
 Rubber bit.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.480
 It's not the rubber bit,

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.760
 it's the bit under the rubber,

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.160
 which is made of interwoven fabric,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.760
 which is responsible for the tension

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.480
 and the weight carrying,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.840
 and it's called the carcass.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.200
 Oh, lovely.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.400
 Oh, that's good.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.280
 Those conveyor belt websites,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.800
 they all do nick from each other, don't they?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.240
 The history of the conveyor belt.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.000
 It's been really copied and pasted

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.200
 quite a few times.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.240
 It has.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.920
 But I think I can tell you the original source,

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.840
 and it is the most important history

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.360
 of conveyor belts ever written.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.120
 It's called Belt Conveyors and Belt Elevators.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.800
 It's by a guy called Fred Hetzel,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.320
 written in 1922.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.760
 And a lot of these copy things seem to come from him.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.320
 So I think 1795 is often cited

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.240
 as the first modern conveyor belt

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.080
 by a guy called Oliver Evans,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.520
 who did it for his flour mills

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.880
 to transport flour around.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.360
 And Evans also invented the first ever car

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.400
 in America,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.000
 but by accident.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.760
 How, okay.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.120
 It's always by accident.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.480
 All inventions are always,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.480
 oh, he was carrying the ingredients of a car

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.960
 and then he tripped over and they fell,

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.240
 assembled themselves on the conveyor belt.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.560
 Yeah, and it just drove him the rest of the way.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.600
 Just absolute nonsense.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:22.920
 Wow.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.040
 Well, it's, um,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.040
 this one I've just used by accident quite loosely.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.920
 It was called the Orook Tor Amphibulos,

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.880
 and it was also the first amphibious vehicle in the world.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.200
 It was a huge steam powered machine

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.600
 that is supposed to dredge stuff from the bottom of water.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.680
 He built it in his warehouse,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.120
 but then he had to transport it

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.960
 to the river in Philadelphia

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.960
 in order to show it off and do the dredging.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.080
 So to transport it,

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.520
 he attached four wheels

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.560
 and he rigged up the wheels

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.400
 to the steam mechanism for the dredging

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.240
 and he drove it through Philadelphia.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.800
 And there, there, by accident,

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.320
 he's made the first car, hasn't he?

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.200
 Very, it's quite cool.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.600
 Very cool.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.320
 That's quite cool.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.560
 Is it Thomas Robbins Jr.,

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.840
 who is largely credited

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.960
 with the sort of the modern conveyor belt

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.080
 that we use these days.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.080
 He, he supplied his conveyor belts

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.280
 to people like Thomas Edison

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.280
 to use in his factories and so on.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.840
 And, um, he also was the first,

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.480
 I believe, to use vulcanized rubber.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.160
 And there's quite a nice link

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.080
 because Thomas Robbins Jr.,

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.240
 his granddaughter, Louisa Robbins,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.840
 married Austin Goodyear,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.920
 which must have been a powerhouse couple.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.880
 It's like a royal family of vulcanized rubber

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.920
 and conveyor belting.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.560
 Wow.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.840
 Have you heard of the Trottois Roulant Rapide?

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.720
 This was at the Montparnasse Bienvenue Station.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.840
 It was a high-speed walkway.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.360
 You know those ones you get at airports?

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:38.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.160
 Yep.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.000
 They go really slowly, don't they?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.840
 I think we could all agree.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.800
 Oh, I love them.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.760
 Sure, we all love them,

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.680
 but they, they could be gingered up a bit.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.880
 Are you the kind of person

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.000
 who just gets on them

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.520
 and then just stands there

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.640
 with all of your luggage,

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.600
 just blocking the way

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.520
 so none of us people can walk on them?

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.400
 No, but I had an accidental layover in Abu Dhabi

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.680
 and I thought there was going to be

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.880
 full of stuff for the kids.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.520
 There was nothing.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.040
 It all had shut since COVID

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.440
 and we spent, no joke, four hours

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.880
 running on the travel lasers

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.480
 back and forth to tire out the kids.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.840
 Well, Dan, you would have loved

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.680
 the Trottois Roulant Rapide

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.520
 at Montparnasse Bienvenue

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.640
 because it was fast.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.440
 It went at seven and a half miles an hour,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.640
 which is, that's jogging speed, I'd say.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.960
 Basically, it was so dangerous.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.560
 It had to have bounces at the beginning

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.720
 saying, no, you are not ready

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.080
 for the Trottois Roulant Rapide.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.680
 It's too much for you to go away.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.440
 There was an acceleration zone at the beginning

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.440
 and then a deceleration zone at the end

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.880
 and it did nine years in service,

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.800
 but there were so many accidents.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.800
 Hang on a second, I have a question.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.800
 If you're on a travel laser

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.320
 that's shared by lots of other people,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.160
 how does it accelerate you at the start

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.560
 without accelerating everyone else along the way?

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.360
 Great question.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.640
 I think it might have been a belt

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.480
 that gets you up to a few miles an hour ready

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.800
 and then the next zone is going a few miles an hour faster

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.160
 than that first, so you don't just step on to a thing

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.080
 going at jogging speed because that would be a bit mad.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.600
 I think we've said that in the past,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.640
 that this was an idea that was put about in America

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.560
 when they first invented conveyor belts,

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:10.120
 which is the walkways where you would step on one,

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.240
 which was two miles an hour,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.000
 and then step on to one that was four miles an hour,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.280
 then one that's eight miles an hour,

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.000
 and before you know it,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 you go in at 60 miles an hour in a walkway.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.440
 Yeah, here's the thing.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.600
 Your one, Andy, with the acceleration speed

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.680
 is assuming that you're just standing still,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.360
 and that is the seven mile an hour speed

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.160
 that you're going at,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.760
 but as we experienced in Abu Dhabi,

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.040
 when you run on these things,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.280
 the speed that you get when you're running,

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.400
 so I wonder what speed you could get

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.200
 on a seven mile an hour travelator.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.760
 Wow, it would be your normal speed plus seven.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.200
 Plus seven miles an hour.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.320
 So what's my normal speed, I guess, is the big question.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.400
 Yeah, I mean, the sky's the limit,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.760
 depending on how good you are at running.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.480
 I don't think the sky is the limit.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.520
 Well, I don't think you can run infinitely fast

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.960
 just as long as you keep trying.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.400
 How do conveyor belts really change the world,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:55.960
 would you say?

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.560
 No, no, before that.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.160
 Like industry, big industrial plants, really,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.920
 they're crucial in all of those, aren't they?

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.520
 Assembly lines, basically, isn't it?

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.160
 Yeah.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.160
 You know, it's like, the idea was,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.160
 let's say you're making a car, your Ford,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.920
 what would happen is you'd have your carcass of a car

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.200
 just sort of hanging up,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.600
 and then if you're the guy who does the left wheel,

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.840
 you'd have to go over to the car and attach the left wheel,

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.600
 and then the guy who puts the windscreen wipers on

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.040
 would have to walk over and do that.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.200
 But if you have the conveyor belt,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.280
 then the carcass can move along

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.760
 and everyone could just stand there and do their thing,

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.680
 and by the time it gets to the end of the conveyor belt,

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.080
 it's done.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.200
 So Ford was the first place to really do that,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.800
 and that was why they became so massive.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.640
 And originally, the conveyor belt was pulled by a rope,

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.200
 so you would have a person on the end,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.040
 and they would be pulling the car along

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.480
 while everyone was doing their thing.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.600
 And the really interesting thing is that

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.320
 the idea came to them from a slaughterhouse.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.000
 So one of the guys who was working at Ford

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.480
 visited a slaughterhouse in Chicago,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.280
 and they had a thing called a disassembly line,

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.920
 where someone would get an actual carcass

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.920
 and pull it along on a rope,

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.480
 and then the first person would take out the heart,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.480
 and then the next person would pull off the legs.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.120
 Really?

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.240
 And they would take all the bits of the carcass off to be used,

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.680
 and this was their system.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.640
 And then Ford thought,

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.200
 "Well, what if instead of taking bits off the carcass,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.640
 we put bits onto the carcass?"

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.600
 And that's why it's called a car.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.680
 Is that?

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.800
 We're all dancing around it.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:33.480
 Conveyor belts are responsible for naming

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.120
 one of the big American products out there.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.680
 Literally, the conveyor belt suggested the name.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.560
 Really?

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.360
 Yeah, and that is Hershey's Kisses chocolate.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.240
 And it was when they were manufacturing it,

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.000
 the sound that the motion of the machine made

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.800
 when it plopped the chocolate onto the conveyor belt,

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.560
 it sounded like a little kiss.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.040
 And so they thought, "Oh, these are kisses that are coming out."

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.120
 And so they became Hershey's Kisses.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.080
 So yeah, it was literally suggestedly named.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.440
 It's better than Hershey's plops.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:08.280
 But also it's like the little tube comes down, doesn't it?

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.600
 And it goes very close to the conveyor belt

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.360
 and then drops it off and pulls up again.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.120
 So it's like it's kissing the conveyor belt.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.600
 Which is not like plopping.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.400
 No.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.360
 Sounds like it's still...

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.040
 They must have had a wet conveyor belt.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.280
 Oh.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.600
 Not for about this.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.440
 I'd never heard a conveyor belt make a kissing sound.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.120
 Hershey's Gentle Wet Plops.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.000
 We've all had American chocolate.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.040
 And that is my fact.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.320
 My fact is that graffiti in toilets is called "Latranalia"

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.880
 thanks to a professor in 1966

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.560
 who thought shithouse poetry wasn't technically correct.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.040
 Because of animal poetry.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.480
 It did seem to be...

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.560
 I did like this fact because it did seem to be

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.760
 that his objection was just that it wasn't technically correct, right?

00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.240
 Yeah.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.360
 Yeah, that's all it was.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.560
 He was an American folklorist called Alan Dundes.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.640
 And it was a fine term,

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.640
 but he just thought it's not all poetry.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.960
 You know, so he wrote, by the way, this paper

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.160
 which is called "Here I Sit".

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.400
 And it's a history of scatological graffiti,

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.920
 anything that we found from the ancient world

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.600
 all the way through to current day.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.520
 And he gave us this word as a result.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.680
 Which we use now on a daily basis.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.800
 Yeah, it's very common.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.680
 The contribution he's made.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.480
 Every day word.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.280
 Dundes had, in his paper,

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.520
 he had the theory that the reason that people write stuff on toilet walls

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.120
 is because they have a desire to smear things with their excrement.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.560
 Oh.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.240
 And apparently this is the socially accepted form of that impulse.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.360
 Right.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.160
 Whereas my newly invented turd crayon

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.240
 actually allows you to indulge both impulses at the same time.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:49.960
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.680
 I thought this was from the paper "Theses on Theses".

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.480
 Am I wrong?

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.920
 Maybe he republished.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.640
 Right.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.120
 I mean, James, as in my book, for instance,

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.000
 was released in hardback under the name "Everything to Play For"

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.320
 and in paperback under a load of old balls.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:03.880
 Wow.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.840
 Jesus.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.520
 Do you have a podcast as well?

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.880
 What's going on?

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.000
 Actually, no, you mentioned it.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.520
 Oh.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.920
 I just, it just felt like a really relevant example.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.240
 Yeah.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.440
 That was really relevant, Anna.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.320
 That's good work.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.760
 Guys, you're being weirdos.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.880
 And look, I don't mind, we can all be, we can be weirdos, but…

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:25.640
 Oh, I'm so sweet of you to publicize Dan's thing.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.600
 Yeah.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.480
 What a good mate.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.400
 So Duns, or Dundies,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.240
 I actually don't know how you pronounce his name.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.400
 I'm going to say Dundies just to contradict you guys.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.120
 Yeah, go for it.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.640
 He was a pretty interesting guy.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.800
 He was known as the jokes professor,

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.120
 because he made his lectures witty and funny,

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.040
 he included lots of riddles in them.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.440
 And he wrote some seriously controversial stuff,

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.640
 like a thing about how the German national character

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.680
 is inextricably bound up with anal erotic fixation,

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.160
 which made him contentious.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.440
 In Germany, I imagine.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.080
 Yeah.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.960
 I think largely in Germany, yeah, some of them objected.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.840
 Some of them loved it.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:03.640
 Fortunately, he only wrote it on the back of a toilet cubicle.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.480
 In his own feces.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.720
 Yeah, so, yeah, had a limited impact.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.960
 But he had this weird moment when he,

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.360
 just before he retired, which was the year 2000,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.160
 he got a letter which his wife opened and read,

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.760
 which I don't know what the dynamic is there.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.520
 But she said,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.160
 "Gosh, you've got this letter from a former student

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.800
 who says that what I learned in your anthropology classes

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.800
 influenced me every day of my life,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.560
 so I'm enclosing this check for you."

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.520
 And she said, "And it's a thousand dollars, darling."

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.880
 And so he said, "Wow, that's, gosh, how lovely."

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.360
 And then she said, "Hang on, I don't know how she miscounted.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.160
 Maybe it was an idiot."

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.640
 But she said, "Oh, actually, there are more zeros

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.600
 than I thought. It's actually a million dollars."

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.560
 And a former student just left him a million dollars.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.040
 If you've been enjoying this podcast for the last 10 years,

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.840
 feel free.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.400
 Which of us is willing to give out a home address

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.800
 to receive that million dollars?

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.800
 I will, but you have to read my letter to me

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.560
 because I just swamped.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.120
 That's very funny. Wow.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.000
 One of the things is I think there's been too much academic study

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.440
 written about latronalia and we need to pare it down

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.840
 because every Tom DeGeneres written a paper

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.960
 who doesn't know what else to do thinks,

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.960
 "How interesting, and I can really easily access this.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.800
 I'll just go to my uni toilets."

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.800
 And it's always about the gender difference

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.520
 because obviously mostly you get men's and women's toilets.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.120
 But it does seem true that sex is definitely

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.480
 the most common topic by far.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.320
 There was a study in Nigeria

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.080
 which found that 46% of men's and 37% of women's graffiti

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.440
 was about sex.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.680
 And women have more insults, but also more supportive.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.760
 Yeah, there was a study that was done in 2016

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.800
 by a guy called Scott Kelly who works in advertising

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.000
 and he just got curious about it.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.640
 And he had people going into toilets all over London,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.680
 I think 100 toilets.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.520
 And he asked both men and women to report back

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.240
 on what they found.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.240
 So some of the results showed that women were more likely

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.320
 to express feelings of love support

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.680
 and men were more likely to draw penises.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.720
 That was the large opening thing that they found.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.600
 The penises that were found on the walls of women's bathrooms

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.960
 had longer penises than the one on the men's walls.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.400
 Not sure what that means.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.920
 Was that because all the men were saying,

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.240
 "This is how big your penises you dickhead,"

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.000
 and then taking the piss out of someone?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.400
 I think it's because the men were tracing around

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.120
 their own penises when they were drawing the pictures

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.680
 on the wall, whereas women had to do it from memory.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.000
 Yeah, it's how men show support mutually, I think,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.960
 is insults and scatological.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.080
 There's a lot of correcting.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.200
 You see someone correct it.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.680
 Someone else is writing or repost, yeah.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.720
 Yeah, I saw an article about Lancaster University.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.480
 So this was Dialogues in Solitude.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.000
 And they talked about someone who'd written "Filed FC"

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.120
 and then someone else had written "R shit"

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.640
 and then someone else had written "Hot" underneath.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.720
 And they went into all sorts.

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.120
 They were like, "Here is an assertion made by A

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.680
 with the Ilocution Signalling Identification

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.280
 with the College Football Team.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.240
 B contributes a negative evaluation of the group in question,

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.240
 denigrating the identity of the other

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.440
 and consequently ameliorating in group identity.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.920
 There is then support for A by C,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.120
 shifting this negative evaluation by the addition of "Hot"

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.560
 which changes shit into an intensifier in shit-hot."

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.320
 If anything proves my complaint about academics

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.880
 wasting their time and hours, it is that.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.080
 It is remarkable, isn't it?

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.280
 I mean, literally.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.320
 Just get a light.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.920
 If that's been done with public money,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.600
 I'm a little bit vexed about that.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:36.440
 The entry for dictionary in the 1911 encyclopedia Britannica

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.000
 was written by a guy called Alan Walker Reed.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.760
 And he was also very big in Latranalia.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.760
 He wrote a book where he went around the Western United States

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.080
 picking up graffiti from toilet walls,

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.240
 but he had to publish it privately in Paris

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.840
 because no publisher would take it

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.600
 because it was so filthy.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.120
 Oh, wow.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.040
 Trust the Parisians.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:58.760
 Isn't that amazing?

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.640
 And even then, they only made 75 copies

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.800
 and there was a disclaimer on the front page

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.760
 saying this should be restricted to students of linguistics.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.000
 Wow, so funny.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.240
 Wow, Paris was the place.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.720
 Because wasn't it Paris that printed Ulysses as well?

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.840
 Ulysses, yeah, yeah.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.000
 It was the place to go if you had something filthy

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.320
 that you wanted to print.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.520
 Maybe Lady Chattely's Lover.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.320
 Did that have to be printed in France and then shipped over?

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:23.800
 Maybe.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.520
 I think so.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.240
 I think you might be right.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:25.960
 I remember, wow.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.360
 Paris actually, I think, had the first public urinals in public.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:30.760
 Is it well?

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.240
 You know, like the ones we have that raise up the street now,

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.120
 you can do in London.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.120
 I think, so I was reading about them

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.840
 because obviously, you know,

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.760
 this is about public toilets generally.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.160
 And there was an early 19th century

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.000
 prefect of the city called Rambuto.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.800
 A prefect?

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.360
 Sorry, like at private schools?

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.240
 Yeah, he wasn't head boy, but it was still my term.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.360
 Just go around telling other Parisians

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.680
 to do up the cravats immediately.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.400
 Exactly, so Rambuto, the prefect,

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.000
 ordered the construction of these things

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.240
 because people were weighing on the streets too much.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.800
 And it's just so interesting that immediately

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.600
 it gives privacy to people to transgress

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.000
 and being gay was not legal then.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.480
 And so that sort of gave an opportunity

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.920
 to be gay in private.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.600
 And by 1862, police were recording the locations

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.600
 of all the glory holes in the public toilets

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.560
 that had been made.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.320
 They were keeping a record.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.600
 So that was like, again, I didn't know

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.120
 glory holes went back that far.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.680
 But I remember probably said it on here,

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.000
 but the oldest glory hole in Australia

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.120
 is in Perth Museum.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.000
 Really?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.280
 And it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.160
 As in brought in?

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.440
 Wait, yeah, that's where it was.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.000
 Was it just...

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.040
 No, it was found in a public toilet

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.800
 and they brought it and put it into the collection.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.360
 Oh, wow.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.080
 Just the hole?

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.000
 As in, like, what's the...

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.960
 Anything is potentially an ex-glory hole.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.920
 I'm holding it.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.440
 I'm holding a glory hole here.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.160
 Can you see it?

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.600
 The Roman stuff we haven't talked about.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.960
 Is there actual evidence of it?

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.800
 I know there are sort of quotes about it.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.120
 So...

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:00.600
 Yeah.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.600
 Why, as in graffiti in ancient Rome?

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.400
 Do we have actual walls that were written on?

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.080
 I think in Pompeii they do, don't they?

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.440
 Yeah, Pompeii they do.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.080
 Oh, yes.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.520
 And that weirdly, that got me onto it.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.520
 Have we talked ever about the Latin thesaurus

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.920
 that has people have been writing since 1894?

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.600
 This is amazing.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.480
 Okay, this is some people in Munich.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.440
 They're making a dictionary of Latin, right?

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.840
 From 500 BC to 200 AD.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.360
 And what their aim is, is every single word ever written

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.600
 in Latin ends up in this dictionary.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.880
 So this is how I found it.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.360
 Researcher Marika Ottink said,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.040
 "If a word is just on a toilet in Pompeii in graffiti,

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.480
 you'll find it with us."

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.240
 So literally every word.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.040
 They started doing this in 1894.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.640
 The German government set it up.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.280
 They might be done by 2050 if they hurry,

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.360
 but they think it's probably actually a bit too ambitious.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.240
 How are they being so slow?

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.640
 I mean, all dictionaries are supposed to have every word in them.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.960
 I think it's every single word has an entry

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.880
 and a branching tree of how it relates to

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.440
 all the other words it's related to.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.080
 I see.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.400
 The most recent work they published was P, that of P,

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.520
 but they did skip N because it had a lot of words in it.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.720
 They have to go back at some point and do N, it's so annoying.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.080
 They have a lot of like,

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.280
 are they called hapex legomonons or something

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.040
 where they have one example of the word,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.480
 they just don't know what it means, right?

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.080
 If you've only got one example of a word being used,

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.600
 unless that is in a dictionary, say this word means this,

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.080
 it's really hard to ascertain exactly what it means.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.400
 If all uses of the word milkshake are lost in future,

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.320
 in 500 years, apart from in the song,

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.680
 "My milkshake brings all the boats to the yard,"

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.920
 there'll be feverish scholar debate

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.200
 about what a milkshake was.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:42.680
 What is it?

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.560
 Exactly.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.760
 You can infer things.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.920
 So if you've only got a word that's on a toilet wall

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.320
 that says X person's name is an absolute questionable word,

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.920
 you know, you can infer, can't you?

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.800
 It might be legend.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.920
 Yeah, it might be asshole.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.000
 I suppose that's a good point, yeah.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 I didn't consider legend as a possibility.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:09.800
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.960
 and that is James.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.240
 Okay, my fact this week is that Pizza Hut in Hong Kong

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.320
 sells a pizza topped with ham, mushroom, and snake.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.720
 Almost.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.920
 Disgusting.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.120
 I think that's like pepperoni, though.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.600
 If you slice the snake finely enough.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.200
 Oh, sorry.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.280
 I was thinking the mushroom part was disgusting,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.880
 but now I see actually that the snake is the unusual bit.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.280
 Yes, so this is Pizza Hut in Hong Kong.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:45.400
 They have done a team up with a restaurant called Sir Wong Fun,

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.560
 which is arguably the oldest restaurant in operation in Hong Kong.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.000
 And this restaurant has lots of specialties,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.680
 which includes snake meat.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.320
 And so the Hong Kong Pizza Hut decided,

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.320
 well, why don't we put some on our pizzas?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.760
 And I don't know how popular it is.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.520
 I wouldn't eat it.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.800
 Do you know what kind of snake?

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.920
 Oh, what a good question.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.760
 I do not actually.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.720
 It's like Scampi, isn't it?

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.080
 There's lots of stuff in there.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:11.640
 You can eat.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.440
 There's lots of different species of snake that are eaten.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.720
 So I actually don't know.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.320
 For instance, we even at Viper in England.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:19.880
 Really?

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.480
 At various times in our history.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.360
 We have a few cookbooks with Viper recipes in them.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.240
 Wow.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.360
 I actually wonder why we don't.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.080
 There must be something.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.280
 It must not be that tasty.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.880
 Otherwise, why aren't we eating snake?

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.640
 I don't think it's very tasty.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.440
 Ken Elm Digby, father of Everard Digby,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.960
 friend of the podcast,

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.520
 come up with a recipe of a Viper wine at some point.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.720
 I think he did with Cockail as well in the same book.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.480
 Interesting.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.560
 Apparently, just on the taste of snake,

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.560
 according to the Oxford Companion, it's a food.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.360
 They say generally, the obvious resemblance between eels and snakes

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.680
 make recipes for one suited to the other.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.880
 But snakes are leaner.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.680
 They taste a bit ealy, apparently.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:04.440
 Do you know when the best time to eat this pizza is?

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.080
 And I don't mean in terms of like, you know, 7pm,

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.520
 I mean seasonal.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.160
 Ooh.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.920
 Oh, snake season.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.040
 When the snakes are big.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:12.280
 Yeah.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.960
 So it's when the autumn wind begins to blow.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.320
 And the reason is because they've fattened up the snakes

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.040
 at this point in preparation for hibernation.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.240
 So you're getting your snakiest topping when you order it then.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:33.320
 Pizza Hut are very good at this kind of regional specializing,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.120
 aren't they?

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:34.680
 Are they?

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.000
 Well, I found a few other examples from around the place.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.560
 These are a bit less visceral.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.160
 I mean, Pizza Hut Middle East did a cheeseburger crown crust pizza

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.440
 which has a ring of miniature cheeseburgers around the edge of the crust.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.640
 Sounds great.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.280
 Fine.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:48.840
 Well, all right.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.520
 How do you think about this one, James?

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.040
 Pizza Hut Malaysia, which offered a kind of squirting crust.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.240
 Okay.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.640
 Isn't that a stuffed crust that you've squeezed?

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.080
 What's it squirting?

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.440
 Garlic sauce and cheese.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.720
 Isn't that just a stuffed crust?

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.560
 For some reason, it's more impressive than a stuffed crust.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.960
 It's more of a blast zone, apparently.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.920
 Oh, okay.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.400
 Okay.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.040
 All right.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.040
 I had a little bit of a look at the stuffed crust,

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.120
 and it's a fascinating tale.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.480
 So any of you guys see this?

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.680
 No, no.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.480
 The inventor of the stuffed crust has actually had a

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.520
 full-on documentary released about him called Stolen Dough.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.240
 Brilliant.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.640
 And he's called Anthony Mongello.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.960
 He invented it in the 1980s, and Pizza Hut stole it.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.720
 He once accidentally made a pizza badly, made the crust too big,

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.040
 saw there's this big hole in my crust.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.640
 Let's stuff it with cheese.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.200
 And he mentioned this to his dad, who actually had invented

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.720
 a machine for molding mozzarella.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.600
 So there are big cheese--

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.640
 How convenient.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.000
 Inventory cheese.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.320
 He accidentally invented stuffed crust after his father

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.800
 invented an incredibly complicated industrial component

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.920
 to mold mozzarella.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.640
 What are the odds?

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.480
 I'm so annoyed.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.080
 I'm so annoyed every time.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:55.800
 Yeah.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.680
 It's a collab.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.480
 That's a collab.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.600
 I'm sure he invented it thanks to a combination of circumstances

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.760
 which are not like, oh, are you trolling my pizza?

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.560
 What can I fill it with?

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.840
 Well, I don't have a snake to hand.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.360
 I'm a little more organic than that, isn't it?

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.400
 You've grown up in a family where cheese is a big thing.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.200
 You're often talking about it, especially squishy cheese.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:14.600
 Completely.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.760
 I'm just saying circumstances are a bigger factor than accident.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.400
 Yeah.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.160
 No one's claimed an accident.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.640
 I haven't claimed that he invented it by accident.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.440
 He very much invented the stuffed crust intentionally.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.640
 OK, OK, good.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.000
 With money in mind.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.320
 Well, like he mentioned in the car, which just somehow

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.440
 magically happened.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.080
 The crucial thing is he's got a patent.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.600
 Then he called up pizza places.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.880
 He called up Pizza Hut and said, look,

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.640
 do you want this stuffed crust thing I've invented?

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.000
 Pizza Hut said, no.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 Eight years later, what shows up on Pizza Hut's menu?

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.880
 It's the stuffed crust.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.040
 And what's the big claim?

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.200
 They were probably just making a pizza

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.920
 and noticed that there was a hole in their pizza tripped over.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.440
 So mozzarella landed in there.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.920
 They didn't even attempt to claim that.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.680
 They basically offered him 50 grand and was like, well, you know.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.880
 And he was like, get stuffed.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.080
 That's what it should have been called, this documentary.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.840
 The stolen dough is very good as well.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.000
 I think get stuff would be the Pizza Hut response

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.080
 documentary in the documentary rat battle.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.040
 But he decided to reject their offer

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.120
 and sued them for $1 billion.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.240
 $1 billion.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.680
 It's always a great number to sue.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.320
 Yeah.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.520
 It is really cool, isn't it?

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.800
 It's very Dr. Evil, but it's destined to failure, which it did.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.040
 Oh, did you get anything?

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:28.840
 He got nothing.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.720
 Just take what you're offered, guys.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.600
 That's the solution of this.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:37.560
 Just very quickly, do you know how they cook pizzas at Pizza Hut?

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.680
 Did they put them in a pizza oven?

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.320
 In a pizza oven.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.680
 They use a conveyor belt.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.880
 No.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.280
 They do.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:42.840
 Really?

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.240
 Yeah.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.920
 It goes on a little conveyor belt and heads into the oven.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.840
 And it comes out the other side cooked.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.240
 Like those things that make toast in hotels.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:51.720
 Yeah.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.120
 Yeah.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.040
 Like that.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.840
 That's very good.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.240
 It's silly because you can't adjust the toastedness, can you?

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.680
 You should be able to adjust the speed.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.960
 Well, you can adjust the toastedness.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.520
 There are dials.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.000
 What?

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.760
 And also, I mean, the problem is they often only toast one side of the bread.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.480
 So you get toast that's charred on one side and bread on the other.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.440
 You guys are going to terrible hotels.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:10.760
 Yes.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.800
 Gens, we'll go on tour together.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.120
 It's annoying when you go off to the local Hilton with your fancy toasting machines.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:23.640
 In 2012, they launched a promotion, Pizza Hut, where if you were in the American

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:28.040
 presidential debates and you asked the candidates whether they preferred sausage or pepperoni

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.120
 on their pizza, you would win free pizza for life.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.000
 OK.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.040
 Did anyone do it?

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.720
 No, because there was an outcry.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.120
 I think it was degrading democracy.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.760
 Little did they know.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.800
 And they moved it online and just instead randomly selected someone to win free pizza

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.720
 for life, which I think was also a swiz because what is free pizza for life?

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:51.560
 They always, what they do is they work out the average number of pizzas that someone eats in a

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:56.920
 year. And like that's always down because they include people who just don't eat pizza.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.360
 And then they say, OK, well, the average person eats one and a half pizzas a year.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.800
 If we include everyone who lives in Mauritania, who's never heard of pizza.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.960
 And so, yeah, they give you a voucher for like 12 pizzas.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.280
 Yeah, it wasn't that quite, it was a free pizza a week, but only for 30 years.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.920
 I think after 30 years, you are probably done.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.400
 I think if you're eating that many pizzas, that probably is your life expectancy.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:23.400
 I would like the right to have 9000 pizzas now.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.120
 Do you know what I mean?

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:29.960
 It should be any number of pizzas you want for eternity.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.440
 I agree.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.080
 Do you know which country eats the most pizza?

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.960
 It's so surprising.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.520
 Italy.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.160
 Italy.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:35.560
 Lovely.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:40.440
 I'll accept James's answer as less wrong, but still wrong.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.720
 What would it be?

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.080
 I think it must be, do you mean per capita or?

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:45.880
 Per capita, yes.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.880
 I think, and it's quite hard to explain why, and no one has adequately done it.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.560
 So my theory is that this place perhaps doesn't have access to that much good,

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.440
 fresh food, because of its geographical location.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.360
 You're quite far away, it's Norway.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.080
 Easter Island.

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.840
 Oh, okay, sorry, I'll take it back.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:08.280
 Norway eats by far the most pizza, so 11.4 kilos per person.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.200
 Next is Canada, 8.9.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.280
 So that's so much.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.160
 Most of it is frozen pizza that you buy from the supermarket,

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:19.400
 and half of those are this brand called Grandiosa,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.080
 and they really want a Norwegian to write in.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:27.080
 When we went to Norway, maybe I'm conflating two places here,

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.280
 but I feel like there was quite a lot of these 7-Eleven places

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.840
 where you could just buy slices of pizza all the time.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.120
 Oh, that's good.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.480
 I think that might be part of it.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.120
 Buying a slice is good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.080
 That makes sense.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.520
 Is it good pizza there?

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.480
 No, I think it's not.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.440
 I think they like it to the extent that when a,

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.040
 the company that makes Grandiosa,

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.240
 which is called Staborette,

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.400
 when they produced a pizza-themed song

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.360
 called Respect for Grandiosa in 2006,

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.240
 it was at the top of the country's music charts for eight weeks.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.040
 Oh my God.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.080
 But I also think it's not particularly good pizza.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.800
 Yeah, but it doesn't prove it really.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.040
 It doesn't prove the taste thing, does it?

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.680
 No.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.320
 Should we mention true pizza from Naples?

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:09.720
 Yeah.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.080
 Because it's, it's very serious in Naples.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:18.280
 So there is the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana,

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.200
 and this was set up in 1984

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.640
 by the 17 most eminent pizza clans in Naples.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:28.200
 So rough on the 18th most eminent.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.280
 I know, I know, and there's a guide to Neapolitan Pizza,

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.880
 what it needs to be to become accredited.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.040
 So if you, even if you're anywhere around the world,

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.960
 you can make a proper Neapolitan Pizza,

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.800
 but you have to adhere to this guide.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.640
 It's 27 pages long,

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:46.360
 and it's incredibly strict about the kind of things you need.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:46.920
 What is it?

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.280
 Is it like just like literally cheese, tomato, and basil or something?

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.120
 There are, yeah, there are,

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.240
 there are lots of rules about the dough and the scorch marks

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.240
 and that kind of stuff.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.400
 And these dimensions, like maximum dimension is 35 centimetres across,

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.840
 all of this stuff.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.000
 Even, they claim that even Roman and Sicilian pizzas

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.160
 are just sort of bastardised for catchers.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.000
 I mean, they're probably very proud of it.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.720
 Well, I think like modern pizzas were invented in America really,

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.600
 weren't they?

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.240
 Because like, basically what happened was,

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.280
 Italian immigrants, or immigrants to America,

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.080
 had this thing called tomato pie,

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.080
 which is basically like a pizza,

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.680
 but the cheese would go on the bottom

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.440
 and the tomato would go on the top.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:28.760
 What?

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.640
 And then they kind of over the years, especially in New York,

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.640
 they kind of added toppings

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.320
 and they swapped the cheese and the tomato around

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.040
 and they created what we would now know as a pizza.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:42.680
 Oh, sorry.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.160
 I thought you meant the cheese went on like the underside

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.240
 and the tomato went on the top side.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.480
 Like a sandwich, a bread sandwich.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.840
 Yeah, well, how do you hold this?

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.720
 That's disgusting.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.960
 And so then what happened was,

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.440
 American tourists would go over to Italy

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.400
 and they'd want pizzas like they knew at home.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.600
 And so Italians would start making pizzas

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.920
 in this American Italian style.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.000
 And so that's why now, even in Italy,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.760
 most of the pizzas will be this kind of modern style of pizza.

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.640
 That's very interesting.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.360
 You know what's so weird?

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.560
 You mentioned New York.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.840
 It wasn't until September 20th, 1944,

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.120
 that pizza got its first proper mention in a newspaper.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.560
 And even more exciting,

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.400
 the article uses what they say is

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.120
 the rare use of the plural of pizza,

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.440
 which is pizza.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.080
 Pizza.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.800
 Oh, that's nice.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.960
 Yeah, yeah, we'll do that from now on, pizza.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.480
 I actually, I did find another mention in from 1935

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.440
 from New York about a pizza restaurant,

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.520
 describing it excitedly as this new invention.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.360
 Yeah, so I think it might have come up a little bit,

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.480
 but it was like a calzone, I think it was stuffed,

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.000
 which I think they often were at this time.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.280
 And it said that pizza is best served as a side to roast beef.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.120
 How interesting.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:57.400
 Because you know calzone used to mean

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.360
 sausage wrapped in a tube of dough was a calzone.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.200
 Like a toad in the hole.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.800
 Well, like a sausage roll, basically.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.640
 And then eventually it became a folded over pizza,

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.160
 but really a true calzone should be just a sausage roll.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.440
 Sausage stuffed crust.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.480
 That's interesting.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:17.240
 The word pizza originally was pizza, like pizza bread.

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:21.800
 And it gets a name from the old word for pitch,

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.160
 you know, like a pine pitch that you might paint onto a ship

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.720
 so that it doesn't, so that it's waterproof.

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.480
 And is that because you're painting the tomato pitch

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.760
 onto the boat, which is the pizza in this instance?

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.280
 No, it's because when you paint pitch onto wood,

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.040
 it kind of comes into layers.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.720
 And quite a lot of breads and cakes are quite layered.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.640
 And so you have in lots of different languages,

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.920
 you have pitch cakes and pitch breads in the Middle East.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.720
 It became pizza.

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.520
 And then that came to Italy and they called it pizza.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.080
 That's great.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.920
 The 2024 World Dominoes Championship.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.040
 Is this Dominoes Pizza?

00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:58.920
 I'm talking pizzas.

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.520
 So the game, the game Dominoes.

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.520
 - Sponsored by? - Pizza Hut.

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.520

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520
 - Is it? - Yeah.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.520

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.520
 - That's brilliant. - They've run out of--

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.520
 People who like Domino's love Pizza Hut.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.520
 - That is so good. - Very clever.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.520
 - That's stunning. - Very clever.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.520
 - Domino's is very clever. - Very clever.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.520
