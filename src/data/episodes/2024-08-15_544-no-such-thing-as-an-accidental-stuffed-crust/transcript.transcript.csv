00:00:02,00:00:03,"Hey, everyone."
00:00:03,00:00:06,"Before we begin this week's episode of Fish,"
00:00:06,00:00:08,we just want to remind you that the four of us
00:00:08,00:00:11,are heading back out on tour as of this September
00:00:11,00:00:16,"with our massive 10th anniversary show, ""Thundernerds."""
00:00:16,00:00:17,"It's going to be so good, guys."
00:00:17,00:00:18,We're going all over.
00:00:18,00:00:20,It's an earth sandwich tour.
00:00:20,00:00:22,"We're doing the UK, we're doing Ireland,"
00:00:22,00:00:24,and then we're going to the New World.
00:00:24,00:00:25,"To Australia and New Zealand, those shows"
00:00:25,00:00:28,are almost entirely sold out in the New World.
00:00:28,00:00:30,"But old world dates, there are some tickets left,"
00:00:30,00:00:34,"so we're going to be playing Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, New"
00:00:34,00:00:38,"Castle, Cardiff, London, London again, and Manchester."
00:00:38,00:00:38,That's right.
00:00:38,00:00:41,"So if you want to come and experience the dorkery in person,"
00:00:41,00:00:42,it's a wild night.
00:00:42,00:00:44,We record a live podcast.
00:00:44,00:00:46,We include extras.
00:00:46,00:00:48,We've just written and performed our first preview of it.
00:00:48,00:00:51,"It was smashing, incredibly exciting."
00:00:51,00:00:54,You're going to meet characters from the archives of our show.
00:00:54,00:00:57,You're going to find out how we put all the show together.
00:00:57,00:00:59,"We're going behind the scenes, and it's"
00:00:59,00:01:00,going to be a wild night.
00:01:00,00:01:04,"So come, be with us in one of these big old rooms,"
00:01:04,00:01:06,and let's have a massive night out together.
00:01:06,00:01:09,Just head to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.
00:01:09,00:01:11,You'll find the links to every single one of those shows
00:01:11,00:01:13,"by ticket, and we'll see you there."
00:01:13,00:01:14,"Yes, we cannot wait."
00:01:14,00:01:15,It's so much fun.
00:01:15,00:01:18,Knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.
00:01:18,00:01:22,It's the perfect thing to do or the perfect gift
00:01:22,00:01:25,to buy someone you love who likes fish
00:01:25,00:01:29,and is happy to see them us on stage.
00:01:29,00:01:30,"Cool, on with the show."
00:01:30,00:01:30,Bye.
00:01:30,00:01:31,Always end strong.
00:01:31,00:01:33,"OK, on with the show."
00:01:33,00:01:54,"Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:01:54,00:01:57,"of Knowsuchthingasafish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:57,00:02:01,from four undisplosed locations around the UK.
00:02:01,00:02:02,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:02,00:02:05,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James"
00:02:05,00:02:07,"Harkin, and Anna Tyshinski."
00:02:07,00:02:09,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:09,00:02:12,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:15,00:02:19,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:02:19,00:02:21,My fact this week is that in the swimming races
00:02:21,00:02:25,"at the first modern Olympics, the American competitor"
00:02:25,00:02:29,drops out because the water was too cold.
00:02:29,00:02:31,That is amazing.
00:02:31,00:02:32,And how things have changed now?
00:02:32,00:02:34,Because they've had to change some of the swimming events
00:02:34,00:02:36,because there's feces in the Sen.
00:02:36,00:02:37,"Oh, yes."
00:02:37,00:02:39,"Oh, wow."
00:02:39,00:02:41,"Actually, well, similarly, now we"
00:02:41,00:02:44,"have a lot of water events happening in the Sen,"
00:02:44,00:02:45,which is natural water.
00:02:45,00:02:47,And this was 1896.
00:02:47,00:02:50,And the swimming events happened in the Med.
00:02:50,00:02:53,So that was surprisingly chilly.
00:02:53,00:02:54,Very nice.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"Yes, I think it was partly because the Olympics had gone"
00:02:57,00:02:59,"three times over budget, and so they couldn't really"
00:02:59,00:03:02,afford to build proper swimming pools or set up those venues.
00:03:02,00:03:03,And so they thought--
00:03:03,00:03:05,Or heat the entire Mediterranean.
00:03:05,00:03:05,Yeah.
00:03:05,00:03:06,All that.
00:03:06,00:03:09,"The Med is, of course, hotter than your big oceans,"
00:03:09,00:03:12,"but this was happening earlier on in the year,"
00:03:12,00:03:15,"in March or April, depending on which calendar you were using."
00:03:15,00:03:17,And it was surprisingly cold.
00:03:17,00:03:18,It was surprisingly bad weather.
00:03:18,00:03:21,And this competitor was called Gardner Williams.
00:03:21,00:03:23,And this is all recounted by one of his fellow competitors
00:03:23,00:03:25,who was there at the time.
00:03:25,00:03:27,So there's some question as to whether this definitely happened.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"But his mate, who was there competing with him, said,"
00:03:29,00:03:30,this is what happened.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"And as this guy called Tom Curtis tells it,"
00:03:33,00:03:37,this guy had won many races in warm American swimming pools.
00:03:37,00:03:38,And he was blissfully ignorant that the Mediterranean
00:03:38,00:03:40,is bitterly cold in April.
00:03:40,00:03:42,So a boat took them out.
00:03:42,00:03:44,He dived headfirst into the icy water.
00:03:44,00:03:47,"And in a split second, his head reappeared."
00:03:47,00:03:50,"He shouted, Jesus Christ, I'm freezing."
00:03:50,00:03:53,"And with that shriek of astonished frenzy,"
00:03:53,00:03:55,he lashed back to the float.
00:03:55,00:03:58,But it sounds like it wasn't even just the coldness.
00:03:58,00:04:00,It sounds like the waves were crazy as hell.
00:04:00,00:04:04,The winner of the match describes 12-foot waves crashing down
00:04:04,00:04:07,onto him as he was swimming towards the ending.
00:04:07,00:04:12,Your lanes were only shown to you via hollowed out pumpkins
00:04:12,00:04:13,that were floating in the ocean.
00:04:13,00:04:15,It sounded wild.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"I think it genuinely was really cold,"
00:04:17,00:04:21,"because the guy who won was called Alfred Hajos, I think."
00:04:21,00:04:24,And he wrote of this event that the icy water
00:04:24,00:04:26,almost cut into our stomachs.
00:04:26,00:04:28,We called him Hajos or Hajos or Hayos.
00:04:28,00:04:31,"Oh, Hajos sounds actually like here."
00:04:31,00:04:33,"He was Hungarian, wasn't he?"
00:04:33,00:04:35,He was actually known as the Hungarian dolphin.
00:04:35,00:04:37,So he could just call him that
00:04:37,00:04:39,and save the pronunciation issue.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"Brilliant. So the Hungarian dolphin,"
00:04:41,00:04:47,he was also later the manager of the Hungarian football team.
00:04:47,00:04:49,He learned to swim when he was 13 years old
00:04:49,00:04:51,after his father had drowned in the Danube
00:04:51,00:04:54,and he decided that he should learn how to swim.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"And when the Olympics started,"
00:04:56,00:05:00,he was at the local university
00:05:00,00:05:02,"and he really, really struggled to get permission"
00:05:02,00:05:04,to leave and go to the Olympics.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"And in fact, when he came back with his medals,"
00:05:06,00:05:09,he said the dean did not congratulate me.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"He said your medals are of no interest to me,"
00:05:11,00:05:13,but I am eager to hear your replies
00:05:13,00:05:14,in your next examination.
00:05:16,00:05:17,"Well, of course, like in those days,"
00:05:17,00:05:20,the Olympics wasn't that big a deal.
00:05:20,00:05:22,"No, it wasn't. It didn't even exist."
00:05:22,00:05:24,"It didn't. It's like the first,"
00:05:24,00:05:27,"if I just went off to a made up competition,"
00:05:27,00:05:28,"if I told you guys,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,"oh, I'm going to be away for three weeks"
00:05:30,00:05:33,because I'm going to the global haiku slam event.
00:05:33,00:05:35,We would totally believe it.
00:05:35,00:05:37,Yeah. But if you Google it and there was no evidence of it.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"Yeah, exactly. I don't know."
00:05:39,00:05:41,I think I sort of understand it.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"Although in fairness, Andy, it was in the newspapers."
00:05:43,00:05:45,"If you look back in the newspaper archives,"
00:05:45,00:05:48,"you can see that in America, they were reporting on it."
00:05:48,00:05:49,They report on this guy that Anna
00:05:49,00:05:51,"and Richard Lee mentioned, Gardner Williams,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,at the start that he's going.
00:05:53,00:05:55,And then you don't really see any mention of him
00:05:55,00:05:56,in the results.
00:05:56,00:05:58,So that does bear credence to the idea
00:05:58,00:05:59,that he jumped in the water.
00:05:59,00:06:01,It was too cold and he jumped out again.
00:06:01,00:06:05,"Yeah. Yeah, I saw one amazing article in the Boston Globe."
00:06:05,00:06:08,"This was from the 12th of April, 1896."
00:06:08,00:06:10,And they said that when Gardner Williams arrived
00:06:10,00:06:11,"on the boat in Athens,"
00:06:11,00:06:15,he came on to land in his trunks and a purple robe.
00:06:15,00:06:16,"And announced to the press,"
00:06:16,00:06:20,"""Leander swam the hellish pond and I will swim this here."""
00:06:20,00:06:22,"Oh, sentences you regret."
00:06:22,00:06:25,I have a feeling it might have been satire.
00:06:25,00:06:28,"They didn't admit at any stage that this was a satirical piece,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,but I think it might have been.
00:06:30,00:06:32,"Because they mentioned another guy called Hoyt,"
00:06:32,00:06:34,"who was a polevolter, and they said that he was practicing"
00:06:34,00:06:37,over a statue of Zeus outside his hotel.
00:06:37,00:06:40,"And that he knocked the guard off his pedestal three times,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,but cleared him at the fourth try.
00:06:42,00:06:44,Wow. So I can't tell if it's real or not.
00:06:44,00:06:47,I believe there was so much mad stuff happening
00:06:47,00:06:48,"at these, the first ever games."
00:06:48,00:06:52,"As in the 1200 meter event, it wasn't like you started,"
00:06:52,00:06:55,you got in the water and then you swam along the shore for 1200 meters.
00:06:55,00:06:58,"You were taken 1200 meters away from land,"
00:06:58,00:07:00,and then you were just ditched in the ocean.
00:07:00,00:07:02,So if you don't finish... It was about surviving.
00:07:02,00:07:05,"Yeah, if you don't finish the race, you die. That's it."
00:07:05,00:07:07,"It was only, because we are saying the water's quite cold,"
00:07:07,00:07:10,"it was only, I think, about 12 degrees, which is chilly."
00:07:10,00:07:12,"But just if there are world swimmers out there,"
00:07:12,00:07:15,"they'll be like, ""Come on, guys, you pussies."""
00:07:15,00:07:17,"I would say in the med, if people are swimming"
00:07:17,00:07:19,"at the start of April in the med,"
00:07:19,00:07:22,"you usually look at them and go, ""Oh, that's a hardy soul."""
00:07:22,00:07:25,"Yeah. Yeah, exactly."
00:07:25,00:07:28,Can I tell you guys about my favourite competitor
00:07:28,00:07:29,from the 1896 Olympics?
00:07:29,00:07:30,"Yeah, go for it. Please."
00:07:30,00:07:34,Have you heard of Italian runner Carlo Iroldi?
00:07:34,00:07:36,I did not hear of him.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"OK. Oh, great. OK."
00:07:37,00:07:42,So he walked to the games.
00:07:42,00:07:46,"He was from Milan, and they were taking place in Athens."
00:07:46,00:07:48,"And he was a great long-distance runner, right?"
00:07:48,00:07:51,"He'd done... The previous year, he'd done a 600-mile race"
00:07:51,00:07:52,in lots of different stages.
00:07:52,00:07:54,So really good at long-distance running.
00:07:54,00:07:56,He hears about this... He hears about this marathon.
00:07:56,00:07:58,"He thinks, ""That's a piece of piss."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"It wasn't 26. Easy."""
00:08:00,00:08:01,"So he thinks, ""I'll do it."""
00:08:01,00:08:04,But he didn't have money for a train or a ship
00:08:04,00:08:05,or whatever from Italy degrees.
00:08:05,00:08:08,"So he thought, ""I'll just walk. I'll just walk there."""
00:08:08,00:08:10,"And he briefly got a boat at one stage,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,but he did walk or run about 900 kilometres
00:08:13,00:08:16,"from his home to Athens, right?"
00:08:16,00:08:18,So what's the comedy thing that happens at the end?
00:08:18,00:08:21,If you're writing this as a script.
00:08:21,00:08:24,He arrives at the start line... Yeah.
00:08:24,00:08:29,..and he's forgotten his shoes and has to go back.
00:08:29,00:08:31,That's good. That's good.
00:08:31,00:08:34,They've moved the venue back to where he'd originally walked from.
00:08:34,00:08:37,"Yeah, it's in Milan. Yeah, yeah. It's in Milan, yeah."
00:08:37,00:08:39,"No, what happened was he got there in time for the games,"
00:08:39,00:08:42,"amazingly impressive, and then he was asked,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"""Oh, by the way, have you ever competed in one money for athletics?"""
00:08:44,00:08:48,"And he said, ""Oh, yeah, I did win the Milan to Barcelona race last year,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,"which was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of kilometres."""
00:08:50,00:08:52,"And they said, ""Oh, sorry. Well, you can't run then. Bye."""
00:08:52,00:08:55,No. Disqualified for being a professional.
00:08:55,00:08:56,That's really sad.
00:08:56,00:08:58,So your favourite competitor at the 1896 Olympics
00:08:58,00:09:01,"was not, in fact, a competitor. That's right, that's right."
00:09:01,00:09:03,He was a cheat. He was an attempted cheat.
00:09:03,00:09:07,Can I give you my favourite competitor for the 1896 Olympics?
00:09:07,00:09:12,"This was Sum Napeen, who was a pistol-fireer."
00:09:12,00:09:14,He won the 30-metre free pistol.
00:09:14,00:09:18,"And when he got home, he arrived a little bit early"
00:09:18,00:09:20,and surprised his wife with his medal.
00:09:20,00:09:22,"""Hey, honey, I'm home early."""
00:09:22,00:09:26,And she was in bed with his daughter's Dutch music teacher.
00:09:26,00:09:28,Oh!
00:09:28,00:09:32,"And so he chased him out of the house, firing his gun,"
00:09:32,00:09:36,bearing in mind that he's just won a gold medal at the 30-metre free pistol.
00:09:36,00:09:38,Chases this guy out of the house.
00:09:38,00:09:43,The guy runs away and the police arrest him and put him in jail.
00:09:43,00:09:47,"And then in the court case later on, he was let off"
00:09:47,00:09:50,because they realised that he was such a good pistol-shooter
00:09:50,00:09:53,that he obviously hadn't meant to shoot the guy.
00:09:53,00:09:53,Brilliant.
00:09:53,00:09:56,"If he meant to shoot him, of course he would have hit him."
00:09:56,00:09:59,So they said that he's shown restraint and he got free.
00:09:59,00:10:02,"I was... Because when you said he runs out of the house firing his first pistol,"
00:10:02,00:10:04,I'm thinking of him like being Yosemite Sam.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Do you know what I mean?
00:10:05,00:10:07,I think there was some of that.
00:10:07,00:10:08,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:08,00:10:09,Um...
00:10:09,00:10:12,"No, sorry, I was too distracting."
00:10:12,00:10:14,"Sorry, what was that?"
00:10:14,00:10:19,"So, listener, what happened there is we are recording this over the internet"
00:10:19,00:10:21,on a particular system.
00:10:21,00:10:24,"And when Addy did his Yosemite Sam shooting the guns in the air,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,a load of balloons came up.
00:10:26,00:10:27,How do I make it happen again?
00:10:27,00:10:29,I just... I was just like...
00:10:29,00:10:31,You have to not be trying.
00:10:31,00:10:32,What?
00:10:32,00:10:33,It knows if you want it.
00:10:33,00:10:34,Wow.
00:10:34,00:10:35,What was that?
00:10:35,00:10:37,"Yeah, that was incredibly distracting."
00:10:37,00:10:38,That was wild.
00:10:38,00:10:41,"I think if I do a thumbs up, it makes a thumbs up on the screen."
00:10:41,00:10:41,There we go.
00:10:41,00:10:42,It does.
00:10:42,00:10:43,Let's not do too many...
00:10:43,00:10:45,"Oh, Addy, no, don't take your pants off."
00:10:45,00:10:49,"Oh, Addy!"
00:10:49,00:10:51,Two other things from the original Olympics that I quite like.
00:10:51,00:10:54,The Greek team won gold in gymnastics
00:10:54,00:10:58,and they would not win another gold in gymnastics for a hundred years.
00:10:58,00:11:02,So it wasn't until the 1996 Olympics that they got their next gold.
00:11:02,00:11:04,And the other thing is the hurdles.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"They used to jump with two feet over it at the same time,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,rather than doing that one leg and then the second leg coming over it.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"Yeah, so according to what I was reading, I haven't seen any footage."
00:11:13,00:11:14,"The Greeks did, I think."
00:11:14,00:11:17,I think the American hurdler rocked up and saw the Greek doing that
00:11:17,00:11:20,"and thought, ""That's absolutely hilarious. You're screwed."
00:11:20,00:11:21,"I'm going to win this."""
00:11:21,00:11:21,Which he did.
00:11:21,00:11:26,"Because the Americans were all into college athletics at that time, weren't they?"
00:11:26,00:11:29,Competing for Harvard or Yale or whatever.
00:11:29,00:11:32,And they were really seasoned competitors
00:11:32,00:11:34,compared to some of the other people who literally just rocked up
00:11:34,00:11:36,"and went, ""Oh, I might just do this then."""
00:11:36,00:11:40,"Yeah, in fact, they were largely from, as you say, Harvard."
00:11:40,00:11:42,"And it was the Boston Athletics Association,"
00:11:42,00:11:45,which was responsible for getting most of them there.
00:11:45,00:11:47,Which I mentioned because there's a really funny thing
00:11:47,00:11:50,"that was actually mentioned in this article by Tom Curtis,"
00:11:50,00:11:51,who was the hurdler who won gold.
00:11:51,00:11:55,"He said that they had a chant, which it's hard to know how it went,"
00:11:55,00:11:59,"but I think it was BAA, rah, rah, rah."
00:11:59,00:12:00,So Boston Athletics Association.
00:12:00,00:12:05,"And according to him, no one in Europe had ever seen cheering in unison before."
00:12:05,00:12:07,So everyone was incredibly excited by this.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"And King George, who the king was presiding over it all,"
00:12:09,00:12:12,"like he judged if there was a tie, he was there."
00:12:12,00:12:15,King George was so excited that the Americans did this chant.
00:12:15,00:12:18,And King George's aid came up to the Americans
00:12:18,00:12:19,and saluted them solemnly.
00:12:19,00:12:24,"And said, ""His Majesty, the king, requests that you, for him,"
00:12:24,00:12:27,"will make one more that funny sound."""
00:12:27,00:12:28,As he wrote it.
00:12:28,00:12:30,And they had to do it again.
00:12:30,00:12:33,"And then he gave them a celebratory breakfast the next day,"
00:12:33,00:12:35,"at which, again, he said to the Americans,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,"""Would you mind doing that funny chant you did again, please?"""
00:12:37,00:12:39,"Wow, so funny."
00:12:39,00:12:41,"Yeah, he was quite involved, wasn't he, the king?"
00:12:41,00:12:45,He decided that no one should measure any of the long jumps.
00:12:45,00:12:49,"Because he thought that, oh, that's just the kind of thing professionals do."
00:12:49,00:12:51,So we don't want professionals at this.
00:12:51,00:12:53,It's an amateur athletics thing.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"We'll work out who's the longest just through looking with our eyes,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,but we're not actually going to measure it.
00:12:57,00:12:59,And so we don't know what the longest distance was
00:12:59,00:13:01,"and that Olympics, we know who won it."
00:13:01,00:13:02,We don't know what they jumped.
00:13:02,00:13:03,Really?
00:13:03,00:13:04,That's really good.
00:13:04,00:13:10,I was actually reading up on how we do find if things are too close
00:13:10,00:13:13,"and like a photo finish, what technology is out there now."
00:13:13,00:13:17,"But the swimming, they use a very interesting process in the pools,"
00:13:17,00:13:20,which is they have a pad that the swimmers need to touch.
00:13:20,00:13:24,"And I think I've worked out a hack, push out a wave"
00:13:24,00:13:27,"that can move at a force of 3.3 pounds,"
00:13:27,00:13:30,because that is the amount of poundage that you need
00:13:30,00:13:34,in order to activate the pad to make it clock the timing.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"Fortunately, they've worked out."
00:13:36,00:13:39,"Sorry, Dan, just to say, the way that swimming works"
00:13:39,00:13:43,is you're kind of pushing the water backwards
00:13:43,00:13:44,in so that you go forwards.
00:13:44,00:13:47,"And if you push the water forwards and make a wave,"
00:13:47,00:13:49,you're actually going to be sending yourself backwards.
00:13:49,00:13:49,"Well, that's fine."
00:13:49,00:13:52,Because then you just stay at the back of the pool
00:13:52,00:13:53,and you just concentrate all the afternoon
00:13:53,00:13:58,blasting away a wall of water at that pad and then relax.
00:13:58,00:14:02,Or the final 10 meters turn around and swim the other way.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"Yeah, that's good."
00:14:05,00:14:06,"Yeah, that's OK."
00:14:06,00:14:08,That's enough of a try next time.
00:14:08,00:14:09,Add a beauty.
00:14:09,00:14:11,But it's pretty amazing how quickly these things are locked.
00:14:11,00:14:13,"Yeah, the speed is extraordinary."
00:14:13,00:14:14,"And I think it's completely pointless,"
00:14:14,00:14:17,"because when you're coming down to those five margins, who cares?"
00:14:17,00:14:18,"You've, it's a draw."
00:14:18,00:14:21,"Just, I just think if human eyes can't see it,"
00:14:21,00:14:22,just call it a tie.
00:14:22,00:14:23,I agree.
00:14:23,00:14:27,"If the King of Greece can't tell clearly who's ahead,"
00:14:27,00:14:28,it's a tie.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"You know, South America was thought not to have played"
00:14:31,00:14:35,a part in the first Olympics until very recently
00:14:35,00:14:36,when we found evidence that they did.
00:14:36,00:14:39,Chile always claimed they'd sent one athlete.
00:14:39,00:14:41,It was very chilly in that water.
00:14:41,00:14:43,"Go on, carry on."
00:14:43,00:14:45,"You're joke signifier now, Andy."
00:14:45,00:14:48,That noise just so we thought it's happened.
00:14:48,00:14:50,"Yeah, anything I say without that"
00:14:50,00:14:52,is actually meant to be taken deadly seriously.
00:14:52,00:14:53,That's really good to know.
00:14:53,00:14:57,There was a Chilean guy called Luis Subercasso.
00:14:57,00:14:59,And he didn't get any medals.
00:14:59,00:15:01,So there's no written evidence of him being there
00:15:01,00:15:02,because they didn't keep very good records.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"It was only if you got a medal, really."
00:15:04,00:15:06,"And then I think in about 2014,"
00:15:06,00:15:10,apparently the forensic Chilean police force
00:15:10,00:15:13,"examined, who are like facial recognisers,"
00:15:13,00:15:16,examined a couple of photos from the 100 meter sprint.
00:15:16,00:15:19,And they confirmed using their facial recognition skills
00:15:19,00:15:21,that that was in fact him.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Now it was the Chilean police.
00:15:22,00:15:24,What a load of nonsense.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"Hey, just if you're a super recommender,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"you can just say, oh yeah, that's the guy."
00:15:27,00:15:29,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's him, definitely."
00:15:29,00:15:31,"It's so ripe for abuse, this system."
00:15:31,00:15:34,"Secondly, slow crime day in Chile, wasn't it?"
00:15:34,00:15:36,"It caught everybody, have you?"
00:15:36,00:15:38,You caught every shoplifter or whatever.
00:15:38,00:15:41,You've cleared your backlog back to 1896.
00:15:48,00:15:52,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:15:52,00:15:57,My fact is that Japan is currently planning a 300 mile conveyor belt.
00:15:57,00:16:01,This is just for people who've done a huge supermarket show.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"That's right, yeah, yeah."
00:16:02,00:16:05,How far into planning is it?
00:16:05,00:16:06,"Oh, it's early stages."
00:16:06,00:16:07,It's very early stages.
00:16:07,00:16:10,"Oh, is it just someone, is it like a Boris Johnson saying,"
00:16:10,00:16:11,"oh, let's do this?"
00:16:11,00:16:15,I don't think anyone in Japan is as unreliable as Boris Johnson.
00:16:15,00:16:17,So I think it's already a better plan than all of his.
00:16:17,00:16:22,"But I think it's a very ambitious plan, definitely,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,because I think the longest conveyor belt at the moment
00:16:24,00:16:26,in the world is quite a lot shorter than this.
00:16:26,00:16:33,But the idea is that it would be effectively a road linking Tokyo and Osaka.
00:16:33,00:16:39,And the conveyor belts would be either along the hard shoulder of roads
00:16:39,00:16:41,between these two places or in tunnels under the road.
00:16:41,00:16:43,And it would be in big pallets.
00:16:43,00:16:44,"And it's really sensible, actually."
00:16:44,00:16:47,It's not just a sort of kind of wacky plan.
00:16:47,00:16:49,It's because--
00:16:49,00:16:51,Another difference with the Boris Johnson approach.
00:16:51,00:16:56,It's because there's forecast to be a really big shortfall of drivers.
00:16:56,00:16:57,Like lorry drivers.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"Lorry drivers, haulage and all of that."
00:16:59,00:17:02,"In some remote areas, it's going to be a really acute problem"
00:17:02,00:17:06,because lots of bits of Japan have fallen populations
00:17:06,00:17:09,"and it's important to be able to keep supplies going, obviously,"
00:17:09,00:17:10,to all bits of the country.
00:17:10,00:17:14,"So the idea is if you free up drivers between Tokyo and Osaka,"
00:17:14,00:17:16,they're free to service lots of other bits of the country.
00:17:16,00:17:20,"And also, it's a generally good idea to free up roads of freight"
00:17:20,00:17:23,because you've released pollution on the surface.
00:17:23,00:17:27,"You reduce congestion, free up the roads for non-commercial travel,"
00:17:27,00:17:28,all sorts of things.
00:17:28,00:17:30,So it is currently in the early state.
00:17:30,00:17:31,"It's basically at the moment, it's a line."
00:17:31,00:17:33,It's a long line on a bit of paper.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Right.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"Is it a conveyor belt that goes back around,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"as in if you miss collecting your freight at the end,"
00:17:38,00:17:40,does it head back to Tokyo?
00:17:40,00:17:41,It's like an airport one.
00:17:41,00:17:42,"Yeah, exactly."
00:17:42,00:17:43,"You have to wait at the end,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,looking out for your Amazon back-end.
00:17:46,00:17:51,Do we know how fast it's going to go?
00:17:51,00:17:53,"Incredibly fast, 400 miles an hour."
00:17:53,00:17:54,"No, come on."
00:17:54,00:17:55,"No, I don't know."
00:17:55,00:17:56,I don't know.
00:17:56,00:17:59,"Because there is a limit of how fast a conveyor belt can go,"
00:17:59,00:17:59,really.
00:17:59,00:18:03,"Practically, there is, because if you put something on a conveyor belt"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"that's going more than, let's say, 20 miles an hour,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,the stuff's just going to fly off.
00:18:07,00:18:07,Yeah.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Yeah.
00:18:08,00:18:09,That's--
00:18:09,00:18:11,"I was thinking, I was wondering if it was going to go fast enough"
00:18:11,00:18:13,to be worth getting on it yourself
00:18:13,00:18:14,if you needed to get from Tokyo to Osaka.
00:18:14,00:18:15,Yes.
00:18:15,00:18:17,"And probably would be, wouldn't it?"
00:18:17,00:18:18,That would be incredibly cool.
00:18:18,00:18:18,I guess so.
00:18:18,00:18:21,"The fastest conveyor belt, actually, I should say,"
00:18:21,00:18:24,is-- can you guess how fast it goes?
00:18:24,00:18:24,Miles an hour.
00:18:24,00:18:25,Ooh.
00:18:25,00:18:26,Is it for people?
00:18:26,00:18:29,"No, it's for redish lignite rocks."
00:18:29,00:18:31,Ooh.
00:18:31,00:18:32,"OK, that changes my calculation."
00:18:32,00:18:35,"OK, I think about 20 miles an hour."
00:18:35,00:18:35,It's miles.
00:18:35,00:18:36,OK.
00:18:36,00:18:36,It's miles.
00:18:36,00:18:36,50.
00:18:36,00:18:37,Any other plans?
00:18:37,00:18:37,50.
00:18:37,00:18:38,50?
00:18:38,00:18:38,Yeah.
00:18:38,00:18:39,50 miles an hour.
00:18:39,00:18:40,50.
00:18:40,00:18:41,"Well, it's going to be a lot, isn't it?"
00:18:41,00:18:42,"Otherwise, it wouldn't have asked."
00:18:42,00:18:44,"Dan, is it somewhere in between?"
00:18:44,00:18:46,Or are you going to go massively high or massively low?
00:18:46,00:18:47,400.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"No, so I think it's got to be lower."
00:18:50,00:18:51,I think lower than Andy's.
00:18:51,00:18:53,I would say 15.
00:18:53,00:18:55,It's 33 miles per hour.
00:18:55,00:18:55,Wow.
00:18:55,00:18:56,15 minutes per second.
00:18:56,00:18:57,Wow.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And yeah, again, the reason that it can't go faster,"
00:19:00,00:19:02,"presumably you could in theory make it go faster,"
00:19:02,00:19:05,"but if you put the rocks on, they're just going to fly off."
00:19:05,00:19:05,Yeah.
00:19:05,00:19:08,How are you going to collect your sushi off that belt
00:19:08,00:19:10,when you're sitting down for a meal?
00:19:10,00:19:10,Yeah.
00:19:10,00:19:11,That sushi's breaking your teeth.
00:19:11,00:19:15,I think the longest one so far is about 100 kilometers.
00:19:15,00:19:18,"It's about 60 miles, and it's in the Western Sahara."
00:19:18,00:19:20,"Well, controversial, Andy."
00:19:20,00:19:21,"Oh, great."
00:19:21,00:19:25,"Can I just say, I always thought that was the longest conveyor belt."
00:19:25,00:19:28,"As a UI researcher, you just kind of know these things."
00:19:28,00:19:28,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:19:28,00:19:30,"That's in your induction pack, isn't it?"
00:19:30,00:19:32,"But that's, okay, I'll just say what that one is."
00:19:32,00:19:35,"So that's phosphate rock in Western Sahara,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"and it's a 2,000 tons an hour of phosphate rock"
00:19:37,00:19:39,"has moved along, and it's been mined,"
00:19:39,00:19:40,and now it's going to be refined.
00:19:40,00:19:45,"So it is really, really long, but it is made of lots of units,"
00:19:45,00:19:49,"and each unit is only 11.7 kilometers long,"
00:19:49,00:19:51,and then they attach together a bit like Legos.
00:19:51,00:19:55,But the longest just one conveyor belt
00:19:55,00:20:00,"is between India and Bangladesh, and that goes 35 kilometers."
00:20:00,00:20:02,And it was the only man-made structure
00:20:02,00:20:05,built after partition that links Bangladesh and India.
00:20:05,00:20:06,Wow.
00:20:06,00:20:09,"The economists tried to follow it,"
00:20:09,00:20:11,"and what they do is they followed this conveyor belt,"
00:20:11,00:20:12,"followed it, followed it, followed it,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,"and they got to within like a few hundred meters of the border,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,"and the soldiers went, nope."
00:20:17,00:20:19,So actually no human can go that way.
00:20:19,00:20:21,You'd have to put yourself in a box
00:20:21,00:20:22,if you ever wanted to make that journey.
00:20:22,00:20:23,"Yeah, or a cake."
00:20:23,00:20:25,Big cake.
00:20:25,00:20:26,I do. It's not used for that.
00:20:26,00:20:29,I think that's going to stand out amongst whatever
00:20:29,00:20:31,they're transporting from the market.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"So it's like, lignite rock, lignite knock,"
00:20:33,00:20:36,"lignite rock, giant birthday cake."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"Lignite rock, lignite rock."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"Wait, hang on. Go back to."
00:20:39,00:20:41,"I don't know you to say, oh, someone down the other end"
00:20:41,00:20:43,of the line is going to have a good birthday.
00:20:43,00:20:43,That's nice.
00:20:43,00:20:46,"Well, you had to do an emergency stop on it,"
00:20:46,00:20:47,and Andy just flung out of the cake.
00:20:47,00:20:50,Fully naked.
00:20:50,00:20:55,"So Andy, is yours a continuous conveyor belt then,"
00:20:55,00:20:57,or should we alter your fact to planning
00:20:57,00:20:59,a three-mile-long conveyor belt?
00:20:59,00:21:01,I don't think the Japanese system will be one belt.
00:21:01,00:21:05,"So it'll be a system, mind you."
00:21:05,00:21:06,I think as long as it doesn't have to dismount
00:21:06,00:21:09,"and then be remounted by a human, I would allow it."
00:21:09,00:21:10,"OK, nice idea."
00:21:10,00:21:13,There's a pitch for one in Britain.
00:21:13,00:21:14,"There's the film called Magway,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,who wants to do the same kind of thing.
00:21:16,00:21:17,"It will be around London,"
00:21:17,00:21:20,and it's on magnetic surfboards.
00:21:20,00:21:24,So I think this would be floating parcels
00:21:24,00:21:25,to live in around London.
00:21:25,00:21:26,Don't put water on it.
00:21:26,00:21:29,"That's a Magway, Magway joke."
00:21:29,00:21:30,"Oh, that's good."
00:21:30,00:21:33,And it can't carry anything after midnight.
00:21:33,00:21:36,Isn't that Cinderella thing?
00:21:36,00:21:38,"Yeah, it's also a governance thing."
00:21:38,00:21:39,"OK, cool."
00:21:39,00:21:43,The swimming at the Athens Olympics
00:21:43,00:21:44,"had to happen after midnight,"
00:21:44,00:21:46,because previously all the coaches
00:21:46,00:21:47,were floating in the water.
00:21:47,00:21:52,That was laboured.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"James, I'm a part of my joke noise for that."
00:21:54,00:21:55,What was that again?
00:21:55,00:22:02,"So I was learning a bit about conveyor belt terminology,"
00:22:02,00:22:04,"because I'm sure, as we all have,"
00:22:04,00:22:05,we've all spent a long time today
00:22:05,00:22:08,on websites that sell conveyor belts.
00:22:08,00:22:09,And do you know what the most important bit
00:22:09,00:22:10,of a conveyor belt is called?
00:22:10,00:22:12,The rubber?
00:22:12,00:22:12,The belt?
00:22:12,00:22:13,Rubber bit.
00:22:13,00:22:15,"It's not the rubber bit,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,"it's the bit under the rubber,"
00:22:16,00:22:19,"which is made of interwoven fabric,"
00:22:19,00:22:20,which is responsible for the tension
00:22:20,00:22:21,"and the weight carrying,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,and it's called the carcass.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"Oh, lovely."
00:22:24,00:22:25,"Oh, that's good."
00:22:25,00:22:26,"Those conveyor belt websites,"
00:22:26,00:22:27,"they all do nick from each other, don't they?"
00:22:27,00:22:29,The history of the conveyor belt.
00:22:29,00:22:31,It's been really copied and pasted
00:22:31,00:22:32,quite a few times.
00:22:32,00:22:33,It has.
00:22:33,00:22:36,"But I think I can tell you the original source,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,and it is the most important history
00:22:38,00:22:40,of conveyor belts ever written.
00:22:40,00:22:44,It's called Belt Conveyors and Belt Elevators.
00:22:44,00:22:45,"It's by a guy called Fred Hetzel,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,written in 1922.
00:22:47,00:22:50,And a lot of these copy things seem to come from him.
00:22:50,00:22:53,So I think 1795 is often cited
00:22:53,00:22:55,as the first modern conveyor belt
00:22:55,00:22:57,"by a guy called Oliver Evans,"
00:22:57,00:22:58,who did it for his flour mills
00:22:58,00:22:59,to transport flour around.
00:23:00,00:23:04,And Evans also invented the first ever car
00:23:04,00:23:05,"in America,"
00:23:05,00:23:07,but by accident.
00:23:07,00:23:08,"How, okay."
00:23:08,00:23:10,It's always by accident.
00:23:10,00:23:11,"All inventions are always,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,"oh, he was carrying the ingredients of a car"
00:23:13,00:23:15,"and then he tripped over and they fell,"
00:23:15,00:23:19,assembled themselves on the conveyor belt.
00:23:19,00:23:21,"Yeah, and it just drove him the rest of the way."
00:23:21,00:23:22,Just absolute nonsense.
00:23:22,00:23:22,Wow.
00:23:22,00:23:24,"Well, it's, um,"
00:23:24,00:23:26,this one I've just used by accident quite loosely.
00:23:26,00:23:28,"It was called the Orook Tor Amphibulos,"
00:23:28,00:23:31,and it was also the first amphibious vehicle in the world.
00:23:31,00:23:34,It was a huge steam powered machine
00:23:34,00:23:36,that is supposed to dredge stuff from the bottom of water.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"He built it in his warehouse,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,but then he had to transport it
00:23:40,00:23:41,to the river in Philadelphia
00:23:41,00:23:43,in order to show it off and do the dredging.
00:23:43,00:23:45,"So to transport it,"
00:23:45,00:23:46,he attached four wheels
00:23:46,00:23:47,and he rigged up the wheels
00:23:47,00:23:49,to the steam mechanism for the dredging
00:23:49,00:23:51,and he drove it through Philadelphia.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"And there, there, by accident,"
00:23:53,00:23:55,"he's made the first car, hasn't he?"
00:23:55,00:23:56,"Very, it's quite cool."
00:23:56,00:23:56,Very cool.
00:23:56,00:23:57,That's quite cool.
00:23:57,00:23:59,"Is it Thomas Robbins Jr.,"
00:23:59,00:24:00,who is largely credited
00:24:00,00:24:03,with the sort of the modern conveyor belt
00:24:03,00:24:05,that we use these days.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"He, he supplied his conveyor belts"
00:24:07,00:24:08,to people like Thomas Edison
00:24:08,00:24:10,to use in his factories and so on.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"And, um, he also was the first,"
00:24:12,00:24:15,"I believe, to use vulcanized rubber."
00:24:15,00:24:17,And there's quite a nice link
00:24:17,00:24:19,"because Thomas Robbins Jr.,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,"his granddaughter, Louisa Robbins,"
00:24:21,00:24:22,"married Austin Goodyear,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,which must have been a powerhouse couple.
00:24:24,00:24:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:25,00:24:27,It's like a royal family of vulcanized rubber
00:24:27,00:24:28,and conveyor belting.
00:24:28,00:24:29,Wow.
00:24:29,00:24:32,Have you heard of the Trottois Roulant Rapide?
00:24:32,00:24:35,This was at the Montparnasse Bienvenue Station.
00:24:35,00:24:36,It was a high-speed walkway.
00:24:36,00:24:38,You know those ones you get at airports?
00:24:38,00:24:38,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:38,00:24:39,Yep.
00:24:39,00:24:41,"They go really slowly, don't they?"
00:24:41,00:24:42,I think we could all agree.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"Oh, I love them."
00:24:43,00:24:44,"Sure, we all love them,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,"but they, they could be gingered up a bit."
00:24:46,00:24:47,Are you the kind of person
00:24:47,00:24:49,who just gets on them
00:24:49,00:24:50,and then just stands there
00:24:50,00:24:51,"with all of your luggage,"
00:24:51,00:24:52,just blocking the way
00:24:52,00:24:54,so none of us people can walk on them?
00:24:54,00:24:57,"No, but I had an accidental layover in Abu Dhabi"
00:24:57,00:24:58,and I thought there was going to be
00:24:58,00:24:59,full of stuff for the kids.
00:24:59,00:25:00,There was nothing.
00:25:00,00:25:02,It all had shut since COVID
00:25:02,00:25:04,"and we spent, no joke, four hours"
00:25:04,00:25:05,running on the travel lasers
00:25:05,00:25:07,back and forth to tire out the kids.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"Well, Dan, you would have loved"
00:25:08,00:25:10,the Trottois Roulant Rapide
00:25:10,00:25:12,at Montparnasse Bienvenue
00:25:12,00:25:13,because it was fast.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"It went at seven and a half miles an hour,"
00:25:16,00:25:19,"which is, that's jogging speed, I'd say."
00:25:19,00:25:21,"Basically, it was so dangerous."
00:25:21,00:25:23,It had to have bounces at the beginning
00:25:23,00:25:25,"saying, no, you are not ready"
00:25:25,00:25:27,for the Trottois Roulant Rapide.
00:25:27,00:25:28,It's too much for you to go away.
00:25:28,00:25:30,There was an acceleration zone at the beginning
00:25:30,00:25:32,and then a deceleration zone at the end
00:25:32,00:25:33,"and it did nine years in service,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,but there were so many accidents.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"Hang on a second, I have a question."
00:25:37,00:25:39,If you're on a travel laser
00:25:39,00:25:41,"that's shared by lots of other people,"
00:25:41,00:25:43,how does it accelerate you at the start
00:25:43,00:25:45,without accelerating everyone else along the way?
00:25:45,00:25:46,Great question.
00:25:46,00:25:47,I think it might have been a belt
00:25:47,00:25:51,that gets you up to a few miles an hour ready
00:25:51,00:25:53,and then the next zone is going a few miles an hour faster
00:25:53,00:25:57,"than that first, so you don't just step on to a thing"
00:25:57,00:25:59,going at jogging speed because that would be a bit mad.
00:25:59,00:26:00,"I think we've said that in the past,"
00:26:00,00:26:03,that this was an idea that was put about in America
00:26:03,00:26:05,"when they first invented conveyor belts,"
00:26:05,00:26:10,"which is the walkways where you would step on one,"
00:26:10,00:26:11,"which was two miles an hour,"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"and then step on to one that was four miles an hour,"
00:26:13,00:26:14,"then one that's eight miles an hour,"
00:26:14,00:26:15,"and before you know it,"
00:26:15,00:26:17,you go in at 60 miles an hour in a walkway.
00:26:17,00:26:18,"Yeah, here's the thing."
00:26:18,00:26:20,"Your one, Andy, with the acceleration speed"
00:26:20,00:26:22,"is assuming that you're just standing still,"
00:26:22,00:26:24,and that is the seven mile an hour speed
00:26:24,00:26:25,"that you're going at,"
00:26:25,00:26:26,"but as we experienced in Abu Dhabi,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"when you run on these things,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,"the speed that you get when you're running,"
00:26:30,00:26:31,so I wonder what speed you could get
00:26:31,00:26:34,on a seven mile an hour travelator.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"Wow, it would be your normal speed plus seven."
00:26:36,00:26:38,Plus seven miles an hour.
00:26:38,00:26:41,"So what's my normal speed, I guess, is the big question."
00:26:41,00:26:43,"Yeah, I mean, the sky's the limit,"
00:26:43,00:26:44,depending on how good you are at running.
00:26:44,00:26:47,I don't think the sky is the limit.
00:26:47,00:26:50,"Well, I don't think you can run infinitely fast"
00:26:50,00:26:51,just as long as you keep trying.
00:26:51,00:26:55,"How do conveyor belts really change the world,"
00:26:55,00:26:55,would you say?
00:26:55,00:26:59,"No, no, before that."
00:26:59,00:27:03,"Like industry, big industrial plants, really,"
00:27:03,00:27:04,"they're crucial in all of those, aren't they?"
00:27:04,00:27:06,"Assembly lines, basically, isn't it?"
00:27:06,00:27:07,Yeah.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"You know, it's like, the idea was,"
00:27:09,00:27:11,"let's say you're making a car, your Ford,"
00:27:11,00:27:14,what would happen is you'd have your carcass of a car
00:27:14,00:27:16,"just sort of hanging up,"
00:27:16,00:27:18,"and then if you're the guy who does the left wheel,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,"you'd have to go over to the car and attach the left wheel,"
00:27:20,00:27:22,and then the guy who puts the windscreen wipers on
00:27:22,00:27:24,would have to walk over and do that.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"But if you have the conveyor belt,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,then the carcass can move along
00:27:28,00:27:30,"and everyone could just stand there and do their thing,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,"and by the time it gets to the end of the conveyor belt,"
00:27:32,00:27:33,it's done.
00:27:33,00:27:36,"So Ford was the first place to really do that,"
00:27:36,00:27:37,and that was why they became so massive.
00:27:37,00:27:41,"And originally, the conveyor belt was pulled by a rope,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"so you would have a person on the end,"
00:27:44,00:27:46,and they would be pulling the car along
00:27:46,00:27:47,while everyone was doing their thing.
00:27:47,00:27:50,And the really interesting thing is that
00:27:50,00:27:53,the idea came to them from a slaughterhouse.
00:27:53,00:27:57,So one of the guys who was working at Ford
00:27:57,00:27:59,"visited a slaughterhouse in Chicago,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,"and they had a thing called a disassembly line,"
00:28:02,00:28:04,where someone would get an actual carcass
00:28:04,00:28:06,"and pull it along on a rope,"
00:28:06,00:28:09,"and then the first person would take out the heart,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,and then the next person would pull off the legs.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Really?
00:28:12,00:28:17,"And they would take all the bits of the carcass off to be used,"
00:28:17,00:28:18,and this was their system.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"And then Ford thought,"
00:28:19,00:28:22,"""Well, what if instead of taking bits off the carcass,"
00:28:22,00:28:23,"we put bits onto the carcass?"""
00:28:23,00:28:24,And that's why it's called a car.
00:28:24,00:28:26,Is that?
00:28:26,00:28:27,We're all dancing around it.
00:28:27,00:28:33,Conveyor belts are responsible for naming
00:28:33,00:28:36,one of the big American products out there.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"Literally, the conveyor belt suggested the name."
00:28:38,00:28:39,Really?
00:28:39,00:28:42,"Yeah, and that is Hershey's Kisses chocolate."
00:28:42,00:28:45,"And it was when they were manufacturing it,"
00:28:45,00:28:49,the sound that the motion of the machine made
00:28:49,00:28:51,"when it plopped the chocolate onto the conveyor belt,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,it sounded like a little kiss.
00:28:53,00:28:56,"And so they thought, ""Oh, these are kisses that are coming out."""
00:28:56,00:28:58,And so they became Hershey's Kisses.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"So yeah, it was literally suggestedly named."
00:29:01,00:29:02,It's better than Hershey's plops.
00:29:02,00:29:08,"But also it's like the little tube comes down, doesn't it?"
00:29:08,00:29:10,And it goes very close to the conveyor belt
00:29:10,00:29:12,and then drops it off and pulls up again.
00:29:12,00:29:14,So it's like it's kissing the conveyor belt.
00:29:14,00:29:16,Which is not like plopping.
00:29:16,00:29:17,No.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Sounds like it's still...
00:29:18,00:29:20,They must have had a wet conveyor belt.
00:29:20,00:29:20,Oh.
00:29:20,00:29:22,Not for about this.
00:29:22,00:29:24,I'd never heard a conveyor belt make a kissing sound.
00:29:24,00:29:26,Hershey's Gentle Wet Plops.
00:29:26,00:29:29,We've all had American chocolate.
00:29:29,00:29:36,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:29:36,00:29:38,And that is my fact.
00:29:38,00:29:43,"My fact is that graffiti in toilets is called ""Latranalia"""
00:29:43,00:29:45,thanks to a professor in 1966
00:29:45,00:29:49,who thought shithouse poetry wasn't technically correct.
00:29:49,00:29:52,Because of animal poetry.
00:29:52,00:29:53,It did seem to be...
00:29:53,00:29:55,I did like this fact because it did seem to be
00:29:55,00:29:58,"that his objection was just that it wasn't technically correct, right?"
00:29:58,00:29:59,Yeah.
00:29:59,00:30:00,"Yeah, that's all it was."
00:30:00,00:30:03,He was an American folklorist called Alan Dundes.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"And it was a fine term,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,but he just thought it's not all poetry.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"You know, so he wrote, by the way, this paper"
00:30:09,00:30:11,"which is called ""Here I Sit""."
00:30:11,00:30:15,"And it's a history of scatological graffiti,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,anything that we found from the ancient world
00:30:16,00:30:18,all the way through to current day.
00:30:18,00:30:20,And he gave us this word as a result.
00:30:20,00:30:22,Which we use now on a daily basis.
00:30:22,00:30:23,"Yeah, it's very common."
00:30:23,00:30:24,The contribution he's made.
00:30:24,00:30:25,Every day word.
00:30:25,00:30:28,"Dundes had, in his paper,"
00:30:28,00:30:32,he had the theory that the reason that people write stuff on toilet walls
00:30:32,00:30:36,is because they have a desire to smear things with their excrement.
00:30:36,00:30:37,Oh.
00:30:37,00:30:41,And apparently this is the socially accepted form of that impulse.
00:30:41,00:30:42,Right.
00:30:42,00:30:45,Whereas my newly invented turd crayon
00:30:45,00:30:49,actually allows you to indulge both impulses at the same time.
00:30:49,00:30:49,"Yeah, yeah."
00:30:49,00:30:52,"I thought this was from the paper ""Theses on Theses""."
00:30:52,00:30:53,Am I wrong?
00:30:53,00:30:54,Maybe he republished.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Right.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"I mean, James, as in my book, for instance,"
00:30:58,00:31:01,"was released in hardback under the name ""Everything to Play For"""
00:31:01,00:31:03,and in paperback under a load of old balls.
00:31:03,00:31:03,Wow.
00:31:03,00:31:04,Jesus.
00:31:04,00:31:06,Do you have a podcast as well?
00:31:06,00:31:07,What's going on?
00:31:07,00:31:09,"Actually, no, you mentioned it."
00:31:09,00:31:10,Oh.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"I just, it just felt like a really relevant example."
00:31:12,00:31:13,Yeah.
00:31:13,00:31:14,"That was really relevant, Anna."
00:31:14,00:31:15,That's good work.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"Guys, you're being weirdos."
00:31:16,00:31:19,"And look, I don't mind, we can all be, we can be weirdos, but…"
00:31:19,00:31:25,"Oh, I'm so sweet of you to publicize Dan's thing."
00:31:25,00:31:26,Yeah.
00:31:26,00:31:27,What a good mate.
00:31:27,00:31:29,"So Duns, or Dundies,"
00:31:29,00:31:31,I actually don't know how you pronounce his name.
00:31:31,00:31:33,I'm going to say Dundies just to contradict you guys.
00:31:33,00:31:34,"Yeah, go for it."
00:31:34,00:31:35,He was a pretty interesting guy.
00:31:35,00:31:37,"He was known as the jokes professor,"
00:31:37,00:31:40,"because he made his lectures witty and funny,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,he included lots of riddles in them.
00:31:42,00:31:44,"And he wrote some seriously controversial stuff,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,like a thing about how the German national character
00:31:47,00:31:50,"is inextricably bound up with anal erotic fixation,"
00:31:50,00:31:53,which made him contentious.
00:31:53,00:31:54,"In Germany, I imagine."
00:31:54,00:31:55,Yeah.
00:31:55,00:31:57,"I think largely in Germany, yeah, some of them objected."
00:31:57,00:31:58,Some of them loved it.
00:31:58,00:32:03,"Fortunately, he only wrote it on the back of a toilet cubicle."
00:32:04,00:32:05,In his own feces.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"Yeah, so, yeah, had a limited impact."
00:32:07,00:32:09,"But he had this weird moment when he,"
00:32:09,00:32:12,"just before he retired, which was the year 2000,"
00:32:12,00:32:15,"he got a letter which his wife opened and read,"
00:32:15,00:32:16,which I don't know what the dynamic is there.
00:32:16,00:32:18,"But she said,"
00:32:18,00:32:21,"""Gosh, you've got this letter from a former student"
00:32:21,00:32:23,who says that what I learned in your anthropology classes
00:32:23,00:32:25,"influenced me every day of my life,"
00:32:25,00:32:27,"so I'm enclosing this check for you."""
00:32:27,00:32:30,"And she said, ""And it's a thousand dollars, darling."""
00:32:30,00:32:33,"And so he said, ""Wow, that's, gosh, how lovely."""
00:32:33,00:32:36,"And then she said, ""Hang on, I don't know how she miscounted."
00:32:36,00:32:37,"Maybe it was an idiot."""
00:32:37,00:32:39,"But she said, ""Oh, actually, there are more zeros"
00:32:39,00:32:42,"than I thought. It's actually a million dollars."""
00:32:42,00:32:47,And a former student just left him a million dollars.
00:32:47,00:32:50,"If you've been enjoying this podcast for the last 10 years,"
00:32:50,00:32:52,feel free.
00:32:52,00:32:55,Which of us is willing to give out a home address
00:32:55,00:32:57,to receive that million dollars?
00:32:57,00:32:59,"I will, but you have to read my letter to me"
00:32:59,00:33:01,because I just swamped.
00:33:01,00:33:04,That's very funny. Wow.
00:33:04,00:33:07,One of the things is I think there's been too much academic study
00:33:07,00:33:10,written about latronalia and we need to pare it down
00:33:10,00:33:12,because every Tom DeGeneres written a paper
00:33:12,00:33:13,"who doesn't know what else to do thinks,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,"""How interesting, and I can really easily access this."
00:33:15,00:33:17,"I'll just go to my uni toilets."""
00:33:17,00:33:19,And it's always about the gender difference
00:33:19,00:33:22,because obviously mostly you get men's and women's toilets.
00:33:22,00:33:26,But it does seem true that sex is definitely
00:33:26,00:33:27,the most common topic by far.
00:33:27,00:33:29,There was a study in Nigeria
00:33:29,00:33:33,which found that 46% of men's and 37% of women's graffiti
00:33:33,00:33:34,was about sex.
00:33:34,00:33:38,"And women have more insults, but also more supportive."
00:33:38,00:33:40,"Yeah, there was a study that was done in 2016"
00:33:40,00:33:43,by a guy called Scott Kelly who works in advertising
00:33:43,00:33:45,and he just got curious about it.
00:33:45,00:33:47,"And he had people going into toilets all over London,"
00:33:47,00:33:48,I think 100 toilets.
00:33:48,00:33:50,And he asked both men and women to report back
00:33:50,00:33:51,on what they found.
00:33:51,00:33:55,So some of the results showed that women were more likely
00:33:55,00:33:57,to express feelings of love support
00:33:58,00:34:00,and men were more likely to draw penises.
00:34:00,00:34:03,That was the large opening thing that they found.
00:34:03,00:34:06,The penises that were found on the walls of women's bathrooms
00:34:06,00:34:09,had longer penises than the one on the men's walls.
00:34:09,00:34:11,Not sure what that means.
00:34:11,00:34:12,"Was that because all the men were saying,"
00:34:12,00:34:15,"""This is how big your penises you dickhead,"""
00:34:15,00:34:17,and then taking the piss out of someone?
00:34:17,00:34:19,I think it's because the men were tracing around
00:34:19,00:34:22,their own penises when they were drawing the pictures
00:34:22,00:34:24,"on the wall, whereas women had to do it from memory."
00:34:24,00:34:27,"Yeah, it's how men show support mutually, I think,"
00:34:27,00:34:29,is insults and scatological.
00:34:29,00:34:31,There's a lot of correcting.
00:34:31,00:34:32,You see someone correct it.
00:34:32,00:34:36,"Someone else is writing or repost, yeah."
00:34:36,00:34:39,"Yeah, I saw an article about Lancaster University."
00:34:39,00:34:41,So this was Dialogues in Solitude.
00:34:41,00:34:45,"And they talked about someone who'd written ""Filed FC"""
00:34:45,00:34:48,"and then someone else had written ""R shit"""
00:34:48,00:34:51,"and then someone else had written ""Hot"" underneath."
00:34:51,00:34:53,And they went into all sorts.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"They were like, ""Here is an assertion made by A"
00:34:56,00:34:58,with the Ilocution Signalling Identification
00:34:58,00:35:00,with the College Football Team.
00:35:00,00:35:03,"B contributes a negative evaluation of the group in question,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,denigrating the identity of the other
00:35:05,00:35:08,and consequently ameliorating in group identity.
00:35:08,00:35:10,"There is then support for A by C,"
00:35:10,00:35:14,"shifting this negative evaluation by the addition of ""Hot"""
00:35:14,00:35:17,"which changes shit into an intensifier in shit-hot."""
00:35:17,00:35:21,If anything proves my complaint about academics
00:35:21,00:35:23,"wasting their time and hours, it is that."
00:35:23,00:35:25,"It is remarkable, isn't it?"
00:35:25,00:35:26,"I mean, literally."
00:35:26,00:35:27,Just get a light.
00:35:27,00:35:28,"If that's been done with public money,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,I'm a little bit vexed about that.
00:35:30,00:35:36,The entry for dictionary in the 1911 encyclopedia Britannica
00:35:36,00:35:39,was written by a guy called Alan Walker Reed.
00:35:39,00:35:42,And he was also very big in Latranalia.
00:35:42,00:35:46,He wrote a book where he went around the Western United States
00:35:46,00:35:49,"picking up graffiti from toilet walls,"
00:35:49,00:35:51,but he had to publish it privately in Paris
00:35:51,00:35:52,because no publisher would take it
00:35:52,00:35:54,because it was so filthy.
00:35:55,00:35:56,"Oh, wow."
00:35:56,00:35:58,Trust the Parisians.
00:35:58,00:35:58,Isn't that amazing?
00:35:58,00:36:03,"And even then, they only made 75 copies"
00:36:03,00:36:05,and there was a disclaimer on the front page
00:36:05,00:36:08,saying this should be restricted to students of linguistics.
00:36:08,00:36:11,"Wow, so funny."
00:36:11,00:36:13,"Wow, Paris was the place."
00:36:13,00:36:15,Because wasn't it Paris that printed Ulysses as well?
00:36:15,00:36:16,"Ulysses, yeah, yeah."
00:36:16,00:36:19,It was the place to go if you had something filthy
00:36:19,00:36:19,that you wanted to print.
00:36:19,00:36:20,Maybe Lady Chattely's Lover.
00:36:20,00:36:23,Did that have to be printed in France and then shipped over?
00:36:23,00:36:23,Maybe.
00:36:23,00:36:24,I think so.
00:36:24,00:36:25,I think you might be right.
00:36:25,00:36:25,"I remember, wow."
00:36:25,00:36:30,"Paris actually, I think, had the first public urinals in public."
00:36:30,00:36:30,Is it well?
00:36:30,00:36:33,"You know, like the ones we have that raise up the street now,"
00:36:33,00:36:34,you can do in London.
00:36:34,00:36:36,"I think, so I was reading about them"
00:36:36,00:36:36,"because obviously, you know,"
00:36:36,00:36:38,this is about public toilets generally.
00:36:38,00:36:41,And there was an early 19th century
00:36:41,00:36:43,prefect of the city called Rambuto.
00:36:43,00:36:43,A prefect?
00:36:43,00:36:46,"Sorry, like at private schools?"
00:36:46,00:36:49,"Yeah, he wasn't head boy, but it was still my term."
00:36:49,00:36:52,Just go around telling other Parisians
00:36:52,00:36:54,to do up the cravats immediately.
00:36:54,00:36:57,"Exactly, so Rambuto, the prefect,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,ordered the construction of these things
00:36:59,00:37:01,because people were weighing on the streets too much.
00:37:01,00:37:03,And it's just so interesting that immediately
00:37:03,00:37:06,it gives privacy to people to transgress
00:37:06,00:37:09,and being gay was not legal then.
00:37:09,00:37:11,And so that sort of gave an opportunity
00:37:11,00:37:12,to be gay in private.
00:37:12,00:37:16,"And by 1862, police were recording the locations"
00:37:16,00:37:18,of all the glory holes in the public toilets
00:37:18,00:37:19,that had been made.
00:37:19,00:37:21,They were keeping a record.
00:37:21,00:37:22,"So that was like, again, I didn't know"
00:37:22,00:37:24,glory holes went back that far.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"But I remember probably said it on here,"
00:37:26,00:37:29,but the oldest glory hole in Australia
00:37:29,00:37:30,is in Perth Museum.
00:37:30,00:37:31,Really?
00:37:31,00:37:32,"And it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:32,00:37:33,As in brought in?
00:37:33,00:37:34,"Wait, yeah, that's where it was."
00:37:34,00:37:35,Was it just...
00:37:35,00:37:40,"No, it was found in a public toilet"
00:37:40,00:37:41,and they brought it and put it into the collection.
00:37:41,00:37:42,"Oh, wow."
00:37:42,00:37:43,Just the hole?
00:37:43,00:37:45,"As in, like, what's the..."
00:37:45,00:37:49,Anything is potentially an ex-glory hole.
00:37:49,00:37:50,I'm holding it.
00:37:50,00:37:52,I'm holding a glory hole here.
00:37:52,00:37:53,Can you see it?
00:37:53,00:37:56,The Roman stuff we haven't talked about.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Is there actual evidence of it?
00:37:57,00:37:59,I know there are sort of quotes about it.
00:37:59,00:38:00,So...
00:38:00,00:38:00,Yeah.
00:38:00,00:38:02,"Why, as in graffiti in ancient Rome?"
00:38:02,00:38:05,Do we have actual walls that were written on?
00:38:05,00:38:07,"I think in Pompeii they do, don't they?"
00:38:07,00:38:08,"Yeah, Pompeii they do."
00:38:08,00:38:09,"Oh, yes."
00:38:09,00:38:10,"And that weirdly, that got me onto it."
00:38:10,00:38:12,Have we talked ever about the Latin thesaurus
00:38:12,00:38:14,that has people have been writing since 1894?
00:38:14,00:38:16,This is amazing.
00:38:16,00:38:19,"Okay, this is some people in Munich."
00:38:20,00:38:22,"They're making a dictionary of Latin, right?"
00:38:22,00:38:24,From 500 BC to 200 AD.
00:38:24,00:38:28,"And what their aim is, is every single word ever written"
00:38:28,00:38:30,in Latin ends up in this dictionary.
00:38:30,00:38:31,So this is how I found it.
00:38:31,00:38:34,"Researcher Marika Ottink said,"
00:38:34,00:38:38,"""If a word is just on a toilet in Pompeii in graffiti,"
00:38:38,00:38:39,"you'll find it with us."""
00:38:39,00:38:41,So literally every word.
00:38:41,00:38:44,They started doing this in 1894.
00:38:44,00:38:45,The German government set it up.
00:38:45,00:38:48,"They might be done by 2050 if they hurry,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,but they think it's probably actually a bit too ambitious.
00:38:50,00:38:53,How are they being so slow?
00:38:53,00:38:55,"I mean, all dictionaries are supposed to have every word in them."
00:38:55,00:38:57,I think it's every single word has an entry
00:38:57,00:38:59,and a branching tree of how it relates to
00:38:59,00:39:02,all the other words it's related to.
00:39:02,00:39:03,I see.
00:39:03,00:39:05,"The most recent work they published was P, that of P,"
00:39:05,00:39:08,but they did skip N because it had a lot of words in it.
00:39:08,00:39:13,"They have to go back at some point and do N, it's so annoying."
00:39:13,00:39:15,"They have a lot of like,"
00:39:15,00:39:18,are they called hapex legomonons or something
00:39:18,00:39:20,"where they have one example of the word,"
00:39:20,00:39:21,"they just don't know what it means, right?"
00:39:21,00:39:25,"If you've only got one example of a word being used,"
00:39:25,00:39:28,"unless that is in a dictionary, say this word means this,"
00:39:28,00:39:31,it's really hard to ascertain exactly what it means.
00:39:31,00:39:35,"If all uses of the word milkshake are lost in future,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,"in 500 years, apart from in the song,"
00:39:37,00:39:38,"""My milkshake brings all the boats to the yard,"""
00:39:38,00:39:40,there'll be feverish scholar debate
00:39:40,00:39:42,about what a milkshake was.
00:39:42,00:39:42,What is it?
00:39:42,00:39:43,Exactly.
00:39:43,00:39:44,You can infer things.
00:39:44,00:39:46,So if you've only got a word that's on a toilet wall
00:39:46,00:39:51,"that says X person's name is an absolute questionable word,"
00:39:51,00:39:52,"you know, you can infer, can't you?"
00:39:52,00:39:53,It might be legend.
00:39:53,00:39:54,"Yeah, it might be asshole."
00:39:54,00:39:59,"I suppose that's a good point, yeah."
00:39:59,00:40:01,I didn't consider legend as a possibility.
00:40:01,00:40:09,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:40:09,00:40:11,and that is James.
00:40:11,00:40:15,"Okay, my fact this week is that Pizza Hut in Hong Kong"
00:40:15,00:40:19,"sells a pizza topped with ham, mushroom, and snake."
00:40:19,00:40:21,Almost.
00:40:21,00:40:22,Disgusting.
00:40:22,00:40:26,"I think that's like pepperoni, though."
00:40:26,00:40:28,If you slice the snake finely enough.
00:40:28,00:40:30,"Oh, sorry."
00:40:30,00:40:32,"I was thinking the mushroom part was disgusting,"
00:40:32,00:40:35,but now I see actually that the snake is the unusual bit.
00:40:35,00:40:40,"Yes, so this is Pizza Hut in Hong Kong."
00:40:40,00:40:45,"They have done a team up with a restaurant called Sir Wong Fun,"
00:40:45,00:40:49,which is arguably the oldest restaurant in operation in Hong Kong.
00:40:49,00:40:53,"And this restaurant has lots of specialties,"
00:40:53,00:40:54,which includes snake meat.
00:40:54,00:40:57,"And so the Hong Kong Pizza Hut decided,"
00:40:57,00:40:59,"well, why don't we put some on our pizzas?"
00:40:59,00:41:00,And I don't know how popular it is.
00:41:00,00:41:02,I wouldn't eat it.
00:41:02,00:41:03,Do you know what kind of snake?
00:41:03,00:41:04,"Oh, what a good question."
00:41:04,00:41:06,I do not actually.
00:41:06,00:41:07,"It's like Scampi, isn't it?"
00:41:09,00:41:11,There's lots of stuff in there.
00:41:11,00:41:11,You can eat.
00:41:11,00:41:14,There's lots of different species of snake that are eaten.
00:41:14,00:41:15,So I actually don't know.
00:41:15,00:41:19,"For instance, we even at Viper in England."
00:41:19,00:41:19,Really?
00:41:19,00:41:21,At various times in our history.
00:41:21,00:41:24,We have a few cookbooks with Viper recipes in them.
00:41:24,00:41:25,Wow.
00:41:25,00:41:26,I actually wonder why we don't.
00:41:26,00:41:27,There must be something.
00:41:27,00:41:28,It must not be that tasty.
00:41:28,00:41:29,"Otherwise, why aren't we eating snake?"
00:41:29,00:41:31,I don't think it's very tasty.
00:41:31,00:41:36,"Ken Elm Digby, father of Everard Digby,"
00:41:36,00:41:37,"friend of the podcast,"
00:41:37,00:41:40,come up with a recipe of a Viper wine at some point.
00:41:40,00:41:43,I think he did with Cockail as well in the same book.
00:41:43,00:41:45,Interesting.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"Apparently, just on the taste of snake,"
00:41:47,00:41:49,"according to the Oxford Companion, it's a food."
00:41:49,00:41:54,"They say generally, the obvious resemblance between eels and snakes"
00:41:54,00:41:56,make recipes for one suited to the other.
00:41:56,00:41:57,But snakes are leaner.
00:41:57,00:42:00,"They taste a bit ealy, apparently."
00:42:00,00:42:04,Do you know when the best time to eat this pizza is?
00:42:04,00:42:07,"And I don't mean in terms of like, you know, 7pm,"
00:42:07,00:42:08,I mean seasonal.
00:42:08,00:42:09,Ooh.
00:42:09,00:42:10,"Oh, snake season."
00:42:10,00:42:12,When the snakes are big.
00:42:12,00:42:12,Yeah.
00:42:12,00:42:15,So it's when the autumn wind begins to blow.
00:42:15,00:42:19,And the reason is because they've fattened up the snakes
00:42:19,00:42:22,at this point in preparation for hibernation.
00:42:22,00:42:27,So you're getting your snakiest topping when you order it then.
00:42:27,00:42:33,"Pizza Hut are very good at this kind of regional specializing,"
00:42:33,00:42:34,aren't they?
00:42:34,00:42:34,Are they?
00:42:34,00:42:37,"Well, I found a few other examples from around the place."
00:42:37,00:42:39,These are a bit less visceral.
00:42:39,00:42:43,"I mean, Pizza Hut Middle East did a cheeseburger crown crust pizza"
00:42:43,00:42:46,which has a ring of miniature cheeseburgers around the edge of the crust.
00:42:46,00:42:47,Sounds great.
00:42:47,00:42:48,Fine.
00:42:48,00:42:48,"Well, all right."
00:42:48,00:42:50,"How do you think about this one, James?"
00:42:50,00:42:54,"Pizza Hut Malaysia, which offered a kind of squirting crust."
00:42:54,00:42:55,Okay.
00:42:55,00:42:57,Isn't that a stuffed crust that you've squeezed?
00:42:57,00:42:59,What's it squirting?
00:42:59,00:43:00,Garlic sauce and cheese.
00:43:00,00:43:01,Isn't that just a stuffed crust?
00:43:01,00:43:05,"For some reason, it's more impressive than a stuffed crust."
00:43:05,00:43:07,"It's more of a blast zone, apparently."
00:43:07,00:43:08,"Oh, okay."
00:43:08,00:43:09,Okay.
00:43:09,00:43:10,All right.
00:43:10,00:43:12,"I had a little bit of a look at the stuffed crust,"
00:43:12,00:43:14,and it's a fascinating tale.
00:43:14,00:43:15,So any of you guys see this?
00:43:15,00:43:16,"No, no."
00:43:16,00:43:19,The inventor of the stuffed crust has actually had a
00:43:19,00:43:22,full-on documentary released about him called Stolen Dough.
00:43:22,00:43:23,Brilliant.
00:43:23,00:43:25,And he's called Anthony Mongello.
00:43:25,00:43:29,"He invented it in the 1980s, and Pizza Hut stole it."
00:43:29,00:43:33,"He once accidentally made a pizza badly, made the crust too big,"
00:43:33,00:43:36,saw there's this big hole in my crust.
00:43:36,00:43:37,Let's stuff it with cheese.
00:43:37,00:43:40,"And he mentioned this to his dad, who actually had invented"
00:43:40,00:43:41,a machine for molding mozzarella.
00:43:41,00:43:42,So there are big cheese--
00:43:42,00:43:43,How convenient.
00:43:43,00:43:45,Inventory cheese.
00:43:45,00:43:47,He accidentally invented stuffed crust after his father
00:43:47,00:43:49,invented an incredibly complicated industrial component
00:43:49,00:43:50,to mold mozzarella.
00:43:50,00:43:51,What are the odds?
00:43:51,00:43:53,I'm so annoyed.
00:43:53,00:43:55,I'm so annoyed every time.
00:43:55,00:43:55,Yeah.
00:43:55,00:43:56,It's a collab.
00:43:56,00:43:57,That's a collab.
00:43:57,00:44:00,I'm sure he invented it thanks to a combination of circumstances
00:44:00,00:44:02,"which are not like, oh, are you trolling my pizza?"
00:44:02,00:44:03,What can I fill it with?
00:44:03,00:44:04,"Well, I don't have a snake to hand."
00:44:04,00:44:08,"I'm a little more organic than that, isn't it?"
00:44:08,00:44:11,You've grown up in a family where cheese is a big thing.
00:44:11,00:44:14,"You're often talking about it, especially squishy cheese."
00:44:14,00:44:14,Completely.
00:44:14,00:44:18,I'm just saying circumstances are a bigger factor than accident.
00:44:18,00:44:19,Yeah.
00:44:19,00:44:21,No one's claimed an accident.
00:44:21,00:44:23,I haven't claimed that he invented it by accident.
00:44:23,00:44:26,He very much invented the stuffed crust intentionally.
00:44:26,00:44:27,"OK, OK, good."
00:44:27,00:44:29,With money in mind.
00:44:29,00:44:31,"Well, like he mentioned in the car, which just somehow"
00:44:31,00:44:32,magically happened.
00:44:32,00:44:35,The crucial thing is he's got a patent.
00:44:35,00:44:36,Then he called up pizza places.
00:44:36,00:44:37,"He called up Pizza Hut and said, look,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,do you want this stuffed crust thing I've invented?
00:44:39,00:44:41,"Pizza Hut said, no."
00:44:41,00:44:45,"Eight years later, what shows up on Pizza Hut's menu?"
00:44:45,00:44:45,It's the stuffed crust.
00:44:45,00:44:48,And what's the big claim?
00:44:48,00:44:50,They were probably just making a pizza
00:44:50,00:44:52,and noticed that there was a hole in their pizza tripped over.
00:44:52,00:44:54,So mozzarella landed in there.
00:44:54,00:44:58,They didn't even attempt to claim that.
00:44:58,00:45:02,"They basically offered him 50 grand and was like, well, you know."
00:45:02,00:45:03,"And he was like, get stuffed."
00:45:03,00:45:07,"That's what it should have been called, this documentary."
00:45:07,00:45:08,The stolen dough is very good as well.
00:45:08,00:45:11,I think get stuff would be the Pizza Hut response
00:45:11,00:45:13,documentary in the documentary rat battle.
00:45:13,00:45:16,But he decided to reject their offer
00:45:16,00:45:18,and sued them for $1 billion.
00:45:18,00:45:19,$1 billion.
00:45:19,00:45:20,It's always a great number to sue.
00:45:20,00:45:21,Yeah.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"It is really cool, isn't it?"
00:45:22,00:45:25,"It's very Dr. Evil, but it's destined to failure, which it did."
00:45:25,00:45:28,"Oh, did you get anything?"
00:45:28,00:45:28,He got nothing.
00:45:28,00:45:31,"Just take what you're offered, guys."
00:45:31,00:45:32,That's the solution of this.
00:45:32,00:45:37,"Just very quickly, do you know how they cook pizzas at Pizza Hut?"
00:45:37,00:45:38,Did they put them in a pizza oven?
00:45:38,00:45:39,In a pizza oven.
00:45:39,00:45:40,They use a conveyor belt.
00:45:40,00:45:41,No.
00:45:41,00:45:42,They do.
00:45:42,00:45:42,Really?
00:45:42,00:45:43,Yeah.
00:45:43,00:45:46,It goes on a little conveyor belt and heads into the oven.
00:45:46,00:45:48,And it comes out the other side cooked.
00:45:48,00:45:51,Like those things that make toast in hotels.
00:45:51,00:45:51,Yeah.
00:45:51,00:45:52,Yeah.
00:45:52,00:45:54,Like that.
00:45:54,00:45:54,That's very good.
00:45:54,00:45:57,"It's silly because you can't adjust the toastedness, can you?"
00:45:57,00:45:58,You should be able to adjust the speed.
00:45:58,00:45:59,"Well, you can adjust the toastedness."
00:45:59,00:46:00,There are dials.
00:46:00,00:46:01,What?
00:46:01,00:46:04,"And also, I mean, the problem is they often only toast one side of the bread."
00:46:04,00:46:07,So you get toast that's charred on one side and bread on the other.
00:46:07,00:46:10,You guys are going to terrible hotels.
00:46:10,00:46:10,Yes.
00:46:10,00:46:13,"Gens, we'll go on tour together."
00:46:13,00:46:18,It's annoying when you go off to the local Hilton with your fancy toasting machines.
00:46:18,00:46:23,"In 2012, they launched a promotion, Pizza Hut, where if you were in the American"
00:46:23,00:46:28,presidential debates and you asked the candidates whether they preferred sausage or pepperoni
00:46:28,00:46:30,"on their pizza, you would win free pizza for life."
00:46:30,00:46:31,OK.
00:46:31,00:46:32,Did anyone do it?
00:46:32,00:46:33,"No, because there was an outcry."
00:46:33,00:46:36,I think it was degrading democracy.
00:46:36,00:46:36,Little did they know.
00:46:36,00:46:41,And they moved it online and just instead randomly selected someone to win free pizza
00:46:41,00:46:45,"for life, which I think was also a swiz because what is free pizza for life?"
00:46:45,00:46:51,"They always, what they do is they work out the average number of pizzas that someone eats in a"
00:46:51,00:46:56,year. And like that's always down because they include people who just don't eat pizza.
00:46:56,00:47:00,"And then they say, OK, well, the average person eats one and a half pizzas a year."
00:47:00,00:47:03,"If we include everyone who lives in Mauritania, who's never heard of pizza."
00:47:03,00:47:07,"And so, yeah, they give you a voucher for like 12 pizzas."
00:47:07,00:47:12,"Yeah, it wasn't that quite, it was a free pizza a week, but only for 30 years."
00:47:12,00:47:14,"I think after 30 years, you are probably done."
00:47:14,00:47:19,"I think if you're eating that many pizzas, that probably is your life expectancy."
00:47:19,00:47:23,I would like the right to have 9000 pizzas now.
00:47:23,00:47:24,Do you know what I mean?
00:47:24,00:47:29,It should be any number of pizzas you want for eternity.
00:47:29,00:47:30,I agree.
00:47:30,00:47:33,Do you know which country eats the most pizza?
00:47:33,00:47:33,It's so surprising.
00:47:33,00:47:34,Italy.
00:47:34,00:47:35,Italy.
00:47:35,00:47:35,Lovely.
00:47:35,00:47:40,"I'll accept James's answer as less wrong, but still wrong."
00:47:40,00:47:41,What would it be?
00:47:41,00:47:45,"I think it must be, do you mean per capita or?"
00:47:45,00:47:45,"Per capita, yes."
00:47:48,00:47:51,"I think, and it's quite hard to explain why, and no one has adequately done it."
00:47:51,00:47:55,"So my theory is that this place perhaps doesn't have access to that much good,"
00:47:55,00:47:58,"fresh food, because of its geographical location."
00:47:58,00:48:00,"You're quite far away, it's Norway."
00:48:00,00:48:01,Easter Island.
00:48:01,00:48:02,"Oh, okay, sorry, I'll take it back."
00:48:02,00:48:08,"Norway eats by far the most pizza, so 11.4 kilos per person."
00:48:08,00:48:10,"Next is Canada, 8.9."
00:48:10,00:48:12,So that's so much.
00:48:12,00:48:15,"Most of it is frozen pizza that you buy from the supermarket,"
00:48:15,00:48:19,"and half of those are this brand called Grandiosa,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,and they really want a Norwegian to write in.
00:48:21,00:48:27,"When we went to Norway, maybe I'm conflating two places here,"
00:48:27,00:48:30,but I feel like there was quite a lot of these 7-Eleven places
00:48:30,00:48:32,where you could just buy slices of pizza all the time.
00:48:32,00:48:34,"Oh, that's good."
00:48:34,00:48:35,I think that might be part of it.
00:48:35,00:48:38,"Buying a slice is good, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:38,00:48:39,That makes sense.
00:48:39,00:48:40,Is it good pizza there?
00:48:40,00:48:41,"No, I think it's not."
00:48:41,00:48:44,"I think they like it to the extent that when a,"
00:48:44,00:48:46,"the company that makes Grandiosa,"
00:48:46,00:48:47,"which is called Staborette,"
00:48:47,00:48:49,when they produced a pizza-themed song
00:48:49,00:48:52,"called Respect for Grandiosa in 2006,"
00:48:52,00:48:55,it was at the top of the country's music charts for eight weeks.
00:48:55,00:48:56,Oh my God.
00:48:56,00:48:59,But I also think it's not particularly good pizza.
00:48:59,00:49:01,"Yeah, but it doesn't prove it really."
00:49:01,00:49:04,"It doesn't prove the taste thing, does it?"
00:49:04,00:49:04,No.
00:49:04,00:49:09,Should we mention true pizza from Naples?
00:49:09,00:49:09,Yeah.
00:49:09,00:49:13,"Because it's, it's very serious in Naples."
00:49:13,00:49:18,"So there is the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana,"
00:49:18,00:49:20,and this was set up in 1984
00:49:20,00:49:23,by the 17 most eminent pizza clans in Naples.
00:49:23,00:49:28,So rough on the 18th most eminent.
00:49:28,00:49:32,"I know, I know, and there's a guide to Neapolitan Pizza,"
00:49:32,00:49:33,what it needs to be to become accredited.
00:49:33,00:49:36,"So if you, even if you're anywhere around the world,"
00:49:36,00:49:37,"you can make a proper Neapolitan Pizza,"
00:49:37,00:49:39,but you have to adhere to this guide.
00:49:39,00:49:41,"It's 27 pages long,"
00:49:41,00:49:46,and it's incredibly strict about the kind of things you need.
00:49:46,00:49:46,What is it?
00:49:46,00:49:50,"Is it like just like literally cheese, tomato, and basil or something?"
00:49:50,00:49:52,"There are, yeah, there are,"
00:49:52,00:49:55,there are lots of rules about the dough and the scorch marks
00:49:55,00:49:57,and that kind of stuff.
00:49:57,00:50:01,"And these dimensions, like maximum dimension is 35 centimetres across,"
00:50:01,00:50:02,all of this stuff.
00:50:02,00:50:05,"Even, they claim that even Roman and Sicilian pizzas"
00:50:05,00:50:07,are just sort of bastardised for catchers.
00:50:07,00:50:09,"I mean, they're probably very proud of it."
00:50:09,00:50:13,"Well, I think like modern pizzas were invented in America really,"
00:50:13,00:50:14,weren't they?
00:50:14,00:50:17,"Because like, basically what happened was,"
00:50:17,00:50:20,"Italian immigrants, or immigrants to America,"
00:50:20,00:50:23,"had this thing called tomato pie,"
00:50:23,00:50:25,"which is basically like a pizza,"
00:50:25,00:50:26,but the cheese would go on the bottom
00:50:26,00:50:28,and the tomato would go on the top.
00:50:28,00:50:28,What?
00:50:28,00:50:33,"And then they kind of over the years, especially in New York,"
00:50:33,00:50:35,they kind of added toppings
00:50:36,00:50:39,and they swapped the cheese and the tomato around
00:50:39,00:50:42,and they created what we would now know as a pizza.
00:50:42,00:50:42,"Oh, sorry."
00:50:42,00:50:45,I thought you meant the cheese went on like the underside
00:50:45,00:50:47,and the tomato went on the top side.
00:50:47,00:50:49,"Like a sandwich, a bread sandwich."
00:50:49,00:50:50,"Yeah, well, how do you hold this?"
00:50:50,00:50:51,That's disgusting.
00:50:51,00:50:53,"And so then what happened was,"
00:50:53,00:50:56,American tourists would go over to Italy
00:50:56,00:50:59,and they'd want pizzas like they knew at home.
00:50:59,00:51:02,And so Italians would start making pizzas
00:51:02,00:51:04,in this American Italian style.
00:51:04,00:51:07,"And so that's why now, even in Italy,"
00:51:07,00:51:10,most of the pizzas will be this kind of modern style of pizza.
00:51:10,00:51:11,That's very interesting.
00:51:11,00:51:12,You know what's so weird?
00:51:12,00:51:13,You mentioned New York.
00:51:13,00:51:16,"It wasn't until September 20th, 1944,"
00:51:16,00:51:20,that pizza got its first proper mention in a newspaper.
00:51:20,00:51:21,"And even more exciting,"
00:51:21,00:51:23,the article uses what they say is
00:51:23,00:51:26,"the rare use of the plural of pizza,"
00:51:26,00:51:28,which is pizza.
00:51:28,00:51:29,Pizza.
00:51:29,00:51:31,"Oh, that's nice."
00:51:31,00:51:33,"Yeah, yeah, we'll do that from now on, pizza."
00:51:33,00:51:37,"I actually, I did find another mention in from 1935"
00:51:37,00:51:40,"from New York about a pizza restaurant,"
00:51:40,00:51:42,describing it excitedly as this new invention.
00:51:42,00:51:44,"Yeah, so I think it might have come up a little bit,"
00:51:44,00:51:47,"but it was like a calzone, I think it was stuffed,"
00:51:47,00:51:49,which I think they often were at this time.
00:51:49,00:51:52,And it said that pizza is best served as a side to roast beef.
00:51:52,00:51:54,How interesting.
00:51:54,00:51:57,Because you know calzone used to mean
00:51:57,00:52:00,sausage wrapped in a tube of dough was a calzone.
00:52:00,00:52:02,Like a toad in the hole.
00:52:02,00:52:03,"Well, like a sausage roll, basically."
00:52:03,00:52:04,"Oh, yeah."
00:52:04,00:52:07,"And then eventually it became a folded over pizza,"
00:52:07,00:52:11,but really a true calzone should be just a sausage roll.
00:52:11,00:52:12,Sausage stuffed crust.
00:52:12,00:52:13,That's interesting.
00:52:13,00:52:17,"The word pizza originally was pizza, like pizza bread."
00:52:17,00:52:21,"And it gets a name from the old word for pitch,"
00:52:21,00:52:25,"you know, like a pine pitch that you might paint onto a ship"
00:52:25,00:52:27,"so that it doesn't, so that it's waterproof."
00:52:27,00:52:31,And is that because you're painting the tomato pitch
00:52:31,00:52:34,"onto the boat, which is the pizza in this instance?"
00:52:34,00:52:38,"No, it's because when you paint pitch onto wood,"
00:52:38,00:52:40,it kind of comes into layers.
00:52:40,00:52:43,And quite a lot of breads and cakes are quite layered.
00:52:43,00:52:45,"And so you have in lots of different languages,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,you have pitch cakes and pitch breads in the Middle East.
00:52:48,00:52:49,It became pizza.
00:52:49,00:52:52,And then that came to Italy and they called it pizza.
00:52:52,00:52:53,That's great.
00:52:53,00:52:56,The 2024 World Dominoes Championship.
