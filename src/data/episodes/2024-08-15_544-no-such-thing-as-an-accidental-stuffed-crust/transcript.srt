00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,320
 Hey, everyone.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,080
 Before we begin this week's episode of Fish,

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,120
 we just want to remind you that the four of us

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,920
 are heading back out on tour as of this September

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,080
 with our massive 10th anniversary show, "Thundernerds."

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,680
 It's going to be so good, guys.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,920
 We're going all over.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,400
 It's an earth sandwich tour.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,040
 We're doing the UK, we're doing Ireland,

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,080
 and then we're going to the New World.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,960
 To Australia and New Zealand, those shows

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,120
 are almost entirely sold out in the New World.

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,920
 But old world dates, there are some tickets left,

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,760
 so we're going to be playing Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, New

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,120
 Castle, Cardiff, London, London again, and Manchester.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,720
 That's right.

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,560
 So if you want to come and experience the dorkery in person,

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,920
 it's a wild night.

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,640
 We record a live podcast.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,120
 We include extras.

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,720
 We've just written and performed our first preview of it.

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,600
 It was smashing, incredibly exciting.

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,400
 You're going to meet characters from the archives of our show.

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
 You're going to find out how we put all the show together.

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,360
 We're going behind the scenes, and it's

27
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,400
 going to be a wild night.

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,040
 So come, be with us in one of these big old rooms,

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,120
 and let's have a massive night out together.

30
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,080
 Just head to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,600
 You'll find the links to every single one of those shows

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
 by ticket, and we'll see you there.

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,800
 Yes, we cannot wait.

34
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
 It's so much fun.

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
 Knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,280
 It's the perfect thing to do or the perfect gift

37
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,520
 to buy someone you love who likes fish

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,120
 and is happy to see them us on stage.

39
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,080
 Cool, on with the show.

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,560
 Bye.

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,680
 Always end strong.

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,120
 OK, on with the show.

43
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:54,320
 Hello, and welcome to another episode

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,800
 of Knowsuchthingasafish, a weekly podcast coming to you

45
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,520
 from four undisplosed locations around the UK.

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,960
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,520
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,320
 Harkin, and Anna Tyshinski.

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,560
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

51
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,800
 and in no particular order, here we go.

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,160
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,880
 My fact this week is that in the swimming races

54
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,120
 at the first modern Olympics, the American competitor

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,960
 drops out because the water was too cold.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,040
 That is amazing.

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,440
 And how things have changed now?

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
 Because they've had to change some of the swimming events

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,240
 because there's feces in the Sen.

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,000
 Oh, yes.

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,160
 Oh, wow.

62
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,120
 Actually, well, similarly, now we

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400
 have a lot of water events happening in the Sen,

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
 which is natural water.

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
 And this was 1896.

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
 And the swimming events happened in the Med.

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,800
 So that was surprisingly chilly.

68
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,520
 Very nice.

69
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,720
 Yes, I think it was partly because the Olympics had gone

70
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,840
 three times over budget, and so they couldn't really

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
 afford to build proper swimming pools or set up those venues.

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,440
 And so they thought--

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
 Or heat the entire Mediterranean.

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,640
 Yeah.

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,520
 All that.

76
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,280
 The Med is, of course, hotter than your big oceans,

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,040
 but this was happening earlier on in the year,

78
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,040
 in March or April, depending on which calendar you were using.

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
 And it was surprisingly cold.

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
 It was surprisingly bad weather.

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,240
 And this competitor was called Gardner Williams.

82
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,920
 And this is all recounted by one of his fellow competitors

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,000
 who was there at the time.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
 So there's some question as to whether this definitely happened.

85
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,760
 But his mate, who was there competing with him, said,

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,920
 this is what happened.

87
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,080
 And as this guy called Tom Curtis tells it,

88
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,000
 this guy had won many races in warm American swimming pools.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,920
 And he was blissfully ignorant that the Mediterranean

90
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,840
 is bitterly cold in April.

91
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
 So a boat took them out.

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,920
 He dived headfirst into the icy water.

93
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
 And in a split second, his head reappeared.

94
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,560
 He shouted, Jesus Christ, I'm freezing.

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,000
 And with that shriek of astonished frenzy,

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,160
 he lashed back to the float.

97
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,440
 But it sounds like it wasn't even just the coldness.

98
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,800
 It sounds like the waves were crazy as hell.

99
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,520
 The winner of the match describes 12-foot waves crashing down

100
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,360
 onto him as he was swimming towards the ending.

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,000
 Your lanes were only shown to you via hollowed out pumpkins

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,960
 that were floating in the ocean.

103
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,320
 It sounded wild.

104
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,240
 I think it genuinely was really cold,

105
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,040
 because the guy who won was called Alfred Hajos, I think.

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,200
 And he wrote of this event that the icy water

107
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
 almost cut into our stomachs.

108
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,880
 We called him Hajos or Hajos or Hayos.

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,680
 Oh, Hajos sounds actually like here.

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
 He was Hungarian, wasn't he?

111
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,880
 He was actually known as the Hungarian dolphin.

112
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,440
 So he could just call him that

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
 and save the pronunciation issue.

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,400
 Brilliant. So the Hungarian dolphin,

115
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,040
 he was also later the manager of the Hungarian football team.

116
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,640
 He learned to swim when he was 13 years old

117
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,880
 after his father had drowned in the Danube

118
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,760
 and he decided that he should learn how to swim.

119
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,800
 And when the Olympics started,

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
 he was at the local university

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,440
 and he really, really struggled to get permission

122
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
 to leave and go to the Olympics.

123
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,560
 And in fact, when he came back with his medals,

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,160
 he said the dean did not congratulate me.

125
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,400
 He said your medals are of no interest to me,

126
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
 but I am eager to hear your replies

127
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,920
 in your next examination.

128
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,920
 Well, of course, like in those days,

129
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,080
 the Olympics wasn't that big a deal.

130
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
 No, it wasn't. It didn't even exist.

131
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,040
 It didn't. It's like the first,

132
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,200
 if I just went off to a made up competition,

133
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,840
 if I told you guys,

134
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,040
 oh, I'm going to be away for three weeks

135
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,480
 because I'm going to the global haiku slam event.

136
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,080
 We would totally believe it.

137
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,720
 Yeah. But if you Google it and there was no evidence of it.

138
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,160
 Yeah, exactly. I don't know.

139
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,040
 I think I sort of understand it.

140
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,320
 Although in fairness, Andy, it was in the newspapers.

141
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,200
 If you look back in the newspaper archives,

142
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,160
 you can see that in America, they were reporting on it.

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,720
 They report on this guy that Anna

144
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,920
 and Richard Lee mentioned, Gardner Williams,

145
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,440
 at the start that he's going.

146
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,480
 And then you don't really see any mention of him

147
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,920
 in the results.

148
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,800
 So that does bear credence to the idea

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,760
 that he jumped in the water.

150
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,520
 It was too cold and he jumped out again.

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,400
 Yeah. Yeah, I saw one amazing article in the Boston Globe.

152
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,040
 This was from the 12th of April, 1896.

153
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,240
 And they said that when Gardner Williams arrived

154
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,760
 on the boat in Athens,

155
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,000
 he came on to land in his trunks and a purple robe.

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
 And announced to the press,

157
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,280
 "Leander swam the hellish pond and I will swim this here."

158
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,360
 Oh, sentences you regret.

159
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,800
 I have a feeling it might have been satire.

160
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,920
 They didn't admit at any stage that this was a satirical piece,

161
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,440
 but I think it might have been.

162
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,320
 Because they mentioned another guy called Hoyt,

163
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,720
 who was a polevolter, and they said that he was practicing

164
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,760
 over a statue of Zeus outside his hotel.

165
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,800
 And that he knocked the guard off his pedestal three times,

166
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,680
 but cleared him at the fourth try.

167
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,480
 Wow. So I can't tell if it's real or not.

168
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,080
 I believe there was so much mad stuff happening

169
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,720
 at these, the first ever games.

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,080
 As in the 1200 meter event, it wasn't like you started,

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,840
 you got in the water and then you swam along the shore for 1200 meters.

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,960
 You were taken 1200 meters away from land,

173
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,680
 and then you were just ditched in the ocean.

174
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,200
 So if you don't finish... It was about surviving.

175
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,240
 Yeah, if you don't finish the race, you die. That's it.

176
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,440
 It was only, because we are saying the water's quite cold,

177
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,480
 it was only, I think, about 12 degrees, which is chilly.

178
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,640
 But just if there are world swimmers out there,

179
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,000
 they'll be like, "Come on, guys, you pussies."

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,560
 I would say in the med, if people are swimming

181
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,680
 at the start of April in the med,

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,800
 you usually look at them and go, "Oh, that's a hardy soul."

183
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

184
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,280
 Can I tell you guys about my favourite competitor

185
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,800
 from the 1896 Olympics?

186
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,880
 Yeah, go for it. Please.

187
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,640
 Have you heard of Italian runner Carlo Iroldi?

188
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,000
 I did not hear of him.

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
 OK. Oh, great. OK.

190
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,280
 So he walked to the games.

191
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,680
 He was from Milan, and they were taking place in Athens.

192
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
 And he was a great long-distance runner, right?

193
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,880
 He'd done... The previous year, he'd done a 600-mile race

194
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,760
 in lots of different stages.

195
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,320
 So really good at long-distance running.

196
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,760
 He hears about this... He hears about this marathon.

197
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,840
 He thinks, "That's a piece of piss.

198
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,480
 It wasn't 26. Easy."

199
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
 So he thinks, "I'll do it."

200
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,240
 But he didn't have money for a train or a ship

201
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
 or whatever from Italy degrees.

202
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,440
 So he thought, "I'll just walk. I'll just walk there."

203
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,720
 And he briefly got a boat at one stage,

204
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,880
 but he did walk or run about 900 kilometres

205
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,120
 from his home to Athens, right?

206
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,840
 So what's the comedy thing that happens at the end?

207
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,320
 If you're writing this as a script.

208
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,160
 He arrives at the start line... Yeah.

209
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,560
 ..and he's forgotten his shoes and has to go back.

210
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,360
 That's good. That's good.

211
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,320
 They've moved the venue back to where he'd originally walked from.

212
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
 Yeah, it's in Milan. Yeah, yeah. It's in Milan, yeah.

213
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,880
 No, what happened was he got there in time for the games,

214
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,200
 amazingly impressive, and then he was asked,

215
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,920
 "Oh, by the way, have you ever competed in one money for athletics?"

216
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,480
 And he said, "Oh, yeah, I did win the Milan to Barcelona race last year,

217
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,440
 which was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of kilometres."

218
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,360
 And they said, "Oh, sorry. Well, you can't run then. Bye."

219
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
 No. Disqualified for being a professional.

220
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
 That's really sad.

221
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,600
 So your favourite competitor at the 1896 Olympics

222
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,640
 was not, in fact, a competitor. That's right, that's right.

223
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,960
 He was a cheat. He was an attempted cheat.

224
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,760
 Can I give you my favourite competitor for the 1896 Olympics?

225
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,240
 This was Sum Napeen, who was a pistol-fireer.

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
 He won the 30-metre free pistol.

227
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,800
 And when he got home, he arrived a little bit early

228
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,920
 and surprised his wife with his medal.

229
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,800
 "Hey, honey, I'm home early."

230
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,280
 And she was in bed with his daughter's Dutch music teacher.

231
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,200
 Oh!

232
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,000
 And so he chased him out of the house, firing his gun,

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,400
 bearing in mind that he's just won a gold medal at the 30-metre free pistol.

234
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,640
 Chases this guy out of the house.

235
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,480
 The guy runs away and the police arrest him and put him in jail.

236
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,480
 And then in the court case later on, he was let off

237
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,920
 because they realised that he was such a good pistol-shooter

238
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,160
 that he obviously hadn't meant to shoot the guy.

239
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,880
 Brilliant.

240
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,560
 If he meant to shoot him, of course he would have hit him.

241
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
 So they said that he's shown restraint and he got free.

242
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,120
 I was... Because when you said he runs out of the house firing his first pistol,

243
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,960
 I'm thinking of him like being Yosemite Sam.

244
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,920
 Do you know what I mean?

245
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
 I think there was some of that.

246
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 Um...

248
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,640
 No, sorry, I was too distracting.

249
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,000
 Sorry, what was that?

250
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,280
 So, listener, what happened there is we are recording this over the internet

251
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,000
 on a particular system.

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,760
 And when Addy did his Yosemite Sam shooting the guns in the air,

253
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,320
 a load of balloons came up.

254
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,560
 How do I make it happen again?

255
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,320
 I just... I was just like...

256
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,880
 You have to not be trying.

257
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,560
 What?

258
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,840
 It knows if you want it.

259
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,520
 Wow.

260
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,200
 What was that?

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,280
 Yeah, that was incredibly distracting.

262
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,960
 That was wild.

263
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,240
 I think if I do a thumbs up, it makes a thumbs up on the screen.

264
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,800
 There we go.

265
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,560
 It does.

266
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
 Let's not do too many...

267
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
 Oh, Addy, no, don't take your pants off.

268
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,040
 Oh, Addy!

269
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,880
 Two other things from the original Olympics that I quite like.

270
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,920
 The Greek team won gold in gymnastics

271
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,960
 and they would not win another gold in gymnastics for a hundred years.

272
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,600
 So it wasn't until the 1996 Olympics that they got their next gold.

273
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
 And the other thing is the hurdles.

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,880
 They used to jump with two feet over it at the same time,

275
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,920
 rather than doing that one leg and then the second leg coming over it.

276
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,880
 Yeah, so according to what I was reading, I haven't seen any footage.

277
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,920
 The Greeks did, I think.

278
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,760
 I think the American hurdler rocked up and saw the Greek doing that

279
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,320
 and thought, "That's absolutely hilarious. You're screwed.

280
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,120
 I'm going to win this."

281
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,840
 Which he did.

282
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,080
 Because the Americans were all into college athletics at that time, weren't they?

283
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,200
 Competing for Harvard or Yale or whatever.

284
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,120
 And they were really seasoned competitors

285
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,760
 compared to some of the other people who literally just rocked up

286
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,520
 and went, "Oh, I might just do this then."

287
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,080
 Yeah, in fact, they were largely from, as you say, Harvard.

288
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,560
 And it was the Boston Athletics Association,

289
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,000
 which was responsible for getting most of them there.

290
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,240
 Which I mentioned because there's a really funny thing

291
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,040
 that was actually mentioned in this article by Tom Curtis,

292
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,720
 who was the hurdler who won gold.

293
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,560
 He said that they had a chant, which it's hard to know how it went,

294
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,120
 but I think it was BAA, rah, rah, rah.

295
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,920
 So Boston Athletics Association.

296
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,160
 And according to him, no one in Europe had ever seen cheering in unison before.

297
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,080
 So everyone was incredibly excited by this.

298
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,800
 And King George, who the king was presiding over it all,

299
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,120
 like he judged if there was a tie, he was there.

300
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,240
 King George was so excited that the Americans did this chant.

301
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,200
 And King George's aid came up to the Americans

302
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,800
 and saluted them solemnly.

303
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,360
 And said, "His Majesty, the king, requests that you, for him,

304
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,160
 will make one more that funny sound."

305
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,840
 As he wrote it.

306
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,360
 And they had to do it again.

307
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,080
 And then he gave them a celebratory breakfast the next day,

308
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,000
 at which, again, he said to the Americans,

309
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,800
 "Would you mind doing that funny chant you did again, please?"

310
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,560
 Wow, so funny.

311
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,800
 Yeah, he was quite involved, wasn't he, the king?

312
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,880
 He decided that no one should measure any of the long jumps.

313
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,480
 Because he thought that, oh, that's just the kind of thing professionals do.

314
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,080
 So we don't want professionals at this.

315
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,240
 It's an amateur athletics thing.

316
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,960
 We'll work out who's the longest just through looking with our eyes,

317
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,160
 but we're not actually going to measure it.

318
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,720
 And so we don't know what the longest distance was

319
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
 and that Olympics, we know who won it.

320
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,600
 We don't know what they jumped.

321
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,800
 Really?

322
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,680
 That's really good.

323
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,120
 I was actually reading up on how we do find if things are too close

324
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,880
 and like a photo finish, what technology is out there now.

325
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,320
 But the swimming, they use a very interesting process in the pools,

326
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,520
 which is they have a pad that the swimmers need to touch.

327
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,440
 And I think I've worked out a hack, push out a wave

328
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,720
 that can move at a force of 3.3 pounds,

329
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,440
 because that is the amount of poundage that you need

330
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,920
 in order to activate the pad to make it clock the timing.

331
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,360
 Fortunately, they've worked out.

332
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,880
 Sorry, Dan, just to say, the way that swimming works

333
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,000
 is you're kind of pushing the water backwards

334
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,760
 in so that you go forwards.

335
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,080
 And if you push the water forwards and make a wave,

336
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,160
 you're actually going to be sending yourself backwards.

337
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,720
 Well, that's fine.

338
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,200
 Because then you just stay at the back of the pool

339
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,880
 and you just concentrate all the afternoon

340
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,600
 blasting away a wall of water at that pad and then relax.

341
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,120
 Or the final 10 meters turn around and swim the other way.

342
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,320
 Yeah, that's good.

343
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
 Yeah, that's OK.

344
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,280
 That's enough of a try next time.

345
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,480
 Add a beauty.

346
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,640
 But it's pretty amazing how quickly these things are locked.

347
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,160
 Yeah, the speed is extraordinary.

348
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,520
 And I think it's completely pointless,

349
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,400
 because when you're coming down to those five margins, who cares?

350
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,520
 You've, it's a draw.

351
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,080
 Just, I just think if human eyes can't see it,

352
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,360
 just call it a tie.

353
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,160
 I agree.

354
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,160
 If the King of Greece can't tell clearly who's ahead,

355
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,120
 it's a tie.

356
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,400
 You know, South America was thought not to have played

357
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,080
 a part in the first Olympics until very recently

358
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,760
 when we found evidence that they did.

359
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,640
 Chile always claimed they'd sent one athlete.

360
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,240
 It was very chilly in that water.

361
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,800
 Go on, carry on.

362
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,720
 You're joke signifier now, Andy.

363
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,520
 That noise just so we thought it's happened.

364
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,200
 Yeah, anything I say without that

365
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,280
 is actually meant to be taken deadly seriously.

366
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,720
 That's really good to know.

367
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,080
 There was a Chilean guy called Luis Subercasso.

368
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,000
 And he didn't get any medals.

369
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,320
 So there's no written evidence of him being there

370
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,520
 because they didn't keep very good records.

371
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,280
 It was only if you got a medal, really.

372
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,680
 And then I think in about 2014,

373
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,280
 apparently the forensic Chilean police force

374
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,000
 examined, who are like facial recognisers,

375
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,840
 examined a couple of photos from the 100 meter sprint.

376
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,720
 And they confirmed using their facial recognition skills

377
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,080
 that that was in fact him.

378
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
 Now it was the Chilean police.

379
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,120
 What a load of nonsense.

380
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,880
 Hey, just if you're a super recommender,

381
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,800
 you can just say, oh yeah, that's the guy.

382
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's him, definitely.

383
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,880
 It's so ripe for abuse, this system.

384
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,280
 Secondly, slow crime day in Chile, wasn't it?

385
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,840
 It caught everybody, have you?

386
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,440
 You caught every shoplifter or whatever.

387
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,720
 You've cleared your backlog back to 1896.

388
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

389
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,000
 My fact is that Japan is currently planning a 300 mile conveyor belt.

390
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,560
 This is just for people who've done a huge supermarket show.

391
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,360
 That's right, yeah, yeah.

392
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,400
 How far into planning is it?

393
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,600
 Oh, it's early stages.

394
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,960
 It's very early stages.

395
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,840
 Oh, is it just someone, is it like a Boris Johnson saying,

396
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
 oh, let's do this?

397
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,160
 I don't think anyone in Japan is as unreliable as Boris Johnson.

398
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,880
 So I think it's already a better plan than all of his.

399
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,040
 But I think it's a very ambitious plan, definitely,

400
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,360
 because I think the longest conveyor belt at the moment

401
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,120
 in the world is quite a lot shorter than this.

402
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:33,640
 But the idea is that it would be effectively a road linking Tokyo and Osaka.

403
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,080
 And the conveyor belts would be either along the hard shoulder of roads

404
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,880
 between these two places or in tunnels under the road.

405
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,560
 And it would be in big pallets.

406
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,920
 And it's really sensible, actually.

407
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,560
 It's not just a sort of kind of wacky plan.

408
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,160
 It's because--

409
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,720
 Another difference with the Boris Johnson approach.

410
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,600
 It's because there's forecast to be a really big shortfall of drivers.

411
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,560
 Like lorry drivers.

412
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,640
 Lorry drivers, haulage and all of that.

413
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,520
 In some remote areas, it's going to be a really acute problem

414
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,040
 because lots of bits of Japan have fallen populations

415
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,320
 and it's important to be able to keep supplies going, obviously,

416
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,440
 to all bits of the country.

417
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,600
 So the idea is if you free up drivers between Tokyo and Osaka,

418
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,840
 they're free to service lots of other bits of the country.

419
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,920
 And also, it's a generally good idea to free up roads of freight

420
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,160
 because you've released pollution on the surface.

421
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,400
 You reduce congestion, free up the roads for non-commercial travel,

422
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,280
 all sorts of things.

423
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,760
 So it is currently in the early state.

424
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,960
 It's basically at the moment, it's a line.

425
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,720
 It's a long line on a bit of paper.

426
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,440
 Right.

427
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,600
 Is it a conveyor belt that goes back around,

428
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,840
 as in if you miss collecting your freight at the end,

429
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,200
 does it head back to Tokyo?

430
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,320
 It's like an airport one.

431
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,600
 Yeah, exactly.

432
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,960
 You have to wait at the end,

433
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,840
 looking out for your Amazon back-end.

434
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,160
 Do we know how fast it's going to go?

435
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,320
 Incredibly fast, 400 miles an hour.

436
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,360
 No, come on.

437
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,720
 No, I don't know.

438
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,440
 I don't know.

439
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,080
 Because there is a limit of how fast a conveyor belt can go,

440
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,480
 really.

441
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,240
 Practically, there is, because if you put something on a conveyor belt

442
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,960
 that's going more than, let's say, 20 miles an hour,

443
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,240
 the stuff's just going to fly off.

444
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,720
 Yeah.

445
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,200
 Yeah.

446
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,720
 That's--

447
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,560
 I was thinking, I was wondering if it was going to go fast enough

448
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,400
 to be worth getting on it yourself

449
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,840
 if you needed to get from Tokyo to Osaka.

450
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,640
 Yes.

451
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,400
 And probably would be, wouldn't it?

452
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,280
 That would be incredibly cool.

453
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,760
 I guess so.

454
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,640
 The fastest conveyor belt, actually, I should say,

455
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,360
 is-- can you guess how fast it goes?

456
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,840
 Miles an hour.

457
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,720
 Ooh.

458
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,600
 Is it for people?

459
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,960
 No, it's for redish lignite rocks.

460
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,320
 Ooh.

461
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,600
 OK, that changes my calculation.

462
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,160
 OK, I think about 20 miles an hour.

463
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,720
 It's miles.

464
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,200
 OK.

465
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,680
 It's miles.

466
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:36,680
 50.

467
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,720
 Any other plans?

468
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:37,800
 50.

469
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,280
 50?

470
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,920
 Yeah.

471
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,880
 50 miles an hour.

472
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,600
 50.

473
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,640
 Well, it's going to be a lot, isn't it?

474
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,760
 Otherwise, it wouldn't have asked.

475
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,040
 Dan, is it somewhere in between?

476
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,760
 Or are you going to go massively high or massively low?

477
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,240
 400.

478
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,840
 No, so I think it's got to be lower.

479
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,880
 I think lower than Andy's.

480
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,240
 I would say 15.

481
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,000
 It's 33 miles per hour.

482
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,480
 Wow.

483
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,440
 15 minutes per second.

484
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,800
 Wow.

485
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,280
 And yeah, again, the reason that it can't go faster,

486
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,600
 presumably you could in theory make it go faster,

487
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,560
 but if you put the rocks on, they're just going to fly off.

488
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:05,960
 Yeah.

489
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,840
 How are you going to collect your sushi off that belt

490
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,280
 when you're sitting down for a meal?

491
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,600
 Yeah.

492
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,720
 That sushi's breaking your teeth.

493
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,480
 I think the longest one so far is about 100 kilometers.

494
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,360
 It's about 60 miles, and it's in the Western Sahara.

495
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,440
 Well, controversial, Andy.

496
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,320
 Oh, great.

497
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,960
 Can I just say, I always thought that was the longest conveyor belt.

498
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,280
 As a UI researcher, you just kind of know these things.

499
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,840
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

500
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,120
 That's in your induction pack, isn't it?

501
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,200
 But that's, okay, I'll just say what that one is.

502
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,160
 So that's phosphate rock in Western Sahara,

503
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,640
 and it's a 2,000 tons an hour of phosphate rock

504
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,240
 has moved along, and it's been mined,

505
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,600
 and now it's going to be refined.

506
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,480
 So it is really, really long, but it is made of lots of units,

507
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,240
 and each unit is only 11.7 kilometers long,

508
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,560
 and then they attach together a bit like Legos.

509
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,560
 But the longest just one conveyor belt

510
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,280
 is between India and Bangladesh, and that goes 35 kilometers.

511
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,760
 And it was the only man-made structure

512
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,800
 built after partition that links Bangladesh and India.

513
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,120
 Wow.

514
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,160
 The economists tried to follow it,

515
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,480
 and what they do is they followed this conveyor belt,

516
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,520
 followed it, followed it, followed it,

517
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,560
 and they got to within like a few hundred meters of the border,

518
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,000
 and the soldiers went, nope.

519
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,640
 So actually no human can go that way.

520
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,320
 You'd have to put yourself in a box

521
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,840
 if you ever wanted to make that journey.

522
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,720
 Yeah, or a cake.

523
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,560
 Big cake.

524
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,920
 I do. It's not used for that.

525
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,720
 I think that's going to stand out amongst whatever

526
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,480
 they're transporting from the market.

527
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,960
 So it's like, lignite rock, lignite knock,

528
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,280
 lignite rock, giant birthday cake.

529
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,040
 Lignite rock, lignite rock.

530
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,160
 Wait, hang on. Go back to.

531
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,960
 I don't know you to say, oh, someone down the other end

532
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,080
 of the line is going to have a good birthday.

533
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,640
 That's nice.

534
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,280
 Well, you had to do an emergency stop on it,

535
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,880
 and Andy just flung out of the cake.

536
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,840
 Fully naked.

537
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,000
 So Andy, is yours a continuous conveyor belt then,

538
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,080
 or should we alter your fact to planning

539
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,480
 a three-mile-long conveyor belt?

540
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,720
 I don't think the Japanese system will be one belt.

541
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,160
 So it'll be a system, mind you.

542
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,680
 I think as long as it doesn't have to dismount

543
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,560
 and then be remounted by a human, I would allow it.

544
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,440
 OK, nice idea.

545
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,080
 There's a pitch for one in Britain.

546
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,600
 There's the film called Magway,

547
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
 who wants to do the same kind of thing.

548
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,480
 It will be around London,

549
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,280
 and it's on magnetic surfboards.

550
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,040
 So I think this would be floating parcels

551
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,320
 to live in around London.

552
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,360
 Don't put water on it.

553
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,400
 That's a Magway, Magway joke.

554
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,760
 Oh, that's good.

555
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,320
 And it can't carry anything after midnight.

556
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,280
 Isn't that Cinderella thing?

557
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,040
 Yeah, it's also a governance thing.

558
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,240
 OK, cool.

559
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,160
 The swimming at the Athens Olympics

560
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,760
 had to happen after midnight,

561
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,360
 because previously all the coaches

562
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,320
 were floating in the water.

563
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,600
 That was laboured.

564
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,920
 James, I'm a part of my joke noise for that.

565
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,640
 What was that again?

566
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,520
 So I was learning a bit about conveyor belt terminology,

567
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,120
 because I'm sure, as we all have,

568
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,960
 we've all spent a long time today

569
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,120
 on websites that sell conveyor belts.

570
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,560
 And do you know what the most important bit

571
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,840
 of a conveyor belt is called?

572
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,200
 The rubber?

573
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,520
 The belt?

574
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,320
 Rubber bit.

575
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,480
 It's not the rubber bit,

576
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,760
 it's the bit under the rubber,

577
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,160
 which is made of interwoven fabric,

578
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,760
 which is responsible for the tension

579
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,480
 and the weight carrying,

580
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,840
 and it's called the carcass.

581
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,200
 Oh, lovely.

582
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,400
 Oh, that's good.

583
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,280
 Those conveyor belt websites,

584
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,800
 they all do nick from each other, don't they?

585
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,240
 The history of the conveyor belt.

586
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,000
 It's been really copied and pasted

587
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,200
 quite a few times.

588
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,240
 It has.

589
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,920
 But I think I can tell you the original source,

590
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,840
 and it is the most important history

591
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,360
 of conveyor belts ever written.

592
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,120
 It's called Belt Conveyors and Belt Elevators.

593
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,800
 It's by a guy called Fred Hetzel,

594
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,320
 written in 1922.

595
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,760
 And a lot of these copy things seem to come from him.

596
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,320
 So I think 1795 is often cited

597
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,240
 as the first modern conveyor belt

598
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,080
 by a guy called Oliver Evans,

599
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,520
 who did it for his flour mills

600
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,880
 to transport flour around.

601
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,360
 And Evans also invented the first ever car

602
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,400
 in America,

603
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
 but by accident.

604
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,760
 How, okay.

605
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,120
 It's always by accident.

606
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,480
 All inventions are always,

607
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 oh, he was carrying the ingredients of a car

608
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,960
 and then he tripped over and they fell,

609
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,240
 assembled themselves on the conveyor belt.

610
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,560
 Yeah, and it just drove him the rest of the way.

611
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,600
 Just absolute nonsense.

612
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:22,920
 Wow.

613
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,040
 Well, it's, um,

614
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
 this one I've just used by accident quite loosely.

615
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,920
 It was called the Orook Tor Amphibulos,

616
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,880
 and it was also the first amphibious vehicle in the world.

617
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,200
 It was a huge steam powered machine

618
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,600
 that is supposed to dredge stuff from the bottom of water.

619
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,680
 He built it in his warehouse,

620
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,120
 but then he had to transport it

621
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,960
 to the river in Philadelphia

622
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
 in order to show it off and do the dredging.

623
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,080
 So to transport it,

624
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,520
 he attached four wheels

625
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,560
 and he rigged up the wheels

626
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,400
 to the steam mechanism for the dredging

627
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,240
 and he drove it through Philadelphia.

628
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,800
 And there, there, by accident,

629
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,320
 he's made the first car, hasn't he?

630
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,200
 Very, it's quite cool.

631
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,600
 Very cool.

632
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,320
 That's quite cool.

633
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,560
 Is it Thomas Robbins Jr.,

634
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,840
 who is largely credited

635
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,960
 with the sort of the modern conveyor belt

636
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,080
 that we use these days.

637
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
 He, he supplied his conveyor belts

638
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,280
 to people like Thomas Edison

639
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
 to use in his factories and so on.

640
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,840
 And, um, he also was the first,

641
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,480
 I believe, to use vulcanized rubber.

642
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,160
 And there's quite a nice link

643
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,080
 because Thomas Robbins Jr.,

644
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,240
 his granddaughter, Louisa Robbins,

645
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,840
 married Austin Goodyear,

646
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,920
 which must have been a powerhouse couple.

647
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,480
 Oh, yeah.

648
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,880
 It's like a royal family of vulcanized rubber

649
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,920
 and conveyor belting.

650
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,560
 Wow.

651
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,840
 Have you heard of the Trottois Roulant Rapide?

652
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,720
 This was at the Montparnasse Bienvenue Station.

653
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
 It was a high-speed walkway.

654
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
 You know those ones you get at airports?

655
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,920
 Oh, yeah.

656
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,160
 Yep.

657
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,000
 They go really slowly, don't they?

658
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,840
 I think we could all agree.

659
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,800
 Oh, I love them.

660
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,760
 Sure, we all love them,

661
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,680
 but they, they could be gingered up a bit.

662
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,880
 Are you the kind of person

663
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,000
 who just gets on them

664
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,520
 and then just stands there

665
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,640
 with all of your luggage,

666
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,600
 just blocking the way

667
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,520
 so none of us people can walk on them?

668
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,400
 No, but I had an accidental layover in Abu Dhabi

669
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,680
 and I thought there was going to be

670
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,880
 full of stuff for the kids.

671
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,520
 There was nothing.

672
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,040
 It all had shut since COVID

673
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,440
 and we spent, no joke, four hours

674
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,880
 running on the travel lasers

675
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,480
 back and forth to tire out the kids.

676
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,840
 Well, Dan, you would have loved

677
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,680
 the Trottois Roulant Rapide

678
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,520
 at Montparnasse Bienvenue

679
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,640
 because it was fast.

680
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,440
 It went at seven and a half miles an hour,

681
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,640
 which is, that's jogging speed, I'd say.

682
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,960
 Basically, it was so dangerous.

683
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,560
 It had to have bounces at the beginning

684
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,720
 saying, no, you are not ready

685
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,080
 for the Trottois Roulant Rapide.

686
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,680
 It's too much for you to go away.

687
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,440
 There was an acceleration zone at the beginning

688
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
 and then a deceleration zone at the end

689
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,880
 and it did nine years in service,

690
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,800
 but there were so many accidents.

691
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 Hang on a second, I have a question.

692
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 If you're on a travel laser

693
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,320
 that's shared by lots of other people,

694
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,160
 how does it accelerate you at the start

695
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,560
 without accelerating everyone else along the way?

696
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,360
 Great question.

697
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,640
 I think it might have been a belt

698
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,480
 that gets you up to a few miles an hour ready

699
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,800
 and then the next zone is going a few miles an hour faster

700
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,160
 than that first, so you don't just step on to a thing

701
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,080
 going at jogging speed because that would be a bit mad.

702
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,600
 I think we've said that in the past,

703
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,640
 that this was an idea that was put about in America

704
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,560
 when they first invented conveyor belts,

705
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,120
 which is the walkways where you would step on one,

706
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,240
 which was two miles an hour,

707
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,000
 and then step on to one that was four miles an hour,

708
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,280
 then one that's eight miles an hour,

709
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,000
 and before you know it,

710
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 you go in at 60 miles an hour in a walkway.

711
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,440
 Yeah, here's the thing.

712
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,600
 Your one, Andy, with the acceleration speed

713
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,680
 is assuming that you're just standing still,

714
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,360
 and that is the seven mile an hour speed

715
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,160
 that you're going at,

716
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,760
 but as we experienced in Abu Dhabi,

717
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,040
 when you run on these things,

718
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,280
 the speed that you get when you're running,

719
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,400
 so I wonder what speed you could get

720
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,200
 on a seven mile an hour travelator.

721
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,760
 Wow, it would be your normal speed plus seven.

722
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,200
 Plus seven miles an hour.

723
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,320
 So what's my normal speed, I guess, is the big question.

724
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,400
 Yeah, I mean, the sky's the limit,

725
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,760
 depending on how good you are at running.

726
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,480
 I don't think the sky is the limit.

727
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,520
 Well, I don't think you can run infinitely fast

728
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,960
 just as long as you keep trying.

729
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,400
 How do conveyor belts really change the world,

730
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,960
 would you say?

731
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,560
 No, no, before that.

732
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,160
 Like industry, big industrial plants, really,

733
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,920
 they're crucial in all of those, aren't they?

734
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,520
 Assembly lines, basically, isn't it?

735
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,160
 Yeah.

736
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
 You know, it's like, the idea was,

737
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
 let's say you're making a car, your Ford,

738
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,920
 what would happen is you'd have your carcass of a car

739
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,200
 just sort of hanging up,

740
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,600
 and then if you're the guy who does the left wheel,

741
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,840
 you'd have to go over to the car and attach the left wheel,

742
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,600
 and then the guy who puts the windscreen wipers on

743
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,040
 would have to walk over and do that.

744
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,200
 But if you have the conveyor belt,

745
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,280
 then the carcass can move along

746
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,760
 and everyone could just stand there and do their thing,

747
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,680
 and by the time it gets to the end of the conveyor belt,

748
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,080
 it's done.

749
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,200
 So Ford was the first place to really do that,

750
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
 and that was why they became so massive.

751
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,640
 And originally, the conveyor belt was pulled by a rope,

752
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,200
 so you would have a person on the end,

753
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,040
 and they would be pulling the car along

754
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,480
 while everyone was doing their thing.

755
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,600
 And the really interesting thing is that

756
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,320
 the idea came to them from a slaughterhouse.

757
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,000
 So one of the guys who was working at Ford

758
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,480
 visited a slaughterhouse in Chicago,

759
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,280
 and they had a thing called a disassembly line,

760
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,920
 where someone would get an actual carcass

761
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
 and pull it along on a rope,

762
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,480
 and then the first person would take out the heart,

763
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
 and then the next person would pull off the legs.

764
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,120
 Really?

765
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,240
 And they would take all the bits of the carcass off to be used,

766
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,680
 and this was their system.

767
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,640
 And then Ford thought,

768
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,200
 "Well, what if instead of taking bits off the carcass,

769
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,640
 we put bits onto the carcass?"

770
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,600
 And that's why it's called a car.

771
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,680
 Is that?

772
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,800
 We're all dancing around it.

773
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,480
 Conveyor belts are responsible for naming

774
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,120
 one of the big American products out there.

775
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,680
 Literally, the conveyor belt suggested the name.

776
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,560
 Really?

777
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,360
 Yeah, and that is Hershey's Kisses chocolate.

778
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,240
 And it was when they were manufacturing it,

779
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,000
 the sound that the motion of the machine made

780
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,800
 when it plopped the chocolate onto the conveyor belt,

781
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,560
 it sounded like a little kiss.

782
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,040
 And so they thought, "Oh, these are kisses that are coming out."

783
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,120
 And so they became Hershey's Kisses.

784
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,080
 So yeah, it was literally suggestedly named.

785
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,440
 It's better than Hershey's plops.

786
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,280
 But also it's like the little tube comes down, doesn't it?

787
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,600
 And it goes very close to the conveyor belt

788
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,360
 and then drops it off and pulls up again.

789
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,120
 So it's like it's kissing the conveyor belt.

790
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,600
 Which is not like plopping.

791
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,400
 No.

792
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,360
 Sounds like it's still...

793
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,040
 They must have had a wet conveyor belt.

794
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,280
 Oh.

795
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,600
 Not for about this.

796
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,440
 I'd never heard a conveyor belt make a kissing sound.

797
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,120
 Hershey's Gentle Wet Plops.

798
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,000
 We've all had American chocolate.

799
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,280
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

800
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,040
 And that is my fact.

801
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,320
 My fact is that graffiti in toilets is called "Latranalia"

802
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,880
 thanks to a professor in 1966

803
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,560
 who thought shithouse poetry wasn't technically correct.

804
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,040
 Because of animal poetry.

805
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,480
 It did seem to be...

806
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,560
 I did like this fact because it did seem to be

807
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,760
 that his objection was just that it wasn't technically correct, right?

808
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,240
 Yeah.

809
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,360
 Yeah, that's all it was.

810
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,560
 He was an American folklorist called Alan Dundes.

811
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,640
 And it was a fine term,

812
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
 but he just thought it's not all poetry.

813
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,960
 You know, so he wrote, by the way, this paper

814
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,160
 which is called "Here I Sit".

815
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,400
 And it's a history of scatological graffiti,

816
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,920
 anything that we found from the ancient world

817
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,600
 all the way through to current day.

818
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,520
 And he gave us this word as a result.

819
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,680
 Which we use now on a daily basis.

820
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,800
 Yeah, it's very common.

821
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,680
 The contribution he's made.

822
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,480
 Every day word.

823
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,280
 Dundes had, in his paper,

824
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,520
 he had the theory that the reason that people write stuff on toilet walls

825
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,120
 is because they have a desire to smear things with their excrement.

826
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,560
 Oh.

827
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,240
 And apparently this is the socially accepted form of that impulse.

828
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,360
 Right.

829
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,160
 Whereas my newly invented turd crayon

830
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,240
 actually allows you to indulge both impulses at the same time.

831
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,960
 Yeah, yeah.

832
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,680
 I thought this was from the paper "Theses on Theses".

833
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,480
 Am I wrong?

834
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,920
 Maybe he republished.

835
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,640
 Right.

836
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,120
 I mean, James, as in my book, for instance,

837
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,000
 was released in hardback under the name "Everything to Play For"

838
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,320
 and in paperback under a load of old balls.

839
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,880
 Wow.

840
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,840
 Jesus.

841
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,520
 Do you have a podcast as well?

842
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,880
 What's going on?

843
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,000
 Actually, no, you mentioned it.

844
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,520
 Oh.

845
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,920
 I just, it just felt like a really relevant example.

846
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,240
 Yeah.

847
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,440
 That was really relevant, Anna.

848
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,320
 That's good work.

849
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,760
 Guys, you're being weirdos.

850
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,880
 And look, I don't mind, we can all be, we can be weirdos, but…

851
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,640
 Oh, I'm so sweet of you to publicize Dan's thing.

852
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,600
 Yeah.

853
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,480
 What a good mate.

854
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,400
 So Duns, or Dundies,

855
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,240
 I actually don't know how you pronounce his name.

856
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,400
 I'm going to say Dundies just to contradict you guys.

857
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,120
 Yeah, go for it.

858
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,640
 He was a pretty interesting guy.

859
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,800
 He was known as the jokes professor,

860
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,120
 because he made his lectures witty and funny,

861
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,040
 he included lots of riddles in them.

862
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,440
 And he wrote some seriously controversial stuff,

863
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,640
 like a thing about how the German national character

864
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,680
 is inextricably bound up with anal erotic fixation,

865
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,160
 which made him contentious.

866
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,440
 In Germany, I imagine.

867
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,080
 Yeah.

868
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,960
 I think largely in Germany, yeah, some of them objected.

869
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,840
 Some of them loved it.

870
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,640
 Fortunately, he only wrote it on the back of a toilet cubicle.

871
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,480
 In his own feces.

872
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,720
 Yeah, so, yeah, had a limited impact.

873
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,960
 But he had this weird moment when he,

874
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,360
 just before he retired, which was the year 2000,

875
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,160
 he got a letter which his wife opened and read,

876
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,760
 which I don't know what the dynamic is there.

877
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,520
 But she said,

878
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,160
 "Gosh, you've got this letter from a former student

879
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,800
 who says that what I learned in your anthropology classes

880
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 influenced me every day of my life,

881
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,560
 so I'm enclosing this check for you."

882
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,520
 And she said, "And it's a thousand dollars, darling."

883
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,880
 And so he said, "Wow, that's, gosh, how lovely."

884
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,360
 And then she said, "Hang on, I don't know how she miscounted.

885
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,160
 Maybe it was an idiot."

886
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,640
 But she said, "Oh, actually, there are more zeros

887
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,600
 than I thought. It's actually a million dollars."

888
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,560
 And a former student just left him a million dollars.

889
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,040
 If you've been enjoying this podcast for the last 10 years,

890
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,840
 feel free.

891
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,400
 Which of us is willing to give out a home address

892
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,800
 to receive that million dollars?

893
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
 I will, but you have to read my letter to me

894
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,560
 because I just swamped.

895
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,120
 That's very funny. Wow.

896
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,000
 One of the things is I think there's been too much academic study

897
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,440
 written about latronalia and we need to pare it down

898
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,840
 because every Tom DeGeneres written a paper

899
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,960
 who doesn't know what else to do thinks,

900
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
 "How interesting, and I can really easily access this.

901
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,800
 I'll just go to my uni toilets."

902
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
 And it's always about the gender difference

903
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,520
 because obviously mostly you get men's and women's toilets.

904
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,120
 But it does seem true that sex is definitely

905
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,480
 the most common topic by far.

906
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,320
 There was a study in Nigeria

907
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,080
 which found that 46% of men's and 37% of women's graffiti

908
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,440
 was about sex.

909
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,680
 And women have more insults, but also more supportive.

910
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,760
 Yeah, there was a study that was done in 2016

911
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,800
 by a guy called Scott Kelly who works in advertising

912
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,000
 and he just got curious about it.

913
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,640
 And he had people going into toilets all over London,

914
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,680
 I think 100 toilets.

915
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,520
 And he asked both men and women to report back

916
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,240
 on what they found.

917
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,240
 So some of the results showed that women were more likely

918
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,320
 to express feelings of love support

919
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,680
 and men were more likely to draw penises.

920
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,720
 That was the large opening thing that they found.

921
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,600
 The penises that were found on the walls of women's bathrooms

922
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,960
 had longer penises than the one on the men's walls.

923
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,400
 Not sure what that means.

924
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,920
 Was that because all the men were saying,

925
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,240
 "This is how big your penises you dickhead,"

926
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,000
 and then taking the piss out of someone?

927
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,400
 I think it's because the men were tracing around

928
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,120
 their own penises when they were drawing the pictures

929
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,680
 on the wall, whereas women had to do it from memory.

930
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,000
 Yeah, it's how men show support mutually, I think,

931
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,960
 is insults and scatological.

932
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,080
 There's a lot of correcting.

933
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,200
 You see someone correct it.

934
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,680
 Someone else is writing or repost, yeah.

935
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,720
 Yeah, I saw an article about Lancaster University.

936
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,480
 So this was Dialogues in Solitude.

937
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,000
 And they talked about someone who'd written "Filed FC"

938
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,120
 and then someone else had written "R shit"

939
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,640
 and then someone else had written "Hot" underneath.

940
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,720
 And they went into all sorts.

941
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,120
 They were like, "Here is an assertion made by A

942
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,680
 with the Ilocution Signalling Identification

943
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,280
 with the College Football Team.

944
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,240
 B contributes a negative evaluation of the group in question,

945
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,240
 denigrating the identity of the other

946
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,440
 and consequently ameliorating in group identity.

947
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,920
 There is then support for A by C,

948
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,120
 shifting this negative evaluation by the addition of "Hot"

949
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,560
 which changes shit into an intensifier in shit-hot."

950
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,320
 If anything proves my complaint about academics

951
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,880
 wasting their time and hours, it is that.

952
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,080
 It is remarkable, isn't it?

953
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,280
 I mean, literally.

954
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,320
 Just get a light.

955
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,920
 If that's been done with public money,

956
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,600
 I'm a little bit vexed about that.

957
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,440
 The entry for dictionary in the 1911 encyclopedia Britannica

958
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,000
 was written by a guy called Alan Walker Reed.

959
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,760
 And he was also very big in Latranalia.

960
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,760
 He wrote a book where he went around the Western United States

961
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,080
 picking up graffiti from toilet walls,

962
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,240
 but he had to publish it privately in Paris

963
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,840
 because no publisher would take it

964
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,600
 because it was so filthy.

965
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,120
 Oh, wow.

966
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,040
 Trust the Parisians.

967
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,760
 Isn't that amazing?

968
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,640
 And even then, they only made 75 copies

969
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,800
 and there was a disclaimer on the front page

970
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,760
 saying this should be restricted to students of linguistics.

971
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,000
 Wow, so funny.

972
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,240
 Wow, Paris was the place.

973
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,720
 Because wasn't it Paris that printed Ulysses as well?

974
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,840
 Ulysses, yeah, yeah.

975
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,000
 It was the place to go if you had something filthy

976
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,320
 that you wanted to print.

977
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,520
 Maybe Lady Chattely's Lover.

978
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,320
 Did that have to be printed in France and then shipped over?

979
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,800
 Maybe.

980
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,520
 I think so.

981
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,240
 I think you might be right.

982
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,960
 I remember, wow.

983
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,360
 Paris actually, I think, had the first public urinals in public.

984
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:30,760
 Is it well?

985
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,240
 You know, like the ones we have that raise up the street now,

986
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,120
 you can do in London.

987
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,120
 I think, so I was reading about them

988
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,840
 because obviously, you know,

989
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,760
 this is about public toilets generally.

990
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,160
 And there was an early 19th century

991
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,000
 prefect of the city called Rambuto.

992
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,800
 A prefect?

993
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,360
 Sorry, like at private schools?

994
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,240
 Yeah, he wasn't head boy, but it was still my term.

995
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,360
 Just go around telling other Parisians

996
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,680
 to do up the cravats immediately.

997
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,400
 Exactly, so Rambuto, the prefect,

998
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,000
 ordered the construction of these things

999
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,240
 because people were weighing on the streets too much.

1000
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,800
 And it's just so interesting that immediately

1001
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,600
 it gives privacy to people to transgress

1002
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,000
 and being gay was not legal then.

1003
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,480
 And so that sort of gave an opportunity

1004
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,920
 to be gay in private.

1005
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,600
 And by 1862, police were recording the locations

1006
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
 of all the glory holes in the public toilets

1007
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,560
 that had been made.

1008
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,320
 They were keeping a record.

1009
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,600
 So that was like, again, I didn't know

1010
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,120
 glory holes went back that far.

1011
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,680
 But I remember probably said it on here,

1012
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,000
 but the oldest glory hole in Australia

1013
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,120
 is in Perth Museum.

1014
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,000
 Really?

1015
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,280
 And it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1016
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,160
 As in brought in?

1017
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,440
 Wait, yeah, that's where it was.

1018
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,000
 Was it just...

1019
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,040
 No, it was found in a public toilet

1020
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,800
 and they brought it and put it into the collection.

1021
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,360
 Oh, wow.

1022
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,080
 Just the hole?

1023
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,000
 As in, like, what's the...

1024
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,960
 Anything is potentially an ex-glory hole.

1025
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,920
 I'm holding it.

1026
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,440
 I'm holding a glory hole here.

1027
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,160
 Can you see it?

1028
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,600
 The Roman stuff we haven't talked about.

1029
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,960
 Is there actual evidence of it?

1030
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,800
 I know there are sort of quotes about it.

1031
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,120
 So...

1032
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,600
 Yeah.

1033
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
 Why, as in graffiti in ancient Rome?

1034
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,400
 Do we have actual walls that were written on?

1035
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,080
 I think in Pompeii they do, don't they?

1036
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,440
 Yeah, Pompeii they do.

1037
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,080
 Oh, yes.

1038
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,520
 And that weirdly, that got me onto it.

1039
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
 Have we talked ever about the Latin thesaurus

1040
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,920
 that has people have been writing since 1894?

1041
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,600
 This is amazing.

1042
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,480
 Okay, this is some people in Munich.

1043
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
 They're making a dictionary of Latin, right?

1044
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,840
 From 500 BC to 200 AD.

1045
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,360
 And what their aim is, is every single word ever written

1046
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,600
 in Latin ends up in this dictionary.

1047
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,880
 So this is how I found it.

1048
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,360
 Researcher Marika Ottink said,

1049
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,040
 "If a word is just on a toilet in Pompeii in graffiti,

1050
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,480
 you'll find it with us."

1051
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,240
 So literally every word.

1052
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,040
 They started doing this in 1894.

1053
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,640
 The German government set it up.

1054
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,280
 They might be done by 2050 if they hurry,

1055
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,360
 but they think it's probably actually a bit too ambitious.

1056
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,240
 How are they being so slow?

1057
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,640
 I mean, all dictionaries are supposed to have every word in them.

1058
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,960
 I think it's every single word has an entry

1059
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,880
 and a branching tree of how it relates to

1060
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,440
 all the other words it's related to.

1061
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,080
 I see.

1062
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,400
 The most recent work they published was P, that of P,

1063
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,520
 but they did skip N because it had a lot of words in it.

1064
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,720
 They have to go back at some point and do N, it's so annoying.

1065
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,080
 They have a lot of like,

1066
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,280
 are they called hapex legomonons or something

1067
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,040
 where they have one example of the word,

1068
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,480
 they just don't know what it means, right?

1069
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,080
 If you've only got one example of a word being used,

1070
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,600
 unless that is in a dictionary, say this word means this,

1071
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,080
 it's really hard to ascertain exactly what it means.

1072
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,400
 If all uses of the word milkshake are lost in future,

1073
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,320
 in 500 years, apart from in the song,

1074
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,680
 "My milkshake brings all the boats to the yard,"

1075
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,920
 there'll be feverish scholar debate

1076
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,200
 about what a milkshake was.

1077
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,680
 What is it?

1078
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,560
 Exactly.

1079
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,760
 You can infer things.

1080
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,920
 So if you've only got a word that's on a toilet wall

1081
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,320
 that says X person's name is an absolute questionable word,

1082
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,920
 you know, you can infer, can't you?

1083
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,800
 It might be legend.

1084
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,920
 Yeah, it might be asshole.

1085
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,000
 I suppose that's a good point, yeah.

1086
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 I didn't consider legend as a possibility.

1087
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,800
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1088
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,960
 and that is James.

1089
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,240
 Okay, my fact this week is that Pizza Hut in Hong Kong

1090
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,320
 sells a pizza topped with ham, mushroom, and snake.

1091
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,720
 Almost.

1092
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,920
 Disgusting.

1093
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,120
 I think that's like pepperoni, though.

1094
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,600
 If you slice the snake finely enough.

1095
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,200
 Oh, sorry.

1096
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,280
 I was thinking the mushroom part was disgusting,

1097
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,880
 but now I see actually that the snake is the unusual bit.

1098
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,280
 Yes, so this is Pizza Hut in Hong Kong.

1099
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,400
 They have done a team up with a restaurant called Sir Wong Fun,

1100
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,560
 which is arguably the oldest restaurant in operation in Hong Kong.

1101
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,000
 And this restaurant has lots of specialties,

1102
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,680
 which includes snake meat.

1103
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,320
 And so the Hong Kong Pizza Hut decided,

1104
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
 well, why don't we put some on our pizzas?

1105
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,760
 And I don't know how popular it is.

1106
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,520
 I wouldn't eat it.

1107
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,800
 Do you know what kind of snake?

1108
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,920
 Oh, what a good question.

1109
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,760
 I do not actually.

1110
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,720
 It's like Scampi, isn't it?

1111
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,080
 There's lots of stuff in there.

1112
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,640
 You can eat.

1113
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,440
 There's lots of different species of snake that are eaten.

1114
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,720
 So I actually don't know.

1115
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,320
 For instance, we even at Viper in England.

1116
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,880
 Really?

1117
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,480
 At various times in our history.

1118
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,360
 We have a few cookbooks with Viper recipes in them.

1119
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,240
 Wow.

1120
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,360
 I actually wonder why we don't.

1121
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,080
 There must be something.

1122
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,280
 It must not be that tasty.

1123
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,880
 Otherwise, why aren't we eating snake?

1124
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,640
 I don't think it's very tasty.

1125
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,440
 Ken Elm Digby, father of Everard Digby,

1126
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,960
 friend of the podcast,

1127
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,520
 come up with a recipe of a Viper wine at some point.

1128
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,720
 I think he did with Cockail as well in the same book.

1129
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,480
 Interesting.

1130
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,560
 Apparently, just on the taste of snake,

1131
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,560
 according to the Oxford Companion, it's a food.

1132
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,360
 They say generally, the obvious resemblance between eels and snakes

1133
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,680
 make recipes for one suited to the other.

1134
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,880
 But snakes are leaner.

1135
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,680
 They taste a bit ealy, apparently.

1136
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,440
 Do you know when the best time to eat this pizza is?

1137
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,080
 And I don't mean in terms of like, you know, 7pm,

1138
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,520
 I mean seasonal.

1139
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,160
 Ooh.

1140
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,920
 Oh, snake season.

1141
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,040
 When the snakes are big.

1142
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,280
 Yeah.

1143
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,960
 So it's when the autumn wind begins to blow.

1144
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,320
 And the reason is because they've fattened up the snakes

1145
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,040
 at this point in preparation for hibernation.

1146
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,240
 So you're getting your snakiest topping when you order it then.

1147
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,320
 Pizza Hut are very good at this kind of regional specializing,

1148
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,120
 aren't they?

1149
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,680
 Are they?

1150
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,000
 Well, I found a few other examples from around the place.

1151
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,560
 These are a bit less visceral.

1152
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,160
 I mean, Pizza Hut Middle East did a cheeseburger crown crust pizza

1153
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,440
 which has a ring of miniature cheeseburgers around the edge of the crust.

1154
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,640
 Sounds great.

1155
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,280
 Fine.

1156
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,840
 Well, all right.

1157
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,520
 How do you think about this one, James?

1158
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,040
 Pizza Hut Malaysia, which offered a kind of squirting crust.

1159
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,240
 Okay.

1160
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,640
 Isn't that a stuffed crust that you've squeezed?

1161
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,080
 What's it squirting?

1162
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,440
 Garlic sauce and cheese.

1163
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,720
 Isn't that just a stuffed crust?

1164
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,560
 For some reason, it's more impressive than a stuffed crust.

1165
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,960
 It's more of a blast zone, apparently.

1166
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,920
 Oh, okay.

1167
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,400
 Okay.

1168
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,040
 All right.

1169
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
 I had a little bit of a look at the stuffed crust,

1170
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,120
 and it's a fascinating tale.

1171
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,480
 So any of you guys see this?

1172
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,680
 No, no.

1173
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,480
 The inventor of the stuffed crust has actually had a

1174
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,520
 full-on documentary released about him called Stolen Dough.

1175
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,240
 Brilliant.

1176
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,640
 And he's called Anthony Mongello.

1177
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,960
 He invented it in the 1980s, and Pizza Hut stole it.

1178
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,720
 He once accidentally made a pizza badly, made the crust too big,

1179
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,040
 saw there's this big hole in my crust.

1180
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,640
 Let's stuff it with cheese.

1181
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,200
 And he mentioned this to his dad, who actually had invented

1182
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,720
 a machine for molding mozzarella.

1183
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,600
 So there are big cheese--

1184
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,640
 How convenient.

1185
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,000
 Inventory cheese.

1186
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,320
 He accidentally invented stuffed crust after his father

1187
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,800
 invented an incredibly complicated industrial component

1188
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,920
 to mold mozzarella.

1189
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,640
 What are the odds?

1190
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,480
 I'm so annoyed.

1191
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,080
 I'm so annoyed every time.

1192
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,800
 Yeah.

1193
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,680
 It's a collab.

1194
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,480
 That's a collab.

1195
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,600
 I'm sure he invented it thanks to a combination of circumstances

1196
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,760
 which are not like, oh, are you trolling my pizza?

1197
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,560
 What can I fill it with?

1198
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,840
 Well, I don't have a snake to hand.

1199
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,360
 I'm a little more organic than that, isn't it?

1200
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,400
 You've grown up in a family where cheese is a big thing.

1201
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,200
 You're often talking about it, especially squishy cheese.

1202
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,600
 Completely.

1203
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,760
 I'm just saying circumstances are a bigger factor than accident.

1204
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,400
 Yeah.

1205
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,160
 No one's claimed an accident.

1206
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,640
 I haven't claimed that he invented it by accident.

1207
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,440
 He very much invented the stuffed crust intentionally.

1208
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,640
 OK, OK, good.

1209
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,000
 With money in mind.

1210
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,320
 Well, like he mentioned in the car, which just somehow

1211
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,440
 magically happened.

1212
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,080
 The crucial thing is he's got a patent.

1213
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,600
 Then he called up pizza places.

1214
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,880
 He called up Pizza Hut and said, look,

1215
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,640
 do you want this stuffed crust thing I've invented?

1216
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,000
 Pizza Hut said, no.

1217
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Eight years later, what shows up on Pizza Hut's menu?

1218
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,880
 It's the stuffed crust.

1219
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,040
 And what's the big claim?

1220
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,200
 They were probably just making a pizza

1221
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,920
 and noticed that there was a hole in their pizza tripped over.

1222
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,440
 So mozzarella landed in there.

1223
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,920
 They didn't even attempt to claim that.

1224
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,680
 They basically offered him 50 grand and was like, well, you know.

1225
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,880
 And he was like, get stuffed.

1226
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,080
 That's what it should have been called, this documentary.

1227
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,840
 The stolen dough is very good as well.

1228
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,000
 I think get stuff would be the Pizza Hut response

1229
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,080
 documentary in the documentary rat battle.

1230
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,040
 But he decided to reject their offer

1231
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,120
 and sued them for $1 billion.

1232
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,240
 $1 billion.

1233
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,680
 It's always a great number to sue.

1234
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,320
 Yeah.

1235
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,520
 It is really cool, isn't it?

1236
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,800
 It's very Dr. Evil, but it's destined to failure, which it did.

1237
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,040
 Oh, did you get anything?

1238
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,840
 He got nothing.

1239
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,720
 Just take what you're offered, guys.

1240
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,600
 That's the solution of this.

1241
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,560
 Just very quickly, do you know how they cook pizzas at Pizza Hut?

1242
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,680
 Did they put them in a pizza oven?

1243
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,320
 In a pizza oven.

1244
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,680
 They use a conveyor belt.

1245
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,880
 No.

1246
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,280
 They do.

1247
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,840
 Really?

1248
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,240
 Yeah.

1249
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,920
 It goes on a little conveyor belt and heads into the oven.

1250
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,840
 And it comes out the other side cooked.

1251
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,240
 Like those things that make toast in hotels.

1252
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:51,720
 Yeah.

1253
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,120
 Yeah.

1254
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,040
 Like that.

1255
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,840
 That's very good.

1256
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,240
 It's silly because you can't adjust the toastedness, can you?

1257
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,680
 You should be able to adjust the speed.

1258
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,960
 Well, you can adjust the toastedness.

1259
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,520
 There are dials.

1260
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,000
 What?

1261
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,760
 And also, I mean, the problem is they often only toast one side of the bread.

1262
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,480
 So you get toast that's charred on one side and bread on the other.

1263
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,440
 You guys are going to terrible hotels.

1264
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,760
 Yes.

1265
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,800
 Gens, we'll go on tour together.

1266
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,120
 It's annoying when you go off to the local Hilton with your fancy toasting machines.

1267
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,640
 In 2012, they launched a promotion, Pizza Hut, where if you were in the American

1268
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,040
 presidential debates and you asked the candidates whether they preferred sausage or pepperoni

1269
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,120
 on their pizza, you would win free pizza for life.

1270
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,000
 OK.

1271
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,040
 Did anyone do it?

1272
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,720
 No, because there was an outcry.

1273
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,120
 I think it was degrading democracy.

1274
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,760
 Little did they know.

1275
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,800
 And they moved it online and just instead randomly selected someone to win free pizza

1276
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,720
 for life, which I think was also a swiz because what is free pizza for life?

1277
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:51,560
 They always, what they do is they work out the average number of pizzas that someone eats in a

1278
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,920
 year. And like that's always down because they include people who just don't eat pizza.

1279
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,360
 And then they say, OK, well, the average person eats one and a half pizzas a year.

1280
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,800
 If we include everyone who lives in Mauritania, who's never heard of pizza.

1281
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,960
 And so, yeah, they give you a voucher for like 12 pizzas.

1282
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,280
 Yeah, it wasn't that quite, it was a free pizza a week, but only for 30 years.

1283
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,920
 I think after 30 years, you are probably done.

1284
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,400
 I think if you're eating that many pizzas, that probably is your life expectancy.

1285
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,400
 I would like the right to have 9000 pizzas now.

1286
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,120
 Do you know what I mean?

1287
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,960
 It should be any number of pizzas you want for eternity.

1288
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,440
 I agree.

1289
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,080
 Do you know which country eats the most pizza?

1290
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,960
 It's so surprising.

1291
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,520
 Italy.

1292
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,160
 Italy.

1293
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:35,560
 Lovely.

1294
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,440
 I'll accept James's answer as less wrong, but still wrong.

1295
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,720
 What would it be?

1296
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,080
 I think it must be, do you mean per capita or?

1297
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:45,880
 Per capita, yes.

1298
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,880
 I think, and it's quite hard to explain why, and no one has adequately done it.

1299
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,560
 So my theory is that this place perhaps doesn't have access to that much good,

1300
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,440
 fresh food, because of its geographical location.

1301
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,360
 You're quite far away, it's Norway.

1302
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,080
 Easter Island.

1303
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,840
 Oh, okay, sorry, I'll take it back.

1304
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:08,280
 Norway eats by far the most pizza, so 11.4 kilos per person.

1305
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,200
 Next is Canada, 8.9.

1306
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,280
 So that's so much.

1307
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,160
 Most of it is frozen pizza that you buy from the supermarket,

1308
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,400
 and half of those are this brand called Grandiosa,

1309
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,080
 and they really want a Norwegian to write in.

1310
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:27,080
 When we went to Norway, maybe I'm conflating two places here,

1311
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,280
 but I feel like there was quite a lot of these 7-Eleven places

1312
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,840
 where you could just buy slices of pizza all the time.

1313
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,120
 Oh, that's good.

1314
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,480
 I think that might be part of it.

1315
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,120
 Buying a slice is good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1316
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,080
 That makes sense.

1317
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,520
 Is it good pizza there?

1318
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,480
 No, I think it's not.

1319
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,440
 I think they like it to the extent that when a,

1320
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,040
 the company that makes Grandiosa,

1321
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,240
 which is called Staborette,

1322
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,400
 when they produced a pizza-themed song

1323
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,360
 called Respect for Grandiosa in 2006,

1324
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,240
 it was at the top of the country's music charts for eight weeks.

1325
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,040
 Oh my God.

1326
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,080
 But I also think it's not particularly good pizza.

1327
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,800
 Yeah, but it doesn't prove it really.

1328
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,040
 It doesn't prove the taste thing, does it?

1329
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:04,680
 No.

1330
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,320
 Should we mention true pizza from Naples?

1331
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:09,720
 Yeah.

1332
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,080
 Because it's, it's very serious in Naples.

1333
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:18,280
 So there is the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana,

1334
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,200
 and this was set up in 1984

1335
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,640
 by the 17 most eminent pizza clans in Naples.

1336
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,200
 So rough on the 18th most eminent.

1337
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,280
 I know, I know, and there's a guide to Neapolitan Pizza,

1338
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,880
 what it needs to be to become accredited.

1339
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,040
 So if you, even if you're anywhere around the world,

1340
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,960
 you can make a proper Neapolitan Pizza,

1341
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,800
 but you have to adhere to this guide.

1342
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,640
 It's 27 pages long,

1343
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,360
 and it's incredibly strict about the kind of things you need.

1344
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:46,920
 What is it?

1345
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,280
 Is it like just like literally cheese, tomato, and basil or something?

1346
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,120
 There are, yeah, there are,

1347
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,240
 there are lots of rules about the dough and the scorch marks

1348
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
 and that kind of stuff.

1349
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,400
 And these dimensions, like maximum dimension is 35 centimetres across,

1350
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,840
 all of this stuff.

1351
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,000
 Even, they claim that even Roman and Sicilian pizzas

1352
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,160
 are just sort of bastardised for catchers.

1353
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,000
 I mean, they're probably very proud of it.

1354
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,720
 Well, I think like modern pizzas were invented in America really,

1355
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,600
 weren't they?

1356
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,240
 Because like, basically what happened was,

1357
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,280
 Italian immigrants, or immigrants to America,

1358
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,080
 had this thing called tomato pie,

1359
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,080
 which is basically like a pizza,

1360
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,680
 but the cheese would go on the bottom

1361
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,440
 and the tomato would go on the top.

1362
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:28,760
 What?

1363
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,640
 And then they kind of over the years, especially in New York,

1364
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,640
 they kind of added toppings

1365
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,320
 and they swapped the cheese and the tomato around

1366
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,040
 and they created what we would now know as a pizza.

1367
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,680
 Oh, sorry.

1368
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,160
 I thought you meant the cheese went on like the underside

1369
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,240
 and the tomato went on the top side.

1370
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,480
 Like a sandwich, a bread sandwich.

1371
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,840
 Yeah, well, how do you hold this?

1372
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,720
 That's disgusting.

1373
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,960
 And so then what happened was,

1374
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,440
 American tourists would go over to Italy

1375
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,400
 and they'd want pizzas like they knew at home.

1376
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,600
 And so Italians would start making pizzas

1377
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,920
 in this American Italian style.

1378
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,000
 And so that's why now, even in Italy,

1379
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,760
 most of the pizzas will be this kind of modern style of pizza.

1380
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,640
 That's very interesting.

1381
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,360
 You know what's so weird?

1382
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,560
 You mentioned New York.

1383
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,840
 It wasn't until September 20th, 1944,

1384
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,120
 that pizza got its first proper mention in a newspaper.

1385
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,560
 And even more exciting,

1386
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,400
 the article uses what they say is

1387
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,120
 the rare use of the plural of pizza,

1388
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,440
 which is pizza.

1389
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,080
 Pizza.

1390
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,800
 Oh, that's nice.

1391
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,960
 Yeah, yeah, we'll do that from now on, pizza.

1392
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,480
 I actually, I did find another mention in from 1935

1393
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,440
 from New York about a pizza restaurant,

1394
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,520
 describing it excitedly as this new invention.

1395
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,360
 Yeah, so I think it might have come up a little bit,

1396
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,480
 but it was like a calzone, I think it was stuffed,

1397
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,000
 which I think they often were at this time.

1398
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,280
 And it said that pizza is best served as a side to roast beef.

1399
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,120
 How interesting.

1400
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,400
 Because you know calzone used to mean

1401
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,360
 sausage wrapped in a tube of dough was a calzone.

1402
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,200
 Like a toad in the hole.

1403
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,800
 Well, like a sausage roll, basically.

1404
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,360
 Oh, yeah.

1405
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,640
 And then eventually it became a folded over pizza,

1406
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,160
 but really a true calzone should be just a sausage roll.

1407
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,440
 Sausage stuffed crust.

1408
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,480
 That's interesting.

1409
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,240
 The word pizza originally was pizza, like pizza bread.

1410
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,800
 And it gets a name from the old word for pitch,

1411
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,160
 you know, like a pine pitch that you might paint onto a ship

1412
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,720
 so that it doesn't, so that it's waterproof.

1413
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,480
 And is that because you're painting the tomato pitch

1414
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,760
 onto the boat, which is the pizza in this instance?

1415
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,280
 No, it's because when you paint pitch onto wood,

1416
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,040
 it kind of comes into layers.

1417
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,720
 And quite a lot of breads and cakes are quite layered.

1418
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,640
 And so you have in lots of different languages,

1419
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,920
 you have pitch cakes and pitch breads in the Middle East.

1420
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,720
 It became pizza.

1421
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,520
 And then that came to Italy and they called it pizza.

1422
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,080
 That's great.

1423
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,920
 The 2024 World Dominoes Championship.

1424
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,040
 Is this Dominoes Pizza?

1425
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,920
 I'm talking pizzas.

1426
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,520
 So the game, the game Dominoes.

1427
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,520
 - Sponsored by? - Pizza Hut.

1428
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,520

 - That's brilliant. - They've run out of--

1432
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
 People who like Domino's love Pizza Hut.

1433
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,520
 [LAUGHTER]

1434
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520

1435
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,520
 - That's stunning. - Very clever.

1436
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,520
 - Domino's is very clever. - Very clever.

1437
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,520
