 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,200
 you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,560
 Harkin, Anna Tyshensky and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,920
 with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that the road network in Cornwall was probably

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,120
 not created by elephants. Really? Because that's slightly odd to what you said a couple of weeks ago.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,160
 Yeah it is slightly isn't it? It's quite long as well, it's quite long.

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,240
 Was this like exposed because of what I said that the roads are far too narrow to allow an

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,720
 elephant to pass through it? It's not, no. So this is just a little bit of inside baseball

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,200
 which is about that fact that I said that the roads in Cornwall were created by elephants

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:13,120
 and which turns out to have been published on April 1st and it's not true and I doubt for it

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,560
 and the slightly complicated factor is that the episode that it went out in went out on April 1st.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,040
 Can't we just pretend it was in April 4th on our part? I seriously considered it but I wasn't

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,680
 allowed to. Is that your actual fact this week? It's not my actual fact should we get to that one?

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,640
 Yeah okay good because it's one right. Paul let's find out in two weeks. My fact this week is that

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,040
 in 1954 Derbyshire Cricket Club tried drying out its pitch with a jet engine. Doesn't sound right.

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,720
 What's interesting is a few years later Yorkshire Cricket Club used an elephant to suck up the

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,800
 water from the bench. Oh my gosh. No this is amazing isn't it? It's fun. It's a cricket pitch

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,960
 drying innovation which hasn't stood the test of time. It's not you don't get a jet engine to

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,880
 hover over laws these days but this is from a brilliant piece that was published in The Guardian

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,920
 by Simon Burnton about the history of cricket pitch drying which obviously see that click

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 straight on that and it was about all these gadgets that have been tried out over the years

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,640
 and one of them was the jet engine was quite new at the time. It's like using I don't know

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,240
 nuclear fusion now. It was a relatively recent innovation. I don't think if we even craft

26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,400
 nuclear fusion I think if that's the first thing we use it for that's going to be quite an odd

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,120
 decision. The rest of the world's going to be looking at England going Jesus. They didn't bring

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,120
 a full jet though did they? They brought an engine yeah exactly so they rigged up an engine over

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,160
 they strapped it to a lorry and it was a Rolls Royce engine which they'd used in a

30
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,080
 plane called the Gloucester Meteor which was one of the first British jet engines.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,960
 Quite a thought lorry though must have been pacing it down the motorway to get there.

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,400
 Yeah did it work? It worked. It dried it out for eight minutes. When Rolls Royce were contacted

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,640
 by it was actually someone from Lancashire Cricket Club who contacted Rolls Royce saying

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,320
 hey why don't we do this. They said well it's going to use 400 gallons of fuel an hour

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,800
 and it'll probably bake the turf of the cricket pitch. It's not going to be very good. So they

36
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
 tried it out at Derbyshire because it was the nearest club to the Rolls Royce factory whatever.

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,200
 So they tried it out for eight minutes worked like a charm and as far as I can tell I don't

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,560
 think it was done again. Right because of all the fuel but they saved all that fuel by picking the

39
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
 nearest club to the Rolls Royce factory. Well this guy was called Jeff Howard wasn't he that he was a

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,840
 secretary of Lancashire and he said that if you can get play restarted using the jets then it'll

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,720
 be fine because it won't matter if the cost is 100 pounds which in modern days is thousands of

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,920
 thousands because if people come to see cricket then it's worth it. And Jeff Howard he was really

43
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,960
 interesting. His grandfather was the guy who invented garden cities so you know like Lechworth

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,520
 and all that kind of stuff. Wellen. Wellen yeah all that kind of stuff. So he was the grandson of

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:03,280
 that guy and he was the uncle of Eunice Stubbs the actor and the great uncle of the man who wrote

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,960
 the theme tune for two pints of lager and a packet of crisps. It's called Christian Henson.

47
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,760
 What a dinerster. What a batshit family gallery they must have in the ancestral home like that's

48
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,480
 the cricket guy that's the city guy that's the two pints of lager and a bag and a crisps guy.

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:29,440
 That's Eunice Stubbs. Amazing isn't it? Wow. Can I just when you say they use jet engines which

50
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,400
 bit is it the sucky bit or the blowy bit? In what way did they use a jet engine? Oh my god I

51
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,680
 don't know which way up it was. It must have been the blowy bit. They were firing it down rather

52
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,360
 than sucking it up. Because they do they do both don't they impressively so you never know. And

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,680
 actually I read somewhere that in in half a second the power of the suction in a jet engine

54
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,200
 could hoover an entire four bedroom house in half a second. That is no. Well so why is my cleaner

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:07,760
 taking three hours? Back to more problems with my cleaner. The spin-off show. I really should wash

56
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,920
 my dirty laundry here but if she did it I wouldn't have to. That surely implies there's kind of a

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,160
 market for a hoover which is shaped like the front door of your home and just drives around

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,480
 plugging into your front door. Well of course that's what used to happen to play hoovers used to be

59
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,000
 we might have said this but hoovers used to be on the back of horse and cart. They used to wait

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
 outside and you'd put it through the window wouldn't you like a big the big hose and you'd

61
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,520
 sort of hoover. Kind of like an elephant's trunk. Exactly like an elephant's trunk. I wouldn't

62
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,080
 miss that Andy. I think if you did do the front door option that you've suggested you would suck

63
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
 all of your furniture and inhabitants of the home into it as well. There's obviously a net in front

64
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,400
 of it Anna. It's sucking out dust and you just pick your belongings out of the net. Spend two to

65
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,120
 three days tidying your house. If you have any belongings that are the size of a speck of dust

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,160
 you're screwed right. Your pollen collection's gone. This article that you found Andy it's amazing

67
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,080
 because it is a genuinely really good article and it just seems that there have been so many

68
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,520
 different innovations trying to work out how to dry cricket grounds and they've come up with great

69
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
 ideas but they all just seem to have just one major flaw that ruins it for them. So there was

70
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,760
 this one idea which was using a new patented drying roller and it was it was really good. It got

71
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,480
 75% of wetness from the top of the turf off. It was really useful. Only issue it left the entire

72
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,960
 pitch jet black every time it did which was not useful cricket right. Isn't it? If you've chased

73
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:43,200
 to a white ball. That's really funny. They also tried giant washing up sponges didn't they? In

74
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,600
 I think in the 30s they just designed these massive washing up sponges where two men would stand on

75
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
 them and it would absorb and the interesting thing is you kind of get those today. I was reading

76
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,800
 about puddle pillows. They're cool aren't they? You can buy a pack of about 12 for about 120 quid

77
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,880
 if you're interested and they're really fun. They're used mostly for baseball pitches and it's

78
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,200
 what you'd imagine a big pillow and you plop it down on a big puddle and then you lift it up again

79
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,760
 and the puddle has vanished. Wow. Where's it gone Anna? Where's it gone? It's magic. That's really

80
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,560
 cool. I think they just mostly when I watch cricket they tend to get a big rope and just drag it around

81
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,920
 the pitch. I don't know how that works but yeah that's how they do. Is that maybe whipping off the

82
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,560
 dew? I don't really know. I've never understood why they do it but they all do it so it must work.

83
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,840
 That's interesting. For the water or is it? What? Like the outfield they tend to just drag a rope

84
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,840
 along I guess. Interesting. Maybe it's the standing water that they're getting rid of.

85
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,960
 Because they try certain things. There was in T20 in 2020, T20 International in fact between

86
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,720
 India and Sri Lanka. T60 basically. Yes that's what I meant. They used a hair dryer and a steam iron.

87
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,360
 There was footage of the groundskeepers using a hair dryer. No way. A physical hair dryer to dry

88
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,960
 wet patches of the ground. That's so funny. It's like when you get a wet patch on your trousers

89
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
 exactly. Just before you're about to go out and you're like how am I going to get rid of this

90
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,920
 wet patch? And you just have to try everything. It's either going to be the hair dryer or the iron

91
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,760
 depending on which bit of the trouser. Why is one patch not your trousers but why is one patch of

92
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,720
 the grounds wet? Is it one tiny cloud? Yeah it's like in the Truman show where it just picks one

93
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,960
 little spot. You know sports pitches are all tilted. Have you never seen sports on TV? Well

94
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,840
 the whole thing is about a 20 degree angle. Why are they playing on a hill? That's why they call it

95
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,440
 2020. It's the 20 degree angle of the game. Well lords is famously tilted as well. Lords is very

96
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,920
 tilted. In fact I think lords, don't they say that if you're standing on one end of lords then your

97
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,800
 head is lower than the field at the other end? That sounds about right. That's true. Yeah but

98
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,200
 that's just a cock up. They built it in the wrong place. That's insane. I used to play football.

99
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,760
 When I was at school I played football for the school team and we played against this prep school

100
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,440
 and they had a football pitch that was on I would say in my memory it was about a 45 degree angle.

101
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,560
 Perhaps it was a bit less than that but it just meant because we were kids like we didn't really

102
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,320
 know how to play football properly so everyone just used the chase after the ball. The ball would

103
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
 then always go up at the bottom of the hill just with 22 kids just kind of mauling after it like

104
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,400
 they're playing rugby. That's amazing. Was it like that? It was like the house vacuum where the parents

105
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,880
 would have to come and scoop their kids out of the big net at the end. Anyway sorry about what you

106
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,680
 were saying. Sports pitches are meant to be slightly tilted for drainage to stop them getting wet so

107
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,800
 they're either crowned which is when they've got a tilt. The high point is in the middle. Brilliant.

108
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,680
 Or they're just tilted on a side slope so they're all drains to one side so like in a football pitch

109
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,320
 for instance the crown runs from one goal to the other like a ledge and they're supposed to be... So

110
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,640
 you're always shooting downhill? No, it's downhill to the sides. So it's like a road. It's like the

111
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,800
 camber on a road. Yeah it's like the camber on a road exactly between one goal and the other

112
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,720
 and then the sides of the pitch are between 12 and 18 inches lower than the middle of the pitch.

113
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,560
 Oh wow. Isn't that cool? That is cool. And that's why when you look at the edges of the pitch and

114
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,440
 like round where the sub-spinches are it's often a lot muddier and harder to drain because that's

115
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,880
 where all the water collects. Wow that's really cool. I didn't know that football pitches have

116
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,520
 underfloor heating. Do they? Throughout the pitch. Under grass heating. Yeah. All Premier League

117
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,680
 ones do for sure. Wow. Right I mean that's if you know about football you definitely know that but

118
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,760
 if you don't know about football like me that's mind-blowing. They've got it's mostly electric

119
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,960
 wire isn't it? Yeah because you know how they play football in winter? Yeah. Yeah so that they

120
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,360
 don't get cold off due to the snow. It's not to warm their feet. I thought it was to help the grass

121
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,680
 grow as opposed to help melt the snow. That can help as well although they'll have big lights above

122
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,400
 the grass to help that grow as well but it's mostly I believe to stop it from getting cold

123
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,720
 off in winter. That's insane. I just think wow people really like football don't they?

124
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:57,200
 This will surprise you it's a multi-million pound international spot.

125
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,760
 I think what we're saying is the heating is paying for itself.

126
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,600
 I like that so Lords is obviously the most famous cricket ground certainly to anyone who's a non-cricketer

127
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,960
 that's the one that I know most and this is the third Lords. It was in two other venues beforehand

128
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,960
 right? So the original Lords which was opened up by a guy called Henry Lord was in Marlborough in

129
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,080
 London. Oh because they're called the Marlborough Cricket Club aren't they? Yes. That's the official

130
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,200
 they they own the rules of cricket don't they? Like if you want to change a rule you can't they own

131
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,280
 it. I've never heard of that before. You have to ask these dicks and stupid outfits whether you're

132
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,800
 allowed to. But so this guy he set up it in Marlborough and then it was moved to St John's

133
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,280
 Wood when he had to change and then that got moved again to where it currently is and when he moved

134
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,320
 each time he wasn't impressed with the grass there so they lifted up the turf from the very first

135
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,080
 Lords moved it to the second one and then when the current Lords that it's in now I think they've

136
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,320
 changed the turf entirely but certainly when it was set up that was the turf that was then carried

137
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,640
 over from the second one really to there as well yeah that's really interesting. So what did they do

138
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,880
 with the grass that was already there did they swap? I think they yeah they might have swapped and

139
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,440
 got rid of it yeah I actually don't know how they disposed the last one but in 2002 they actually

140
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,800
 Lords did a whole new revamp on it and they got rid of the turf so they sold off chunks of turf to

141
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,720
 people so people all over the UK now have little bits of Lords grass in their garden which they're

142
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,240
 growing. One guy spent over a thousand pounds buying a huge but so his whole garden is Lords

143
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,520
 ground. That's cool. And the grid that you mentioned the MCC they made sure that they kept one very

144
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,840
 specific patch of grass that they gave to the location of the original Lords from 188 years ago

145
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,280
 so sitting back there now the grass has returned. It's like a cutting that they can propagate and

146
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,720
 they can grow new Lords for the if the current Lords is destroyed or whatever. Yes it's like a

147
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,920
 seed bank yeah yeah yeah yeah. You see Andy people really like cricket as well. It's amazing isn't it?

148
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,960
 Yeah people do. People just love sport anyway. So wet fields is a problem in all sports do you

149
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,080
 know how people dry baseball fields? Well with the sponges you said the puddle sponges. They do it

150
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,000
 with the puddle sponges I think that's a good way to do it that's a recommended way a non-recommended

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,640
 way which has been a space of lately as people setting fire to them. So it's been really weird

152
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,440
 every couple of years it's reported in America so in 2019 in Connecticut there were 25 gallons of

153
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,680
 petrol dumped on a baseball infield and lit and it was just by lit by 20 parents whose kids would

154
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,840
 strike the match to get it going. Nice. Yeah yeah yeah. Very good. Strike. I like it. Yeah.

155
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,240
 Would have also worked if it had been a bowling set because it's like a bowling alley.

156
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,200
 Hang on so they sorry is this on the grassy bit or the muddy bit? The muddy bit.

157
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,760
 Oh so there's no grass to destroy that's good.

158
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,800
 That's true although it still does quite a lot of damage it did $50,000 worth of damage police

159
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,320
 estimated and they advise people not to do it. What to the dirt?

160
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,800
 Like how valuable is this dirt? I'm sorry sir but the dirt's gone.

161
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,160
 However will we replace the mud?

162
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:27,440
 Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that there's currently

163
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,880
 a court case going on in Ireland about whether stained glass windows are actually windows.

164
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,120
 It's a big deal. Can I ask Anna right so you've read about this story.

165
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,040
 Do you land on the opinion that stained glass windows are windows or that they're not? Well

166
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,880
 don't want to get into any subjudice here but oh yeah always a case happening in Ireland

167
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,680
 isn't it? Yeah. So if you're listening in Ireland turn the show off now. Especially if you're on the

168
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,840
 jury for this piece. Yeah without wanting to sway any listeners at home I wouldn't like to make a

169
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,640
 call because I've instinctively sided with the victim which doesn't necessarily mean I've sided

170
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,960
 with the truth. Oh okay yeah I mean so it makes sense when you tell the story. Yeah I should tell

171
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,440
 the story. The very fact that you've decided which side is the victim I think shows that

172
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,560
 you are biased. Yeah you're right you're right thank god I'm not on this jury. Anyway this is

173
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,240
 all about a place called Beaulieu's Cafe which you might know if you live in Dublin it's in Central

174
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,600
 Dublin it's this famous old period building. Beautiful building the pièce de résistance

175
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,840
 in this building are six stained glass windows and they were designed in 1927 by Ireland's most

176
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,400
 famous stained glass window maker who I'm sure you know is Harry Clark. Oh yeah. There's a bit

177
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,480
 of a problem because Beaulieu's, Beaulieu's Cafe are just tenants and the people who own the building

178
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,840
 are called Ronan Group Real Estate and Beaulieu's are in massive renters not their fault some would

179
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,000
 say the rent has gone up massively over the last few years very difficult to pay. I'm working out who

180
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,640
 the victim is. So they're in renters of 700,000 euros and the windows are worth about a million

181
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,640
 euros and what Beaulieu's are arguing is that the windows are not windows which means that the

182
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,880
 company that owns the building doesn't own the windows because they're not windows. You own

183
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,080
 windows because they're part of a building but these windows are works of art they're chattels

184
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,240
 they're things that are held within the building so their argument is I'm afraid this big billionaire

185
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,280
 landlord group doesn't own the movable chattels it's arguing they are movable uh yeah that and

186
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,520
 that might be where the court case falls down because it is quite difficult to move them obviously

187
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,760
 anyway they so Beaulieu made this offer they've said to the guys who are the landlords look we

188
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:56,000
 won't pay the rent because we can't but what we will do is um steal the windows we will sell the

189
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,480
 windows on uh to a company which will then donate them back to the cafe and you are allowed to keep

190
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,040
 them yeah so there's that they're actually selling them to the state and then the state will donate

191
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,040
 them to the cafe and say okay you're allowed to keep them in the cafe the landlords are like

192
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,600
 screw you we own the windows you can't sell us something that we already own yeah feels a bit

193
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,040
 like they're right as in when when Beaulieu's arrived did they knock out the existing windows

194
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,920
 and put in their own stained glass windows I don't think so right well Dan you raised a very

195
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,040
 interesting question because the people who owned it originally were Beaulieu's and then they sold

196
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,920
 it on they own the stained glass windows and then they sold it and became tenants in the 80s right

197
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,440
 interesting so that does confuse me because they sold it so they've they've kind of sold the windows

198
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,920
 once and now they're suggesting they might depend on what's in the contract doesn't it yeah it does

199
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,480
 absolutely I maybe they haven't thought of checking the contract I mean Beaulieu's yeah like you say

200
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,360
 really um you know part of the furniture in Dublin you know one of the most famous places

201
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,000
 mentioned in a great work of art um see if you can guess which which it is I'll give you the quote

202
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,440
 monica had gone home long ago it was quarter to nine little chandler had come home late for tea

203
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,920
 any ideas okay well yeah well friends but what what there's something spin off I don't know what you're

204
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,720
 talking about they're just two characters in the Dubliners by James Joyce but isn't it true

205
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,520
 James that that the tv series friends is part of the extended Dubliners universe I tried to look

206
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,720
 I got the entire text of the Dubliners in search for all the other characters no gunter you

207
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,200
 wouldn't believe it would you anyway it says the little chandler had come home late for tea

208
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,240
 and moreover he had forgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Beaulieu's so yeah James

209
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,320
 Joyce he used to go there and he mentioned it that's really cool and isn't there an episode of

210
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,120
 friends called the one where they sell the windows on dubious grounds in order to get out of 700 grand

211
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,480
 it's basically Central Perk's big problem that's solved with that that's great it was founded by

212
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,240
 the Beaulieu family but the Beaulieu family the first people who were involved in hot drinks

213
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,120
 was a guy called Samuel Beaulieu and he brought in a load of tea from China when the East India

214
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,280
 company had a monopoly and the monopoly finished and so people could suddenly buy tea in London

215
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,360
 and he said well why should we buy tea in London we can just ship it straight over to Dublin so he

216
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,840
 did that and the reason he could do it is he had all these ships because he used to be a merchant

217
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,320
 of silkworm guts cool cool isn't that cool i would see do you think he said i'm a silkworm

218
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,480
 gut merchant what's that i'm a silkworm gut merchant that's what i do do you know what they

219
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,800
 might use i'd never heard of silkworm guts i mean i assume they had them are we talking about the

220
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,240
 actual parts of the silkworm that yeah the place that they digest stuff is it like yeah is there

221
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,440
 equivalent to sausages for them like tiny little sausages oh the extra bits that's a great thought

222
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,080
 you could make a sort of silk making robot and then when you implant the silkworm guts into it

223
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,520
 it is the crucial missing bit but it is almost gettable but probably not the kind of guts or the

224
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,200
 animal guts cat cut cat guts you use for instruments yeah so how tiny is this orchestra

225
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,520
 whenever someone says they're playing the tiniest violin in the world actually silkworm guts of

226
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,240
 they were used for making fishing tackle like fishing lines and also to sew up cuts by surgeons

227
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,040
 they used to use silkworm guts because it was really good so cool isn't that amazing awesome

228
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:38,800
 wow people are so clever i stayed in a b&b in broad stares once with my wife and the guys who

229
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,480
 owned it who ran it they make their own stained glass and it's really beautiful and they were

230
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,960
 telling us about the process and i mentioned to my wife and Ella that we were going to be talking

231
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,560
 about this and she said do you remember that thing they told us they said that back in the

232
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,600
 medieval days when people made stained glass they used to use the urine of redheaded boys

233
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:04,000
 as part of the formula for making it and i found a couple of sources online that suggest that that's

234
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,760
 apparently redheaded or ginger urine used to have magical properties and they thought sorry

235
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,560
 it was used to be thought that it has magical properties it didn't used to have magical properties

236
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,000
 when do the redheads lose this amazing power some say they've never lost it is that how Rod

237
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,520
 Weasley got into Hogwarts um it does make sense because the redheaded bit doesn't but

238
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,120
 to make the paint in stained glass it actually used to be made out of crushed glass and something

239
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,680
 like urine so it was it was either urine or wine they tended to mix it with to make the paint to

240
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,920
 stain it i i did believe it when you said it down as well but i you believe it even more now that i

241
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:50,240
 understand it i don't believe it i do know guys what color can glass be stained stained glass

242
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,200
 be stained give me some colors any color blue red green yellow you're all wrong you're all completely

243
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,560
 wrong what the only staining you see on stained glass is brown or black or gray paint stained

244
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,280
 what no it's a big old misnomer what so stained glass this is i feel like that doesn't tally with

245
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,000
 my experience but you know when you go to the church and all the windows are brown and black

246
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,720
 just looks like the birds are pooed all down this absolute symphony of browns yeah god's light

247
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,240
 uh makes you hallucinate all the colors no the way you make the colors the proper colors in

248
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,960
 stained glass is you mix up your glass mixture with certain metals that make certain colors so

249
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,880
 like cobalt i think makes blue and um what other different ones are there gold chloride makes red

250
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,280
 color so that's not staining you're mixing it with a metal that's making the glass rather than having

251
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,200
 existing clear glass and then painting that because that's one of the other techniques as well isn't

252
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,680
 it so then you do that and that was the only way they made stained glass until i think about 13th

253
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,920
 century so stained glass wasn't actually stained and then they came up with this idea of kind of

254
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,160
 painting it with this paint they made and all that does is this add the shading which i didn't

255
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,760
 realize stained glass involved is the black lines that you see that create the kind of textures

256
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,760
 and all the shading which makes it look more realistic and that's all just in brown and brown

257
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,520
 and gray just for the glass notes out there the palace of westminster they have stained glass there

258
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,160
 and basically this is a story about the british um harry clark what i think is the british harry

259
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,400
 clark and that's a woman called mary lounges she was a stained glass artist and she was like one of

260
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,480
 the main people of the arts and crafts in the uk okay now she also established the artist suffrage

261
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,440
 league and they did all of the posters and placards and christmas cards for suffrage events

262
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,280
 one of them that she did in particular was the mud march in 1907 this was the largest ever march

263
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,680
 for women's suffrage they brought people in from all the different towns of the uk and they all

264
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,160
 had banners and so if you were from bolton you would have like a banner with something to do with

265
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,000
 bolton in it like a pasty or something i don't know but it would be like from each place it would

266
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,680
 be something to do with them and she designed all of these stained glass artists and in the palace

267
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:06,560
 of westminster um window number four has a stained glass of the mud march which is what she did all

268
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,160
 of the banners for so it kind of comes around in a nice circle that's cool isn't it and then and on

269
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,440
 the window is there an individual little bit of stained glass of all of the banners no it's just

270
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,240
 like a general kind of picture of the mud march because it was really muddy that day and they

271
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
 were they went through i don't know like st james's and stuff but it was really really muddy and

272
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,760
 all the pictures in the newspapers were of all these muddy angry stuff tragically they didn't

273
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,880
 have jet engine technology to drive them out there's west from mr abbey obviously has a lot

274
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,320
 of stained glass windows as well there's loads when we're talking central london and um it has a

275
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,880
 recent one that has been added a few years back by can anyone guess an artist an artist um tracy

276
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,000
 ermin no uh but like a good guess that's as good a guess as any i know what those stains would have

277
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,200
 been made of it was all brown wasn't it yeah um demianhurst no so david gunter von hargan's

278
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,120
 no that would have been i know someone flayed you know so lots of pinks and reds what about um who

279
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,000

299
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,200
 it looks like someone's done that on their phone and it kind of turns out he has and he designed it

300
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,840
 certainly find it in that's what i'm wearing i've just i actually read about this in my research

303
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,720
 bit he was on the toilet like have you guys seen like the david hockney's he does on his ipad yeah

304
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,400
 like i'm sure they're great works of art they genuinely look like they've been done by children

305
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,800
 and this looks no different really i'd love to see this in person just to see if it's a bit more

306
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,720
 vibrant but when you see a photo of it it looks like i'm a big fan of hockney but yeah yeah i know

307
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,720
 but i agree these ipad drawings are very much they look quite uh microsoft word kind of you

308
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,920
 know or like microsoft art microsoft paint microsoft paint not work it's quite impressive to

309
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:17,280
 her to microsoft work okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact my fact this week

310
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:25,520
 is that hard rock cafe is owned globally by a group of native americans so weird this is pretty

311
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:33,680
 incredible this is the seminal tribe uh they're in florida and um back in 2006 i believe it was

312
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,280
 they bought for nine hundred and sixty five million dollars the entire group of hard rock

313
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,520
 cafe so that's all the cafes it's the hotels it's the casinos and they are now the owners

314
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,920
 not only of hard rock cafe but this group of native americans are also the owners of the greatest

315
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:57,920
 collection of rock and roll memorabilia in the world so they have been buying up things like

316
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:04,640
 casinos and hotels ever since the late 1970s and this purchase is just part of their catalog

317
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 of ever-growing business ventures and the seminal tribe uh it's worth putting into context who

318
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,680
 they are they came into existence properly in the 1950s and what it was was a disparate group

319
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,880
 of native americans that feels late it was very late they've i mean you know the the peoples that make

320
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,040
 up the the group with this name of seminal they've been around 12 000 years in america and they were

321
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,240
 all little groups of uh native american tribes that were sort of being pushed out further away

322
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,440
 by white people coming into america and they made a decision to sort of form together and sort of

323
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,280
 create a body where you officially would become the seminal like a supergroup yes yeah like cream

324
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,920
 they are like the traveling wilburys yeah and actually there's a lot of traveling wilburys and

325
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,640
 cream memorabilia in our country as a sort of solidarity the seminal people though of course

326
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,040
 you know they've been around for a very very long time that's not a new name the seminal tribe that

327
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,400
 was set up in 1957 was a collection of other tribes coming together and banding under that name

328
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,280
 and they they basically the the claim on the seminal tribe website is that they are the only

329
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:18,320
 people who never surrendered to the white invaders basically yeah and um that was true of the seminal

330
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,120
 people in the 19th century they had the seminal wars which were a massive deal in the us throughout

331
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,880
 the 19th century i think there were three big seminal wars and it was this thing where presidents

332
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,000
 like andrew jackson very famous for persecuting native americans and others kind of went to war

333
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,280
 with them and tried to force them west because obviously they suddenly wanted all the eastern

334
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,920
 land so forced loads of them west but a bunch of the seminal people rather than being forced out of

335
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,520
 florida where they wanted to be kind of retreated into the everglade marshes yeah the seminal

336
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,000
 traditions i read that there are four particular seminal traditions which are sewing patchwork

337
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,080
 building chickies which are small wooden houses on stilts kind of traditional structures and

338
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,240
 bidding on big multi national businesses the fourth one is wrestling alligators oh yes that's

339
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,200
 it i just wonder if it's like sewing patchwork building small wooden structures and wrestling

340
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
 alligators that's the hardest of the badges to get when you're in seminal high scouts isn't it

341
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,240
 i just feel like there might be some kind of sorting hat procedure as a young seminal

342
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,600
 alligators can i put the hat on again please should we talk about hard rock cafe so it was

343
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,400
 started by peter mortin and another guy called isaac tigaret i believe that's how you pronounce

344
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:35,600
 his name and isaac tigaret clearly a massive rock and roll fan actually married the first wife of

345
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,160
 ringo star not moraine moraine he married moraine someone's read this fact i just know but i just

346
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:48,080
 know that ring goes marital history i think if i'd known that before i would have remembered

347
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,800
 his first wife was called moraine that's the kind of you know it's a more usual name yeah isn't it

348
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,760
 yeah moraine starkey so moraine um and they broke up because she had an affair with george

349
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,680
 harrison huge scandal wait ringo and moraine or no ringo and moraine broke out when when she was

350
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,880
 found crumbs with george harrison yeah like uh so that's that's just a bit goss for you guys there

351
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:18,240
 and are you saying because you say he's clearly a massive breaking news what a scoop a lot of the

352
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,120
 memorabilia yeah it's not it's not all hard rock as in i think of hard rock as being even harder than

353
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,520
 normal rock yeah like slipknot or something right right and it's not they don't have a lot of kind

354
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,640
 of death metal or doom drone based right and i think people would be less willing to eat in their

355
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,080
 restaurants i certainly would if they did just dead rats yeah cradle of filth is playing out of

356
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,640
 the sound system you're right you're right but wings paul mccartney's band wings debuted at the

357
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,720
 london branch the original branch of the hard rock cafe yeah probably what can you get as a

358
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:57,360
 starter at hard rock cafe the paul mccartney one waitress says that when they did debut they

359
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,360
 all the waiting staff put cotton wool in their ears so that they could keep the night out while

360
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,320
 they serve people well this this waitress who said this is a waitress you can and she still

361
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,800
 works it so i walked past it on the way to the qi office today i walked past the hard rock just

362
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,320
 i just i want to see this this was open in 1971 this was the the landmark spot where it was opened

363
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,320
 and when they opened they had a waitress working there who is called reeta gilligan and she has an

364
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,640
 mbe she still works there she's seriously fun isn't she yeah um and has such good goss because

365
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,080
 i didn't quite realize that every musical celebrity you've ever heard of is eating in

366
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,440
 hard rock cafes is this in your contract when you join a band so you know she says um she actually

367
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,400
 said i've served the beetles the stones freddy mercury eric clapton pete townsend and then she

368
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,120
 says take that and the carnebis which seems like an incredibly steep decline i've actually never

369
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,680
 heard of the i haven't either and i looked them up and they don't even have a bloody wikipedia page

370
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,840
 i think she's probably pushing a band that she's managing i wonder if that might be a

371
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,280
 misprint for the cranberries i wondered if it was the cranberries but then there is a band

372
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,800
 called the carnebis that have played in the hard rock cafe i think it's part of their brand so

373
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,800
 she's trying to slip them in maybe with these big names and she supposedly turned down posh spice

374
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,040
 for a job reeta when she came in i love the story that's the way you tell it i don't know the full

375
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,880
 story well it's it's there's not much more to it than that but she reeta gilligan claims that victoria

376
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:23,200
 beckham applied for a job at the hard rock cafe as a hostess or whatever shortly before the spice

377
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,720
 girls took off but that she was rejected for being too quiet yeah and so she went and got a job at

378
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,960
 bill wyman's restaurant sticky fingers instead but it's she was trying to know what was named after

379
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,880
 a rollingstone's album yeah i just didn't know i would have chosen one of the others i don't know

380
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:44,480
 any of the other albums but i reckon all of them will be a better name yeah they would in association

381
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,080
 with they've got an album called beggars banquet that's quite a fun cool name for a restaurant

382
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,080
 but no sticky fingers yeah but this is the weird thing so there's reeta gilligan who worked there

383
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,520
 since 1971 and it was still there a couple of years ago there's also another waitress from the

384
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,080
 hard rock cafe called dealia lee's who worked there for 48 years and she got a job two weeks

385
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,200
 after it opened and she's 80 now and she still does two days a week so i think there are two of them

386
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:14,640
 who have been there for 50 years this is like bloody qi there's no turnover of staff that reminds

387
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,920
 me there was um i only half remember this story but at the savoy um there was two very famous um

388
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,960
 waiters who work behind the bar and they two women and they both worked there for about 60 years or

389
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,240
 something and they knew everyone um but they stopped talking after about five years of working

390
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,160
 together and then they just stopped being friends and then they didn't really see each other because

391
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,200
 they were on shifts but literally didn't talk for like 30 years that's so funny that's over all we

392
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,920
 have a similar thing on the podcast don't because actually if you listen carefully back to all the

393
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
 episodes you notice that anna and dan have not said anything to each other on the show

394
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,680
 for the last five years if you notice that when we were doing that guessing game and it wasn't

395
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,680
 giving any yeah there was only me and andy shouting for half an hour it's long-term beam

396
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,520
 listen out for that um rita by the way she got her job in 1971 and it happened when her husband

397
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,280
 was reading the evening standard and he shouted to her the looking for people like you and she

398
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:19,280
 went oh are they and she went over and the advert read older women wanted late 30s 40s and 50s and

399
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,280
 she was only 29 when she left oh that's such a horrible thing to say did she have to put

400
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,280
 talcum powder in her hair and well actually when she went there she said um you know i'm looking

401
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,160
 for a job and one of the co-founders peter martin said no you know you're too young you're too young

402
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,960
 for this and she said i'm the best you're gonna get so you better take me and he said yeah cool

403
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,200
 you're hired do we is it known why they wanted women in the late 30s 40s 50s and so on i suspect

404
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,240
 that what they were trying to do is they were trying to get american diners in the uk because

405
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,520
 there wasn't anywhere that you there was no McDonald's there and there was nothing like that they

406
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,280
 wanted to have a place where you could get burgers and stuff like that and if there's that cliche of

407
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,520
 being sold by sort of a 65 year old yeah like a happy days kind of thing yeah you got to any diner

408
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,640
 in america and you you have breakfast there there's always a woman who's you know in her you know

409
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,040
 middle age coming around with a with a pot of coffee and tipping you up and topping you up and

410
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,280
 i think that was just the cliche right tipping you up and topping you up she inverts you on your

411
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:30,160
 chair they're very strong isaac tigrit was a devotee of an indian guru back when those indian

412
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,240
 gurus were a big deal um and this one was satya saibaba and so yeah the chain was founded by him

413
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,600
 and he obviously brought the spiritual side to hard rock cafe and then this guy called peter

414
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:46,000
 morton who um was the son of a founder of morton steakhouse who brought the steak side um so the

415
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,520
 motto of the hard rock cafe is love all serve all apparently there must be something like a tennis

416
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,480
 term doesn't it you never say serve all in serve all serve all it's like what you might say just

417
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,400
 before the game starts yeah i know have you not seen the serve all bit of a tennis match where

418
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,800
 everyone gets to serve at the same time it's chaotic but it's the points rack up actually

419
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,600
 happens before right they do a warm-up where they both serve at each other yeah right technically

420
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,720
 known as the love all serve all but yeah of course it was originally a chain of tennis courts that

421
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,480
 would be such an improvement i mean like cricket has had the t20 revolution i think tennis needs a

422
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,000
 like a jeopardy round where everyone can serve as many balls as they can at the same time and you

423
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,160
 just have to stand there and if it hits you in the post then that's part of the game doesn't

424
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:40,480
 yeah that's 40 love anyway this guy who um inspired hard rock cafe this saibaba

425
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,840
 he was quite interesting i didn't know about him he was a massive deal in india 500 000 people

426
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,520
 went to his funeral sachin tendulkar cancelled his birthday really that year that he died wait

427
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,200
 sorry he he cancelled his birthday he's now actually one year younger than everyone thinks

428
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,600
 he is that just feels like an anti-aging prick by sachin tendulkar oh no he's sneaky right what

429
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,440
 what's he gonna be cancelled well he cancelled his birthday party he didn't celebrate a hard rock cafe

430
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,480
 so he uninvited everyone he didn't have a cake he didn't have a party he didn't have a party he

431
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,800
 didn't even celebrate no one even sung to him uh because he was so sad about this spiritualist dying

432
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,480
 oh gosh and he claimed that he was a proper god like omnipotent omniscient and the he did

433
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,240
 loads of amazing tricks apparently and he got some some examples for us there was a terminally ill

434
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,120
 woman uh she needed treatment it could only be given in japan and so she went and visited this guy

435
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,760
 and said i need this treatment to save my life can only be treated in japan and he pointed at a door

436
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,280
 and said walk through that door and she walked through the door with a travel agent

437
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:54,960
 i'm so glad i'm so glad i set my office up next to this branch of trail finders

438
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,640
 what happened that was on 10 times and it was japan what she walked through the door and she was in

439
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,320
 japan yeah cool wow don't say cool like you believe it though it's a cool story it's a really cool

440
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,720
 story it's like narnia for the modern day yes um isn't that amazing why to claim and yeah and then

441
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,840
 what happened well that's sort of where his tale ends you assume i suppose she was in japan and

442
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,760
 she's in japan well how's he supposed to know what happened that's true he can't go through the door

443
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,120
 he's not okay so he didn't leave the door open he just said he closed the door otherwise everyone

444
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:35,760
 leaves india and goes to japan so this woman who's quite ill has just ended up in i presume

445
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,560
 around a bit of japan i'm not because the door already led to japan it can't have led to the

446
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,640
 specific clinic she needs she's now trapped in a foreign country she's now illiterate because

447
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,600
 japanese is a different alphabet yeah yeah it's an incredibly upsetting and busy place she's very

448
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,120
 he hasn't come off brilliantly in this story he doesn't have a rail car because you can get rail

449
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,760
 cards in japan that help you go around foreigners you can get them especially but she's now she's

450
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,360
 wanted by the authorities because she's not in the country legally she hasn't got a visa or

451
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,760
 whatever you get here who's going to believe that so that's why you've got to be very careful what

452
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:18,640
 you wish for oh it's one of those stories okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that

453
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,960
 is james okay my fact this week is that when female seals have sex they have a special muscle

454
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,960
 in their vagina that can clamp around their partner to stop seawater from getting in

455
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,280
 that means that in order to create a seal they first need to create a seal

456
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:44,640
 superb fabulous oh god is it sex sex does always create a seal really doesn't it

457
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,640
 but do these ones plant particularly hard yeah these are like proper muscles in the vagina it

458
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,240
 feels like a wise saying that the seals have doesn't it yes to create a seal you must first

459
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,760
 create a seal yes you know the seals and the seals and what would happen if they didn't

460
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:12,720
 have the seal would they flood sorry tragic they have to get a jet engine to blow all the water

461
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,400
 out of them let me quickly say where i got this so i was honestly this was a speculative search

462
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,480
 that king i wonder if seals have seals and i found this paper called reproductive biology of seals

463
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,640
 by shannon atkinson where they describe this but basically it's just to stop seawater getting in

464
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,840
 pebbles getting in and if you think about they basically have a very similar reproductive system

465
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:42,400
 to humans so they you know you know vagina cervix uterus blah blah blah and if you look at a whale

466
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,920
 for instance they have quite a long sort of maze like structure in between that kind of stops anything

467
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,200
 from getting in there yeah but they have like basically like the human reproductive system

468
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,880
 it's pretty much straight up and straight down so they need something to stop stuff from getting in

469
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,040
 there and there are a few different ways of doing this but the way they do it is with these folds

470
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,840
 which have special muscles in and the muscles can clamp around the penis so that when the seaman gets

471
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:16,320
 in no sea gets it i feel like i feel like you're feeling you're pushing it a bit

472
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:22,480
 the seals are great and we should talk about seals oh they're amazing hardly ever talked

473
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,240
 about them so let's talk about them yeah you know they they basically don't need eyes or ears

474
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,720
 really there's their whiskers phenomenal whiskers that seals have and they do have eyes and ears

475
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,240
 they have eyes and ears and they use them but they didn't have them they could basically operate

476
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,240
 because yeah their whiskers are so unbelievably sensitive oh yeah all right so let's say we know

477
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,360
 that cats use their whiskers or rats use their whiskers they've got 200 nerve endings on their

478
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:53,040
 on their whiskers cats and rats right a seal has about 1500 basically what it means is that if they

479
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,360
 were swimming through the ocean and they couldn't see or hear and they needed to work out where the

480
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,480
 precise location of the fish is that they wanted to eat they could just use their whiskers to feel

481
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,040
 the vibrations the little movements of the water they're being pushed through the whisker and and

482
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:16,480
 pinpoint it and get to the nose and the other thing is they can tell if a fish has gone past 30

483
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,560
 seconds ago they can tell by the vibration in the water where the fish was using their whiskers

484
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,120
 and they go oh there was a fish here 30 seconds ago and they can follow the trail of where the

485
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,920
 fish has been and then with their whiskers and go down and the other thing is not just a whiskers

486
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,280
 like a cat which is where the nose is they can also do this with their eyebrows because they have

487
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,480
 whiskers on their eyebrows so they can hunt fish with their eyebrows that's pretty amazing that's

488
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,840
 that's also why old men are so good at fishing isn't it there was an experiment on the whiskers it

489
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,960
 was by the University of Rostock and it was about how harbour seals they find flatfish so flatfish

490
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,280
 hide under the sand so they're not very visible but there are these tiny movements of their gills

491
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,120
 because they're breathing in and out very slightly and the seals use their whiskers to find the

492
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,000
 flatfish and eat them for the experiment the scientists found some seals they created some

493
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 fake flatfish under the water to be the bait and then they blindfolded the seals yeah how cool that

494
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,400
 is the better way of doing it because the first person probably to do most of this work was a

495
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,440
 woman called Dean Renov and she did it by snipping off the whiskers of the seals and you won't be

496
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,800
 able to do that now but this was in the 70s and she was really into her she loved her seals and

497
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,600
 stuff like you know obviously now to modern modern years it sounds quite bad but she really

498
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:39,360
 loved her seals apparently you could see the seal walking behind her in the University when she was

499
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,240
 walking to her lectures and stuff I was listening to a really good podcast which interviews someone

500
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,120
 called Dr Alex Milne who has such a great job she's a sensory biologist specializing in pinniped

501
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,200
 whiskers um and she was saying we don't know this but seal whiskers are curly they've got like wavy

502
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,720
 hair as opposed to sea lions and walruses who are sort of the the other pinnipeds um and we think

503
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,920
 that is to sense the undulations of the water though we're not totally sure but anyway she did

504
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,960
 this um she's done lots of experiments with um seal you know playing with seals and seeing how

505
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,880
 sensitive their whiskers are and playing with them balancing balls on their whiskers and so you get

506
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,400
 balls of lots of different sizes and then you watch what their whiskers do so if you've got a

507
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,560
 small ball and then a big ball which you think involves you know it points its whiskers towards

508
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,880
 them to balance um and then which would use more whiskers the big ball more area and that's incorrect

509
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,160
 oh yeah the little ball that there you go dance dance got it dance how did you learn that out

510
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,720
 you've got to use the method of wait for people to answer wrongly and they get in there I tried

511
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,600
 to do that with the artist but we didn't go through every artist in the world um it's so it's the same

512
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,240
 physics which means it's easier to spin a big ball around on one finger right then balance the

513
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,600
 little ball um and so the smaller the prey the more whiskers it takes so if they're chasing

514
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,840
 prey in the water the same thing happens they focus more whiskers towards a smaller prey to

515
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,480
 try and pinpoint where it is because I know you're looking a bit skeptical Andy but you see basketball

516
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,800
 players spinning a ball on the finger you don't see table tennis players doing it to you no I don't

517
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:20,240
 know I've never seen that thank you James but balls get heavier the bigger they get yeah to a

518
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,880
 certain extent like once they're so big they crush your fingers then you have to yeah a basket ball

519
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,920
 versus a ping pong ball for example would I would feel require more whiskers purely for the weight

520
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,760
 of it so we must be talking beach balls they use their nose as well um but I think um it is I think

521
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,520
 the the whiskers are sort of for balance but yeah I think it probably is beach balls so those are

522
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,120
 the ones with the balls on their noses aren't they yeah yeah they always have a ball on their nose

523
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,320
 yeah yeah and dolphins do as well often yeah it's not a vintage dolphin thing though no I think when

524
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,880
 I think of dolphins I think of dolphins jumping through hoops yeah yeah yeah being really clever

525
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,880
 yeah playing chess but they are the only two animals so it's weird that you say it's not

526
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,000
 a vintage dolphin thing when it's so clearly no it's such a seal thing they'd have a ball on

527
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,160
 your nose yeah absolutely I agree I don't think it's a dolphin thing at all it is no it is a dolphin

528
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:13,280
 thing well I think it's on its way out they gave people TB tuberculosis in South America

529
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,480
 is believed to come from seals I know this sounds like elephants built the roads in Cornwall

530
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,320
 I appreciate it sounds like that but no there's a there's a bioarchaeologist never heard of that

531
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,800
 job before either called Jane Buikstra I hope I'm pronouncing it right from the Colombian

532
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,040
 Institute of Anthropology and History because TB got to South America with colonists 500 years ago

533
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,600
 but there have been bones found much older which also have TB and it doesn't look like they came

534
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,760
 over with the original humans you know 10,000 years ago whenever it was because it spreads from

535
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,800
 south to north not north to south which is not the order you would expect it to go in right hang on

536
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,480
 sorry I'm confused so the colonists brought the TB over but there are also seals that are older

537
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,480
 with TB but there was pre-existing human TB found in samples in bones and if it had come with the

538
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,720
 original arrivers 10,000 years ago it would have gone from north to south but it didn't

539
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,720
 went south to north and so the theory is that it came over with seals which might have been you

540
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,080
 know eaten hunted and eaten and the bacteria survived there because TB arose in Africa

541
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,080
 interesting and somehow seals got it is the theory took it to South America gave it to humans

542
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,640
 and then they met on the way down presumably the humans coming down met the TB on the way up

543
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,760
 an awkward dinner yeah but sometimes zookeepers these days get TB from the seals in their care

544
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,960
 doesn't always happen they need to not get so close don't they have you guys seen Andre the seal

545
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,720
 no no okay seriously yeah seriously right no I kind of thought everyone watched that as a kid

546
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:45,120
 oh it was a TV show it was a film oh no no I've not seen it okay well this I think I saw the play

547
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:51,520
 yeah I was just shot down on animal rights grounds within a couple of days wasn't it

548
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,960
 did they mention the vagina thing yeah it was about that was weird it was you and it was marketed

549
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,040
 to children um well Andre the seal for those who've seen it it was a very famous film in our

550
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,160
 childhoods for a brief period of time we all watched it it wasn't very good and it was the true story

551
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,640
 of a seal who befriended a tree surgeon which you wouldn't have thought their lives could lie

552
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:18,160
 better cricket match yeah that's a hell of a meat cute you've got to enter there um yeah I don't

553
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,120
 know how maybe the forest was flooded anyway seal befriended a tree surgeon we're like in the

554
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:28,640
 pitch me see they go so this is the story the seal meets this guy we've seen that a million times

555
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:38,320
 wait wait wait the guy's a tree surgeon keep talking um true befriended this seal and it's a true story

556
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,560
 between 1961 and 1986 yeah so this guy was also into diving met this seal it had been abandoned

557
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,720
 by its mother and so it took it in and sort of raised it for a few weeks thinking it would return

558
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,920
 to the wild tried to return it to the wild and the seal loved him so much he just stuck around

559
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,120
 stuck around for like 25 years but what like in the bath or don't they need lots of water it would

560
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,960
 come up to his house and hang out in his house in the day and then flop back down to the harbour

561
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,640
 and then he'd go swimming with it wow and it wintered in this aquarium anyway they made this film

562
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,200
 about it and do you know what species of seal they used in the film uh seal no there's a there's an

563
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,240
 elephant seal uh what's the name of the film down what were you gonna say no because I realized I

564
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,480
 was saying not while saying a sea lion you're absolutely correct you're kidding they used a

565
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,000
 not seal and how bullshit is that as if they couldn't be bothered to find a seal and they do

566
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,560
 look quite similar it's all in the ears but anyway they the filmmakers wanted to coordinate with the

567
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,400
 aquarium who raised andre in the winters and the aquarium refused bigger I think sea lions right

568
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,040
 I think they're both they are bigger yeah although you can get huge seals elephant seals are massive

569
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:50,080
 the key apparent is that um seals have um ears that are just holes I think yeah seals are kind of

570
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:55,360
 more roundheaded so seals can remember what they have just done and repeat it on command

571
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:03,760
 as long as you ask them within 18 seconds of the image I'll think okay I set a cup of tea

572
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:10,720
 this is unusual because not many people can do this right this is a study I think most people

573
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:18,160
 can do this but well I'm quite content so this is um a study by simian smiel at the university

574
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:24,080
 of southern Denmark in Odent and basically they asked them to do one thing and then they asked

575
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:30,160
 them to do it again after 18 seconds but they could still do the thing they said repeat they

576
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,440
 didn't say do this thing again they said repeat and they managed to do it okay and what was quite

577
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,720
 interesting is the guy in charge of it smiel said that this is really they've did a really good job

578
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,320
 because what you have to understand is that this is a very very repetitive study and even the human

579
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,920
 trainers and assistants had a hard time remembering what they had just asked

580
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,520
 you end up with a human as they were just staring at each other

581
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:08,160
