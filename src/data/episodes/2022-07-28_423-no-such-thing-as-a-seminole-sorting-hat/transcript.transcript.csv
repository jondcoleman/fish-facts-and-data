00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:19,00:00:25,"you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"Harkin, Anna Tyshensky and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:30,00:00:36,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting
00:00:36,00:00:43,with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that the road network in Cornwall was probably
00:00:43,00:00:49,not created by elephants. Really? Because that's slightly odd to what you said a couple of weeks ago.
00:00:49,00:00:52,"Yeah it is slightly isn't it? It's quite long as well, it's quite long."
00:00:52,00:00:56,Was this like exposed because of what I said that the roads are far too narrow to allow an
00:00:56,00:01:00,"elephant to pass through it? It's not, no. So this is just a little bit of inside baseball"
00:01:00,00:01:05,which is about that fact that I said that the roads in Cornwall were created by elephants
00:01:05,00:01:13,and which turns out to have been published on April 1st and it's not true and I doubt for it
00:01:13,00:01:18,and the slightly complicated factor is that the episode that it went out in went out on April 1st.
00:01:19,00:01:25,Can't we just pretend it was in April 4th on our part? I seriously considered it but I wasn't
00:01:25,00:01:29,allowed to. Is that your actual fact this week? It's not my actual fact should we get to that one?
00:01:29,00:01:36,Yeah okay good because it's one right. Paul let's find out in two weeks. My fact this week is that
00:01:36,00:01:43,in 1954 Derbyshire Cricket Club tried drying out its pitch with a jet engine. Doesn't sound right.
00:01:43,00:01:48,What's interesting is a few years later Yorkshire Cricket Club used an elephant to suck up the
00:01:48,00:01:56,water from the bench. Oh my gosh. No this is amazing isn't it? It's fun. It's a cricket pitch
00:01:56,00:02:00,drying innovation which hasn't stood the test of time. It's not you don't get a jet engine to
00:02:00,00:02:04,hover over laws these days but this is from a brilliant piece that was published in The Guardian
00:02:04,00:02:09,by Simon Burnton about the history of cricket pitch drying which obviously see that click
00:02:09,00:02:13,straight on that and it was about all these gadgets that have been tried out over the years
00:02:13,00:02:18,and one of them was the jet engine was quite new at the time. It's like using I don't know
00:02:18,00:02:24,nuclear fusion now. It was a relatively recent innovation. I don't think if we even craft
00:02:24,00:02:28,nuclear fusion I think if that's the first thing we use it for that's going to be quite an odd
00:02:28,00:02:33,decision. The rest of the world's going to be looking at England going Jesus. They didn't bring
00:02:33,00:02:39,a full jet though did they? They brought an engine yeah exactly so they rigged up an engine over
00:02:39,00:02:42,they strapped it to a lorry and it was a Rolls Royce engine which they'd used in a
00:02:42,00:02:46,plane called the Gloucester Meteor which was one of the first British jet engines.
00:02:46,00:02:48,Quite a thought lorry though must have been pacing it down the motorway to get there.
00:02:48,00:02:56,Yeah did it work? It worked. It dried it out for eight minutes. When Rolls Royce were contacted
00:02:56,00:03:00,by it was actually someone from Lancashire Cricket Club who contacted Rolls Royce saying
00:03:00,00:03:04,hey why don't we do this. They said well it's going to use 400 gallons of fuel an hour
00:03:04,00:03:08,and it'll probably bake the turf of the cricket pitch. It's not going to be very good. So they
00:03:08,00:03:13,tried it out at Derbyshire because it was the nearest club to the Rolls Royce factory whatever.
00:03:13,00:03:17,So they tried it out for eight minutes worked like a charm and as far as I can tell I don't
00:03:17,00:03:22,think it was done again. Right because of all the fuel but they saved all that fuel by picking the
00:03:22,00:03:27,nearest club to the Rolls Royce factory. Well this guy was called Jeff Howard wasn't he that he was a
00:03:27,00:03:33,secretary of Lancashire and he said that if you can get play restarted using the jets then it'll
00:03:33,00:03:38,be fine because it won't matter if the cost is 100 pounds which in modern days is thousands of
00:03:38,00:03:43,thousands because if people come to see cricket then it's worth it. And Jeff Howard he was really
00:03:43,00:03:50,interesting. His grandfather was the guy who invented garden cities so you know like Lechworth
00:03:50,00:03:55,and all that kind of stuff. Wellen. Wellen yeah all that kind of stuff. So he was the grandson of
00:03:55,00:04:03,that guy and he was the uncle of Eunice Stubbs the actor and the great uncle of the man who wrote
00:04:03,00:04:08,the theme tune for two pints of lager and a packet of crisps. It's called Christian Henson.
00:04:08,00:04:15,What a dinerster. What a batshit family gallery they must have in the ancestral home like that's
00:04:15,00:04:20,the cricket guy that's the city guy that's the two pints of lager and a bag and a crisps guy.
00:04:20,00:04:29,That's Eunice Stubbs. Amazing isn't it? Wow. Can I just when you say they use jet engines which
00:04:29,00:04:34,bit is it the sucky bit or the blowy bit? In what way did they use a jet engine? Oh my god I
00:04:34,00:04:39,don't know which way up it was. It must have been the blowy bit. They were firing it down rather
00:04:39,00:04:45,than sucking it up. Because they do they do both don't they impressively so you never know. And
00:04:45,00:04:51,actually I read somewhere that in in half a second the power of the suction in a jet engine
00:04:51,00:04:59,could hoover an entire four bedroom house in half a second. That is no. Well so why is my cleaner
00:04:59,00:05:07,taking three hours? Back to more problems with my cleaner. The spin-off show. I really should wash
00:05:07,00:05:13,my dirty laundry here but if she did it I wouldn't have to. That surely implies there's kind of a
00:05:13,00:05:18,market for a hoover which is shaped like the front door of your home and just drives around
00:05:18,00:05:22,plugging into your front door. Well of course that's what used to happen to play hoovers used to be
00:05:22,00:05:28,we might have said this but hoovers used to be on the back of horse and cart. They used to wait
00:05:28,00:05:31,outside and you'd put it through the window wouldn't you like a big the big hose and you'd
00:05:31,00:05:35,sort of hoover. Kind of like an elephant's trunk. Exactly like an elephant's trunk. I wouldn't
00:05:35,00:05:40,miss that Andy. I think if you did do the front door option that you've suggested you would suck
00:05:40,00:05:44,all of your furniture and inhabitants of the home into it as well. There's obviously a net in front
00:05:44,00:05:50,of it Anna. It's sucking out dust and you just pick your belongings out of the net. Spend two to
00:05:50,00:05:55,three days tidying your house. If you have any belongings that are the size of a speck of dust
00:05:55,00:06:02,you're screwed right. Your pollen collection's gone. This article that you found Andy it's amazing
00:06:02,00:06:06,because it is a genuinely really good article and it just seems that there have been so many
00:06:06,00:06:11,different innovations trying to work out how to dry cricket grounds and they've come up with great
00:06:11,00:06:15,ideas but they all just seem to have just one major flaw that ruins it for them. So there was
00:06:15,00:06:21,this one idea which was using a new patented drying roller and it was it was really good. It got
00:06:21,00:06:28,75% of wetness from the top of the turf off. It was really useful. Only issue it left the entire
00:06:28,00:06:34,pitch jet black every time it did which was not useful cricket right. Isn't it? If you've chased
00:06:34,00:06:43,to a white ball. That's really funny. They also tried giant washing up sponges didn't they? In
00:06:43,00:06:47,I think in the 30s they just designed these massive washing up sponges where two men would stand on
00:06:47,00:06:51,them and it would absorb and the interesting thing is you kind of get those today. I was reading
00:06:51,00:06:58,about puddle pillows. They're cool aren't they? You can buy a pack of about 12 for about 120 quid
00:06:58,00:07:02,if you're interested and they're really fun. They're used mostly for baseball pitches and it's
00:07:02,00:07:07,what you'd imagine a big pillow and you plop it down on a big puddle and then you lift it up again
00:07:07,00:07:13,and the puddle has vanished. Wow. Where's it gone Anna? Where's it gone? It's magic. That's really
00:07:13,00:07:18,cool. I think they just mostly when I watch cricket they tend to get a big rope and just drag it around
00:07:18,00:07:23,the pitch. I don't know how that works but yeah that's how they do. Is that maybe whipping off the
00:07:23,00:07:28,dew? I don't really know. I've never understood why they do it but they all do it so it must work.
00:07:28,00:07:33,That's interesting. For the water or is it? What? Like the outfield they tend to just drag a rope
00:07:33,00:07:37,along I guess. Interesting. Maybe it's the standing water that they're getting rid of.
00:07:37,00:07:42,"Because they try certain things. There was in T20 in 2020, T20 International in fact between"
00:07:42,00:07:50,India and Sri Lanka. T60 basically. Yes that's what I meant. They used a hair dryer and a steam iron.
00:07:50,00:07:55,There was footage of the groundskeepers using a hair dryer. No way. A physical hair dryer to dry
00:07:55,00:08:00,wet patches of the ground. That's so funny. It's like when you get a wet patch on your trousers
00:08:00,00:08:04,exactly. Just before you're about to go out and you're like how am I going to get rid of this
00:08:04,00:08:07,wet patch? And you just have to try everything. It's either going to be the hair dryer or the iron
00:08:07,00:08:13,depending on which bit of the trouser. Why is one patch not your trousers but why is one patch of
00:08:13,00:08:18,the grounds wet? Is it one tiny cloud? Yeah it's like in the Truman show where it just picks one
00:08:18,00:08:24,little spot. You know sports pitches are all tilted. Have you never seen sports on TV? Well
00:08:24,00:08:29,the whole thing is about a 20 degree angle. Why are they playing on a hill? That's why they call it
00:08:29,00:08:35,2020. It's the 20 degree angle of the game. Well lords is famously tilted as well. Lords is very
00:08:35,00:08:39,"tilted. In fact I think lords, don't they say that if you're standing on one end of lords then your"
00:08:39,00:08:44,head is lower than the field at the other end? That sounds about right. That's true. Yeah but
00:08:44,00:08:51,that's just a cock up. They built it in the wrong place. That's insane. I used to play football.
00:08:51,00:08:55,When I was at school I played football for the school team and we played against this prep school
00:08:55,00:09:01,and they had a football pitch that was on I would say in my memory it was about a 45 degree angle.
00:09:01,00:09:06,Perhaps it was a bit less than that but it just meant because we were kids like we didn't really
00:09:06,00:09:10,know how to play football properly so everyone just used the chase after the ball. The ball would
00:09:10,00:09:16,then always go up at the bottom of the hill just with 22 kids just kind of mauling after it like
00:09:16,00:09:20,they're playing rugby. That's amazing. Was it like that? It was like the house vacuum where the parents
00:09:20,00:09:24,would have to come and scoop their kids out of the big net at the end. Anyway sorry about what you
00:09:24,00:09:29,were saying. Sports pitches are meant to be slightly tilted for drainage to stop them getting wet so
00:09:29,00:09:34,they're either crowned which is when they've got a tilt. The high point is in the middle. Brilliant.
00:09:34,00:09:39,Or they're just tilted on a side slope so they're all drains to one side so like in a football pitch
00:09:39,00:09:44,for instance the crown runs from one goal to the other like a ledge and they're supposed to be... So
00:09:44,00:09:50,"you're always shooting downhill? No, it's downhill to the sides. So it's like a road. It's like the"
00:09:50,00:09:54,camber on a road. Yeah it's like the camber on a road exactly between one goal and the other
00:09:54,00:09:58,and then the sides of the pitch are between 12 and 18 inches lower than the middle of the pitch.
00:09:58,00:10:02,Oh wow. Isn't that cool? That is cool. And that's why when you look at the edges of the pitch and
00:10:02,00:10:07,like round where the sub-spinches are it's often a lot muddier and harder to drain because that's
00:10:07,00:10:12,where all the water collects. Wow that's really cool. I didn't know that football pitches have
00:10:12,00:10:17,underfloor heating. Do they? Throughout the pitch. Under grass heating. Yeah. All Premier League
00:10:17,00:10:21,ones do for sure. Wow. Right I mean that's if you know about football you definitely know that but
00:10:21,00:10:25,if you don't know about football like me that's mind-blowing. They've got it's mostly electric
00:10:25,00:10:30,wire isn't it? Yeah because you know how they play football in winter? Yeah. Yeah so that they
00:10:30,00:10:35,don't get cold off due to the snow. It's not to warm their feet. I thought it was to help the grass
00:10:35,00:10:39,grow as opposed to help melt the snow. That can help as well although they'll have big lights above
00:10:39,00:10:44,the grass to help that grow as well but it's mostly I believe to stop it from getting cold
00:10:44,00:10:48,off in winter. That's insane. I just think wow people really like football don't they?
00:10:48,00:10:57,This will surprise you it's a multi-million pound international spot.
00:10:57,00:11:03,I think what we're saying is the heating is paying for itself.
00:11:07,00:11:13,I like that so Lords is obviously the most famous cricket ground certainly to anyone who's a non-cricketer
00:11:13,00:11:18,that's the one that I know most and this is the third Lords. It was in two other venues beforehand
00:11:18,00:11:24,right? So the original Lords which was opened up by a guy called Henry Lord was in Marlborough in
00:11:24,00:11:30,London. Oh because they're called the Marlborough Cricket Club aren't they? Yes. That's the official
00:11:30,00:11:35,they they own the rules of cricket don't they? Like if you want to change a rule you can't they own
00:11:35,00:11:39,it. I've never heard of that before. You have to ask these dicks and stupid outfits whether you're
00:11:39,00:11:46,allowed to. But so this guy he set up it in Marlborough and then it was moved to St John's
00:11:46,00:11:53,Wood when he had to change and then that got moved again to where it currently is and when he moved
00:11:53,00:11:58,each time he wasn't impressed with the grass there so they lifted up the turf from the very first
00:11:58,00:12:04,Lords moved it to the second one and then when the current Lords that it's in now I think they've
00:12:04,00:12:08,changed the turf entirely but certainly when it was set up that was the turf that was then carried
00:12:08,00:12:12,over from the second one really to there as well yeah that's really interesting. So what did they do
00:12:12,00:12:16,with the grass that was already there did they swap? I think they yeah they might have swapped and
00:12:16,00:12:21,got rid of it yeah I actually don't know how they disposed the last one but in 2002 they actually
00:12:21,00:12:26,Lords did a whole new revamp on it and they got rid of the turf so they sold off chunks of turf to
00:12:26,00:12:32,people so people all over the UK now have little bits of Lords grass in their garden which they're
00:12:32,00:12:38,growing. One guy spent over a thousand pounds buying a huge but so his whole garden is Lords
00:12:38,00:12:43,ground. That's cool. And the grid that you mentioned the MCC they made sure that they kept one very
00:12:43,00:12:49,specific patch of grass that they gave to the location of the original Lords from 188 years ago
00:12:49,00:12:55,so sitting back there now the grass has returned. It's like a cutting that they can propagate and
00:12:55,00:13:00,they can grow new Lords for the if the current Lords is destroyed or whatever. Yes it's like a
00:13:00,00:13:05,seed bank yeah yeah yeah yeah. You see Andy people really like cricket as well. It's amazing isn't it?
00:13:05,00:13:12,Yeah people do. People just love sport anyway. So wet fields is a problem in all sports do you
00:13:12,00:13:18,know how people dry baseball fields? Well with the sponges you said the puddle sponges. They do it
00:13:18,00:13:22,with the puddle sponges I think that's a good way to do it that's a recommended way a non-recommended
00:13:22,00:13:28,way which has been a space of lately as people setting fire to them. So it's been really weird
00:13:28,00:13:33,every couple of years it's reported in America so in 2019 in Connecticut there were 25 gallons of
00:13:33,00:13:39,petrol dumped on a baseball infield and lit and it was just by lit by 20 parents whose kids would
00:13:39,00:13:45,strike the match to get it going. Nice. Yeah yeah yeah. Very good. Strike. I like it. Yeah.
00:13:45,00:13:50,Would have also worked if it had been a bowling set because it's like a bowling alley.
00:13:50,00:13:55,Hang on so they sorry is this on the grassy bit or the muddy bit? The muddy bit.
00:13:55,00:13:57,Oh so there's no grass to destroy that's good.
00:13:58,00:14:02,"That's true although it still does quite a lot of damage it did $50,000 worth of damage police"
00:14:02,00:14:06,estimated and they advise people not to do it. What to the dirt?
00:14:06,00:14:12,Like how valuable is this dirt? I'm sorry sir but the dirt's gone.
00:14:12,00:14:16,However will we replace the mud?
00:14:16,00:14:27,Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that there's currently
00:14:27,00:14:32,a court case going on in Ireland about whether stained glass windows are actually windows.
00:14:32,00:14:39,It's a big deal. Can I ask Anna right so you've read about this story.
00:14:39,00:14:45,Do you land on the opinion that stained glass windows are windows or that they're not? Well
00:14:45,00:14:48,don't want to get into any subjudice here but oh yeah always a case happening in Ireland
00:14:48,00:14:53,isn't it? Yeah. So if you're listening in Ireland turn the show off now. Especially if you're on the
00:14:53,00:14:59,jury for this piece. Yeah without wanting to sway any listeners at home I wouldn't like to make a
00:14:59,00:15:04,call because I've instinctively sided with the victim which doesn't necessarily mean I've sided
00:15:04,00:15:08,with the truth. Oh okay yeah I mean so it makes sense when you tell the story. Yeah I should tell
00:15:08,00:15:13,the story. The very fact that you've decided which side is the victim I think shows that
00:15:13,00:15:18,you are biased. Yeah you're right you're right thank god I'm not on this jury. Anyway this is
00:15:18,00:15:22,all about a place called Beaulieu's Cafe which you might know if you live in Dublin it's in Central
00:15:22,00:15:27,Dublin it's this famous old period building. Beautiful building the pièce de résistance
00:15:27,00:15:33,in this building are six stained glass windows and they were designed in 1927 by Ireland's most
00:15:33,00:15:38,famous stained glass window maker who I'm sure you know is Harry Clark. Oh yeah. There's a bit
00:15:38,00:15:44,"of a problem because Beaulieu's, Beaulieu's Cafe are just tenants and the people who own the building"
00:15:44,00:15:49,are called Ronan Group Real Estate and Beaulieu's are in massive renters not their fault some would
00:15:49,00:15:54,say the rent has gone up massively over the last few years very difficult to pay. I'm working out who
00:15:54,00:16:02,"the victim is. So they're in renters of 700,000 euros and the windows are worth about a million"
00:16:02,00:16:08,euros and what Beaulieu's are arguing is that the windows are not windows which means that the
00:16:08,00:16:12,company that owns the building doesn't own the windows because they're not windows. You own
00:16:12,00:16:18,windows because they're part of a building but these windows are works of art they're chattels
00:16:18,00:16:22,they're things that are held within the building so their argument is I'm afraid this big billionaire
00:16:22,00:16:29,landlord group doesn't own the movable chattels it's arguing they are movable uh yeah that and
00:16:29,00:16:35,that might be where the court case falls down because it is quite difficult to move them obviously
00:16:35,00:16:39,anyway they so Beaulieu made this offer they've said to the guys who are the landlords look we
00:16:39,00:16:56,won't pay the rent because we can't but what we will do is um steal the windows we will sell the
00:16:56,00:17:02,windows on uh to a company which will then donate them back to the cafe and you are allowed to keep
00:17:02,00:17:07,them yeah so there's that they're actually selling them to the state and then the state will donate
00:17:07,00:17:11,them to the cafe and say okay you're allowed to keep them in the cafe the landlords are like
00:17:11,00:17:15,screw you we own the windows you can't sell us something that we already own yeah feels a bit
00:17:15,00:17:21,like they're right as in when when Beaulieu's arrived did they knock out the existing windows
00:17:21,00:17:25,and put in their own stained glass windows I don't think so right well Dan you raised a very
00:17:25,00:17:31,interesting question because the people who owned it originally were Beaulieu's and then they sold
00:17:31,00:17:35,it on they own the stained glass windows and then they sold it and became tenants in the 80s right
00:17:35,00:17:41,interesting so that does confuse me because they sold it so they've they've kind of sold the windows
00:17:41,00:17:45,once and now they're suggesting they might depend on what's in the contract doesn't it yeah it does
00:17:45,00:17:52,absolutely I maybe they haven't thought of checking the contract I mean Beaulieu's yeah like you say
00:17:52,00:17:57,really um you know part of the furniture in Dublin you know one of the most famous places
00:17:57,00:18:04,mentioned in a great work of art um see if you can guess which which it is I'll give you the quote
00:18:04,00:18:11,monica had gone home long ago it was quarter to nine little chandler had come home late for tea
00:18:11,00:18:17,any ideas okay well yeah well friends but what what there's something spin off I don't know what you're
00:18:17,00:18:22,talking about they're just two characters in the Dubliners by James Joyce but isn't it true
00:18:22,00:18:29,James that that the tv series friends is part of the extended Dubliners universe I tried to look
00:18:29,00:18:34,I got the entire text of the Dubliners in search for all the other characters no gunter you
00:18:34,00:18:39,wouldn't believe it would you anyway it says the little chandler had come home late for tea
00:18:39,00:18:44,and moreover he had forgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Beaulieu's so yeah James
00:18:44,00:18:48,Joyce he used to go there and he mentioned it that's really cool and isn't there an episode of
00:18:48,00:18:53,friends called the one where they sell the windows on dubious grounds in order to get out of 700 grand
00:18:53,00:19:00,it's basically Central Perk's big problem that's solved with that that's great it was founded by
00:19:00,00:19:06,the Beaulieu family but the Beaulieu family the first people who were involved in hot drinks
00:19:06,00:19:13,was a guy called Samuel Beaulieu and he brought in a load of tea from China when the East India
00:19:13,00:19:19,company had a monopoly and the monopoly finished and so people could suddenly buy tea in London
00:19:19,00:19:23,and he said well why should we buy tea in London we can just ship it straight over to Dublin so he
00:19:23,00:19:27,did that and the reason he could do it is he had all these ships because he used to be a merchant
00:19:27,00:19:34,of silkworm guts cool cool isn't that cool i would see do you think he said i'm a silkworm
00:19:34,00:19:40,gut merchant what's that i'm a silkworm gut merchant that's what i do do you know what they
00:19:40,00:19:44,might use i'd never heard of silkworm guts i mean i assume they had them are we talking about the
00:19:44,00:19:50,actual parts of the silkworm that yeah the place that they digest stuff is it like yeah is there
00:19:50,00:19:57,equivalent to sausages for them like tiny little sausages oh the extra bits that's a great thought
00:19:57,00:20:02,you could make a sort of silk making robot and then when you implant the silkworm guts into it
00:20:02,00:20:07,it is the crucial missing bit but it is almost gettable but probably not the kind of guts or the
00:20:07,00:20:13,animal guts cat cut cat guts you use for instruments yeah so how tiny is this orchestra
00:20:13,00:20:19,whenever someone says they're playing the tiniest violin in the world actually silkworm guts of
00:20:20,00:20:26,they were used for making fishing tackle like fishing lines and also to sew up cuts by surgeons
00:20:26,00:20:31,they used to use silkworm guts because it was really good so cool isn't that amazing awesome
00:20:31,00:20:38,wow people are so clever i stayed in a b&b in broad stares once with my wife and the guys who
00:20:38,00:20:42,owned it who ran it they make their own stained glass and it's really beautiful and they were
00:20:42,00:20:46,telling us about the process and i mentioned to my wife and Ella that we were going to be talking
00:20:46,00:20:50,about this and she said do you remember that thing they told us they said that back in the
00:20:50,00:20:55,medieval days when people made stained glass they used to use the urine of redheaded boys
00:20:55,00:21:04,as part of the formula for making it and i found a couple of sources online that suggest that that's
00:21:04,00:21:09,apparently redheaded or ginger urine used to have magical properties and they thought sorry
00:21:09,00:21:14,it was used to be thought that it has magical properties it didn't used to have magical properties
00:21:14,00:21:20,when do the redheads lose this amazing power some say they've never lost it is that how Rod
00:21:20,00:21:29,Weasley got into Hogwarts um it does make sense because the redheaded bit doesn't but
00:21:29,00:21:35,to make the paint in stained glass it actually used to be made out of crushed glass and something
00:21:35,00:21:39,like urine so it was it was either urine or wine they tended to mix it with to make the paint to
00:21:39,00:21:43,stain it i i did believe it when you said it down as well but i you believe it even more now that i
00:21:43,00:21:50,understand it i don't believe it i do know guys what color can glass be stained stained glass
00:21:50,00:21:55,be stained give me some colors any color blue red green yellow you're all wrong you're all completely
00:21:55,00:22:00,wrong what the only staining you see on stained glass is brown or black or gray paint stained
00:22:00,00:22:07,what no it's a big old misnomer what so stained glass this is i feel like that doesn't tally with
00:22:07,00:22:12,my experience but you know when you go to the church and all the windows are brown and black
00:22:12,00:22:18,just looks like the birds are pooed all down this absolute symphony of browns yeah god's light
00:22:18,00:22:24,uh makes you hallucinate all the colors no the way you make the colors the proper colors in
00:22:24,00:22:28,stained glass is you mix up your glass mixture with certain metals that make certain colors so
00:22:28,00:22:34,like cobalt i think makes blue and um what other different ones are there gold chloride makes red
00:22:34,00:22:39,color so that's not staining you're mixing it with a metal that's making the glass rather than having
00:22:39,00:22:43,existing clear glass and then painting that because that's one of the other techniques as well isn't
00:22:43,00:22:47,it so then you do that and that was the only way they made stained glass until i think about 13th
00:22:47,00:22:51,century so stained glass wasn't actually stained and then they came up with this idea of kind of
00:22:51,00:22:56,painting it with this paint they made and all that does is this add the shading which i didn't
00:22:56,00:23:01,realize stained glass involved is the black lines that you see that create the kind of textures
00:23:01,00:23:05,and all the shading which makes it look more realistic and that's all just in brown and brown
00:23:05,00:23:11,and gray just for the glass notes out there the palace of westminster they have stained glass there
00:23:11,00:23:18,and basically this is a story about the british um harry clark what i think is the british harry
00:23:18,00:23:24,clark and that's a woman called mary lounges she was a stained glass artist and she was like one of
00:23:24,00:23:30,the main people of the arts and crafts in the uk okay now she also established the artist suffrage
00:23:30,00:23:35,league and they did all of the posters and placards and christmas cards for suffrage events
00:23:35,00:23:41,one of them that she did in particular was the mud march in 1907 this was the largest ever march
00:23:41,00:23:45,for women's suffrage they brought people in from all the different towns of the uk and they all
00:23:45,00:23:50,had banners and so if you were from bolton you would have like a banner with something to do with
00:23:50,00:23:54,bolton in it like a pasty or something i don't know but it would be like from each place it would
00:23:54,00:23:59,be something to do with them and she designed all of these stained glass artists and in the palace
00:23:59,00:24:06,of westminster um window number four has a stained glass of the mud march which is what she did all
00:24:06,00:24:12,of the banners for so it kind of comes around in a nice circle that's cool isn't it and then and on
00:24:12,00:24:17,the window is there an individual little bit of stained glass of all of the banners no it's just
00:24:17,00:24:22,like a general kind of picture of the mud march because it was really muddy that day and they
00:24:22,00:24:26,were they went through i don't know like st james's and stuff but it was really really muddy and
00:24:26,00:24:31,all the pictures in the newspapers were of all these muddy angry stuff tragically they didn't
00:24:31,00:24:38,have jet engine technology to drive them out there's west from mr abbey obviously has a lot
00:24:38,00:24:44,of stained glass windows as well there's loads when we're talking central london and um it has a
00:24:44,00:24:50,recent one that has been added a few years back by can anyone guess an artist an artist um tracy
00:24:50,00:24:56,ermin no uh but like a good guess that's as good a guess as any i know what those stains would have
00:24:56,00:25:05,been made of it was all brown wasn't it yeah um demianhurst no so david gunter von hargan's
00:25:05,00:25:11,no that would have been i know someone flayed you know so lots of pinks and reds what about um who
00:25:11,00:25:16,is the guy who did the angel of the north oh yeah um what's he called his name's antony gormley antony
00:25:16,00:25:21,gormley he got his face because he's in everything that he does right is he so he's a big picture of
00:25:21,00:25:25,his face in west minster abbey oh great i did but no yeah the great idea was it gormley
00:25:25,00:25:31,well i just said no okay great great um more artists who's that guy who did all the cartoony
00:25:31,00:25:39,stuff roll harris with all the colors and roll harris they brought him back into the game
00:25:40,00:25:47,uh who did cartoons oh and who did the cans oh andy warhol andy warhol andy warhol no this
00:25:47,00:25:51,is just a couple of years ago so he's all right okay just a couple of years ago yeah a couple of
00:25:51,00:25:55,years ago an artist we can get this only a modern you'll be canon from art attack yeah oh it's a
00:25:55,00:26:01,great idea no thanksy oh who some people think says you'll be canon exactly that's why i thought of
00:26:01,00:26:09,it yeah right so no no okay and a modern artist is not banksy or me yeah is it someone who's who's
00:26:09,00:26:12,says they're an artist like ronnie word from the rolling stones who does paint in his spare time
00:26:12,00:26:17,technically he looks great all right yeah oh thick Reeves oh that would be very cool as well or
00:26:17,00:26:23,grace and perry or yeah no grace and perry uh no i've already just said that wasn't great oh is it
00:26:23,00:26:31,harry valenak the greatest um no it's not um dan i actually do need i do a class tonight well
00:26:31,00:26:37,i was i've been ready to tell it a while ago detective harkett is worried insist on cracking
00:26:37,00:26:46,the case okay guys 12 more guesses each okay and then i have to move us on i'm begging you please
00:26:46,00:26:51,stop put these guys out of them literally i don't think it might be just because we've gone this far
00:26:51,00:27:02,i'm gonna give you the initials great dh david hockney yes david hockney oh my god that's so
00:27:02,00:27:06,predictable did he do it on his ipad because that's why he does these yes he did did he yeah so it's
00:27:06,00:27:12,called the queen's window it's 28 feet by 12 feet and it looks jeck when i saw it i was like my god
00:27:12,00:27:17,it looks like someone's done that on their phone and it kind of turns out he has and he designed it
00:27:17,00:27:21,certainly find it in that's what i'm wearing i've just i actually read about this in my research
00:27:21,00:27:30,oh my god so you do this already to save an hour of everyone's time oh that's good yeah so he he
00:27:30,00:27:36,and he didn't even really come over to do it he sent over the drawing sat over the phone for a
00:27:36,00:27:40,bit he was on the toilet like have you guys seen like the david hockney's he does on his ipad yeah
00:27:40,00:27:44,like i'm sure they're great works of art they genuinely look like they've been done by children
00:27:44,00:27:48,and this looks no different really i'd love to see this in person just to see if it's a bit more
00:27:48,00:27:52,vibrant but when you see a photo of it it looks like i'm a big fan of hockney but yeah yeah i know
00:27:52,00:27:58,but i agree these ipad drawings are very much they look quite uh microsoft word kind of you
00:27:58,00:28:03,know or like microsoft art microsoft paint microsoft paint not work it's quite impressive to
00:28:03,00:28:17,her to microsoft work okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact my fact this week
00:28:17,00:28:25,is that hard rock cafe is owned globally by a group of native americans so weird this is pretty
00:28:25,00:28:33,incredible this is the seminal tribe uh they're in florida and um back in 2006 i believe it was
00:28:33,00:28:39,they bought for nine hundred and sixty five million dollars the entire group of hard rock
00:28:39,00:28:45,cafe so that's all the cafes it's the hotels it's the casinos and they are now the owners
00:28:45,00:28:51,not only of hard rock cafe but this group of native americans are also the owners of the greatest
00:28:51,00:28:57,collection of rock and roll memorabilia in the world so they have been buying up things like
00:28:57,00:29:04,casinos and hotels ever since the late 1970s and this purchase is just part of their catalog
00:29:04,00:29:10,of ever-growing business ventures and the seminal tribe uh it's worth putting into context who
00:29:10,00:29:17,they are they came into existence properly in the 1950s and what it was was a disparate group
00:29:17,00:29:22,of native americans that feels late it was very late they've i mean you know the the peoples that make
00:29:22,00:29:29,up the the group with this name of seminal they've been around 12 000 years in america and they were
00:29:29,00:29:34,all little groups of uh native american tribes that were sort of being pushed out further away
00:29:34,00:29:39,by white people coming into america and they made a decision to sort of form together and sort of
00:29:39,00:29:45,create a body where you officially would become the seminal like a supergroup yes yeah like cream
00:29:45,00:29:49,they are like the traveling wilburys yeah and actually there's a lot of traveling wilburys and
00:29:49,00:29:56,cream memorabilia in our country as a sort of solidarity the seminal people though of course
00:29:56,00:30:01,you know they've been around for a very very long time that's not a new name the seminal tribe that
00:30:01,00:30:06,was set up in 1957 was a collection of other tribes coming together and banding under that name
00:30:06,00:30:11,and they they basically the the claim on the seminal tribe website is that they are the only
00:30:11,00:30:18,people who never surrendered to the white invaders basically yeah and um that was true of the seminal
00:30:18,00:30:23,people in the 19th century they had the seminal wars which were a massive deal in the us throughout
00:30:23,00:30:28,the 19th century i think there were three big seminal wars and it was this thing where presidents
00:30:28,00:30:34,like andrew jackson very famous for persecuting native americans and others kind of went to war
00:30:34,00:30:37,with them and tried to force them west because obviously they suddenly wanted all the eastern
00:30:37,00:30:41,land so forced loads of them west but a bunch of the seminal people rather than being forced out of
00:30:41,00:30:47,florida where they wanted to be kind of retreated into the everglade marshes yeah the seminal
00:30:47,00:30:52,traditions i read that there are four particular seminal traditions which are sewing patchwork
00:30:52,00:30:56,building chickies which are small wooden houses on stilts kind of traditional structures and
00:30:56,00:31:02,bidding on big multi national businesses the fourth one is wrestling alligators oh yes that's
00:31:02,00:31:07,it i just wonder if it's like sewing patchwork building small wooden structures and wrestling
00:31:07,00:31:11,alligators that's the hardest of the badges to get when you're in seminal high scouts isn't it
00:31:11,00:31:16,i just feel like there might be some kind of sorting hat procedure as a young seminal
00:31:17,00:31:23,alligators can i put the hat on again please should we talk about hard rock cafe so it was
00:31:23,00:31:28,started by peter mortin and another guy called isaac tigaret i believe that's how you pronounce
00:31:28,00:31:35,his name and isaac tigaret clearly a massive rock and roll fan actually married the first wife of
00:31:35,00:31:42,ringo star not moraine moraine he married moraine someone's read this fact i just know but i just
00:31:42,00:31:48,know that ring goes marital history i think if i'd known that before i would have remembered
00:31:48,00:31:52,his first wife was called moraine that's the kind of you know it's a more usual name yeah isn't it
00:31:52,00:31:57,yeah moraine starkey so moraine um and they broke up because she had an affair with george
00:31:57,00:32:03,harrison huge scandal wait ringo and moraine or no ringo and moraine broke out when when she was
00:32:03,00:32:08,found crumbs with george harrison yeah like uh so that's that's just a bit goss for you guys there
00:32:08,00:32:18,and are you saying because you say he's clearly a massive breaking news what a scoop a lot of the
00:32:18,00:32:23,memorabilia yeah it's not it's not all hard rock as in i think of hard rock as being even harder than
00:32:23,00:32:27,normal rock yeah like slipknot or something right right and it's not they don't have a lot of kind
00:32:27,00:32:32,of death metal or doom drone based right and i think people would be less willing to eat in their
00:32:32,00:32:38,restaurants i certainly would if they did just dead rats yeah cradle of filth is playing out of
00:32:38,00:32:44,the sound system you're right you're right but wings paul mccartney's band wings debuted at the
00:32:44,00:32:48,london branch the original branch of the hard rock cafe yeah probably what can you get as a
00:32:48,00:32:57,starter at hard rock cafe the paul mccartney one waitress says that when they did debut they
00:32:57,00:33:01,all the waiting staff put cotton wool in their ears so that they could keep the night out while
00:33:01,00:33:06,they serve people well this this waitress who said this is a waitress you can and she still
00:33:06,00:33:10,works it so i walked past it on the way to the qi office today i walked past the hard rock just
00:33:10,00:33:16,i just i want to see this this was open in 1971 this was the the landmark spot where it was opened
00:33:16,00:33:22,and when they opened they had a waitress working there who is called reeta gilligan and she has an
00:33:22,00:33:28,mbe she still works there she's seriously fun isn't she yeah um and has such good goss because
00:33:28,00:33:32,i didn't quite realize that every musical celebrity you've ever heard of is eating in
00:33:32,00:33:37,hard rock cafes is this in your contract when you join a band so you know she says um she actually
00:33:37,00:33:42,said i've served the beetles the stones freddy mercury eric clapton pete townsend and then she
00:33:42,00:33:47,says take that and the carnebis which seems like an incredibly steep decline i've actually never
00:33:47,00:33:51,heard of the i haven't either and i looked them up and they don't even have a bloody wikipedia page
00:33:52,00:33:57,i think she's probably pushing a band that she's managing i wonder if that might be a
00:33:57,00:34:01,misprint for the cranberries i wondered if it was the cranberries but then there is a band
00:34:01,00:34:04,called the carnebis that have played in the hard rock cafe i think it's part of their brand so
00:34:04,00:34:08,she's trying to slip them in maybe with these big names and she supposedly turned down posh spice
00:34:08,00:34:13,for a job reeta when she came in i love the story that's the way you tell it i don't know the full
00:34:13,00:34:16,story well it's it's there's not much more to it than that but she reeta gilligan claims that victoria
00:34:16,00:34:23,beckham applied for a job at the hard rock cafe as a hostess or whatever shortly before the spice
00:34:23,00:34:28,girls took off but that she was rejected for being too quiet yeah and so she went and got a job at
00:34:28,00:34:34,bill wyman's restaurant sticky fingers instead but it's she was trying to know what was named after
00:34:34,00:34:38,a rollingstone's album yeah i just didn't know i would have chosen one of the others i don't know
00:34:38,00:34:44,any of the other albums but i reckon all of them will be a better name yeah they would in association
00:34:44,00:34:48,with they've got an album called beggars banquet that's quite a fun cool name for a restaurant
00:34:48,00:34:52,but no sticky fingers yeah but this is the weird thing so there's reeta gilligan who worked there
00:34:52,00:34:57,since 1971 and it was still there a couple of years ago there's also another waitress from the
00:34:57,00:35:02,hard rock cafe called dealia lee's who worked there for 48 years and she got a job two weeks
00:35:02,00:35:07,after it opened and she's 80 now and she still does two days a week so i think there are two of them
00:35:07,00:35:14,who have been there for 50 years this is like bloody qi there's no turnover of staff that reminds
00:35:14,00:35:21,me there was um i only half remember this story but at the savoy um there was two very famous um
00:35:21,00:35:28,waiters who work behind the bar and they two women and they both worked there for about 60 years or
00:35:28,00:35:34,something and they knew everyone um but they stopped talking after about five years of working
00:35:34,00:35:38,together and then they just stopped being friends and then they didn't really see each other because
00:35:38,00:35:43,they were on shifts but literally didn't talk for like 30 years that's so funny that's over all we
00:35:43,00:35:45,have a similar thing on the podcast don't because actually if you listen carefully back to all the
00:35:45,00:35:49,episodes you notice that anna and dan have not said anything to each other on the show
00:35:49,00:35:53,for the last five years if you notice that when we were doing that guessing game and it wasn't
00:35:53,00:35:59,giving any yeah there was only me and andy shouting for half an hour it's long-term beam
00:35:59,00:36:05,listen out for that um rita by the way she got her job in 1971 and it happened when her husband
00:36:05,00:36:11,was reading the evening standard and he shouted to her the looking for people like you and she
00:36:11,00:36:19,went oh are they and she went over and the advert read older women wanted late 30s 40s and 50s and
00:36:19,00:36:25,she was only 29 when she left oh that's such a horrible thing to say did she have to put
00:36:25,00:36:31,talcum powder in her hair and well actually when she went there she said um you know i'm looking
00:36:31,00:36:36,for a job and one of the co-founders peter martin said no you know you're too young you're too young
00:36:36,00:36:40,for this and she said i'm the best you're gonna get so you better take me and he said yeah cool
00:36:40,00:36:47,you're hired do we is it known why they wanted women in the late 30s 40s 50s and so on i suspect
00:36:47,00:36:52,that what they were trying to do is they were trying to get american diners in the uk because
00:36:52,00:36:55,there wasn't anywhere that you there was no McDonald's there and there was nothing like that they
00:36:55,00:36:59,wanted to have a place where you could get burgers and stuff like that and if there's that cliche of
00:36:59,00:37:05,being sold by sort of a 65 year old yeah like a happy days kind of thing yeah you got to any diner
00:37:05,00:37:10,in america and you you have breakfast there there's always a woman who's you know in her you know
00:37:10,00:37:15,middle age coming around with a with a pot of coffee and tipping you up and topping you up and
00:37:15,00:37:21,i think that was just the cliche right tipping you up and topping you up she inverts you on your
00:37:21,00:37:30,chair they're very strong isaac tigrit was a devotee of an indian guru back when those indian
00:37:30,00:37:36,gurus were a big deal um and this one was satya saibaba and so yeah the chain was founded by him
00:37:36,00:37:39,and he obviously brought the spiritual side to hard rock cafe and then this guy called peter
00:37:39,00:37:46,morton who um was the son of a founder of morton steakhouse who brought the steak side um so the
00:37:46,00:37:51,motto of the hard rock cafe is love all serve all apparently there must be something like a tennis
00:37:51,00:37:58,term doesn't it you never say serve all in serve all serve all it's like what you might say just
00:37:58,00:38:02,before the game starts yeah i know have you not seen the serve all bit of a tennis match where
00:38:02,00:38:06,everyone gets to serve at the same time it's chaotic but it's the points rack up actually
00:38:06,00:38:11,happens before right they do a warm-up where they both serve at each other yeah right technically
00:38:11,00:38:16,known as the love all serve all but yeah of course it was originally a chain of tennis courts that
00:38:16,00:38:22,would be such an improvement i mean like cricket has had the t20 revolution i think tennis needs a
00:38:22,00:38:28,like a jeopardy round where everyone can serve as many balls as they can at the same time and you
00:38:28,00:38:32,just have to stand there and if it hits you in the post then that's part of the game doesn't
00:38:32,00:38:40,yeah that's 40 love anyway this guy who um inspired hard rock cafe this saibaba
00:38:40,00:38:45,he was quite interesting i didn't know about him he was a massive deal in india 500 000 people
00:38:45,00:38:51,went to his funeral sachin tendulkar cancelled his birthday really that year that he died wait
00:38:51,00:38:57,sorry he he cancelled his birthday he's now actually one year younger than everyone thinks
00:38:57,00:39:03,he is that just feels like an anti-aging prick by sachin tendulkar oh no he's sneaky right what
00:39:03,00:39:07,what's he gonna be cancelled well he cancelled his birthday party he didn't celebrate a hard rock cafe
00:39:10,00:39:14,so he uninvited everyone he didn't have a cake he didn't have a party he didn't have a party he
00:39:14,00:39:18,didn't even celebrate no one even sung to him uh because he was so sad about this spiritualist dying
00:39:18,00:39:24,oh gosh and he claimed that he was a proper god like omnipotent omniscient and the he did
00:39:24,00:39:30,loads of amazing tricks apparently and he got some some examples for us there was a terminally ill
00:39:30,00:39:37,woman uh she needed treatment it could only be given in japan and so she went and visited this guy
00:39:37,00:39:41,and said i need this treatment to save my life can only be treated in japan and he pointed at a door
00:39:41,00:39:45,and said walk through that door and she walked through the door with a travel agent
00:39:45,00:39:54,i'm so glad i'm so glad i set my office up next to this branch of trail finders
00:39:54,00:40:02,what happened that was on 10 times and it was japan what she walked through the door and she was in
00:40:02,00:40:08,japan yeah cool wow don't say cool like you believe it though it's a cool story it's a really cool
00:40:08,00:40:14,story it's like narnia for the modern day yes um isn't that amazing why to claim and yeah and then
00:40:14,00:40:19,what happened well that's sort of where his tale ends you assume i suppose she was in japan and
00:40:19,00:40:23,she's in japan well how's he supposed to know what happened that's true he can't go through the door
00:40:23,00:40:29,he's not okay so he didn't leave the door open he just said he closed the door otherwise everyone
00:40:29,00:40:35,leaves india and goes to japan so this woman who's quite ill has just ended up in i presume
00:40:35,00:40:40,around a bit of japan i'm not because the door already led to japan it can't have led to the
00:40:40,00:40:44,specific clinic she needs she's now trapped in a foreign country she's now illiterate because
00:40:44,00:40:49,japanese is a different alphabet yeah yeah it's an incredibly upsetting and busy place she's very
00:40:49,00:40:53,he hasn't come off brilliantly in this story he doesn't have a rail car because you can get rail
00:40:53,00:40:57,cards in japan that help you go around foreigners you can get them especially but she's now she's
00:40:57,00:41:01,wanted by the authorities because she's not in the country legally she hasn't got a visa or
00:41:01,00:41:05,whatever you get here who's going to believe that so that's why you've got to be very careful what
00:41:05,00:41:18,you wish for oh it's one of those stories okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that
00:41:18,00:41:24,is james okay my fact this week is that when female seals have sex they have a special muscle
00:41:24,00:41:30,in their vagina that can clamp around their partner to stop seawater from getting in
00:41:30,00:41:35,that means that in order to create a seal they first need to create a seal
00:41:35,00:41:44,superb fabulous oh god is it sex sex does always create a seal really doesn't it
00:41:44,00:41:50,but do these ones plant particularly hard yeah these are like proper muscles in the vagina it
00:41:50,00:41:56,feels like a wise saying that the seals have doesn't it yes to create a seal you must first
00:41:56,00:42:03,create a seal yes you know the seals and the seals and what would happen if they didn't
00:42:03,00:42:12,have the seal would they flood sorry tragic they have to get a jet engine to blow all the water
00:42:12,00:42:18,out of them let me quickly say where i got this so i was honestly this was a speculative search
00:42:18,00:42:24,that king i wonder if seals have seals and i found this paper called reproductive biology of seals
00:42:24,00:42:30,by shannon atkinson where they describe this but basically it's just to stop seawater getting in
00:42:30,00:42:35,pebbles getting in and if you think about they basically have a very similar reproductive system
00:42:35,00:42:42,to humans so they you know you know vagina cervix uterus blah blah blah and if you look at a whale
00:42:42,00:42:49,for instance they have quite a long sort of maze like structure in between that kind of stops anything
00:42:49,00:42:55,from getting in there yeah but they have like basically like the human reproductive system
00:42:55,00:42:58,it's pretty much straight up and straight down so they need something to stop stuff from getting in
00:42:58,00:43:03,there and there are a few different ways of doing this but the way they do it is with these folds
00:43:03,00:43:07,which have special muscles in and the muscles can clamp around the penis so that when the seaman gets
00:43:07,00:43:16,in no sea gets it i feel like i feel like you're feeling you're pushing it a bit
00:43:16,00:43:22,the seals are great and we should talk about seals oh they're amazing hardly ever talked
00:43:22,00:43:26,about them so let's talk about them yeah you know they they basically don't need eyes or ears
00:43:26,00:43:32,really there's their whiskers phenomenal whiskers that seals have and they do have eyes and ears
00:43:32,00:43:36,they have eyes and ears and they use them but they didn't have them they could basically operate
00:43:36,00:43:42,because yeah their whiskers are so unbelievably sensitive oh yeah all right so let's say we know
00:43:42,00:43:47,that cats use their whiskers or rats use their whiskers they've got 200 nerve endings on their
00:43:47,00:43:53,on their whiskers cats and rats right a seal has about 1500 basically what it means is that if they
00:43:53,00:43:57,were swimming through the ocean and they couldn't see or hear and they needed to work out where the
00:43:57,00:44:02,precise location of the fish is that they wanted to eat they could just use their whiskers to feel
00:44:02,00:44:07,the vibrations the little movements of the water they're being pushed through the whisker and and
00:44:07,00:44:16,pinpoint it and get to the nose and the other thing is they can tell if a fish has gone past 30
00:44:16,00:44:22,seconds ago they can tell by the vibration in the water where the fish was using their whiskers
00:44:22,00:44:27,and they go oh there was a fish here 30 seconds ago and they can follow the trail of where the
00:44:27,00:44:31,fish has been and then with their whiskers and go down and the other thing is not just a whiskers
00:44:31,00:44:37,like a cat which is where the nose is they can also do this with their eyebrows because they have
00:44:37,00:44:42,whiskers on their eyebrows so they can hunt fish with their eyebrows that's pretty amazing that's
00:44:42,00:44:49,that's also why old men are so good at fishing isn't it there was an experiment on the whiskers it
00:44:49,00:44:54,was by the University of Rostock and it was about how harbour seals they find flatfish so flatfish
00:44:54,00:44:59,hide under the sand so they're not very visible but there are these tiny movements of their gills
00:44:59,00:45:03,because they're breathing in and out very slightly and the seals use their whiskers to find the
00:45:03,00:45:08,flatfish and eat them for the experiment the scientists found some seals they created some
00:45:08,00:45:14,fake flatfish under the water to be the bait and then they blindfolded the seals yeah how cool that
00:45:14,00:45:18,is the better way of doing it because the first person probably to do most of this work was a
00:45:18,00:45:23,woman called Dean Renov and she did it by snipping off the whiskers of the seals and you won't be
00:45:23,00:45:28,able to do that now but this was in the 70s and she was really into her she loved her seals and
00:45:28,00:45:33,stuff like you know obviously now to modern modern years it sounds quite bad but she really
00:45:33,00:45:39,loved her seals apparently you could see the seal walking behind her in the University when she was
00:45:39,00:45:44,walking to her lectures and stuff I was listening to a really good podcast which interviews someone
00:45:44,00:45:49,called Dr Alex Milne who has such a great job she's a sensory biologist specializing in pinniped
00:45:49,00:45:55,whiskers um and she was saying we don't know this but seal whiskers are curly they've got like wavy
00:45:55,00:46:00,hair as opposed to sea lions and walruses who are sort of the the other pinnipeds um and we think
00:46:00,00:46:05,that is to sense the undulations of the water though we're not totally sure but anyway she did
00:46:05,00:46:10,this um she's done lots of experiments with um seal you know playing with seals and seeing how
00:46:10,00:46:16,sensitive their whiskers are and playing with them balancing balls on their whiskers and so you get
00:46:16,00:46:20,balls of lots of different sizes and then you watch what their whiskers do so if you've got a
00:46:20,00:46:24,small ball and then a big ball which you think involves you know it points its whiskers towards
00:46:24,00:46:30,them to balance um and then which would use more whiskers the big ball more area and that's incorrect
00:46:30,00:46:36,oh yeah the little ball that there you go dance dance got it dance how did you learn that out
00:46:36,00:46:40,you've got to use the method of wait for people to answer wrongly and they get in there I tried
00:46:40,00:46:47,to do that with the artist but we didn't go through every artist in the world um it's so it's the same
00:46:47,00:46:52,physics which means it's easier to spin a big ball around on one finger right then balance the
00:46:52,00:46:57,little ball um and so the smaller the prey the more whiskers it takes so if they're chasing
00:46:57,00:47:01,prey in the water the same thing happens they focus more whiskers towards a smaller prey to
00:47:01,00:47:06,try and pinpoint where it is because I know you're looking a bit skeptical Andy but you see basketball
00:47:06,00:47:10,players spinning a ball on the finger you don't see table tennis players doing it to you no I don't
00:47:10,00:47:20,know I've never seen that thank you James but balls get heavier the bigger they get yeah to a
00:47:20,00:47:24,certain extent like once they're so big they crush your fingers then you have to yeah a basket ball
00:47:24,00:47:29,versus a ping pong ball for example would I would feel require more whiskers purely for the weight
00:47:29,00:47:35,of it so we must be talking beach balls they use their nose as well um but I think um it is I think
00:47:35,00:47:39,the the whiskers are sort of for balance but yeah I think it probably is beach balls so those are
00:47:39,00:47:43,the ones with the balls on their noses aren't they yeah yeah they always have a ball on their nose
00:47:43,00:47:48,yeah yeah and dolphins do as well often yeah it's not a vintage dolphin thing though no I think when
00:47:48,00:47:52,I think of dolphins I think of dolphins jumping through hoops yeah yeah yeah being really clever
00:47:52,00:47:56,yeah playing chess but they are the only two animals so it's weird that you say it's not
00:47:56,00:48:02,a vintage dolphin thing when it's so clearly no it's such a seal thing they'd have a ball on
00:48:02,00:48:06,your nose yeah absolutely I agree I don't think it's a dolphin thing at all it is no it is a dolphin
00:48:06,00:48:13,thing well I think it's on its way out they gave people TB tuberculosis in South America
00:48:13,00:48:18,is believed to come from seals I know this sounds like elephants built the roads in Cornwall
00:48:18,00:48:24,I appreciate it sounds like that but no there's a there's a bioarchaeologist never heard of that
00:48:24,00:48:28,job before either called Jane Buikstra I hope I'm pronouncing it right from the Colombian
00:48:28,00:48:35,Institute of Anthropology and History because TB got to South America with colonists 500 years ago
00:48:35,00:48:39,but there have been bones found much older which also have TB and it doesn't look like they came
00:48:39,00:48:43,"over with the original humans you know 10,000 years ago whenever it was because it spreads from"
00:48:43,00:48:48,south to north not north to south which is not the order you would expect it to go in right hang on
00:48:48,00:48:52,sorry I'm confused so the colonists brought the TB over but there are also seals that are older
00:48:52,00:48:58,with TB but there was pre-existing human TB found in samples in bones and if it had come with the
00:48:58,00:49:02,"original arrivers 10,000 years ago it would have gone from north to south but it didn't"
00:49:02,00:49:08,went south to north and so the theory is that it came over with seals which might have been you
00:49:08,00:49:14,know eaten hunted and eaten and the bacteria survived there because TB arose in Africa
00:49:14,00:49:18,interesting and somehow seals got it is the theory took it to South America gave it to humans
00:49:18,00:49:22,and then they met on the way down presumably the humans coming down met the TB on the way up
00:49:22,00:49:27,an awkward dinner yeah but sometimes zookeepers these days get TB from the seals in their care
00:49:27,00:49:32,doesn't always happen they need to not get so close don't they have you guys seen Andre the seal
00:49:33,00:49:38,no no okay seriously yeah seriously right no I kind of thought everyone watched that as a kid
00:49:38,00:49:45,oh it was a TV show it was a film oh no no I've not seen it okay well this I think I saw the play
00:49:45,00:49:51,yeah I was just shot down on animal rights grounds within a couple of days wasn't it
00:49:51,00:49:56,did they mention the vagina thing yeah it was about that was weird it was you and it was marketed
00:49:56,00:50:01,to children um well Andre the seal for those who've seen it it was a very famous film in our
00:50:01,00:50:06,childhoods for a brief period of time we all watched it it wasn't very good and it was the true story
00:50:06,00:50:10,of a seal who befriended a tree surgeon which you wouldn't have thought their lives could lie
00:50:10,00:50:18,better cricket match yeah that's a hell of a meat cute you've got to enter there um yeah I don't
00:50:18,00:50:23,know how maybe the forest was flooded anyway seal befriended a tree surgeon we're like in the
00:50:23,00:50:28,pitch me see they go so this is the story the seal meets this guy we've seen that a million times
00:50:28,00:50:38,wait wait wait the guy's a tree surgeon keep talking um true befriended this seal and it's a true story
00:50:38,00:50:44,between 1961 and 1986 yeah so this guy was also into diving met this seal it had been abandoned
00:50:44,00:50:48,by its mother and so it took it in and sort of raised it for a few weeks thinking it would return
00:50:48,00:50:53,to the wild tried to return it to the wild and the seal loved him so much he just stuck around
00:50:53,00:50:59,stuck around for like 25 years but what like in the bath or don't they need lots of water it would
00:50:59,00:51:02,come up to his house and hang out in his house in the day and then flop back down to the harbour
00:51:02,00:51:08,and then he'd go swimming with it wow and it wintered in this aquarium anyway they made this film
00:51:08,00:51:13,about it and do you know what species of seal they used in the film uh seal no there's a there's an
00:51:13,00:51:18,elephant seal uh what's the name of the film down what were you gonna say no because I realized I
00:51:18,00:51:22,was saying not while saying a sea lion you're absolutely correct you're kidding they used a
00:51:22,00:51:28,not seal and how bullshit is that as if they couldn't be bothered to find a seal and they do
00:51:28,00:51:32,look quite similar it's all in the ears but anyway they the filmmakers wanted to coordinate with the
00:51:32,00:51:38,aquarium who raised andre in the winters and the aquarium refused bigger I think sea lions right
00:51:38,00:51:43,I think they're both they are bigger yeah although you can get huge seals elephant seals are massive
00:51:43,00:51:50,the key apparent is that um seals have um ears that are just holes I think yeah seals are kind of
00:51:50,00:51:55,more roundheaded so seals can remember what they have just done and repeat it on command
00:51:55,00:52:03,as long as you ask them within 18 seconds of the image I'll think okay I set a cup of tea
00:52:03,00:52:10,this is unusual because not many people can do this right this is a study I think most people
00:52:10,00:52:18,can do this but well I'm quite content so this is um a study by simian smiel at the university
00:52:18,00:52:24,of southern Denmark in Odent and basically they asked them to do one thing and then they asked
00:52:24,00:52:30,them to do it again after 18 seconds but they could still do the thing they said repeat they
00:52:30,00:52:35,didn't say do this thing again they said repeat and they managed to do it okay and what was quite
00:52:35,00:52:40,interesting is the guy in charge of it smiel said that this is really they've did a really good job
00:52:40,00:52:46,because what you have to understand is that this is a very very repetitive study and even the human
00:52:46,00:52:49,trainers and assistants had a hard time remembering what they had just asked
00:52:49,00:52:55,you end up with a human as they were just staring at each other
00:52:55,00:53:08,that's it that's all of our facts thank you so much for listening if you'd like to get in contact
