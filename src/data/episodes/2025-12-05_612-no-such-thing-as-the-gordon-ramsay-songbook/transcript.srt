00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,120
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,760
 of No Six Things, a fish where we decided

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,560
 that we would help a new up and coming comedian

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,840
 who is our guest today, Andy, can you remember their name?

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,960
 I can't quite recall.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,540
 - This is called Michael Paulin.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,760
 - Michael Paulin.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
 - Yeah, that's what I'm reading here.

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,960
 Oh, I'm sorry, it's always Michael Paulin.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,280
 It's Michael Paulin.

12
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,400
 - It's only bloody Michael Paulin.

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,080
 - From everything, from Monty Python onwards.

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,560
 We are so excited to have Michael on the show.

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,000
 We hope you'll enjoy this one.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,240
 We certainly did recording, as you're about to hear.

17
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,680
 He's amazing, it was such fun episode.

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,720
 - He has a new book out.

19
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,320
 A lot of the facts that you hear at the start of this podcast

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,840
 will be recounted in that book,

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,880
 but there is so much more besides,

22
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,160
 and that book is called, simply.

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,840
 - Michael Paulin in Venezuela.

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,400
 - Michael Paulin in Venezuela does exactly what it says

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,280
 on the ten, it's a brilliant book.

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
 Dan has read it from cover to cover multiple times.

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,520
 And he tells us that it's an incredible book,

28
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,960
 so you should definitely go out and get that.

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,080
 And if you wanna know anything more about Michael,

30
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,240
 then go to his website, it's MichaelPalin.com.

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,000
 And there's so much on there.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,440
 Like you just can't, you'll be on there for weeks.

33
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,360
 - Absolutely.

34
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
 And we have Club Fish,

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,480
 which is our super secret, private, exclusive, extraordinary,

36
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,560
 members club.

 You can get bonus bits of Fish.

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,160
 There is a longer version of the episode

40
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,800

 You can get FishXL.

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,640
 There's so much other stuff and goodies on there.

45
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,960
 - But in the meantime, please do enjoy this episode

46
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,360
 of "No Six Things Affish" with Michael Palin.

47
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,440
 And why not check out some of the other stuff he's done?

48
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,800
 I've heard it's quite good.

49
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,640
 - I think so.

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,480
 I think so.

51
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,520
 - I'm with the podcast.

52
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,360
 - I'm with the show.

53
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,360
 (dramatic music)

54
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,560
 (upbeat music)

55
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

56
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,320
 (upbeat music)

57
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,760
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

58
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,400
 of "No Such Thing As A Fish"

59
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,080
 a weekly podcast coming to you

60
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,480
 from the QI offices in Hobern.

61
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

62
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,880
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

63
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,600
 James Harkin, and Michael Palin.

64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,640
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

65
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,360
 and in no particular order, here we go.

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Michael.

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,360
 - In the Venezuelan Andes, there's a town called Millida,

69
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,800
 and it has two entries in the Guinness Book of Records.

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,760
 One is the tallest cable car in the world,

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,520
 and the other is the El Adarier Colomoto,

72
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,400
 which is an ice cream parlor,

73
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,640
 which has the record number of ice cream varieties on sale.

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,640
 860, including avocado, garlic, and trout.

75
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,800
 (laughing)

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,640
 A trout ice cream, please.

77
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
 - Oh, Daddy, can I have a trout ice cream parlor?

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,360
 - Mushroom and wine, gyrkin, chili, shellfishes of some type.

79
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,200
 You went to Venezuela, have you been to this town

80
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,320
 and to this specific ice cream parlor?

81
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,000
 - Well, I haven't been to the ice cream parlor.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
 We were doing various other things.

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
 I haven't been up on the amazing cable car,

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
 which takes you right up in the mountains.

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
 But I know where it was, the El Adarier Colomoto.

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,080
 And it's obviously fallen on hard times.

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,960
 I think it may have been superseded now

88
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,240
 by some other, probably in China.

89
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,120
 There's another place that's got more.

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,200
 - I really like the sound of,

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
 is it, I'm going to pronounce it wrong.

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,600
 Pabellon Crio, which is a traditional food,

93
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 but it's five different kinds of ice cream, beef rice,

94
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,520
 plantain, cheese, and black beans, so five little scoops

95
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,280
 with a scoop of chili on top.

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,840
 - Well, on the flip side, they've got Viagra Hope,

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,720
 which is blue like the pills.

98
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,080
 So maybe, maybe those two are talking about it.

99
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,000
 - Does it have any sort of natural ingredients, perhaps?

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,240
 - It's only got honey and something else natural they don't use.

101
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,280
 - Oh, we know that everything is an aphrodisiac,

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
 really, isn't it?

103
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,560
 That's why they claim honey's an aphrodisiac for sure.

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
 - Kippers, are they the only things?

105
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,000
 - Kippers, no, they're not an aphrodisiac.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
 - Are they not, right?

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
 - I don't think so.

108
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,040
 - I've had a lot of kippers in my time.

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,080
 - Yeah, no, my legs are man, man, crossed.

110
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,240
 - I think you're right, Michael, that it's now,

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,600
 it's now not selling 800 flavours anymore.

112
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,520
 This was the glory days, but when the original owner

113
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,440
 was still trading, I think, and it's also been overtaken,

114
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,400
 not by somewhere in China.

115
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,280
 It's actually meag and muts craft creamery in Colorado.

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
 - Oh, god, really?

117
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,360
 - Well, how many do they do, and do they do garlic?

118
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,000
 - I think it's something, they must have more than 860,

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 so I can't imagine garlic isn't in there.

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,480
 - If you walked in and you said,

121
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,680
 "Do you have raspberry ripple?"

122
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,640
 And they go, "Oh, damn it!"

123
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,520
 - Exactly, chocolate, oh.

124
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,600
 - But you did do the cable car.

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
 - Yeah.

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,920
 - Which sounds, I mean, it looks,

127
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,000
 I mean, I don't really like cable cars

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
 where you're floating over a bit,

129
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,400
 but it looks terrifying.

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,040
 - I don't really, and they're big, gondolas,

131
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,080
 and they take about 40 people.

132
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,640
 So not only are you hanging from these very slim cables,

133
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,240
 you've got 40 very large, you know,

134
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,360
 Venezuela's also traveling with you.

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,520
 But the thing is, it's not a continuous ride.

136
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,040
 You have to stop at various places

137
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,840
 and get into another one, and so there are four stages.

138
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
 But it is, I mean, it's amazing.

139
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,760
 If you imagine, if you're a sort of geography teacher,

140
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,080
 take a class up there,

141
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,600
 and they could see all the different environments

142
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,560
 from the River Valley, with all its agriculture,

143
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,320
 and all that, and the city itself.

144
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,240
 To the very top, where it's all completely bleak,

145
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
 and you end up alongside the highest peaking

146
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,680
 of Venezuela and Andes.

147
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,520
 - It's pretty amazing.

148
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,680
 I read that chapter in your book,

149
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,400
 but in that chapter, you talk about it,

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,160
 and you say that it's an hour journey, basically,

151
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,000
 to get to the top.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 But in that time, you're traveling,

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,240
 basically half the height of Everest.

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
 So when you get to the top,

155
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,640
 the oxygen level has changed vastly,

156
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,960
 and you're all giddy, and there's all these signs

157
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,320
 in the gondola that are sort of talking about,

158
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,440
 how you feel in, how's the old ticker doing?

159
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,920
 Is it feeling okay? - Yeah, I mean, it's quite extraordinary

160
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,600
 that people get in downtown.

161
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,840
 You know, it seems like getting on a bus,

162
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,840
 or something, and it's quite warm in Merida.

163
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,680
 And you see these people like party goers,

164
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,240
 and tiny little girls, and slim dresses,

165
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,680
 sleepless dresses, and all that, and shorts skirts.

166
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,280
 And they're getting up to half-large of Everest, do you know?

167
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,320
 - I read that it was there,

168
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,080
 because originally there was a ski track there.

169
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,480
 - Oh, yeah. - There were some ski slopes,

170
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,520
 'cause there was a big old glacier there,

171
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,760
 which you could see from the city, but now it's gone.

172
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,400
 - The dusty has gone in the last two years.

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
 And they thought, well, it may return,

174
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,440
 but it's now gone for good.

175
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,760
 So there are a lot of things in the cable car saying,

176
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,320
 this is how the plant is changing,

177
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,960
 everywhere you go.

178
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,720
 And then as well, there has no snow anymore.

179
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
 - Michael, did you say,

180
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,040
 'cause I was reading about some of the amazing creatures

181
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,400
 that live, I mean, it's a huge country.

182
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,120
 It's equatorial, it's got a lot of amazing wild spaces.

183
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,880
 So there is the Marida Cable Car Frog,

184
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,320
 which you might have seen.

185
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,160
 - What?

186
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
 - What?

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,160
 - What lives in the cable car, or what?

188
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
 - It takes your tickets.

189
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 - Yeah.

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,840
 - Hello.

192
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,600
 - Oh, you call me Frog, please.

193
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,080
 - It just lives very near the stations of the cable car,

194
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,000
 and it's been found nowhere else.

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 So it's now called--

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,080
 - That's very interesting.

197
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,280
 - Is it, sorry to say, is it found at the top and the bottom?

198
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,160
 So you can imagine that like it travels from one place

199
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,360
 to the other to mate, maybe, or to my grades?

200
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,200
 - That's it.

201
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,120
 - The male's 1,000 feet to mate.

202
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
 - That's it.

203
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,040
 - You've got, I really love somebody.

204
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,600
 - Everyone's gone, they've all got their kippers ready.

205
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,080
 - Honestly, the Assembra, the great migration

206
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,840
 of the cable car, Frog, they're just all of them

207
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,160
 in one gondola, just having up, yeah.

208
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
 - Okay.

209
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,320
 - The oil bird.

210
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,400
 - Oh, I don't know if you saw that.

211
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,040
 - Yes, actually, I did hear about the oil birds.

212
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,720
 I hope it's not because in the olden days,

213
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,400
 they used to take oily birds and then use them as candles.

214
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,240
 I hope it's not that.

215
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,080
 - Yeah, I'm really, I'm really sorry to say it, James.

216
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,920
 - It is.

217
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 - They did use them as--

218
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
 - Oh, yeah, they didn't go.

219
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,720
 - They had a very high fat content,

220
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,520
 and I'm afraid it's especially the baby oil birds.

221
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
 - Oh, oh, no.

222
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,280
 - And they basically were burnt down to make oil.

223
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
 But they're an amazing animal.

224
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,800
 They're the only birds, or one of very, very few birds,

225
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
 which uses echolocation.

226
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,640
 - Yeah.

227
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
 - So we're used to that in bats,

228
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,440
 but they make a stream of high pitch calls

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,200
 and have it as they live in very dark caves,

230
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,560
 and that's how they get around.

231
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,400
 - Another animal they had in Venezuela was a guinea pig

232
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,680
 the size of a fiat 500.

233
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,960
 - Just one.

234
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,800
 - Did you see that?

235
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,520
 - Did you see that when you were there, Mike?

236
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,560
 (laughing)

237
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,520
 - I saw lots of fiat 500s.

238
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,600
 Not none of them, you know?

239
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,760
 - Did you check the whiskers?

240
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
 I didn't have fur all over the place.

242
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,560
 - I'm afraid it was many hundreds of thousands of years ago.

243
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
 We only know about them because of their teeth,

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,200
 and we've extrapolated the size.

245
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
 - Wow.

246
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,280
 - But there were 10 times the mass of the largest living rodent

247
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,120
 today.

248
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
 - Go on.

249
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,800
 - Wow, fantastic.

250
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
 - Which is the largest living rodent,

251
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,400
 also in Venezuela, is a cappibara,

252
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,320
 which is apparently the largest living rodent.

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 - Have you seen one?

254
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
 - Yeah.

255
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,000
 - Yes.

256
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,920
 - You're not very impressed.

257
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,720
 - No, they're a bit sad, really.

258
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,480
 Like, they were supposed to be a model

259
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,720
 for another kind of creature,

260
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,920
 but they didn't get the fittings.

261
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,680
 So that's pretty basic, four legs and a sort of back

262
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,600
 and a nose, but there's nothing very distinguished about them.

263
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,120
 - When you went to Peru, did you eat guinea pig?

264
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,280
 'Cause that's like a big delicacy over there,

265
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,040
 and every market they sell guinea pig and stuff.

266
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,480
 - Not knowingly.

267
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,280
 No, I mean, seriously, you don't ever know half the time.

268
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,120
 - No.

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,960
 - What you're eating.

270
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
 - Are you one when you go to all the different countries

271
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,640
 that you like to try different foods that they have

272
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,600
 and stuff, or are you not really,

273
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,440
 you'd rather have these things?

274
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,920
 - No, I like to, 'cause it's part of getting to know people

275
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,600
 and meeting people is, you know, hospitality offered

276
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,000
 has to be taken, otherwise people get to be defended.

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,560
 And also there's this feeling,

278
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,200
 oh, you're going abroad with a food at your home.

279
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,840
 - Oh, we're going to France.

280
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,680
 - Oh.

281
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,520
 (laughing)

282
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,480
 And yet the people in these countries

283
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
 don't want to poison themselves.

284
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,560
 They're not making bad food.

285
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,000
 And we're wishing they had McDonald's or something like that.

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
 They make strange ingredients sometimes,

287
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,680
 but always very, very well cooked.

288
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,160
 - I so wish you were the opposite

289
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,440
 that you would go to the ice cream shop

290
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,040
 and just go, "Vinilla, please."

291
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,880
 - Yes, yes, yes, yes.

292
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,480
 - I think I might have said this before in this show.

293
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,960
 One of my favorite Beatles facts is that

294
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,720
 when the Beatles went to India

295
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,000
 for their great, you know, spiritual awakening

296
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 and all of this, Ringo started a suitcase

297
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,280
 of baked beans with him, like a full chocoblock.

298
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,120
 - Yeah.

299
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
 - Just so he didn't run out of baked beans.

300
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
 I just, I love that.

301
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,200
 - Well, when we did around the 180 days,

302
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,120
 I remember that, the soundman, Ron,

303
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,760
 he didn't like foreign food and he'd got all these tins

304
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,680
 of canned food.

305
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,240
 We end up on a dow, you know, just very, very basic.

306
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,440
 There's no cabins in there.

307
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,320
 You all sleep on deck together.

308
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,640
 - That boat, sorry, a dow.

309
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,480
 - Yes, a dow.

310
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
 So it's a big, the old sailing boat.

311
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,480
 So they use around the African coast

312
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
 and on the Gulf, Persian Gulf and all that.

313
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,640
 So we got on the thing and, you know,

314
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,280
 comes to the evening and the guys

315
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,120
 are all fishermen from India, very, you know, not wealthy at all.

316
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,960
 And so we get our food out and they get their food out.

317
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,440
 And the first thing that gets out is a tuna

318
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,440
 from Sainsbury and it sort of comes out of the can,

319
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,640
 like a sort of oily mass.

320
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,440
 It goes boi oil and goes onto the plate

321
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,840
 and sort of wobbles there and it's sweating slightly.

322
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,280
 (laughing)

323
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
 I said, right, we're going to have that.

324
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,640
 And these guys, these wonderful guys are,

325
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,680
 the fishermen said, you know, please,

326
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,080
 I could see that some of us didn't really know that is.

327
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,320
 We're making a curry, we'll share it with you.

328
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
 And they did.

329
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,280
 And from then on, we always had what they had.

330
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,640
 You know, the tins were put to one side.

331
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,480
 - Yeah.

332
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,600
 - Did Ron stay with the tins?

333
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,320
 - Ron, you know, Ron, we threw him overboard.

334
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,640
 (laughing)

335
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,600
 The tins strapped him, maybe sank immediately.

336
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
 (laughing)

337
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,200
 - I noticed, Michael, in your book,

338
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,200
 that Venezuela is your 100th country

339
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
 that you have visited.

340
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

341
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,720
 - More or less, or you think that's--

342
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,880
 - No, I think that's right.

343
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,720
 I'm a bit of a list nerd and I kept a list.

344
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,560
 - So you've kept a list?

345
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,400
 'Cause that's what I was gonna ask.

346
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,160
 You can now do a top 100 of countries of the world

347
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 that you've visited.

348
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,360
 So where does Venezuela just off the top of your head?

349
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,240
 Where does that rank?

350
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,200
 - I was thinking about 93, really.

351
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,040
 (laughing)

352
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,880
 I'm full of positive thoughts about Venezuela at the moment.

353
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,640
 Oh, sorry, I see what you mean, sorry.

354
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,560
 - Yeah, no, try it.

355
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,400
 - Three.

356
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,720
 - Three or nine.

357
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,880
 - Wow, okay.

358
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,480
 - Yeah, sorry, math is good, that's trying to do it.

359
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,480
 - Yeah, so there was an interesting point

360
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
 about the airport when you arrived,

361
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,960
 which is, I wondered if you were aware of this.

362
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,600
 This might have stopped now, but you were paying tax

363
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
 in the airport and one of the taxes that you would pay

364
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,400
 were for the air you were literally breathing.

365
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,160
 Because they tax the air, it's a ventilation system

366
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,000
 that they have and they say we're providing clean air.

367
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,560
 - Oh, just so far and as I guess.

368
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,400
 - Yeah, I'm guessing so.

369
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,240
 - Must be, yeah.

370
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
 - Just in the airport, it's not a whole country.

371
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,320
 - No, just now.

372
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,280
 - You go, breathe in, and don't breathe out for three weeks, okay?

373
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,640
 You save a lot of money.

374
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,240
 (laughing)

375
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
 - Because they did have the world record

376
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,960
 for the lowest petrol price in 2016.

377
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,080
 Wow, I was trying to look at some other records

378
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,120
 that Venezuela have had.

379
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,800
 It was one cent per litre.

380
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,560
 And at the time, the price in the UK was 110.7 pounds per litre.

381
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,760
 I was trying to work out if I could do some kind of business

382
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,280
 where I offset the price of the flight, but it feels like

383
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,320
 you're going to run into some legal difficulties, I think.

384
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,560
 You can try and bring it back in hand luggage or whatever.

385
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,600
 - Well, they've got a lot of,

386
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,040
 we need to rush this episode out basically

387
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,520
 before America invades.

388
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,640
 So one of the things that Venezuela has is a lot of oil.

389
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,000
 But it's not really used to supply a lot more

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,840
 to the global market, I think it provides less now.

391
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,160
 - Well, it's just sanctions.

392
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,840
 - Sanctions also, oil price sort of fell.

393
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,640
 So other countries are producing a lot more oil.

394
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,400
 But I mean, there is more oil still in the ground

395
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,160
 in Venezuela than any other country.

396
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,080
 - They're not just ringing out oil birds.

397
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,040
 - No, that's not the oil birds.

398
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,720
 - Very pleased, you know, they're not needed.

399
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,840
 - I found a couple of records that have held as well

400
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,040
 in Venezuela.

401
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,560
 This is Guinness World Records.

402
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,840
 The living person with the largest feet.

403
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,680
 - Oh, really?

404
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,520
 - Yes.

405
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,000
 - The bike foot measures at 40.55 centimeters

406
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
 and the left foot at 40.47 centimeters.

407
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,080
 - Now Dan, do you Google Bigfoot Venezuelan?

408
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,800
 (laughing)

409
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,760
 - Now these are their own feet.

410
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,040
 It's not someone just has two extraordinary large feet

411
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,880
 which is beneficial.

412
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,920
 - Yeah, no, it's one person with one foot.

413
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,800
 - I read an interview with this guy.

414
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 And he said that he realized he had big feet

415
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,600
 when he and his friends would often compare their foot sizes

416
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,520
 and he would come out on top each time.

417
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,320
 - I was like, what are his legs doing?

418
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,400
 Charlie's always gonna be him, but we're not like,

419
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,080
 - Unless they're clowns and they're just naturally

420
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
 an oversized shoes.

421
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,920
 - That's good.

422
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,760
 - You can't tell.

423
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,600
 But does he do something for a living that's foot,

424
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,080
 I don't know what advantage he would.

425
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,920
 - Not reach.

426
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,760
 - Yeah foot.

427
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,080
 - What is it?

428
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,320
 What do you do if you've got very, very large feet?

429
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,480
 - Real life, Monty Python opening credits.

430
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
 (laughing)

431
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,800
 - Yeah, that's true.

432
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,400
 (upbeat music)

433
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,200
 - Okay, it is now time for fact number two

434
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,560
 and that is my fact.

435
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,480
 My fact this week is that in 1949,

436
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,000
 the BBC issued a company-wide ban

437
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,440
 on making any rude jokes about solicitors, chambermaids,

438
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,760
 and one very specific Irishman called Mr. McGillicutty.

439
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,600
 - Wow.

440
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,440
 - This is one guy.

441
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,280
 - Yeah.

442
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
 - Well, it's so funny about him.

443
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,440
 - There was people who continued to make jokes

444
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
 about this man, Ross McGillicutty of the reeks.

445
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,280
 - Of the reeks, yes, McGillicutty's reeks.

446
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,120
 - I've heard of that.

447
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
 - Well, there you go.

448
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,440
 And I imagine there was fun to be had.

449
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,960
 - It is quite a funny name, isn't it?

450
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,800
 - Yeah, I found that.

451
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,640
 - He got a big comedian.

452
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
 - Oh, he got that.

453
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,320
 - So what had happened was there was a comment

454
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,680
 called Leonard Henry, not Lenny Henry, Leonard Henry.

455
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,880
 And he'd found the name of McGillicutty of the reeks

456
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,960
 in an atlas and bought it was a place

457
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,200
 and then turned it into a comedy person.

458
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,000
 And then this person who really existed said,

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,680
 well, I never gave you permission to use my name

460
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,280
 and the BBC had to apologize.

461
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,120
 - Yeah.

462
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,160
 - And there's still a McGillicutty of the reeks

463
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,000
 to this day.

464
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,820
 - Yeah.

465
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,200
 - So this title and the reeks is I think a range of,

466
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,920
 it's an ancestral territory in County Kerry.

467
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,760
 So there's a range of mountains, which is called the reeks.

468
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,120
 And the last evidence I have found

469
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
 of the current McGillicutty of the reeks

470
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,160
 is him writing to the daily telegraph in 2017

471
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,240
 about the price of stamps.

472
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,520
 He's about 85 now.

473
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,680
 And I believe he looks after the earnham herd of cattle.

474
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,600
 That's the latest news on the McGillicutty of the reeks.

475
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,560
 - Have you ever laughed at someone like that?

476
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,280
 - He's a serious man.

477
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
 Does he have any administrative powers?

478
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,320
 I mean, does he like a sheriff or something like that at all?

479
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,400
 - He might do, 'cause it's sort of honoree.

480
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,240
 It's an honoree thing.

481
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,440
 You're sort of a chief of family.

482
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,880
 Chief of the name is the term that gets used.

483
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,360
 And this like senior McGillicutty of the 1930s and 40s

484
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,240
 was a big deal.

485
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,800
 You know, he was an officer of the British Army.

486
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,440
 He was an Irish senator.

487
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,360
 He was, you know, all sorts of serious.

488
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,200
 And he just objected very strongly

489
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,360
 to being choked about.

490
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,200
 - He did try.

491
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,040
 - He complained.

492
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,280
 The BBC said, come on, it's never a place.

493
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,120
 - Yeah.

494
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,960
 - Come on.

495
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,800
 - It's a joke.

496
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 - Just reeks of envy for me.

497
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,640
 - Yeah.

498
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,280
 - But then he said that he'd never appeared or contemplated

499
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,960
 appearing before the public for their amusement.

500
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,800
 - Okay.

501
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,640
 - So you must apologize immediately.

502
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,480
 - Right.

503
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
 - The music haved.

504
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,320
 - They did.

505
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,000
 And they produced this thing called the Green Book,

506
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,200
 unofficially called the Green Book.

507
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,040
 It was a pamphlet that was sent internally.

508
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,360
 And it was largely sent to people kind of like Spike Milligan

509
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,440
 and comedians of that ilk who were writing topical,

510
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,680
 not topical shows necessarily,

511
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,000
 but shows that were going out live weekly.

512
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,560
 And so it came with a long list of things, jokes about lavatories,

513
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,040
 immorality of any kind.

514
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,680
 You couldn't make any suggestive references to honeymoon couples,

515
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,280
 fig leaves, ladies underwear, baskets.

516
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,200
 Because baskets could be used as a new endo in sexual relation.

517
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,840
 You could, if you, a nicely placed basket

518
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,600
 in a sentence could suggest sex.

519
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,440
 - What?

520
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,080
 - Yeah, it was used as a replacement word, let's say.

521
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,600
 - I'm sure Shakespeare used baskets of China.

522
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,440
 He must have seen it.

523
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,280
 - He must have seen it.

524
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,560
 It must have been a hot bag.

525
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,560
 (laughing)

526
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,360
 - Did you ever come across the censors yourselves, Michael?

527
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
 - Yeah, we had some censorship on Python.

528
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,200
 - Yeah.

529
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,680
 - What did they object to?

530
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,720
 - Were they objected to the word masturbation?

531
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,560
 - Oh yeah.

532
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,040
 - What is this?

533
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,520
 - I'll give you the context, you know what I'm saying?

534
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,480
 So you're just gonna, if you just come out and say,

535
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,600
 "Oh, we love the later sketch, Michael."

536
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
 - No, no, we're not sure, we're sorry.

537
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,000
 - It was cut out of the power sketch.

538
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,600
 It was not interested in masturbation.

539
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
 (laughing)

540
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,960
 No, the context was we did a sort of northern quiz show,

541
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,960
 sort of an onstage thing where people came on stage.

542
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,560
 And it was a, it was a thing, I said, I didn't,

543
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,320
 but people had to sum up, proofs.

544
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,520
 - It was, it was officially called

545
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,080
 the all-England summarized proofs competition.

546
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,440
 - The all-England proofs competition.

547
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,200
 So they had 15 seconds to summarize proofs.

548
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,520
 Anyway, the ones that comes up,

549
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,560
 and they get a little cheery,

550
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,000
 will frid pickles, oh, hello, how are you?

551
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,920
 What are your hobbies?

552
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,400
 And this man's hobbies are strangling animals,

553
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,880
 golf and masturbation.

554
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,040
 (laughing)

555
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,160
 It was a huge laugh.

556
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,480
 And anyway, very quickly, the sketch itself.

557
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,520
 This one, my favorite bits, because, all right,

558
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,360
 you've got 15 seconds now.

559
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,320
 Summarize proofs in this master work,

560
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
 and all the various volumes of proofs

561
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,480
 were on the sort of thermometer.

562
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,920
 (laughing)

563
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,440
 So he goes, oh, yeah, oh, ah, did it,

564
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,240
 that on verb, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

565
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,360
 swan comes along, swan comes along, swan comes,

566
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 and bings, but the, the BBC said you can't,

567
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,920
 they reviewed the tape and said you can't say masturbating.

568
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 And so you'll have to cut it out.

569
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,680
 And in those days, we recorded on tape,

570
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,840
 so you had to physically cut the tape.

571
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,440
 So our director said he cut the thing out,

572
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,280
 the word masturbating, but he left the gap,

573
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,240
 which is brilliant, so you hear, what are your hobbies?

574
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,560
 Strung the animals, golf, huge laugh.

575
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,720
 (laughing)

576
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,520
 Never has golf got a laugh, absolutely colossal laugh.

577
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,320
 And that's a good summary of the life of proofs

578
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,880
 from what I remember.

579
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,720
 - Probably.

580
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 - He spent, I mean, he was in his bedroom for a lot of time.

581
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,880
 - Very true. - He was.

582
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,800
 - He was, I think he was putting pins in mice or something,

583
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
 wasn't he when he was a kid?

584
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,840
 - Was it?

585
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,680
 - I think so.

586
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,920
 - I've never heard of him playing golf,

587
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,160
 and I would know if proofs play golf, I would know that.

588
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,240
 - I love the shame.

589
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,480
 - I love that there's a great story in your diaries,

590
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,880
 the Python years, the first diaries,

591
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,120
 which is that you had obviously the most famous story

592
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,320
 of censorship and banning in comedy history, life of Brian,

593
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,360
 and all the things that you guys had to do

594
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,520
 in order to say that this wasn't an attack on religion.

595
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,640
 It was, you know, Jesus is not being mocked

596
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,760
 and it was the big thing, right?

597
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,760
 And you got banned in places like Norway,

598
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,640
 and in the diary, you point out that in Sweden,

599
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,120
 the posters read so funny, it was banned in Norway.

600
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,840
 - Yeah, I just think that's fantastic.

601
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,760
 - Yeah.

602
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,520
 - And you, because it was a great moment,

603
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,160
 'cause it did get banned in a lot of places

604
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,360
 from cinema altogether,

605
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,680
 and one of those places was in Wales,

606
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,760
 and that was overturned by the mayor,

607
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,640
 Sue Jones Davies, who happened to be in the life of Brian.

608
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,800
 - She was Brian's girlfriend,

609
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,000
 skipping around naked.

610
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,840
 - Oh yeah.

611
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,800
 - She was the revolutionary leader.

612
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,000
 - So she suddenly becomes mayor of Aberystwyth,

614
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,760
 and for one night, she says,

615
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,040
 "I'm going to overturn the ban."

616
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,160
 And Terry and myself and her went to the local Odin

617
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,320
 in Aberystwyth, with arms, links,

618
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,960
 like, you know, we were all in the sort of,

619
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,800
 tell them a much, or something like that.

620
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,360
 We saw one night of life in Brian.

621
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 I think it was banned in the night after that, yeah.

622
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,400
 - I was looking at a few songs

623
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,240
 that maybe should have been banned,

624
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,400
 'cause the BBC had a lot of rules about songs as well.

625
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,240
 - Yeah.

626
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,080
 - So they banned things like,

627
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,720
 "My Generation," by the who?

628
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,560
 - Really?

629
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,840
 - '60s classic, that was banned.

630
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,080
 Not because of any profanity.

631
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,720
 It was banned because it has a stammer.

632
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,560
 - A stammer?

633
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,400
 - I was mad.

634
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,240
 - I really liked it.

635
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,080
 - People put, you know, that it's--

636
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

637
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,040
 - Yeah, and that was just that people with a stammer

638
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,880
 will find that offensive.

639
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,280
 - That's interesting.

640
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,240
 - Space Audity by David Bowie was banned

641
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,880
 because it was, I think it was banned

642
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
 until Neil Armstrong had safely got back to Earth.

643
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,680
 - Oh, really?

644
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
 - It out.

645
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
 - Okay, yeah, I'm stronger than Collins,

646
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
 because they thought, oh, it's a bit sensationalist.

647
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,680
 - Oh, really?

648
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,520
 - Yeah.

649
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,440
 - Very clear, he's stuck in a tin can, of course, right?

650
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,520
 - Yeah, yeah.

651
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,440
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

652
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,760
 But there's this whole, there's this whole genre of songs

653
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,320
 called "Dirty Blues" from the '20s and '30s,

654
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,800
 which are all sort of, they're all black singers,

655
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,880
 many women, but the lyrics and the song titles

656
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,960
 are so extraordinarily rude.

657
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,200
 I can't believe the songs are released, basically.

658
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,760
 So I just want to give you a few of them.

659
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,920
 - Yeah, for it.

660
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,720
 - Please warm my weenah.

661
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,360
 I mean, that's the single "On Tundra" it's basically.

662
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,640
 - Yeah, they're really popular, but get 'em

663
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,240
 from the peanut man, brackets, hot nuts.

664
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,640
 - Yeah.

665
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,440
 - Lil Johnson was one of the women singing these.

666
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,080
 Let me roll your lemon.

667
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,480
 Sort of just about the "Dubel on Tundra."

668
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
 My stove is in good condition.

669
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
 - It's good.

670
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,240
 - Any news of her basket?

671
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,520
 - Anybody want to buy my cabbage?

672
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,480
 - That's not rude.

673
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
 - Well, the way she sings it is, sorry.

674
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,160
 - It sounds like sort of Gordon Ramsay's songbook, really.

675
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,040
 (all laughing)

676
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,480
 Margaret Carter, they were actually their loads of cooking ones.

677
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,680
 So Margaret Carter had, I want plenty grease in my frying pan

678
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,200
 and meant this mini had, I'm selling my pork chops,

679
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
 but I'm giving my gravy away,

680
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,040
 which has lost me completely.

681
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,760
 - Is that like my milkshake brings other bites to the yard?

682
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,280
 - I think it is, but with more pork.

683
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,520
 - I think it's sort of, yeah.

684
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
 More sex took place in the kitchen than anywhere else.

685
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,920
 - That sounds like it.

686
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

687
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,200
 - Do you know who's was the first song band

688
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,160
 from the BBC at somebody you've all heard of?

689
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,360
 - So. - Okay.

690
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,720
 - 1933.

691
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
 - 1933.

692
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,960
 - Adolf Hitler.

693
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
 - With his...

694
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
 (all laughing)

695
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
 - Is that called "Chancellor's Waltz"?

696
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,880
 - 33.

697
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,040
 - So we've all heard of.

698
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,400
 Some of you've all heard of.

699
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,160
 Someone from my part of the world.

700
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,040
 - George. - George Foreman.

701
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
 - I was about to say George Foreman.

702
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,960
 - George Foreman. - George Foreman.

703
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,040
 - George Foreman, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

704
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,160
 - His song with my little ukulele in hand was banned,

705
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,960
 but he was a real double entendre.

706
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,600
 - Yes, and lovely. - Yeah, yeah.

707
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,560
 - Like one of his songs, "My Little Stick of Black Poor Rock"

708
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,720
 goes, "It may be sticky, but I never complain.

709
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,960
 It's nice to have a nibble of it now and again."

710
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,800
 (all laughing)

711
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,520
 - So. - That is sort of...

712
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,880
 - The role of double entendre is all the way for me.

713
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
 - Very interesting.

714
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,040
 - There was a number one hit in the UK,

715
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,720
 which was a very famous song, "Jetem."

716
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,360
 - Oh, yeah. - So Jamesburg, Jamesburg, again.

717
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,560
 That was banned as well.

718
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,360
 I read this in the monkey diaries.

719
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,360
 Jane Berkins diaries, other diaries are available.

720
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,160
 (all laughing)

721
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,960
 The problem that they had was it got too popular.

722
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,760
 It got so popular that it made it to number one.

723
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,520
 And so in order to be able to play it within the charts,

724
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
 they had to get an orchestral version of it

725
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,800
 and just play it completely without any voice

726
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,640
 at all.

727
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,480
 'Cause it wasn't even the lyrics, it was the moaning.

728
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,800
 - Yes, exactly. - That was the big problem of the song.

729
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,880
 - It was a breathing, wasn't it?

730
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,240
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

731
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,800
 - And all these, my generation, all this,

732
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,400
 this is why Radio Caroline became a big thing.

733
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,240
 - Was that pirate?

734
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,840
 - Offshore pirate radio, because no one was playing

735
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,600
 any of these songs.

736
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,120
 Yeah, I've got one last one, which I find pretty amazing,

737
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,160
 which is King Charles.

738
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,480
 I didn't realize he was part of the reviews

739
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,800
 in Cambridge when he was there.

740
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,440
 He did footlight smokers and he was part of them.

741
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,480
 What does that mean, so?

742
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,040
 - So people--

743
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,160
 - People on stage, you do sort of funny things, don't you?

744
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,120
 - Yeah, exactly, it's comedy stuff.

745
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,960
 - It's comedy stuff.

746
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,600
 - It's comedy, yeah, yeah, it's a smoker.

747
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,080
 - Smoking room, yeah.

748
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,960
 - You and Terry Jones were in Oxford,

749
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,720
 but Eric Idol and John Cleese and Graham Chapman

750
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,400
 would have been part of the Cambridge Footlight,

751
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
 Breon the Fringe, all that.

752
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,800
 And so he was part of the Cambridge Footlights.

753
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 And there's a story that goes that they were not allowed

754
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,720
 to make fun of him or his family

755
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,160
 while he was part of the footlights, which is pretty amazing.

756
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,720
 And he did a few reviews, he was on stage quite a lot.

757
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,880
 - Yeah, he was in the magic circle as well, wasn't he?

758
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,720
 - Really?

759
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,680
 - When he was Prince Charles, yeah.

760
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,160
 Well, you guys with me when I didn't

761
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,200
 horror the magic circle, I can't remember who was there.

762
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,040
 - We weren't allowed it.

763
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,680
 - Well, we went there and they told us about when,

764
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,920
 'cause you have to do a trick to get into the magic circle

765
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,880
 and he did the balls trick like the cups and balls.

766
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,040
 Apparently, not the best person who's ever done it,

767
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,640
 but they decided that it was good enough

768
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,240
 for him to join the magic circle.

769
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,160
 - The edge of the throne.

770
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,400
 - Yeah, I'm sorry, come again next week.

771
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

772
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,480
 - I can make your head disappear, actually.

773
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,000
 (laughing)

774
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,480
 - So he took part in two reviews.

775
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,800
 One was called Revolution with a U instead of the U

776
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,120
 in the middle and quietly flows the Don.

777
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,960
 And so you weren't allowed to make any jokes about him

778
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,840
 or royalty, but also the first play got in a bit of trouble

779
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,200
 in 1969 because they were putting it on a Sunday

780
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,280
 and the Lord's Day observant society got in touch

781
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,000
 and said, "Absolutely not."

782
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,640
 So it's basically a society looking out

783
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,960
 for anything going on on a Sunday that shouldn't be.

784
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,360
 - And I'd rather think about them

785
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,280
 as they can only work on Sundays.

786
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,600
 (laughing)

787
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
 - Can't do anything on a Saturday like this, exactly.

788
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,400
 - Yeah, but yeah, apparently it was quite odd

789
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,040
 because when he was on stage, they would sell tickets

790
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,360
 to the smokers, as they were called,

791
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,720
 the performances that you could go to.

792
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,040
 And they would field in calls from Japan saying,

793
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,120
 "How many tickets are available?

794
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,280
 "We have a full plane load of tourists

795
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,760
 "who are ready to fly over to see the prints and performance."

796
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
 - Well, there we are.

797
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,160
 He's still performing, isn't he really?

798
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,360
 - Yeah, he is.

799
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,760
 - And he's what he learned for the footlights.

800
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,960
 Probably very useful for public life, you know.

801
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,440
 - And the magic circle he made prints Andrew disappear?

802
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,280
 - Yes.

803
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
 (laughing)

804
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,880
 (upbeat music)

805
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,520
 - Okay, there's time for fact number three,

806
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,720
 and that is Andy.

807
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,240
 My fact is, the rescue team who tried to find

808
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,000
 the Lost Franklin Expedition did so

809
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,200
 with rockets, kites, flashing lights, gunshots, horns,

810
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,400
 drums, and by putting collars on Arctic foxes.

811
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,080
 - Hmm, wow.

812
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,680
 - It didn't work, we should say.

813
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,520
 - And that's sad.

814
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,360
 - Well, the collars, was this before

815
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,880
 they had some radio equipment?

816
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,240
 So I mean, you just put the collars on,

817
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,520
 there was no recording device.

818
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,440
 - Yeah, 100%.

819
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
 - 100%. - So what they did?

820
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,240
 - This is in the 1840s and '50s.

821
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,880
 This expedition, which you've written about Michael,

822
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,200
 went north over Canada.

823
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,240
 They were trying to find a shorter route through the Arctic

824
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,200
 because that will be amazing for shipping.

825
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,680
 There's fabled things called the Northwest Passage,

826
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,200
 and it would cut thousands of miles.

827
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,360
 - So this is before the Panama Canal, right?

828
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
 - Yes, it is.

829
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,120
 - So they previously had to go all the way down South America.

830
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,160
 - Exactly, and it's just a very, very long route

831
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,040
 to sail from Europe to Asia, basically.

832
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,800
 So if you could find the Northwest Passage,

833
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,880
 it would be a huge boon to mankind.

834
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,960
 And this expedition went out, the Franklin expedition,

835
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,880
 two ships, terror and aerobus.

836
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,080
 They went missing, and a lot of search parties went out for them.

837
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,440
 And some sources estimate more than 30 search missions went out.

838
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,280
 - And one of them.

839
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,960
 - Mostly financed by his wife.

840
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,440
 - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

841
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,760
 - And he determined that she could find him

842
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,960
 and everyone was saying, "No, it's too late now, he's dead."

843
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,840
 And one of them decided to put collars on foxes,

845
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,080
 Arctic foxes, wild fox cubs,

846
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,080
 which had the coordinates of where they were,

847
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
 saying, "We are looking for you.

848
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,120
 This is where we are based."

849
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,320
 And they just released the foxes into the wilds.

850
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,600
 And it was clever, it didn't work.

851
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,340
 I mean, the foxes, I imagine,

852
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,680
 - It's the survivors.

853
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,520
 (laughing)

854
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,000
 - Normally they're there to read them.

855
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
 - No, exactly, they're all inew it.

856
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,080
 So they wouldn't say, "What does this mean?"

857
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,560
 - Yeah, so read that.

858
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,720
 - It's simply did not work.

859
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,080
 - That's a fascinating fact.

860
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,560
 - So they did some very strange things at that time.

861
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,080
 It was a kind of hysteria to try and find him

862
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,920
 and a refusal to admit that they might be dead.

863
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,840
 Because they basically completely got it wrong.

864
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,680
 The whole expedition was given enormous amounts of money.

865
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,360
 They had lots of wine on board and libraries

866
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
 and all that sort of thing.

867
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,920
 And they just took a wrong turn and got stuck down

868
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,280
 a sort of fairly narrow stretch of water

869
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,920
 where it was quite an extreme winter then.

870
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,640
 And that froze and they were stuck.

871
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,320
 So yeah, thank all the wines.

872
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,360
 So when the spring comes, it's a melt and they go off,

873
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,960
 the spring didn't melt.

874
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,600
 There was two or three years of the worst

875
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,800
 and the coldest winters up in the Northwest Passage.

876
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,520
 So basically, we just stuck there for about two years,

877
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,360
 ran out of food, went out trying to get the trade

878
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,120
 with the inew it, but they didn't do that very well.

879
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,880
 Because no one had actually done the research

880
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,520
 and saying, "Well, how do we speak to inew it?"

881
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,600
 The people who lived there.

882
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,000
 So when it came to wanting to be helped by those people,

883
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,840
 they couldn't do it.

884
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,000
 Whereas later, Amundsen or something like that

885
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,320
 was very much a sort of, you know,

886
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,840
 the ground you're on sort of traveler.

887
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,760
 He always knew what to ask the local people, right?

888
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,600
 So it was a bit arrogant really.

889
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
 So frankly, next.

890
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,440
 Well, were they a bit unlucky with the weather,

891
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,960
 like if they'd gone a few years later?

892
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,480
 Yeah, I mean, I think it was these two very, very cold winters.

893
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,320
 But they'd also, you know, they've gone a slightly different route

894
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,240
 and not gone down.

895
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,880
 They took like a shortcut, and then it got trapped.

896
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,360
 And the ice is always stronger when you've got the confined space.

897
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,280
 So if they've gone a bit further ahead,

898
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,760
 where there's more open water, they might have got through.

899
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,280
 The absolute disappointment of the ice

900
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,520
 not melting that spring must have been.

901
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,600
 Yeah, must be near the spring now.

902
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,360
 Yeah, yeah.

903
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,920
 So you wrote a brilliant book about aerobus,

904
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,440
 and you went and visited a lot of these places as well.

905
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,480
 I mean, it's pretty fascinating

906
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,360
 that it was lost for so long only found in 2014.

907
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:21,880
 Yeah.

908
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,200
 I mean, that's remarkable.

909
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,920
 Well, the end of it at the time in the late 19th century,

910
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,320
 people went out there, said they had seen a ship,

911
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,320
 or the master of a ship, they knew exactly where it was.

912
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,680
 But there was sort of, because they only had an oral tradition,

913
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,960
 didn't write things down.

914
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,080
 People thought, oh, wow, they're just saying that.

915
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,160
 And they didn't find it up.

916
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,320
 And in the end, aerobus was found almost exactly

917
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,280
 where they had said a hundred and a hundred years

918
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,080
 with their local residents was just going on.

919
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,280
 Frayed so, yeah.

920
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,520
 It's a real sort of imperial sort of attitude you have.

921
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,600
 No, no, you don't know.

922
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,200
 There's just, you just lived here for 500 years.

923
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,040
 Yeah, we know.

924
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,960
 I think we, the 31st Expedition.

925
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,160
 Yeah, we wanted to find them without any help from you guys.

926
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,960
 Thank you.

927
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
 Colin Wolfson, you go.

928
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,000
 Oh, I should say where I saw the,

929
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,920
 I've seen one of these collars in the flesh.

930
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,680
 It's so exciting.

931
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,200
 Oh, wow.

932
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,800
 It's a few of us.

933
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,760
 With words on it.

934
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,280
 Yeah.

935
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,120
 And the coordinates.

936
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,640
 Behind the scenes at the Royal Geographical Society,

937
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,320
 which I believe you've been president.

938
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,760
 I was president for three years.

939
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
 Yeah.

940
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,080
 And they have, in the back rooms,

941
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,200
 they have these amazing collections of extraordinary stuff,

942
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,560
 because it was founded in 1830 and basically contributed

943
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,160
 to founding geography as a discipline.

944
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,280
 Geography is a much newer area of study than many others.

945
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
 So it's an incredible place.

946
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,760
 And they've got these collars there as amazing to say.

947
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
 Very cool.

948
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,920
 The thing is, which is quite interesting,

949
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,640
 I think one of the many attempts to find out where they were,

950
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,880
 was a ship called HMS Resolution.

951
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,960
 That was about sort of five of us out there left.

952
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,520
 And the desk from the captain's cabin,

953
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,720
 the HMS Resolution, is the desk in the White House?

954
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
 Oh, really?

955
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
 It's in the White House offices.

956
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,280
 I have heard it called the Resolution desk.

957
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,360
 I have not found what that came from the search for Franklin.

958
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,840
 Isn't Trump just trying to turn that into a solid gold desk?

959
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,360
 It will be easier if he's guilty in that right now.

960
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:11,880
 Yeah.

961
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,760
 And I read that they took 8,000 tins of food for the voyage.

962
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
 Sounds like Ron.

963
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
 Exactly.

964
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
 You're Ron, mate.

965
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
 You're a ship, haven't you?

966
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
 Yeah.

967
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
 And nobody, Tino.

968
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,760
 Oh, come on.

969
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,160
 We could ask the locals, no, no.

970
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,720
 And 7,088 pounds of tobacco, which, according to my calculation,

971
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,800
 in today's money would be enough for three million cigarettes.

972
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
 Yeah.

973
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,240
 Which really, really, enough, wouldn't it?

974
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,400
 But yeah, I think a lot of people thought

975
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,640
 that the tins were the problem.

976
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
 Right.

977
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,440
 So a lot of the men went away from the ship,

978
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,200
 maybe to try and find the way off somewhere.

979
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,520
 But they walked away with the load of stuff they wouldn't really need,

980
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,040
 like button polish and curtain rods, sort of writing desk and stuff.

981
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
 Time to try and get it.

982
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
 Yeah, exactly.

983
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,840
 And people thought, well, maybe they went mad.

984
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,520
 And I think now we do think that there was some lead poisoning.

985
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,720
 And for a long time, they thought it was the tins of food,

986
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,320
 because they were soldered with lead.

987
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,440
 Now, I think we're not quite so sure it might have been

988
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,400
 because the pipes in the boat had lead in them.

989
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,880
 Because the levels of lead were so high

990
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,920
 that it couldn't just be bleached from the tins.

991
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
 How interesting.

992
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,560
 It was about 150 men in total.

993
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,880
 129, I believe.

994
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,960
 OK, right.

995
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,840
 Like, all hands on both ships, not one of them survived.

996
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,640
 Yeah, yeah.

997
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
 Is this right, Michael?

998
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,960
 I read this, and it sounded too wild to be true to me.

999
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,520
 But is it the case that when you went out looking and writing the book

1000
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,280
 that there's bits where in the snow,

1001
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,480
 their footprints are sort of fossilized

1002
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,200
 that you can see them in the ground?

1003
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
 I don't know.

1004
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,800
 I mean, you can see there are graves,

1005
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,480
 the first people who died.

1006
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,720
 Right.

1007
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,880
 I'm not sure about the fossil.

1008
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,120
 OK, yeah, it felt weird.

1009
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,640
 Yeah, I mean, that's why I'm a fossil.

1010
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,520
 Yeah, but unless it was that Fener's Wailing guy with a massive--

1011
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,720
 [LAUGHTER]

1012
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,120
 --he had no map, you 24 yards across.

1013
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,640
 We died of large feet.

1014
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,280
 I'm able to cut his turn, then.

1015
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,320
 So I mean, it's a lumberjack's to get in there.

1016
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,080
 But they did find a lot of very well-preserved bodies, I believe.

1017
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,120
 And I don't know if they are.

1018
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,440
 I think they must have been dug up.

1019
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,680
 But bodies were found in 1984, incredibly well-preserved.

1020
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,280
 And you could see they had blue eyes.

1021
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,040
 So there was a crew member called John Torrington,

1022
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,680
 who was found 138 years after he died.

1023
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,960
 But he was put on people magazine's list

1024
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,520
 of the most intriguing people of 1984.

1025
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,040
 Really?

1026
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,000
 Yeah, yeah, wow.

1027
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,560
 Bit of a post-industrial recognition, which I suppose is nice.

1028
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
 But you are on ice.

1029
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,800
 You know, that's what they say about like places like Everest.

1030
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,280
 Cryogenics and situation.

1031
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,360
 When they found Mallory's body, Mallory's body

1032
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,320
 was just still Mallory's body.

1033
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,000
 It was there.

1034
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,400
 But they didn't get that many.

1035
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,040
 Not many of that many were brought back, actually.

1036
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,120
 We should say Lady Franklin as well.

1037
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,640
 Yeah.

1038
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,520
 So John Franklin was the commander of the whole mission, wasn't he?

1039
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,000
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

1040
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,360
 And I think there were questions about whether he was suitable,

1041
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,520
 whether he was the best man to draw--

1042
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,280
 Absolutely.

1043
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,360
 For a start, Franklin wasn't the first person

1044
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
 they wanted to lead it.

1045
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,520
 They wanted James Clark Ross to lead it,

1046
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,040
 because he had extraordinary success in Antarctica in 1841

1047
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,720
 and stood on places that no human being had ever been before.

1048
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,960
 But he didn't want to do it, quite rightly.

1049
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,040
 And so they got Franklin, because he was quite old at the time.

1050
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,200
 He was nearly 60.

1051
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,440
 But he ever liked him.

1052
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,200
 He was all right.

1053
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,840
 He was pretty intellectual.

1054
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,360
 And I spoke to everybody.

1055
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,640
 Yeah, I want to do it.

1056
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,760
 And his wife was very dynamic.

1057
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,000
 Must have pushed him forward and said,

1058
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,680
 "My husband's available."

1059
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
 And here he is.

1060
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,120
 John, come in.

1061
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
 [LAUGHTER]

1062
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,280
 On the other hand, I read that James Ross, one of the reasons

1063
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,160
 he declined this, because he promised his wife

1064
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,280
 that he wouldn't go to any more polar expedition.

1065
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,800
 Yes.

1066
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,640
 So it's all we're blaming the wives for the whole thing of this.

1067
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,160
 That's such a great detail.

1068
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,640
 Yeah.

1069
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,120
 No, I promise my wife that we'll have to go get it.

1070
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,400
 If he's just done four years, you know, the Antarctic.

1071
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,280
 It's reasonable.

1072
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,080
 Where are you going?

1073
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,680
 Just to enjoy the Antarctic.

1074
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,280
 Lady Franklin was very smitten with James Clarke Ross.

1075
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,640
 Oh, sort of dashing character.

1076
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,160
 Really?

1077
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,600
 Tall, yeah, yeah.

1078
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,520
 That's why the wife didn't want him at all.

1079
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,360
 Yeah, yeah.

1080
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,720
 [LAUGHTER]

1081
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,200
 Actually, it doesn't say that it was his wife

1082
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,840
 who didn't want him to go around.

1083
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,800
 [LAUGHTER]

1084
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,480
 Wow.

1085
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,400
 That's really interesting.

1086
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,520
 So James Clarke Ross led one of the expeditions.

1087
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,680
 And that was the one that put the collars on the foxes.

1088
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
 Really?

1089
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
 Yeah, yeah.

1090
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,960
 And Lady Franklin did all the lobbying, didn't she?

1091
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,200
 She said, we must send our search parties.

1092
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,240
 It's quite moving.

1093
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,600
 She wrote him letters for eight years after he departed.

1094
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,520
 And you know, the large majority of that time

1095
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,040
 he would have died.

1096
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,280
 No one knew, for sure.

1097
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,200
 But what would happen to those letters?

1098
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,360
 Would they just be kept in her house?

1099
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,240
 Or would she post them and send it to Canada maybe?

1100
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,160
 She would have had them indexed and looked after well.

1101
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,360
 Yeah, she had an assistant, a woman who worked with her.

1102
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,840
 And they organized the whole sort of rescue business

1103
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,280
 down to the last detail.

1104
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,200
 So the letters, I'm sure, everything that she'd written

1105
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,720
 would be kept.

1106
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
 That's the other thing, right?

1107
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,240
 Where they were going, there was no post box right.

1108
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,280
 So they didn't take a post box with them.

1109
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,440
 They should have done it in the true Imperial spirit.

1110
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,360
 We're going to put the first post box in the North.

1111
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,000
 I can imagine a postman coming to collect those

1112
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,080
 definitely wearing shorts.

1113
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,560
 No collection on Sunday.

1114
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,760
 Well, the Lord's Day Observant Society have been in touch.

1115
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:43,280
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

1116
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,640
 And that is James.

1117
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,480
 OK, my fact this week is that in Bologna,

1118
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,360
 there is a word, um, a role, which describes

1119
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,920
 a grumpy pensioner who stands with his hands behind his back,

1120
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,280
 complaining about road works.

1121
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
 The dream.

1122
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,560
 The dream for me, dream life.

1123
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,680
 We'll all end up there eventually handy.

1124
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,960
 You were a lot earlier than others, I'm sure.

1125
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,120
 Andy's there, I'm there.

1126
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,000
 So this is a term that was coined in 2005 by a writer

1127
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,600
 called Danilo Masotti.

1128
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,360
 And he had noticed that there was a lot of people

1129
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,160
 doing this in Bologna.

1130
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,320
 And they've decided that it's going to be a thing

1131
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,720
 and they've really embraced it.

1132
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,400
 And now if you go to Bologna and they do road works,

1133
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,080
 the people who are doing the work will talk to the umorals.

1134
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,720
 When they finish some works, they'll

1135
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,080
 put a sign up saying where they're going

1136
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,000
 to be next week so that the umorals can go and see them.

1137
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
 Wonderful.

1138
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,520
 And they was a very good way of institutionalizing grumpy

1139
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,680
 pensioner.

1140
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,240
 Go ahead and deal with it.

1141
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,920
 And there was a Burger King advert in 2016

1142
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,720
 about these guys. And in 2021, the word entered

1143
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,640
 the official Italian dictionary.

1144
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,320
 Incredible.

1145
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,360
 So this is a real proper thing now.

1146
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,320
 Isn't the umorals sounds really nice?

1147
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,040
 It sounds like a laxative, to be honest.

1148
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,840
 No, it's a very glamorous term for grumpy old men.

1149
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,360
 Yeah, but also it doesn't sound very Italian, I think.

1150
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,160
 Umoral.

1151
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
 Umorale.

1152
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
 Umorale.

1153
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
 Umorale.

1154
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,760
 I think it's the way you pronounce it.

1155
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,400
 Yeah, but he's a, it comes from a Bologna

1156
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,400
 like regional dialects word, meaning little guy.

1157
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,680
 So is it, are they annoying to the builders?

1158
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,000
 Are they looking through the fence?

1159
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,360
 And they're saying, I wouldn't put it there if I,

1160
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,520
 I wouldn't put that R.S.J. there if I were you.

1161
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,080
 I think it all depends on the attitude of the builders.

1162
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,600
 OK.

1163
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,160
 I think some of the builders embrace it and like them.

1164
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,360
 And it's someone to chat to and, you know, they use the knowledge

1165
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,640
 of people who have maybe done this job before or know about it.

1166
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,240
 And then there are other builders who go off my building site.

1167
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
 Yeah, a lot of these guys will be retired.

1168
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,960
 Yeah, no, no, no, don't put it through to Houston.

1169
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,360
 Oh, all right, we've made the tunnels.

1170
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,320
 Well, you should have asked us, asked us, yeah.

1171
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,080
 I just think a lot of these guys are going to be retired solicitors

1172
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,480
 or people who are not, oh, yeah, builders.

1173
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,560
 There's a lot of people who thought that they kind of stand

1174
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,480
 with their eyes and their backs.

1175
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,360
 You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, like a, like a sort of, that's a costume.

1176
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,880
 In, uh, Villa Santa, which is near Monza in the north of Italy.

1177
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,080
 Um, they have officially used these umorals.

1178
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,720
 And the local government have spoken to them and said, right,

1179
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,560
 you can stand next to this bit of world works and let us know

1180
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,520
 if anything's wrong.

1181
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,920
 So they're like professional umorals.

1182
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,320
 All right, the government, the snitches as well.

1183
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,760
 Basically, and that's true.

1184
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,480
 I'd think of it like that, but I found a line.

1185
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,240
 You can get a 3D printed model of an umoral, uh, for your desk.

1186
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,160
 And the idea is you just pop him here and he will look there and work

1187
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,720
 for your doing.

1188
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,200
 Yeah, and brilliant idea.

1189
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,920
 You'll get a lot more done because you're so frightened that he's going to complain.

1190
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,040
 It's just, it's lovely.

1191
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,760
 Yeah, I feel like I would very happily, even if, because I don't speak the language,

1192
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,960
 just listen to a live stream of just the old man.

1193
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1194
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,320
 And I think the theory is a lot of these guys, well, they're all retarded.

1195
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,800
 Yeah.

1196
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,640
 And I think part of the theory is their wives do not want them around the household day.

1197
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,360
 So very much like Lady Franklin, they've said,

1198
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,400
 "Why don't you pop out and discopital for passage?"

1199
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,720
 And quite often what they'll do is they'll go in the morning,

1200
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,040
 have their cappuccino, sit around, chat about the football scores or whatever.

1201
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,560
 But then once it comes to mid-morning, what do you do then, right?

1202
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,040
 Ah, going to a lot of work's happening.

1203
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,400
 So you go and touch.

1204
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,400
 They sort of sound a bit like superannuated train spotters, really.

1205
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:31,880
 Yeah.

1206
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,040
 Rather than glamorous and Italian way, you know?

1207
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,040
 They wouldn't be nerdy.

1208
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:42,200
 Train spotters, Italian, sort of, had seen all the Fellini movies.

1209
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,400
 I do really hope that you're just mentioning Franklin

1210
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,240
 that there were a group of innuit old men just standing around the air of us.

1211
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,280
 I won't go down that.

1212
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,160
 I won't go down that.

1213
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,600
 Yeah, you're going down that body of water.

1214
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,760
 Sorry, mate, back up.

1215
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,480
 Michael, you're doing a live show at the moment.

1216
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,000
 And one of the themes is aging disgracefully, right?

1217
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,880
 As part of a--

1218
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,600
 Yeah, yeah.

1219
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,640
 Is that sort of this?

1220
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,120
 Yes.

1221
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,920
 Does that appeal, the idea of humoral, to be--

1222
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,640
 Yeah, I mean, I'd like to be a bit more active.

1223
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,680
 But I think you just keep going.

1224
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,280
 And there's two ways of approaching age one is to sit in a chair.

1225
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,360
 And the others become fanatically busy.

1226
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,720
 And just say, I just got to have things to do all the time.

1227
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,960
 So I couldn't, you know, otherwise it's completely boring.

1228
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,680
 But some people choose one, some people choose the other.

1229
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,360
 There's another term that I really like.

1230
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,560
 The window side tribe, they're known as in Japan.

1231
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,160
 And it means an employee who at work is quite old.

1232
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,320
 And they can't really get them to do what they used to do.

1233
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,440
 So they sort of sideline them.

1234
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,880
 They just give them a desk by the window.

1235
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,800
 And they don't really do anything anymore.

1236
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,760
 So it's apparently the biggest dream, yeah.

1237
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,720
 It's quite big in Japan.

1238
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,120
 They just, rather than firing or retiring someone,

1239
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,960
 they just take away all their responsibilities,

1240
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,640
 put them by the window and just say,

1241
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,680
 "All right, just keep going."

1242
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,160
 That's called "execitive producer" that you beat yourself.

1243
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,520
 But it's true that most other countries

1244
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,080
 have a more enlightened attitude to aging.

1245
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,880
 They think it's valuable that people get older.

1246
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,840
 I mean most tribal societies, you're the top man.

1247
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,160
 If you argue, the more you know,

1248
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,640
 the more experience you can pass on to others.

1249
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,680
 So I'm the idea of care homes here.

1250
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,960
 It's quite sad, really.

1251
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,680
 Yeah, I quite like, you know,

1252
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,640
 getting involved in a heist, for example,

1253
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,480
 in your older years.

1254
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,400
 The fascinating story from a few years ago

1255
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,920
 that the greatest, largest burglary in English history

1256
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,320
 was committed by people in their 70s.

1257
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,520
 The oldest guy was 76.

1258
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,400
 That's the hat I'm talking about.

1259
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,560
 Was the hat in 2001, which is just pretty astonishing.

1260
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,480
 They went down an elevator shaft.

1261
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,520
 They drilled through.

1262
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,800
 They stole millions of pounds worth of stuff.

1263
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,240
 I didn't know they were that old.

1264
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,400
 They had a combined age of 500.

1265
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,880
 They just, oh, bloke from the pub, you know.

1266
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,560
 Let's go out and do it for real.

1267
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,320
 Yeah, and they had a history of having done

1268
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,520
 quite a few heists in the past over a long career.

1269
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,200
 But they'd been scripted by Richard Osmond.

1270
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,040
 It just feels like quite so.

1271
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,320
 It just splashed.

1272
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,440
 One of them got to the high.

1273
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,160
 So I'm a boss using his pensioners past.

1274
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,560
 Like it was, ironically, his freedom pass.

1275
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,680
 Yes, yes.

1276
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,880
 Yeah.

1277
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,000
 But then what do you do with the money, really?

1278
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,640
 Well, we never want to find out, because I've got less of your life

1279
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,880
 to, you know, going up a few years to spend it.

1280
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,080
 Some of it still missing, isn't it?

1281
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,920
 I think it is quite a lot of it, really.

1282
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,960
 So, and they're all going to come out at some stage.

1283
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,120
 We need to look for a care home that has installed, you know.

1284
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,080
 Gold tax.

1285
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,840
 Gold tax, Vegas style fountain.

1286
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,280
 That would be it.

1287
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,480
 It's called the Trump home.

1288
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,760
 Yeah, exactly.

1289
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,480
 Well, there's one mystery man still missing who's called Bazzle.

1290
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,680
 And there's a £20,000 reward on his head.

1291
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:55,480
 Did you find in the course of this, the word gongusula?

1292
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,400
 No, it's basically the British umeral.

1293
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,960
 It's someone who stands and watches activity on a canal, quite specifically.

1294
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,040
 Is this voyeuristic or just finished?

1295
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,320
 The canal activities that happen near me is basically graffiti.

1296
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,520
 Yeah, taking drugs.

1297
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,480
 Oh, really?

1298
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,840
 I think hotbeds are vise.

1299
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,640
 I didn't know that.

1300
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,240
 Oh, well, I'm used to the Gentile Southern Kennet and Avon canals

1301
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,240
 of places like that, where it's just simply watching a lot.

1302
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,640
 Well, the least Liverpool I can tell you.

1303
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,840
 Drug-free canal.

1304
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,800
 Yeah.

1305
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,120
 And loads of joy-riders on the least Liverpool canal.

1306
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,480
 Going up four miles an hour.

1307
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,640
 I was reading a little about Britain's self-styled dullest man.

1308
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,680
 Because this is about standing around.

1309
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,680
 Yeah.

1310
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,520
 Anyway, I'm very proud to have been nominated.

1311
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,800
 Oh, actually.

1312
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,400
 I think he's called Kev.

1313
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,440
 And he was featured in the Guardian a couple of years ago,

1314
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,240
 because he's the man behind roundabouts of Redditch.

1315
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,080
 Oh, a calendar, which did enormously well about 20 years ago

1316
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,440
 and has led to a number of other works.

1317
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,200
 You know, roundabouts of Great Britain, Carparks of Britain.

1318
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,920
 Well, he's blown it, hasn't he?

1319
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,080
 You know, he can't be dull if you've been in the Guardian.

1320
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,760
 And you've got 12 books out.

1321
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,160
 He's sort of, he sort of has.

1322
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,040
 And he founded the Carpark Appreciation Society.

1323
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,480
 Claims to be the only member, but I did have a look and tried to join.

1324
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,240
 And I don't think it's a closed shop.

1325
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,840
 I don't know, I'm not sure he's admitting.

1326
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,440
 And he said, "My three ex-wives found me dull,

1327
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,160
 not in the bedroom, but in every other part of the house."

1328
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:34,680
 Hey, apparently there's been a study done by a professor in Brighton

1329
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,280
 who says, "The people that you shouldn't listen to about longevity.

1330
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,120
 There's one group of people you shouldn't listen to."

1331
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,240
 Oh, I would guess centenarians.

1332
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,080
 Yeah, people age 100 and more.

1333
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,640
 Why?

1334
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,080
 Their advice is just terrible.

1335
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,760
 They're like, "I ate one boiled egg and nothing else

1336
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,720
 for 70 years.

1337
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,680
 It's always detail that has no relevance.

1338
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,840
 What they have is probably very good genes.

1339
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,640
 And they've managed to survive despite the vices that they've taken in.

1340
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,680
 Despite upvice.

1341
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,160
 And the cocaine that goes with it.

1342
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,440
 Sorry, I forgot to add.

1343
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,200
 I always find that the idea that people are 100 and 7.

1344
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,440
 And they have, "Oh, I have three whiskies every night."

1345
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,840
 I think that's great.

1346
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,800
 Is this really true?

1347
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,880
 I mean, is there anything that's kept me drinking whisky?

1348
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,080
 No.

1349
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,680
 And I've got to age you too.

1350
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,160
 Oh!

1351
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:28,120
 All right, well time to wrap up.

1352
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,760
 Michael's died.

1353
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:36,600
 Okay, that is it.

1354
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,720
 That is all of our facts.

1355
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,080
 Thank you so much for listening.

1356
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,400
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things

1357
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,240
 that we've said over the course of this podcast,

00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,360

 Mine is @AndruHunterRam.

1364
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,360
 Michael, do you have one?

1365
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,800
 Social media accounts of any kind?

1366
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,840
 You've got a great website.

1367
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,080
 I don't have a social media account.

1368
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,200
 I don't think.

1369
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,560
 It's what would it be, you know?

1370
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,760
 Probably Michael Paylon.

1371
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,560
 Yeah.

1372
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,280
 Dalman.

1373
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,520
 Dalman2.

1374
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,720
 DalmanSeekswork.

1375
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:13,480
 Yeah, but MichaelPaylon.com, I believe it is.

1376
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,760
 If you go to your website,

1377
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,160
 Venezuela is out now and hardback as a book.

1378
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,960
 It's also a TV series that you can find that was on Channel 5.
