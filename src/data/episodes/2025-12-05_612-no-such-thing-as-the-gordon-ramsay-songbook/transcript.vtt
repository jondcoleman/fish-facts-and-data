00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.120
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.760
 of No Six Things, a fish where we decided

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.560
 that we would help a new up and coming comedian

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.840
 who is our guest today, Andy, can you remember their name?

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.960
 I can't quite recall.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.540
 - This is called Michael Paulin.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.760
 - Michael Paulin.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.760
 - Yeah, that's what I'm reading here.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.960
 Oh, I'm sorry, it's always Michael Paulin.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.280
 It's Michael Paulin.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.400
 - It's only bloody Michael Paulin.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.080
 - From everything, from Monty Python onwards.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.560
 We are so excited to have Michael on the show.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.000
 We hope you'll enjoy this one.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.240
 We certainly did recording, as you're about to hear.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.680
 He's amazing, it was such fun episode.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.720
 - He has a new book out.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.320
 A lot of the facts that you hear at the start of this podcast

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.840
 will be recounted in that book,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.880
 but there is so much more besides,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.160
 and that book is called, simply.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.840
 - Michael Paulin in Venezuela.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.400
 - Michael Paulin in Venezuela does exactly what it says

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.280
 on the ten, it's a brilliant book.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.480
 Dan has read it from cover to cover multiple times.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.520
 And he tells us that it's an incredible book,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.960
 so you should definitely go out and get that.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080
 And if you wanna know anything more about Michael,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.240
 then go to his website, it's MichaelPalin.com.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.000
 And there's so much on there.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.440
 Like you just can't, you'll be on there for weeks.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.360
 - Absolutely.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 And we have Club Fish,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.480
 which is our super secret, private, exclusive, extraordinary,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.560

 You can get bonus bits of Fish.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.160
 There is a longer version of the episode

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.800

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.360
 You can get FishXL.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.640

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.360
 of "No Six Things Affish" with Michael Palin.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.440
 And why not check out some of the other stuff he's done?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.800
 I've heard it's quite good.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.640
 - I think so.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.480
 I think so.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.520
 - I'm with the podcast.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.360
 - I'm with the show.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 (dramatic music)

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.560
 (upbeat music)

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.720
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.320
 (upbeat music)

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.760
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.400
 of "No Such Thing As A Fish"

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.080
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.480
 from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.880
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.600
 James Harkin, and Michael Palin.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.640
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.360
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Michael.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.360
 - In the Venezuelan Andes, there's a town called Millida,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.800
 and it has two entries in the Guinness Book of Records.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.760
 One is the tallest cable car in the world,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.520
 and the other is the El Adarier Colomoto,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.400
 which is an ice cream parlor,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.640
 which has the record number of ice cream varieties on sale.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.640
 860, including avocado, garlic, and trout.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.800
 (laughing)

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.640
 A trout ice cream, please.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.360
 - Oh, Daddy, can I have a trout ice cream parlor?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.360
 - Mushroom and wine, gyrkin, chili, shellfishes of some type.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.200
 You went to Venezuela, have you been to this town

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.320
 and to this specific ice cream parlor?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.000
 - Well, I haven't been to the ice cream parlor.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.560
 We were doing various other things.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.440
 I haven't been up on the amazing cable car,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.040
 which takes you right up in the mountains.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.640
 But I know where it was, the El Adarier Colomoto.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.080
 And it's obviously fallen on hard times.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.960
 I think it may have been superseded now

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.240
 by some other, probably in China.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.120
 There's another place that's got more.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.200
 - I really like the sound of,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.640
 is it, I'm going to pronounce it wrong.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.600
 Pabellon Crio, which is a traditional food,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 but it's five different kinds of ice cream, beef rice,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.520
 plantain, cheese, and black beans, so five little scoops

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.280
 with a scoop of chili on top.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.840
 - Well, on the flip side, they've got Viagra Hope,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.720
 which is blue like the pills.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.080
 So maybe, maybe those two are talking about it.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.000
 - Does it have any sort of natural ingredients, perhaps?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.240
 - It's only got honey and something else natural they don't use.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.280
 - Oh, we know that everything is an aphrodisiac,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.120
 really, isn't it?

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.560
 That's why they claim honey's an aphrodisiac for sure.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.720
 - Kippers, are they the only things?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.000
 - Kippers, no, they're not an aphrodisiac.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.200
 - Are they not, right?

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200
 - I don't think so.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.040
 - I've had a lot of kippers in my time.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.080
 - Yeah, no, my legs are man, man, crossed.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.240
 - I think you're right, Michael, that it's now,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.600
 it's now not selling 800 flavours anymore.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.520
 This was the glory days, but when the original owner

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.440
 was still trading, I think, and it's also been overtaken,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.400
 not by somewhere in China.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.280
 It's actually meag and muts craft creamery in Colorado.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.680
 - Oh, god, really?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.360
 - Well, how many do they do, and do they do garlic?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.000
 - I think it's something, they must have more than 860,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 so I can't imagine garlic isn't in there.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.480
 - If you walked in and you said,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.680
 "Do you have raspberry ripple?"

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.640
 And they go, "Oh, damn it!"

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.520
 - Exactly, chocolate, oh.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.600
 - But you did do the cable car.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.440
 - Yeah.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.920
 - Which sounds, I mean, it looks,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.000
 I mean, I don't really like cable cars

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.200
 where you're floating over a bit,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.400
 but it looks terrifying.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.040
 - I don't really, and they're big, gondolas,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.080
 and they take about 40 people.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.640
 So not only are you hanging from these very slim cables,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.240
 you've got 40 very large, you know,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.360
 Venezuela's also traveling with you.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.520
 But the thing is, it's not a continuous ride.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.040
 You have to stop at various places

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.840
 and get into another one, and so there are four stages.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.520
 But it is, I mean, it's amazing.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.760
 If you imagine, if you're a sort of geography teacher,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.080
 take a class up there,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.600
 and they could see all the different environments

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.560
 from the River Valley, with all its agriculture,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.320
 and all that, and the city itself.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.240
 To the very top, where it's all completely bleak,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.400
 and you end up alongside the highest peaking

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.680
 of Venezuela and Andes.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.520
 - It's pretty amazing.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.680
 I read that chapter in your book,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.400
 but in that chapter, you talk about it,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.160
 and you say that it's an hour journey, basically,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.000
 to get to the top.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 But in that time, you're traveling,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.240
 basically half the height of Everest.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.680
 So when you get to the top,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.640
 the oxygen level has changed vastly,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.960
 and you're all giddy, and there's all these signs

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.320
 in the gondola that are sort of talking about,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.440
 how you feel in, how's the old ticker doing?

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.920
 Is it feeling okay? - Yeah, I mean, it's quite extraordinary

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.600
 that people get in downtown.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.840
 You know, it seems like getting on a bus,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.840
 or something, and it's quite warm in Merida.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.680
 And you see these people like party goers,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.240
 and tiny little girls, and slim dresses,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.680
 sleepless dresses, and all that, and shorts skirts.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.280
 And they're getting up to half-large of Everest, do you know?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.320
 - I read that it was there,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.080
 because originally there was a ski track there.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.480
 - Oh, yeah. - There were some ski slopes,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.520
 'cause there was a big old glacier there,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.760
 which you could see from the city, but now it's gone.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.400
 - The dusty has gone in the last two years.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.160
 And they thought, well, it may return,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.440
 but it's now gone for good.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.760
 So there are a lot of things in the cable car saying,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.320
 this is how the plant is changing,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.960
 everywhere you go.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.720
 And then as well, there has no snow anymore.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.560
 - Michael, did you say,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.040
 'cause I was reading about some of the amazing creatures

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.400
 that live, I mean, it's a huge country.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.120
 It's equatorial, it's got a lot of amazing wild spaces.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.880
 So there is the Marida Cable Car Frog,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.320
 which you might have seen.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.160
 - What?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.000
 - What?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.160
 - What lives in the cable car, or what?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
 - It takes your tickets.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 - Yeah.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.840
 - Hello.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.600
 - Oh, you call me Frog, please.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.080
 - It just lives very near the stations of the cable car,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.000
 and it's been found nowhere else.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 So it's now called--

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.080
 - That's very interesting.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.280
 - Is it, sorry to say, is it found at the top and the bottom?

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.160
 So you can imagine that like it travels from one place

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.360
 to the other to mate, maybe, or to my grades?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.200
 - That's it.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.120
 - The male's 1,000 feet to mate.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.960
 - That's it.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.040
 - You've got, I really love somebody.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.600
 - Everyone's gone, they've all got their kippers ready.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.080
 - Honestly, the Assembra, the great migration

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.840
 of the cable car, Frog, they're just all of them

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.160
 in one gondola, just having up, yeah.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.160
 - Okay.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.320
 - The oil bird.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.400
 - Oh, I don't know if you saw that.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.040
 - Yes, actually, I did hear about the oil birds.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.720
 I hope it's not because in the olden days,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.400
 they used to take oily birds and then use them as candles.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.240
 I hope it's not that.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.080
 - Yeah, I'm really, I'm really sorry to say it, James.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.920
 - It is.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.920
 - They did use them as--

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.760
 - Oh, yeah, they didn't go.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.720
 - They had a very high fat content,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.520
 and I'm afraid it's especially the baby oil birds.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.520
 - Oh, oh, no.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.280
 - And they basically were burnt down to make oil.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280
 But they're an amazing animal.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.800
 They're the only birds, or one of very, very few birds,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.800
 which uses echolocation.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.640
 - Yeah.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.480
 - So we're used to that in bats,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.440
 but they make a stream of high pitch calls

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.200
 and have it as they live in very dark caves,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.560
 and that's how they get around.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.400
 - Another animal they had in Venezuela was a guinea pig

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.680
 the size of a fiat 500.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.960
 - Just one.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.800
 - Did you see that?

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.520
 - Did you see that when you were there, Mike?

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.560
 (laughing)

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.520
 - I saw lots of fiat 500s.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.600
 Not none of them, you know?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.760
 - Did you check the whiskers?

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.400
 I didn't have fur all over the place.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.560
 - I'm afraid it was many hundreds of thousands of years ago.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.320
 We only know about them because of their teeth,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.200
 and we've extrapolated the size.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.040
 - Wow.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.280
 - But there were 10 times the mass of the largest living rodent

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.120
 today.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.960
 - Go on.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.800
 - Wow, fantastic.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800
 - Which is the largest living rodent,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.400
 also in Venezuela, is a cappibara,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.320
 which is apparently the largest living rodent.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.320
 - Have you seen one?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.160
 - Yeah.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.000
 - Yes.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.920
 - You're not very impressed.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.720
 - No, they're a bit sad, really.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.480
 Like, they were supposed to be a model

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.720
 for another kind of creature,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.920
 but they didn't get the fittings.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.680
 So that's pretty basic, four legs and a sort of back

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.600
 and a nose, but there's nothing very distinguished about them.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.120
 - When you went to Peru, did you eat guinea pig?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.280
 'Cause that's like a big delicacy over there,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.040
 and every market they sell guinea pig and stuff.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.480
 - Not knowingly.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.280
 No, I mean, seriously, you don't ever know half the time.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.120
 - No.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.960
 - What you're eating.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.600
 - Are you one when you go to all the different countries

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.640
 that you like to try different foods that they have

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.600
 and stuff, or are you not really,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.440
 you'd rather have these things?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.920
 - No, I like to, 'cause it's part of getting to know people

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.600
 and meeting people is, you know, hospitality offered

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.000
 has to be taken, otherwise people get to be defended.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.560
 And also there's this feeling,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.200
 oh, you're going abroad with a food at your home.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.840
 - Oh, we're going to France.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.680
 - Oh.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.520
 (laughing)

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.480
 And yet the people in these countries

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.800
 don't want to poison themselves.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.560
 They're not making bad food.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.000
 And we're wishing they had McDonald's or something like that.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.600
 They make strange ingredients sometimes,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.680
 but always very, very well cooked.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.160
 - I so wish you were the opposite

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.440
 that you would go to the ice cream shop

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.040
 and just go, "Vinilla, please."

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.880
 - Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.480
 - I think I might have said this before in this show.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.960
 One of my favorite Beatles facts is that

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.720
 when the Beatles went to India

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.000
 for their great, you know, spiritual awakening

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 and all of this, Ringo started a suitcase

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.280
 of baked beans with him, like a full chocoblock.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.120
 - Yeah.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.480
 - Just so he didn't run out of baked beans.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480
 I just, I love that.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.200
 - Well, when we did around the 180 days,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.120
 I remember that, the soundman, Ron,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.760
 he didn't like foreign food and he'd got all these tins

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.680
 of canned food.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.240
 We end up on a dow, you know, just very, very basic.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.440
 There's no cabins in there.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.320
 You all sleep on deck together.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.640
 - That boat, sorry, a dow.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.480
 - Yes, a dow.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.240
 So it's a big, the old sailing boat.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.480
 So they use around the African coast

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.120
 and on the Gulf, Persian Gulf and all that.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.640
 So we got on the thing and, you know,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.280
 comes to the evening and the guys

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.120
 are all fishermen from India, very, you know, not wealthy at all.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.960
 And so we get our food out and they get their food out.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.440
 And the first thing that gets out is a tuna

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.440
 from Sainsbury and it sort of comes out of the can,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.640
 like a sort of oily mass.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.440
 It goes boi oil and goes onto the plate

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.840
 and sort of wobbles there and it's sweating slightly.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.280
 (laughing)

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.600
 I said, right, we're going to have that.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.640
 And these guys, these wonderful guys are,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.680
 the fishermen said, you know, please,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.080
 I could see that some of us didn't really know that is.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.320
 We're making a curry, we'll share it with you.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.920
 And they did.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.280
 And from then on, we always had what they had.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.640
 You know, the tins were put to one side.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.480
 - Yeah.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.600
 - Did Ron stay with the tins?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.320
 - Ron, you know, Ron, we threw him overboard.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.640
 (laughing)

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.600
 The tins strapped him, maybe sank immediately.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 (laughing)

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.200
 - I noticed, Michael, in your book,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.200
 that Venezuela is your 100th country

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.320
 that you have visited.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.720
 - More or less, or you think that's--

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.880
 - No, I think that's right.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.720
 I'm a bit of a list nerd and I kept a list.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.560
 - So you've kept a list?

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.400
 'Cause that's what I was gonna ask.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.160
 You can now do a top 100 of countries of the world

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160
 that you've visited.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.360
 So where does Venezuela just off the top of your head?

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.240
 Where does that rank?

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.200
 - I was thinking about 93, really.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.040
 (laughing)

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.880
 I'm full of positive thoughts about Venezuela at the moment.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.640
 Oh, sorry, I see what you mean, sorry.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.560
 - Yeah, no, try it.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.400
 - Three.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.720
 - Three or nine.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.880
 - Wow, okay.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.480
 - Yeah, sorry, math is good, that's trying to do it.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.480
 - Yeah, so there was an interesting point

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.560
 about the airport when you arrived,

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.960
 which is, I wondered if you were aware of this.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.600
 This might have stopped now, but you were paying tax

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.760
 in the airport and one of the taxes that you would pay

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.400
 were for the air you were literally breathing.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.160
 Because they tax the air, it's a ventilation system

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.000
 that they have and they say we're providing clean air.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.560
 - Oh, just so far and as I guess.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.400
 - Yeah, I'm guessing so.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.240
 - Must be, yeah.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.480
 - Just in the airport, it's not a whole country.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.320
 - No, just now.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.280
 - You go, breathe in, and don't breathe out for three weeks, okay?

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.640
 You save a lot of money.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.240
 (laughing)

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.240
 - Because they did have the world record

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.960
 for the lowest petrol price in 2016.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.080
 Wow, I was trying to look at some other records

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.120
 that Venezuela have had.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.800
 It was one cent per litre.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.560
 And at the time, the price in the UK was 110.7 pounds per litre.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.760
 I was trying to work out if I could do some kind of business

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.280
 where I offset the price of the flight, but it feels like

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.320
 you're going to run into some legal difficulties, I think.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.560
 You can try and bring it back in hand luggage or whatever.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.600
 - Well, they've got a lot of,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.040
 we need to rush this episode out basically

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.520
 before America invades.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.640
 So one of the things that Venezuela has is a lot of oil.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.000
 But it's not really used to supply a lot more

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.840
 to the global market, I think it provides less now.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.160
 - Well, it's just sanctions.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.840
 - Sanctions also, oil price sort of fell.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.640
 So other countries are producing a lot more oil.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.400
 But I mean, there is more oil still in the ground

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.160
 in Venezuela than any other country.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.080
 - They're not just ringing out oil birds.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.040
 - No, that's not the oil birds.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.720
 - Very pleased, you know, they're not needed.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.840
 - I found a couple of records that have held as well

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.040
 in Venezuela.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.560
 This is Guinness World Records.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.840
 The living person with the largest feet.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.680
 - Oh, really?

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.520
 - Yes.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.000
 - The bike foot measures at 40.55 centimeters

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.240
 and the left foot at 40.47 centimeters.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.080
 - Now Dan, do you Google Bigfoot Venezuelan?

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.800
 (laughing)

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.760
 - Now these are their own feet.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.040
 It's not someone just has two extraordinary large feet

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.880
 which is beneficial.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.920
 - Yeah, no, it's one person with one foot.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.800
 - I read an interview with this guy.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.800
 And he said that he realized he had big feet

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.600
 when he and his friends would often compare their foot sizes

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.520
 and he would come out on top each time.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.320
 - I was like, what are his legs doing?

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.400
 Charlie's always gonna be him, but we're not like,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.080
 - Unless they're clowns and they're just naturally

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.080
 an oversized shoes.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.920
 - That's good.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.760
 - You can't tell.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.600
 But does he do something for a living that's foot,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.080
 I don't know what advantage he would.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.920
 - Not reach.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.760
 - Yeah foot.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.080
 - What is it?

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.320
 What do you do if you've got very, very large feet?

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.480
 - Real life, Monty Python opening credits.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.480
 (laughing)

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.800
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.400
 (upbeat music)

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.200
 - Okay, it is now time for fact number two

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.560
 and that is my fact.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.480
 My fact this week is that in 1949,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.000
 the BBC issued a company-wide ban

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.440
 on making any rude jokes about solicitors, chambermaids,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.760
 and one very specific Irishman called Mr. McGillicutty.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.600
 - Wow.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.440
 - This is one guy.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.280
 - Yeah.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280
 - Well, it's so funny about him.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.440
 - There was people who continued to make jokes

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.440
 about this man, Ross McGillicutty of the reeks.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.280
 - Of the reeks, yes, McGillicutty's reeks.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.120
 - I've heard of that.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.960
 - Well, there you go.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.440
 And I imagine there was fun to be had.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.960
 - It is quite a funny name, isn't it?

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.800
 - Yeah, I found that.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.640
 - He got a big comedian.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.640
 - Oh, he got that.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.320
 - So what had happened was there was a comment

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.680
 called Leonard Henry, not Lenny Henry, Leonard Henry.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.880
 And he'd found the name of McGillicutty of the reeks

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.960
 in an atlas and bought it was a place

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.200
 and then turned it into a comedy person.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.000
 And then this person who really existed said,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.680
 well, I never gave you permission to use my name

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.280
 and the BBC had to apologize.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.120
 - Yeah.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.160
 - And there's still a McGillicutty of the reeks

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.000
 to this day.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.820
 - Yeah.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.200
 - So this title and the reeks is I think a range of,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.920
 it's an ancestral territory in County Kerry.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.760
 So there's a range of mountains, which is called the reeks.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.120
 And the last evidence I have found

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.080
 of the current McGillicutty of the reeks

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.160
 is him writing to the daily telegraph in 2017

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.240
 about the price of stamps.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.520
 He's about 85 now.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.680
 And I believe he looks after the earnham herd of cattle.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.600
 That's the latest news on the McGillicutty of the reeks.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.560
 - Have you ever laughed at someone like that?

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.280
 - He's a serious man.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.280
 Does he have any administrative powers?

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.320
 I mean, does he like a sheriff or something like that at all?

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.400
 - He might do, 'cause it's sort of honoree.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.240
 It's an honoree thing.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.440
 You're sort of a chief of family.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.880
 Chief of the name is the term that gets used.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.360
 And this like senior McGillicutty of the 1930s and 40s

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.240
 was a big deal.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.800
 You know, he was an officer of the British Army.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.440
 He was an Irish senator.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.360
 He was, you know, all sorts of serious.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.200
 And he just objected very strongly

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.360
 to being choked about.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.200
 - He did try.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.040
 - He complained.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.280
 The BBC said, come on, it's never a place.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.120
 - Yeah.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.960
 - Come on.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.800
 - It's a joke.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 - Just reeks of envy for me.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.640
 - Yeah.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.280
 - But then he said that he'd never appeared or contemplated

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.960
 appearing before the public for their amusement.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.800
 - Okay.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.640
 - So you must apologize immediately.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.480
 - Right.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480
 - The music haved.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.320
 - They did.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.000
 And they produced this thing called the Green Book,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.200
 unofficially called the Green Book.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.040
 It was a pamphlet that was sent internally.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.360
 And it was largely sent to people kind of like Spike Milligan

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.440
 and comedians of that ilk who were writing topical,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.680
 not topical shows necessarily,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.000
 but shows that were going out live weekly.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.560
 And so it came with a long list of things, jokes about lavatories,

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.040
 immorality of any kind.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.680
 You couldn't make any suggestive references to honeymoon couples,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.280
 fig leaves, ladies underwear, baskets.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.200
 Because baskets could be used as a new endo in sexual relation.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.840
 You could, if you, a nicely placed basket

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.600
 in a sentence could suggest sex.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.440
 - What?

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.080
 - Yeah, it was used as a replacement word, let's say.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.600
 - I'm sure Shakespeare used baskets of China.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.440
 He must have seen it.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.280
 - He must have seen it.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.560
 It must have been a hot bag.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.560
 (laughing)

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.360
 - Did you ever come across the censors yourselves, Michael?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.360
 - Yeah, we had some censorship on Python.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.200
 - Yeah.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.680
 - What did they object to?

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.720
 - Were they objected to the word masturbation?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.560
 - Oh yeah.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.040
 - What is this?

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.520
 - I'll give you the context, you know what I'm saying?

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.480
 So you're just gonna, if you just come out and say,

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.600
 "Oh, we love the later sketch, Michael."

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.800
 - No, no, we're not sure, we're sorry.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.000
 - It was cut out of the power sketch.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.600
 It was not interested in masturbation.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600
 (laughing)

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.960
 No, the context was we did a sort of northern quiz show,

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.960
 sort of an onstage thing where people came on stage.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.560
 And it was a, it was a thing, I said, I didn't,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.320
 but people had to sum up, proofs.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.520
 - It was, it was officially called

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.080
 the all-England summarized proofs competition.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.440
 - The all-England proofs competition.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.200
 So they had 15 seconds to summarize proofs.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.520
 Anyway, the ones that comes up,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.560
 and they get a little cheery,

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.000
 will frid pickles, oh, hello, how are you?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.920
 What are your hobbies?

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.400
 And this man's hobbies are strangling animals,

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.880
 golf and masturbation.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.040
 (laughing)

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.160
 It was a huge laugh.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.480
 And anyway, very quickly, the sketch itself.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.520
 This one, my favorite bits, because, all right,

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.360
 you've got 15 seconds now.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.320
 Summarize proofs in this master work,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.320
 and all the various volumes of proofs

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.480
 were on the sort of thermometer.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.920
 (laughing)

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.440
 So he goes, oh, yeah, oh, ah, did it,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.240
 that on verb, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.360
 swan comes along, swan comes along, swan comes,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.360
 and bings, but the, the BBC said you can't,

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.920
 they reviewed the tape and said you can't say masturbating.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.920
 And so you'll have to cut it out.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.680
 And in those days, we recorded on tape,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.840
 so you had to physically cut the tape.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.440
 So our director said he cut the thing out,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.280
 the word masturbating, but he left the gap,

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.240
 which is brilliant, so you hear, what are your hobbies?

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.560
 Strung the animals, golf, huge laugh.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.720
 (laughing)

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.520
 Never has golf got a laugh, absolutely colossal laugh.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.320
 And that's a good summary of the life of proofs

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.880
 from what I remember.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.720
 - Probably.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.720
 - He spent, I mean, he was in his bedroom for a lot of time.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.880
 - Very true. - He was.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.800
 - He was, I think he was putting pins in mice or something,

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.000
 wasn't he when he was a kid?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.840
 - Was it?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.680
 - I think so.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.920
 - I've never heard of him playing golf,

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.160
 and I would know if proofs play golf, I would know that.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.240
 - I love the shame.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.480
 - I love that there's a great story in your diaries,

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.880
 the Python years, the first diaries,

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.120
 which is that you had obviously the most famous story

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.320
 of censorship and banning in comedy history, life of Brian,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.360
 and all the things that you guys had to do

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.520
 in order to say that this wasn't an attack on religion.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.640
 It was, you know, Jesus is not being mocked

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.760
 and it was the big thing, right?

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.760
 And you got banned in places like Norway,

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.640
 and in the diary, you point out that in Sweden,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.120
 the posters read so funny, it was banned in Norway.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.840
 - Yeah, I just think that's fantastic.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.760
 - Yeah.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.520
 - And you, because it was a great moment,

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.160
 'cause it did get banned in a lot of places

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.360
 from cinema altogether,

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.680
 and one of those places was in Wales,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.760
 and that was overturned by the mayor,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.640
 Sue Jones Davies, who happened to be in the life of Brian.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.800
 - She was Brian's girlfriend,

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.000
 skipping around naked.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.840
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.800
 - She was the revolutionary leader.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.000
 - So she suddenly becomes mayor of Aberystwyth,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.760
 and for one night, she says,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.040
 "I'm going to overturn the ban."

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.160
 And Terry and myself and her went to the local Odin

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.320
 in Aberystwyth, with arms, links,

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.960
 like, you know, we were all in the sort of,

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.800
 tell them a much, or something like that.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.360
 We saw one night of life in Brian.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.360
 I think it was banned in the night after that, yeah.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.400
 - I was looking at a few songs

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.240
 that maybe should have been banned,

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.400
 'cause the BBC had a lot of rules about songs as well.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.240
 - Yeah.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.080
 - So they banned things like,

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.720
 "My Generation," by the who?

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.560
 - Really?

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.840
 - '60s classic, that was banned.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.080
 Not because of any profanity.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.720
 It was banned because it has a stammer.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.560
 - A stammer?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.400
 - I was mad.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.240
 - I really liked it.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.080
 - People put, you know, that it's--

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.040
 - Yeah, and that was just that people with a stammer

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.880
 will find that offensive.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.280
 - That's interesting.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.240
 - Space Audity by David Bowie was banned

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.880
 because it was, I think it was banned

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.840
 until Neil Armstrong had safely got back to Earth.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.680
 - Oh, really?

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.520
 - It out.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520
 - Okay, yeah, I'm stronger than Collins,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.520
 because they thought, oh, it's a bit sensationalist.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.680
 - Oh, really?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.520
 - Yeah.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.440
 - Very clear, he's stuck in a tin can, of course, right?

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.440
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.760
 But there's this whole, there's this whole genre of songs

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.320
 called "Dirty Blues" from the '20s and '30s,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.800
 which are all sort of, they're all black singers,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.880
 many women, but the lyrics and the song titles

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.960
 are so extraordinarily rude.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.200
 I can't believe the songs are released, basically.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.760
 So I just want to give you a few of them.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.920
 - Yeah, for it.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.720
 - Please warm my weenah.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.360
 I mean, that's the single "On Tundra" it's basically.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.640
 - Yeah, they're really popular, but get 'em

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.240
 from the peanut man, brackets, hot nuts.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.640
 - Yeah.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.440
 - Lil Johnson was one of the women singing these.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.080
 Let me roll your lemon.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.480
 Sort of just about the "Dubel on Tundra."

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.640
 My stove is in good condition.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.640
 - It's good.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.240
 - Any news of her basket?

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.520
 - Anybody want to buy my cabbage?

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.480
 - That's not rude.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.400
 - Well, the way she sings it is, sorry.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.160
 - It sounds like sort of Gordon Ramsay's songbook, really.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.040
 (all laughing)

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.480
 Margaret Carter, they were actually their loads of cooking ones.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.680
 So Margaret Carter had, I want plenty grease in my frying pan

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.200
 and meant this mini had, I'm selling my pork chops,

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.520
 but I'm giving my gravy away,

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.040
 which has lost me completely.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.760
 - Is that like my milkshake brings other bites to the yard?

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.280
 - I think it is, but with more pork.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.520
 - I think it's sort of, yeah.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.640
 More sex took place in the kitchen than anywhere else.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.920
 - That sounds like it.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.200
 - Do you know who's was the first song band

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.160
 from the BBC at somebody you've all heard of?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.360
 - So. - Okay.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.720
 - 1933.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720
 - 1933.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.960
 - Adolf Hitler.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.200
 - With his...

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200
 (all laughing)

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.200
 - Is that called "Chancellor's Waltz"?

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.880
 - 33.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.040
 - So we've all heard of.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.400
 Some of you've all heard of.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.160
 Someone from my part of the world.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.040
 - George. - George Foreman.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.040
 - I was about to say George Foreman.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:43.960
 - George Foreman. - George Foreman.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.040
 - George Foreman, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.160
 - His song with my little ukulele in hand was banned,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.960
 but he was a real double entendre.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.600
 - Yes, and lovely. - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.560
 - Like one of his songs, "My Little Stick of Black Poor Rock"

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.720
 goes, "It may be sticky, but I never complain.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.960
 It's nice to have a nibble of it now and again."

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.800
 (all laughing)

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.520
 - So. - That is sort of...

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.880
 - The role of double entendre is all the way for me.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.880
 - Very interesting.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.040
 - There was a number one hit in the UK,

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.720
 which was a very famous song, "Jetem."

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.360
 - Oh, yeah. - So Jamesburg, Jamesburg, again.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.560
 That was banned as well.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.360
 I read this in the monkey diaries.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.360
 Jane Berkins diaries, other diaries are available.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.160
 (all laughing)

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.960
 The problem that they had was it got too popular.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.760
 It got so popular that it made it to number one.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.520
 And so in order to be able to play it within the charts,

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.520
 they had to get an orchestral version of it

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.800
 and just play it completely without any voice

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.640
 at all.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.480
 'Cause it wasn't even the lyrics, it was the moaning.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.800
 - Yes, exactly. - That was the big problem of the song.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.880
 - It was a breathing, wasn't it?

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.240
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.800
 - And all these, my generation, all this,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.400
 this is why Radio Caroline became a big thing.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.240
 - Was that pirate?

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.840
 - Offshore pirate radio, because no one was playing

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.600
 any of these songs.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.120
 Yeah, I've got one last one, which I find pretty amazing,

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.160
 which is King Charles.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.480
 I didn't realize he was part of the reviews

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.800
 in Cambridge when he was there.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.440
 He did footlight smokers and he was part of them.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.480
 What does that mean, so?

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.040
 - So people--

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.160
 - People on stage, you do sort of funny things, don't you?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.120
 - Yeah, exactly, it's comedy stuff.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:13.960
 - It's comedy stuff.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.600
 - It's comedy, yeah, yeah, it's a smoker.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.080
 - Smoking room, yeah.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.960
 - You and Terry Jones were in Oxford,

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.720
 but Eric Idol and John Cleese and Graham Chapman

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.400
 would have been part of the Cambridge Footlight,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.400
 Breon the Fringe, all that.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.800
 And so he was part of the Cambridge Footlights.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.800
 And there's a story that goes that they were not allowed

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.720
 to make fun of him or his family

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.160
 while he was part of the footlights, which is pretty amazing.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.720
 And he did a few reviews, he was on stage quite a lot.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.880
 - Yeah, he was in the magic circle as well, wasn't he?

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.720
 - Really?

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.680
 - When he was Prince Charles, yeah.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.160
 Well, you guys with me when I didn't

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.200
 horror the magic circle, I can't remember who was there.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.040
 - We weren't allowed it.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.680
 - Well, we went there and they told us about when,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.920
 'cause you have to do a trick to get into the magic circle

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.880
 and he did the balls trick like the cups and balls.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.040
 Apparently, not the best person who's ever done it,

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.640
 but they decided that it was good enough

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.240
 for him to join the magic circle.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.160
 - The edge of the throne.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.400
 - Yeah, I'm sorry, come again next week.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.480
 - I can make your head disappear, actually.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.000
 (laughing)

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.480
 - So he took part in two reviews.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.800
 One was called Revolution with a U instead of the U

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.120
 in the middle and quietly flows the Don.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.960
 And so you weren't allowed to make any jokes about him

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.840
 or royalty, but also the first play got in a bit of trouble

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.200
 in 1969 because they were putting it on a Sunday

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.280
 and the Lord's Day observant society got in touch

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.000
 and said, "Absolutely not."

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.640
 So it's basically a society looking out

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.960
 for anything going on on a Sunday that shouldn't be.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.360
 - And I'd rather think about them

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.280
 as they can only work on Sundays.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.600
 (laughing)

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.320
 - Can't do anything on a Saturday like this, exactly.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.400
 - Yeah, but yeah, apparently it was quite odd

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.040
 because when he was on stage, they would sell tickets

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.360
 to the smokers, as they were called,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.720
 the performances that you could go to.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.040
 And they would field in calls from Japan saying,

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.120
 "How many tickets are available?

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.280
 "We have a full plane load of tourists

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.760
 "who are ready to fly over to see the prints and performance."

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760
 - Well, there we are.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.160
 He's still performing, isn't he really?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.360
 - Yeah, he is.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.760
 - And he's what he learned for the footlights.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.960
 Probably very useful for public life, you know.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.440
 - And the magic circle he made prints Andrew disappear?

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.280
 - Yes.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.280
 (laughing)

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.880
 (upbeat music)

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.520
 - Okay, there's time for fact number three,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.720
 and that is Andy.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.240
 My fact is, the rescue team who tried to find

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.000
 the Lost Franklin Expedition did so

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.200
 with rockets, kites, flashing lights, gunshots, horns,

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.400
 drums, and by putting collars on Arctic foxes.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.080
 - Hmm, wow.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.680
 - It didn't work, we should say.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.520
 - And that's sad.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.360
 - Well, the collars, was this before

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.880
 they had some radio equipment?

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.240
 So I mean, you just put the collars on,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.520
 there was no recording device.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.440
 - Yeah, 100%.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.120
 - 100%. - So what they did?

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.240
 - This is in the 1840s and '50s.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.880
 This expedition, which you've written about Michael,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.200
 went north over Canada.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.240
 They were trying to find a shorter route through the Arctic

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.200
 because that will be amazing for shipping.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.680
 There's fabled things called the Northwest Passage,

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.200
 and it would cut thousands of miles.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.360
 - So this is before the Panama Canal, right?

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.200
 - Yes, it is.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.120
 - So they previously had to go all the way down South America.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.160
 - Exactly, and it's just a very, very long route

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.040
 to sail from Europe to Asia, basically.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.800
 So if you could find the Northwest Passage,

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.880
 it would be a huge boon to mankind.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.960
 And this expedition went out, the Franklin expedition,

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.880
 two ships, terror and aerobus.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.080
 They went missing, and a lot of search parties went out for them.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.440
 And some sources estimate more than 30 search missions went out.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.280
 - And one of them.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.960
 - Mostly financed by his wife.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.440
 - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.760
 - And he determined that she could find him

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.960
 and everyone was saying, "No, it's too late now, he's dead."

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.840
 And one of them decided to put collars on foxes,

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.080
 Arctic foxes, wild fox cubs,

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.080
 which had the coordinates of where they were,

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.080
 saying, "We are looking for you.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.120
 This is where we are based."

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.320
 And they just released the foxes into the wilds.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.600
 And it was clever, it didn't work.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.340
 I mean, the foxes, I imagine,

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.680
 - It's the survivors.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.520
 (laughing)

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.000
 - Normally they're there to read them.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.800
 - No, exactly, they're all inew it.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.080
 So they wouldn't say, "What does this mean?"

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.560
 - Yeah, so read that.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.720
 - It's simply did not work.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.080
 - That's a fascinating fact.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.560
 - So they did some very strange things at that time.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.080
 It was a kind of hysteria to try and find him

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.920
 and a refusal to admit that they might be dead.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.840
 Because they basically completely got it wrong.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.680
 The whole expedition was given enormous amounts of money.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.360
 They had lots of wine on board and libraries

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.640
 and all that sort of thing.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.920
 And they just took a wrong turn and got stuck down

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.280
 a sort of fairly narrow stretch of water

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.920
 where it was quite an extreme winter then.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.640
 And that froze and they were stuck.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.320
 So yeah, thank all the wines.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.360
 So when the spring comes, it's a melt and they go off,

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.960
 the spring didn't melt.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.600
 There was two or three years of the worst

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.800
 and the coldest winters up in the Northwest Passage.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.520
 So basically, we just stuck there for about two years,

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.360
 ran out of food, went out trying to get the trade

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.120
 with the inew it, but they didn't do that very well.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.880
 Because no one had actually done the research

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.520
 and saying, "Well, how do we speak to inew it?"

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.600
 The people who lived there.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.000
 So when it came to wanting to be helped by those people,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.840
 they couldn't do it.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.000
 Whereas later, Amundsen or something like that

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.320
 was very much a sort of, you know,

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.840
 the ground you're on sort of traveler.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.760
 He always knew what to ask the local people, right?

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.600
 So it was a bit arrogant really.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.600
 So frankly, next.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.440
 Well, were they a bit unlucky with the weather,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.960
 like if they'd gone a few years later?

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:48.480
 Yeah, I mean, I think it was these two very, very cold winters.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.320
 But they'd also, you know, they've gone a slightly different route

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.240
 and not gone down.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.880
 They took like a shortcut, and then it got trapped.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.360
 And the ice is always stronger when you've got the confined space.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.280
 So if they've gone a bit further ahead,

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.760
 where there's more open water, they might have got through.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.280
 The absolute disappointment of the ice

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.520
 not melting that spring must have been.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.600
 Yeah, must be near the spring now.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.920
 So you wrote a brilliant book about aerobus,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.440
 and you went and visited a lot of these places as well.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.480
 I mean, it's pretty fascinating

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.360
 that it was lost for so long only found in 2014.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:21.880
 Yeah.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.200
 I mean, that's remarkable.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.920
 Well, the end of it at the time in the late 19th century,

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.320
 people went out there, said they had seen a ship,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.320
 or the master of a ship, they knew exactly where it was.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.680
 But there was sort of, because they only had an oral tradition,

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.960
 didn't write things down.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.080
 People thought, oh, wow, they're just saying that.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.160
 And they didn't find it up.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.320
 And in the end, aerobus was found almost exactly

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.280
 where they had said a hundred and a hundred years

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.080
 with their local residents was just going on.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.280
 Frayed so, yeah.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.520
 It's a real sort of imperial sort of attitude you have.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.600
 No, no, you don't know.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.200
 There's just, you just lived here for 500 years.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.040
 Yeah, we know.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.960
 I think we, the 31st Expedition.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.160
 Yeah, we wanted to find them without any help from you guys.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:04.960
 Thank you.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.960
 Colin Wolfson, you go.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.000
 Oh, I should say where I saw the,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.920
 I've seen one of these collars in the flesh.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.680
 It's so exciting.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.200
 Oh, wow.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.800
 It's a few of us.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.760
 With words on it.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.280
 Yeah.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.120
 And the coordinates.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.640
 Behind the scenes at the Royal Geographical Society,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.320
 which I believe you've been president.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.760
 I was president for three years.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760
 Yeah.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.080
 And they have, in the back rooms,

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.200
 they have these amazing collections of extraordinary stuff,

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.560
 because it was founded in 1830 and basically contributed

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.160
 to founding geography as a discipline.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.280
 Geography is a much newer area of study than many others.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.560
 So it's an incredible place.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.760
 And they've got these collars there as amazing to say.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.760
 Very cool.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.920
 The thing is, which is quite interesting,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.640
 I think one of the many attempts to find out where they were,

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.880
 was a ship called HMS Resolution.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.960
 That was about sort of five of us out there left.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.520
 And the desk from the captain's cabin,

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.720
 the HMS Resolution, is the desk in the White House?

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.720
 Oh, really?

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.720
 It's in the White House offices.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.280
 I have heard it called the Resolution desk.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.360
 I have not found what that came from the search for Franklin.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.840
 Isn't Trump just trying to turn that into a solid gold desk?

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.360
 It will be easier if he's guilty in that right now.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:11.880
 Yeah.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.760
 And I read that they took 8,000 tins of food for the voyage.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.760
 Sounds like Ron.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.760
 Exactly.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.760
 You're Ron, mate.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.760
 You're a ship, haven't you?

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.760
 Yeah.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.760
 And nobody, Tino.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.760
 Oh, come on.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.160
 We could ask the locals, no, no.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.720
 And 7,088 pounds of tobacco, which, according to my calculation,

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.800
 in today's money would be enough for three million cigarettes.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800
 Yeah.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.240
 Which really, really, enough, wouldn't it?

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.400
 But yeah, I think a lot of people thought

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.640
 that the tins were the problem.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.640
 Right.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.440
 So a lot of the men went away from the ship,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.200
 maybe to try and find the way off somewhere.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.520
 But they walked away with the load of stuff they wouldn't really need,

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.040
 like button polish and curtain rods, sort of writing desk and stuff.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.040
 Time to try and get it.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.840
 And people thought, well, maybe they went mad.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.520
 And I think now we do think that there was some lead poisoning.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.720
 And for a long time, they thought it was the tins of food,

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.320
 because they were soldered with lead.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.440
 Now, I think we're not quite so sure it might have been

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.400
 because the pipes in the boat had lead in them.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.880
 Because the levels of lead were so high

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.920
 that it couldn't just be bleached from the tins.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920
 How interesting.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.560
 It was about 150 men in total.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.880
 129, I believe.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.960
 OK, right.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.840
 Like, all hands on both ships, not one of them survived.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640
 Is this right, Michael?

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.960
 I read this, and it sounded too wild to be true to me.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.520
 But is it the case that when you went out looking and writing the book

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.280
 that there's bits where in the snow,

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.480
 their footprints are sort of fossilized

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.200
 that you can see them in the ground?

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.040
 I don't know.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.800
 I mean, you can see there are graves,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.480
 the first people who died.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.720
 Right.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.880
 I'm not sure about the fossil.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.120
 OK, yeah, it felt weird.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.640
 Yeah, I mean, that's why I'm a fossil.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.520
 Yeah, but unless it was that Fener's Wailing guy with a massive--

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.120
 --he had no map, you 24 yards across.

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.640
 We died of large feet.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.280
 I'm able to cut his turn, then.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:09.320
 So I mean, it's a lumberjack's to get in there.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.080
 But they did find a lot of very well-preserved bodies, I believe.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.120
 And I don't know if they are.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.440
 I think they must have been dug up.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.680
 But bodies were found in 1984, incredibly well-preserved.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.280
 And you could see they had blue eyes.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.040
 So there was a crew member called John Torrington,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.680
 who was found 138 years after he died.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.960
 But he was put on people magazine's list

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.520
 of the most intriguing people of 1984.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.040
 Really?

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.000
 Yeah, yeah, wow.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.560
 Bit of a post-industrial recognition, which I suppose is nice.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560
 But you are on ice.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.800
 You know, that's what they say about like places like Everest.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.280
 Cryogenics and situation.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.360
 When they found Mallory's body, Mallory's body

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.320
 was just still Mallory's body.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.000
 It was there.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.400
 But they didn't get that many.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.040
 Not many of that many were brought back, actually.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.120
 We should say Lady Franklin as well.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.640
 Yeah.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.520
 So John Franklin was the commander of the whole mission, wasn't he?

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.000
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.360
 And I think there were questions about whether he was suitable,

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.520
 whether he was the best man to draw--

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.280
 Absolutely.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.360
 For a start, Franklin wasn't the first person

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360
 they wanted to lead it.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.520
 They wanted James Clark Ross to lead it,

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.040
 because he had extraordinary success in Antarctica in 1841

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.720
 and stood on places that no human being had ever been before.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.960
 But he didn't want to do it, quite rightly.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.040
 And so they got Franklin, because he was quite old at the time.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.200
 He was nearly 60.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.440
 But he ever liked him.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.200
 He was all right.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.840
 He was pretty intellectual.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.360
 And I spoke to everybody.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.640
 Yeah, I want to do it.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.760
 And his wife was very dynamic.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.000
 Must have pushed him forward and said,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.680
 "My husband's available."

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.680
 And here he is.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.120
 John, come in.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.280
 On the other hand, I read that James Ross, one of the reasons

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.160
 he declined this, because he promised his wife

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.280
 that he wouldn't go to any more polar expedition.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:47.800
 Yes.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.640
 So it's all we're blaming the wives for the whole thing of this.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.160
 That's such a great detail.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:52.640
 Yeah.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.120
 No, I promise my wife that we'll have to go get it.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.400
 If he's just done four years, you know, the Antarctic.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.280
 It's reasonable.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.080
 Where are you going?

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.680
 Just to enjoy the Antarctic.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.280
 Lady Franklin was very smitten with James Clarke Ross.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.640
 Oh, sort of dashing character.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.160
 Really?

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.600
 Tall, yeah, yeah.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.520
 That's why the wife didn't want him at all.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.200
 Actually, it doesn't say that it was his wife

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.840
 who didn't want him to go around.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.480
 Wow.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.400
 That's really interesting.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.520
 So James Clarke Ross led one of the expeditions.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.680
 And that was the one that put the collars on the foxes.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.680
 Really?

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.960
 And Lady Franklin did all the lobbying, didn't she?

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.200
 She said, we must send our search parties.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.240
 It's quite moving.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:41.600
 She wrote him letters for eight years after he departed.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.520
 And you know, the large majority of that time

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.040
 he would have died.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.280
 No one knew, for sure.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.200
 But what would happen to those letters?

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.360
 Would they just be kept in her house?

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.240
 Or would she post them and send it to Canada maybe?

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.160
 She would have had them indexed and looked after well.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.360
 Yeah, she had an assistant, a woman who worked with her.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.840
 And they organized the whole sort of rescue business

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.280
 down to the last detail.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.200
 So the letters, I'm sure, everything that she'd written

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.720
 would be kept.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720
 That's the other thing, right?

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.240
 Where they were going, there was no post box right.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.280
 So they didn't take a post box with them.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.440
 They should have done it in the true Imperial spirit.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.360
 We're going to put the first post box in the North.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.000
 I can imagine a postman coming to collect those

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.080
 definitely wearing shorts.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.560
 No collection on Sunday.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.760
 Well, the Lord's Day Observant Society have been in touch.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:43.280
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.640
 And that is James.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.480
 OK, my fact this week is that in Bologna,

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.360
 there is a word, um, a role, which describes

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.920
 a grumpy pensioner who stands with his hands behind his back,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.280
 complaining about road works.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.280
 The dream.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.560
 The dream for me, dream life.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.680
 We'll all end up there eventually handy.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.960
 You were a lot earlier than others, I'm sure.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.120
 Andy's there, I'm there.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.000
 So this is a term that was coined in 2005 by a writer

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.600
 called Danilo Masotti.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.360
 And he had noticed that there was a lot of people

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.160
 doing this in Bologna.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.320
 And they've decided that it's going to be a thing

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.720
 and they've really embraced it.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.400
 And now if you go to Bologna and they do road works,

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.080
 the people who are doing the work will talk to the umorals.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.720
 When they finish some works, they'll

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.080
 put a sign up saying where they're going

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.000
 to be next week so that the umorals can go and see them.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.200
 Wonderful.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.520
 And they was a very good way of institutionalizing grumpy

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.680
 pensioner.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.240
 Go ahead and deal with it.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.920
 And there was a Burger King advert in 2016

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.720
 about these guys. And in 2021, the word entered

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.640
 the official Italian dictionary.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.320
 Incredible.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.360
 So this is a real proper thing now.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.320
 Isn't the umorals sounds really nice?

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.040
 It sounds like a laxative, to be honest.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.840
 No, it's a very glamorous term for grumpy old men.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.360
 Yeah, but also it doesn't sound very Italian, I think.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.160
 Umoral.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.160
 Umorale.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.160
 Umorale.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.160
 Umorale.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.760
 I think it's the way you pronounce it.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.400
 Yeah, but he's a, it comes from a Bologna

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.400
 like regional dialects word, meaning little guy.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.680
 So is it, are they annoying to the builders?

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.000
 Are they looking through the fence?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.360
 And they're saying, I wouldn't put it there if I,

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.520
 I wouldn't put that R.S.J. there if I were you.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.080
 I think it all depends on the attitude of the builders.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:32.600
 OK.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.160
 I think some of the builders embrace it and like them.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.360
 And it's someone to chat to and, you know, they use the knowledge

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.640
 of people who have maybe done this job before or know about it.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.240
 And then there are other builders who go off my building site.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.240
 Yeah, a lot of these guys will be retired.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.960
 Yeah, no, no, no, don't put it through to Houston.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.360
 Oh, all right, we've made the tunnels.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.320
 Well, you should have asked us, asked us, yeah.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.080
 I just think a lot of these guys are going to be retired solicitors

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.480
 or people who are not, oh, yeah, builders.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.560
 There's a lot of people who thought that they kind of stand

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.480
 with their eyes and their backs.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.360
 You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, like a, like a sort of, that's a costume.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.880
 In, uh, Villa Santa, which is near Monza in the north of Italy.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.080
 Um, they have officially used these umorals.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.720
 And the local government have spoken to them and said, right,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.560
 you can stand next to this bit of world works and let us know

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.520
 if anything's wrong.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.920
 So they're like professional umorals.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.320
 All right, the government, the snitches as well.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.760
 Basically, and that's true.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.480
 I'd think of it like that, but I found a line.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:39.240
 You can get a 3D printed model of an umoral, uh, for your desk.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.160
 And the idea is you just pop him here and he will look there and work

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:43.720
 for your doing.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.200
 Yeah, and brilliant idea.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.920
 You'll get a lot more done because you're so frightened that he's going to complain.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.040
 It's just, it's lovely.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:54.760
 Yeah, I feel like I would very happily, even if, because I don't speak the language,

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.960
 just listen to a live stream of just the old man.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:03.320
 And I think the theory is a lot of these guys, well, they're all retarded.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.800
 Yeah.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.640
 And I think part of the theory is their wives do not want them around the household day.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.360
 So very much like Lady Franklin, they've said,

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.400
 "Why don't you pop out and discopital for passage?"

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.720
 And quite often what they'll do is they'll go in the morning,

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:20.040
 have their cappuccino, sit around, chat about the football scores or whatever.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.560
 But then once it comes to mid-morning, what do you do then, right?

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.040
 Ah, going to a lot of work's happening.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.400
 So you go and touch.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.400
 They sort of sound a bit like superannuated train spotters, really.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:31.880
 Yeah.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.040
 Rather than glamorous and Italian way, you know?

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.040
 They wouldn't be nerdy.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:42.200
 Train spotters, Italian, sort of, had seen all the Fellini movies.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.400
 I do really hope that you're just mentioning Franklin

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.240
 that there were a group of innuit old men just standing around the air of us.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.280
 I won't go down that.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.160
 I won't go down that.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.600
 Yeah, you're going down that body of water.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.760
 Sorry, mate, back up.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.480
 Michael, you're doing a live show at the moment.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.000
 And one of the themes is aging disgracefully, right?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.880
 As part of a--

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.640
 Is that sort of this?

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.120
 Yes.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.920
 Does that appeal, the idea of humoral, to be--

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.640
 Yeah, I mean, I'd like to be a bit more active.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.680
 But I think you just keep going.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.280
 And there's two ways of approaching age one is to sit in a chair.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.360
 And the others become fanatically busy.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.720
 And just say, I just got to have things to do all the time.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.960
 So I couldn't, you know, otherwise it's completely boring.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.680
 But some people choose one, some people choose the other.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.360
 There's another term that I really like.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.560
 The window side tribe, they're known as in Japan.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.160
 And it means an employee who at work is quite old.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.320
 And they can't really get them to do what they used to do.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.440
 So they sort of sideline them.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.880
 They just give them a desk by the window.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.800
 And they don't really do anything anymore.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.760
 So it's apparently the biggest dream, yeah.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.720
 It's quite big in Japan.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.120
 They just, rather than firing or retiring someone,

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.960
 they just take away all their responsibilities,

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.640
 put them by the window and just say,

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.680
 "All right, just keep going."

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.160
 That's called "execitive producer" that you beat yourself.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:08.520
 But it's true that most other countries

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.080
 have a more enlightened attitude to aging.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.880
 They think it's valuable that people get older.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.840
 I mean most tribal societies, you're the top man.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.160
 If you argue, the more you know,

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.640
 the more experience you can pass on to others.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.680
 So I'm the idea of care homes here.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.960
 It's quite sad, really.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.680
 Yeah, I quite like, you know,

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.640
 getting involved in a heist, for example,

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.480
 in your older years.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.400
 The fascinating story from a few years ago

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.920
 that the greatest, largest burglary in English history

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.320
 was committed by people in their 70s.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.520
 The oldest guy was 76.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.400
 That's the hat I'm talking about.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.560
 Was the hat in 2001, which is just pretty astonishing.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.480
 They went down an elevator shaft.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.520
 They drilled through.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.800
 They stole millions of pounds worth of stuff.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.240
 I didn't know they were that old.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.400
 They had a combined age of 500.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.880
 They just, oh, bloke from the pub, you know.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.560
 Let's go out and do it for real.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.320
 Yeah, and they had a history of having done

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.520
 quite a few heists in the past over a long career.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.200
 But they'd been scripted by Richard Osmond.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.040
 It just feels like quite so.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.320
 It just splashed.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.440
 One of them got to the high.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.160
 So I'm a boss using his pensioners past.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.560
 Like it was, ironically, his freedom pass.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.680
 Yes, yes.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.880
 Yeah.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.000
 But then what do you do with the money, really?

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.640
 Well, we never want to find out, because I've got less of your life

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.880
 to, you know, going up a few years to spend it.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.080
 Some of it still missing, isn't it?

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.920
 I think it is quite a lot of it, really.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.960
 So, and they're all going to come out at some stage.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.120
 We need to look for a care home that has installed, you know.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.080
 Gold tax.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.840
 Gold tax, Vegas style fountain.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.280
 That would be it.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.480
 It's called the Trump home.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.480
 Well, there's one mystery man still missing who's called Bazzle.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.680
 And there's a £20,000 reward on his head.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:55.480
 Did you find in the course of this, the word gongusula?

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.400
 No, it's basically the British umeral.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.960
 It's someone who stands and watches activity on a canal, quite specifically.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.040
 Is this voyeuristic or just finished?

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:11.320
 The canal activities that happen near me is basically graffiti.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.520
 Yeah, taking drugs.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.480
 Oh, really?

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.840
 I think hotbeds are vise.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.640
 I didn't know that.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.240
 Oh, well, I'm used to the Gentile Southern Kennet and Avon canals

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.240
 of places like that, where it's just simply watching a lot.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.640
 Well, the least Liverpool I can tell you.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.840
 Drug-free canal.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.800
 Yeah.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.120
 And loads of joy-riders on the least Liverpool canal.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.480
 Going up four miles an hour.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:35.640
 I was reading a little about Britain's self-styled dullest man.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.680
 Because this is about standing around.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.680
 Yeah.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.520
 Anyway, I'm very proud to have been nominated.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.800
 Oh, actually.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.400
 I think he's called Kev.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.440
 And he was featured in the Guardian a couple of years ago,

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.240
 because he's the man behind roundabouts of Redditch.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.080
 Oh, a calendar, which did enormously well about 20 years ago

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.440
 and has led to a number of other works.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:02.200
 You know, roundabouts of Great Britain, Carparks of Britain.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.920
 Well, he's blown it, hasn't he?

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.080
 You know, he can't be dull if you've been in the Guardian.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.760
 And you've got 12 books out.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.160
 He's sort of, he sort of has.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:14.040
 And he founded the Carpark Appreciation Society.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.480
 Claims to be the only member, but I did have a look and tried to join.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.240
 And I don't think it's a closed shop.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.840
 I don't know, I'm not sure he's admitting.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.440
 And he said, "My three ex-wives found me dull,

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.160
 not in the bedroom, but in every other part of the house."

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:34.680
 Hey, apparently there's been a study done by a professor in Brighton

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.280
 who says, "The people that you shouldn't listen to about longevity.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.120
 There's one group of people you shouldn't listen to."

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.240
 Oh, I would guess centenarians.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.080
 Yeah, people age 100 and more.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:45.640
 Why?

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.080
 Their advice is just terrible.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.760
 They're like, "I ate one boiled egg and nothing else

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.720
 for 70 years.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.680
 It's always detail that has no relevance.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.840
 What they have is probably very good genes.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:01.640
 And they've managed to survive despite the vices that they've taken in.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.680
 Despite upvice.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.160
 And the cocaine that goes with it.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.440
 Sorry, I forgot to add.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.200
 I always find that the idea that people are 100 and 7.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.440
 And they have, "Oh, I have three whiskies every night."

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.840
 I think that's great.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.800
 Is this really true?

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.880
 I mean, is there anything that's kept me drinking whisky?

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.080
 No.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.680
 And I've got to age you too.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.160
 Oh!

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:28.120
 All right, well time to wrap up.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:28.760
 Michael's died.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:36.600
 Okay, that is it.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.720
 That is all of our facts.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.080

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.400

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.520
 I'm on @Sriberland on Instagram.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.920
 My Instagram is nosy's thing that's James Harkin.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.400

 Mine is @AndruHunterRam.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.360
 Michael, do you have one?

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.800
 Social media accounts of any kind?

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.840
 You've got a great website.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.080
 I don't have a social media account.

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.200
 I don't think.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.560
 It's what would it be, you know?

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.760
 Probably Michael Paylon.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.560
 Yeah.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.280
 Dalman.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.520
 Dalman2.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.720
 DalmanSeekswork.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:13.480
 Yeah, but MichaelPaylon.com, I believe it is.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.760
 If you go to your website,

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.160
 Venezuela is out now and hardback as a book.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.960

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.840

 Goodbye.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.220

00:50:52.220 --> 00:51:02.220
