00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:06,"of No Six Things, a fish where we decided"
00:00:06,00:00:10,that we would help a new up and coming comedian
00:00:10,00:00:13,"who is our guest today, Andy, can you remember their name?"

00:00:16,00:00:17,- Michael Paulin.
00:00:17,00:00:18,"- Yeah, that's what I'm reading here."
00:00:18,00:00:20,"Oh, I'm sorry, it's always Michael Paulin."
00:00:20,00:00:22,It's Michael Paulin.
00:00:22,00:00:24,- It's only bloody Michael Paulin.
00:00:24,00:00:27,"- From everything, from Monty Python onwards."

00:00:47,00:00:48,- Michael Paulin in Venezuela.

00:01:47,00:01:50,(dramatic music)
00:01:50,00:01:53,(upbeat music)
00:01:53,00:01:56,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:56,00:01:59,(upbeat music)
00:01:59,00:02:05,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:05,00:02:07,"of ""No Such Thing As A Fish"""
00:02:07,00:02:09,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:02:09,00:02:11,from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:02:11,00:02:12,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:14,00:02:17,"James Harkin, and Michael Palin."
00:02:17,00:02:19,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:19,00:02:22,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:22,00:02:25,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:25,00:02:28,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Michael."
00:02:28,00:02:32,"- In the Venezuelan Andes, there's a town called Millida,"
00:02:32,00:02:36,and it has two entries in the Guinness Book of Records.
00:02:36,00:02:39,"One is the tallest cable car in the world,"
00:02:39,00:02:43,"and the other is the El Adarier Colomoto,"
00:02:43,00:02:45,"which is an ice cream parlor,"
00:02:45,00:02:48,which has the record number of ice cream varieties on sale.
00:02:48,00:02:53,"860, including avocado, garlic, and trout."
00:02:53,00:02:56,(laughing)
00:02:56,00:02:58,"A trout ice cream, please."
00:02:58,00:03:01,"- Oh, Daddy, can I have a trout ice cream parlor?"
00:03:01,00:03:06,"- Mushroom and wine, gyrkin, chili, shellfishes of some type."
00:03:06,00:03:10,"You went to Venezuela, have you been to this town"
00:03:10,00:03:12,and to this specific ice cream parlor?
00:03:12,00:03:15,"- Well, I haven't been to the ice cream parlor."
00:03:15,00:03:16,We were doing various other things.
00:03:16,00:03:19,"I haven't been up on the amazing cable car,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,which takes you right up in the mountains.
00:03:21,00:03:24,"But I know where it was, the El Adarier Colomoto."
00:03:24,00:03:28,And it's obviously fallen on hard times.
00:03:28,00:03:29,I think it may have been superseded now
00:03:29,00:03:32,"by some other, probably in China."
00:03:32,00:03:34,There's another place that's got more.
00:03:34,00:03:35,"- I really like the sound of,"
00:03:35,00:03:36,"is it, I'm going to pronounce it wrong."
00:03:36,00:03:39,"Pabellon Crio, which is a traditional food,"
00:03:39,00:03:43,"but it's five different kinds of ice cream, beef rice,"
00:03:43,00:03:47,"plantain, cheese, and black beans, so five little scoops"
00:03:47,00:03:49,with a scoop of chili on top.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"- Well, on the flip side, they've got Viagra Hope,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,which is blue like the pills.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"So maybe, maybe those two are talking about it."
00:03:55,00:03:58,"- Does it have any sort of natural ingredients, perhaps?"
00:03:58,00:04:01,- It's only got honey and something else natural they don't use.
00:04:01,00:04:03,"- Oh, we know that everything is an aphrodisiac,"
00:04:03,00:04:04,"really, isn't it?"
00:04:04,00:04:06,That's why they claim honey's an aphrodisiac for sure.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- Kippers, are they the only things?"
00:04:07,00:04:10,"- Kippers, no, they're not an aphrodisiac."
00:04:10,00:04:11,"- Are they not, right?"
00:04:11,00:04:12,- I don't think so.
00:04:12,00:04:15,- I've had a lot of kippers in my time.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"- Yeah, no, my legs are man, man, crossed."
00:04:19,00:04:22,"- I think you're right, Michael, that it's now,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,it's now not selling 800 flavours anymore.
00:04:24,00:04:26,"This was the glory days, but when the original owner"
00:04:26,00:04:30,"was still trading, I think, and it's also been overtaken,"
00:04:30,00:04:31,not by somewhere in China.
00:04:31,00:04:35,It's actually meag and muts craft creamery in Colorado.
00:04:35,00:04:36,"- Oh, god, really?"
00:04:36,00:04:40,"- Well, how many do they do, and do they do garlic?"
00:04:40,00:04:44,"- I think it's something, they must have more than 860,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,so I can't imagine garlic isn't in there.
00:04:46,00:04:47,"- If you walked in and you said,"
00:04:47,00:04:48,"""Do you have raspberry ripple?"""
00:04:48,00:04:50,"And they go, ""Oh, damn it!"""
00:04:50,00:04:52,"- Exactly, chocolate, oh."
00:04:52,00:04:55,- But you did do the cable car.
00:04:55,00:04:56,- Yeah.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"- Which sounds, I mean, it looks,"
00:04:57,00:05:00,"I mean, I don't really like cable cars"
00:05:00,00:05:01,"where you're floating over a bit,"
00:05:01,00:05:02,but it looks terrifying.
00:05:02,00:05:05,"- I don't really, and they're big, gondolas,"
00:05:05,00:05:07,and they take about 40 people.
00:05:07,00:05:10,"So not only are you hanging from these very slim cables,"
00:05:10,00:05:13,"you've got 40 very large, you know,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,Venezuela's also traveling with you.
00:05:15,00:05:18,"But the thing is, it's not a continuous ride."
00:05:18,00:05:20,You have to stop at various places
00:05:20,00:05:23,"and get into another one, and so there are four stages."
00:05:23,00:05:25,"But it is, I mean, it's amazing."
00:05:25,00:05:28,"If you imagine, if you're a sort of geography teacher,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,"take a class up there,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,and they could see all the different environments
00:05:32,00:05:35,"from the River Valley, with all its agriculture,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"and all that, and the city itself."
00:05:37,00:05:40,"To the very top, where it's all completely bleak,"
00:05:40,00:05:44,and you end up alongside the highest peaking
00:05:44,00:05:45,of Venezuela and Andes.
00:05:45,00:05:46,- It's pretty amazing.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"I read that chapter in your book,"
00:05:48,00:05:50,"but in that chapter, you talk about it,"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"and you say that it's an hour journey, basically,"
00:05:53,00:05:54,to get to the top.
00:05:54,00:05:56,"But in that time, you're traveling,"
00:05:56,00:05:58,basically half the height of Everest.
00:05:58,00:05:59,"So when you get to the top,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,"the oxygen level has changed vastly,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,"and you're all giddy, and there's all these signs"
00:06:03,00:06:06,"in the gondola that are sort of talking about,"
00:06:06,00:06:09,"how you feel in, how's the old ticker doing?"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"Is it feeling okay? - Yeah, I mean, it's quite extraordinary"
00:06:12,00:06:14,that people get in downtown.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"You know, it seems like getting on a bus,"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"or something, and it's quite warm in Merida."
00:06:19,00:06:22,"And you see these people like party goers,"
00:06:22,00:06:25,"and tiny little girls, and slim dresses,"
00:06:25,00:06:27,"sleepless dresses, and all that, and shorts skirts."
00:06:27,00:06:31,"And they're getting up to half-large of Everest, do you know?"
00:06:31,00:06:32,"- I read that it was there,"
00:06:32,00:06:35,because originally there was a ski track there.
00:06:35,00:06:36,"- Oh, yeah. - There were some ski slopes,"
00:06:36,00:06:38,"'cause there was a big old glacier there,"
00:06:38,00:06:41,"which you could see from the city, but now it's gone."
00:06:41,00:06:44,- The dusty has gone in the last two years.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"And they thought, well, it may return,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,but it's now gone for good.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"So there are a lot of things in the cable car saying,"
00:06:49,00:06:52,"this is how the plant is changing,"
00:06:52,00:06:53,everywhere you go.
00:06:53,00:06:56,"And then as well, there has no snow anymore."
00:06:56,00:06:57,"- Michael, did you say,"
00:06:57,00:07:01,'cause I was reading about some of the amazing creatures
00:07:01,00:07:03,"that live, I mean, it's a huge country."
00:07:03,00:07:07,"It's equatorial, it's got a lot of amazing wild spaces."
00:07:07,00:07:09,"So there is the Marida Cable Car Frog,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,which you might have seen.
00:07:11,00:07:12,- What?
00:07:12,00:07:13,- What?
00:07:13,00:07:15,"- What lives in the cable car, or what?"
00:07:15,00:07:16,- It takes your tickets.
00:07:16,00:07:17,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:07:17,00:07:18,- Yeah.
00:07:18,00:07:18,- Hello.
00:07:18,00:07:21,"- Oh, you call me Frog, please."
00:07:21,00:07:24,"- It just lives very near the stations of the cable car,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,and it's been found nowhere else.
00:07:26,00:07:27,So it's now called--
00:07:27,00:07:28,- That's very interesting.
00:07:28,00:07:31,"- Is it, sorry to say, is it found at the top and the bottom?"
00:07:31,00:07:34,So you can imagine that like it travels from one place
00:07:34,00:07:36,"to the other to mate, maybe, or to my grades?"
00:07:36,00:07:37,- That's it.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"- The male's 1,000 feet to mate."
00:07:39,00:07:39,- That's it.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"- You've got, I really love somebody."
00:07:42,00:07:44,"- Everyone's gone, they've all got their kippers ready."
00:07:44,00:07:47,"- Honestly, the Assembra, the great migration"
00:07:47,00:07:48,"of the cable car, Frog, they're just all of them"
00:07:48,00:07:51,"in one gondola, just having up, yeah."
00:07:51,00:07:52,- Okay.
00:07:52,00:07:53,- The oil bird.
00:07:53,00:07:54,"- Oh, I don't know if you saw that."
00:07:54,00:07:58,"- Yes, actually, I did hear about the oil birds."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"I hope it's not because in the olden days,"
00:08:00,00:08:03,they used to take oily birds and then use them as candles.
00:08:03,00:08:04,I hope it's not that.
00:08:04,00:08:07,"- Yeah, I'm really, I'm really sorry to say it, James."
00:08:07,00:08:07,- It is.
00:08:07,00:08:08,- They did use them as--
00:08:08,00:08:09,"- Oh, yeah, they didn't go."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- They had a very high fat content,"
00:08:11,00:08:14,and I'm afraid it's especially the baby oil birds.
00:08:14,00:08:15,"- Oh, oh, no."
00:08:15,00:08:18,- And they basically were burnt down to make oil.
00:08:18,00:08:19,But they're an amazing animal.
00:08:19,00:08:21,"They're the only birds, or one of very, very few birds,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,which uses echolocation.
00:08:23,00:08:24,- Yeah.
00:08:24,00:08:25,"- So we're used to that in bats,"
00:08:25,00:08:27,but they make a stream of high pitch calls
00:08:27,00:08:29,"and have it as they live in very dark caves,"
00:08:29,00:08:30,and that's how they get around.
00:08:30,00:08:33,- Another animal they had in Venezuela was a guinea pig
00:08:33,00:08:35,the size of a fiat 500.
00:08:35,00:08:36,- Just one.
00:08:36,00:08:37,- Did you see that?
00:08:37,00:08:39,"- Did you see that when you were there, Mike?"
00:08:39,00:08:40,(laughing)
00:08:40,00:08:42,- I saw lots of fiat 500s.
00:08:42,00:08:43,"Not none of them, you know?"
00:08:43,00:08:44,- Did you check the whiskers?
00:08:44,00:08:45,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:45,00:08:47,I didn't have fur all over the place.
00:08:47,00:08:50,- I'm afraid it was many hundreds of thousands of years ago.
00:08:50,00:08:52,"We only know about them because of their teeth,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,and we've extrapolated the size.
00:08:54,00:08:55,- Wow.
00:08:55,00:08:57,- But there were 10 times the mass of the largest living rodent
00:08:57,00:08:58,today.
00:08:58,00:08:58,- Go on.
00:08:58,00:08:59,"- Wow, fantastic."
00:08:59,00:09:00,"- Which is the largest living rodent,"
00:09:00,00:09:04,"also in Venezuela, is a cappibara,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,which is apparently the largest living rodent.
00:09:06,00:09:07,- Have you seen one?
00:09:07,00:09:08,- Yeah.
00:09:08,00:09:09,- Yes.
00:09:09,00:09:10,- You're not very impressed.
00:09:10,00:09:13,"- No, they're a bit sad, really."
00:09:13,00:09:15,"Like, they were supposed to be a model"
00:09:15,00:09:17,"for another kind of creature,"
00:09:17,00:09:18,but they didn't get the fittings.
00:09:18,00:09:22,"So that's pretty basic, four legs and a sort of back"
00:09:22,00:09:25,"and a nose, but there's nothing very distinguished about them."
00:09:25,00:09:28,"- When you went to Peru, did you eat guinea pig?"
00:09:28,00:09:31,"'Cause that's like a big delicacy over there,"
00:09:31,00:09:34,and every market they sell guinea pig and stuff.
00:09:34,00:09:35,- Not knowingly.
00:09:35,00:09:38,"No, I mean, seriously, you don't ever know half the time."
00:09:38,00:09:39,- No.
00:09:39,00:09:39,- What you're eating.
00:09:39,00:09:41,- Are you one when you go to all the different countries
00:09:41,00:09:43,that you like to try different foods that they have
00:09:43,00:09:45,"and stuff, or are you not really,"
00:09:45,00:09:46,you'd rather have these things?
00:09:46,00:09:49,"- No, I like to, 'cause it's part of getting to know people"
00:09:49,00:09:53,"and meeting people is, you know, hospitality offered"
00:09:53,00:09:58,"has to be taken, otherwise people get to be defended."
00:09:58,00:09:59,"And also there's this feeling,"
00:09:59,00:10:03,"oh, you're going abroad with a food at your home."
00:10:03,00:10:04,"- Oh, we're going to France."
00:10:04,00:10:05,- Oh.
00:10:05,00:10:06,(laughing)
00:10:06,00:10:09,And yet the people in these countries
00:10:09,00:10:10,don't want to poison themselves.
00:10:10,00:10:12,They're not making bad food.
00:10:12,00:10:16,And we're wishing they had McDonald's or something like that.
00:10:16,00:10:18,"They make strange ingredients sometimes,"
00:10:18,00:10:21,"but always very, very well cooked."
00:10:21,00:10:23,- I so wish you were the opposite
00:10:23,00:10:24,that you would go to the ice cream shop
00:10:24,00:10:26,"and just go, ""Vinilla, please."""
00:10:26,00:10:27,"- Yes, yes, yes, yes."
00:10:27,00:10:30,- I think I might have said this before in this show.
00:10:30,00:10:32,One of my favorite Beatles facts is that
00:10:32,00:10:34,when the Beatles went to India
00:10:34,00:10:37,"for their great, you know, spiritual awakening"
00:10:37,00:10:39,"and all of this, Ringo started a suitcase"
00:10:39,00:10:42,"of baked beans with him, like a full chocoblock."
00:10:42,00:10:43,- Yeah.
00:10:43,00:10:44,- Just so he didn't run out of baked beans.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"I just, I love that."
00:10:45,00:10:47,"- Well, when we did around the 180 days,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,"I remember that, the soundman, Ron,"
00:10:50,00:10:54,he didn't like foreign food and he'd got all these tins
00:10:54,00:10:55,of canned food.
00:10:55,00:10:59,"We end up on a dow, you know, just very, very basic."
00:10:59,00:11:00,There's no cabins in there.
00:11:00,00:11:02,You all sleep on deck together.
00:11:02,00:11:03,"- That boat, sorry, a dow."
00:11:03,00:11:04,"- Yes, a dow."
00:11:04,00:11:06,"So it's a big, the old sailing boat."
00:11:06,00:11:08,So they use around the African coast
00:11:08,00:11:11,"and on the Gulf, Persian Gulf and all that."
00:11:11,00:11:14,"So we got on the thing and, you know,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,comes to the evening and the guys
00:11:16,00:11:21,"are all fishermen from India, very, you know, not wealthy at all."
00:11:21,00:11:23,And so we get our food out and they get their food out.
00:11:23,00:11:26,And the first thing that gets out is a tuna
00:11:26,00:11:31,"from Sainsbury and it sort of comes out of the can,"
00:11:31,00:11:33,like a sort of oily mass.
00:11:33,00:11:35,It goes boi oil and goes onto the plate
00:11:35,00:11:38,and sort of wobbles there and it's sweating slightly.
00:11:38,00:11:40,(laughing)
00:11:40,00:11:41,"I said, right, we're going to have that."
00:11:41,00:11:44,"And these guys, these wonderful guys are,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"the fishermen said, you know, please,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,I could see that some of us didn't really know that is.
00:11:50,00:11:52,"We're making a curry, we'll share it with you."
00:11:52,00:11:53,And they did.
00:11:53,00:11:57,"And from then on, we always had what they had."
00:11:57,00:11:59,"You know, the tins were put to one side."
00:11:59,00:12:00,- Yeah.
00:12:00,00:12:02,- Did Ron stay with the tins?
00:12:02,00:12:05,"- Ron, you know, Ron, we threw him overboard."
00:12:05,00:12:06,(laughing)
00:12:06,00:12:09,"The tins strapped him, maybe sank immediately."
00:12:09,00:12:10,(laughing)
00:12:10,00:12:12,"- I noticed, Michael, in your book,"
00:12:12,00:12:15,that Venezuela is your 100th country
00:12:15,00:12:16,that you have visited.
00:12:16,00:12:17,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:12:17,00:12:18,"- More or less, or you think that's--"
00:12:18,00:12:19,"- No, I think that's right."
00:12:19,00:12:23,I'm a bit of a list nerd and I kept a list.
00:12:23,00:12:24,- So you've kept a list?
00:12:24,00:12:25,'Cause that's what I was gonna ask.
00:12:25,00:12:29,You can now do a top 100 of countries of the world
00:12:29,00:12:30,that you've visited.
00:12:30,00:12:32,So where does Venezuela just off the top of your head?
00:12:32,00:12:33,Where does that rank?
00:12:33,00:12:35,"- I was thinking about 93, really."
00:12:35,00:12:36,(laughing)
00:12:36,00:12:39,I'm full of positive thoughts about Venezuela at the moment.
00:12:39,00:12:41,"Oh, sorry, I see what you mean, sorry."
00:12:41,00:12:43,"- Yeah, no, try it."
00:12:43,00:12:44,- Three.
00:12:44,00:12:45,- Three or nine.
00:12:45,00:12:46,"- Wow, okay."
00:12:46,00:12:49,"- Yeah, sorry, math is good, that's trying to do it."
00:12:49,00:12:52,"- Yeah, so there was an interesting point"
00:12:52,00:12:54,"about the airport when you arrived,"
00:12:54,00:12:56,"which is, I wondered if you were aware of this."
00:12:56,00:12:59,"This might have stopped now, but you were paying tax"
00:12:59,00:13:01,in the airport and one of the taxes that you would pay
00:13:01,00:13:04,were for the air you were literally breathing.
00:13:04,00:13:07,"Because they tax the air, it's a ventilation system"
00:13:07,00:13:09,that they have and they say we're providing clean air.
00:13:09,00:13:10,"- Oh, just so far and as I guess."
00:13:10,00:13:11,"- Yeah, I'm guessing so."
00:13:11,00:13:12,"- Must be, yeah."
00:13:12,00:13:14,"- Just in the airport, it's not a whole country."
00:13:14,00:13:15,"- No, just now."
00:13:15,00:13:19,"- You go, breathe in, and don't breathe out for three weeks, okay?"
00:13:19,00:13:20,You save a lot of money.
00:13:20,00:13:23,(laughing)
00:13:23,00:13:25,- Because they did have the world record
00:13:25,00:13:27,for the lowest petrol price in 2016.
00:13:27,00:13:30,"Wow, I was trying to look at some other records"
00:13:30,00:13:31,that Venezuela have had.
00:13:31,00:13:33,It was one cent per litre.
00:13:33,00:13:38,"And at the time, the price in the UK was 110.7 pounds per litre."
00:13:38,00:13:40,I was trying to work out if I could do some kind of business
00:13:40,00:13:45,"where I offset the price of the flight, but it feels like"
00:13:45,00:13:48,"you're going to run into some legal difficulties, I think."
00:13:48,00:13:51,You can try and bring it back in hand luggage or whatever.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"- Well, they've got a lot of,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,we need to rush this episode out basically
00:13:55,00:13:56,before America invades.
00:13:56,00:13:59,So one of the things that Venezuela has is a lot of oil.
00:13:59,00:14:02,But it's not really used to supply a lot more
00:14:02,00:14:04,"to the global market, I think it provides less now."
00:14:04,00:14:06,"- Well, it's just sanctions."
00:14:06,00:14:09,"- Sanctions also, oil price sort of fell."
00:14:09,00:14:13,So other countries are producing a lot more oil.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"But I mean, there is more oil still in the ground"
00:14:16,00:14:18,in Venezuela than any other country.
00:14:18,00:14:20,- They're not just ringing out oil birds.
00:14:20,00:14:23,"- No, that's not the oil birds."
00:14:23,00:14:26,"- Very pleased, you know, they're not needed."
00:14:26,00:14:29,- I found a couple of records that have held as well
00:14:29,00:14:31,in Venezuela.
00:14:31,00:14:32,This is Guinness World Records.
00:14:32,00:14:35,The living person with the largest feet.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"- Oh, really?"
00:14:36,00:14:37,- Yes.
00:14:37,00:14:40,- The bike foot measures at 40.55 centimeters
00:14:40,00:14:42,and the left foot at 40.47 centimeters.
00:14:42,00:14:45,"- Now Dan, do you Google Bigfoot Venezuelan?"
00:14:45,00:14:46,(laughing)
00:14:46,00:14:48,- Now these are their own feet.
00:14:48,00:14:52,It's not someone just has two extraordinary large feet
00:14:52,00:14:52,which is beneficial.
00:14:52,00:14:55,"- Yeah, no, it's one person with one foot."
00:14:55,00:14:57,- I read an interview with this guy.
00:14:57,00:14:59,And he said that he realized he had big feet
00:14:59,00:15:02,when he and his friends would often compare their foot sizes
00:15:02,00:15:05,and he would come out on top each time.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"- I was like, what are his legs doing?"
00:15:07,00:15:10,"Charlie's always gonna be him, but we're not like,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,- Unless they're clowns and they're just naturally
00:15:12,00:15:13,an oversized shoes.
00:15:13,00:15:13,- That's good.
00:15:13,00:15:14,- You can't tell.
00:15:14,00:15:16,"But does he do something for a living that's foot,"
00:15:16,00:15:18,I don't know what advantage he would.
00:15:18,00:15:18,- Not reach.
00:15:18,00:15:19,- Yeah foot.
00:15:19,00:15:21,- What is it?
00:15:21,00:15:23,"What do you do if you've got very, very large feet?"
00:15:23,00:15:25,"- Real life, Monty Python opening credits."
00:15:25,00:15:27,(laughing)
00:15:27,00:15:28,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:15:28,00:15:31,(upbeat music)
00:15:33,00:15:36,"- Okay, it is now time for fact number two"
00:15:36,00:15:37,and that is my fact.
00:15:37,00:15:40,"My fact this week is that in 1949,"
00:15:40,00:15:43,the BBC issued a company-wide ban
00:15:43,00:15:47,"on making any rude jokes about solicitors, chambermaids,"
00:15:47,00:15:51,and one very specific Irishman called Mr. McGillicutty.
00:15:51,00:15:52,- Wow.
00:15:52,00:15:53,- This is one guy.
00:15:53,00:15:54,- Yeah.
00:15:54,00:15:55,"- Well, it's so funny about him."
00:15:55,00:15:58,- There was people who continued to make jokes
00:15:58,00:16:01,"about this man, Ross McGillicutty of the reeks."
00:16:01,00:16:03,"- Of the reeks, yes, McGillicutty's reeks."
00:16:03,00:16:04,- I've heard of that.
00:16:04,00:16:04,"- Well, there you go."
00:16:04,00:16:06,And I imagine there was fun to be had.
00:16:06,00:16:07,"- It is quite a funny name, isn't it?"
00:16:07,00:16:08,"- Yeah, I found that."
00:16:08,00:16:09,- He got a big comedian.
00:16:09,00:16:10,"- Oh, he got that."
00:16:10,00:16:12,- So what had happened was there was a comment
00:16:12,00:16:15,"called Leonard Henry, not Lenny Henry, Leonard Henry."
00:16:15,00:16:18,And he'd found the name of McGillicutty of the reeks
00:16:18,00:16:20,in an atlas and bought it was a place
00:16:20,00:16:23,and then turned it into a comedy person.
00:16:23,00:16:26,"And then this person who really existed said,"
00:16:26,00:16:28,"well, I never gave you permission to use my name"
00:16:28,00:16:30,and the BBC had to apologize.
00:16:30,00:16:31,- Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:33,- And there's still a McGillicutty of the reeks
00:16:33,00:16:34,to this day.
00:16:34,00:16:34,- Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:37,"- So this title and the reeks is I think a range of,"
00:16:37,00:16:38,it's an ancestral territory in County Kerry.
00:16:38,00:16:41,"So there's a range of mountains, which is called the reeks."
00:16:41,00:16:45,And the last evidence I have found
00:16:45,00:16:47,of the current McGillicutty of the reeks
00:16:47,00:16:50,is him writing to the daily telegraph in 2017
00:16:50,00:16:52,about the price of stamps.
00:16:52,00:16:53,He's about 85 now.
00:16:53,00:16:56,And I believe he looks after the earnham herd of cattle.
00:16:56,00:17:00,That's the latest news on the McGillicutty of the reeks.
00:17:00,00:17:02,- Have you ever laughed at someone like that?
00:17:02,00:17:04,- He's a serious man.
00:17:04,00:17:06,Does he have any administrative powers?
00:17:06,00:17:09,"I mean, does he like a sheriff or something like that at all?"
00:17:09,00:17:12,"- He might do, 'cause it's sort of honoree."
00:17:12,00:17:13,It's an honoree thing.
00:17:13,00:17:14,You're sort of a chief of family.
00:17:14,00:17:16,Chief of the name is the term that gets used.
00:17:16,00:17:21,And this like senior McGillicutty of the 1930s and 40s
00:17:21,00:17:22,was a big deal.
00:17:22,00:17:23,"You know, he was an officer of the British Army."
00:17:23,00:17:25,He was an Irish senator.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"He was, you know, all sorts of serious."
00:17:27,00:17:29,And he just objected very strongly
00:17:29,00:17:30,to being choked about.
00:17:30,00:17:31,- He did try.
00:17:31,00:17:32,- He complained.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"The BBC said, come on, it's never a place."
00:17:34,00:17:35,- Yeah.
00:17:35,00:17:35,- Come on.
00:17:35,00:17:36,- It's a joke.
00:17:36,00:17:37,- Just reeks of envy for me.
00:17:37,00:17:38,- Yeah.
00:17:38,00:17:42,- But then he said that he'd never appeared or contemplated
00:17:42,00:17:44,appearing before the public for their amusement.
00:17:44,00:17:45,- Okay.
00:17:45,00:17:46,- So you must apologize immediately.
00:17:46,00:17:47,- Right.
00:17:47,00:17:48,- The music haved.
00:17:48,00:17:49,- They did.
00:17:49,00:17:50,"And they produced this thing called the Green Book,"
00:17:50,00:17:51,unofficially called the Green Book.
00:17:51,00:17:53,It was a pamphlet that was sent internally.
00:17:53,00:17:57,And it was largely sent to people kind of like Spike Milligan
00:17:57,00:18:01,"and comedians of that ilk who were writing topical,"
00:18:01,00:18:02,"not topical shows necessarily,"
00:18:02,00:18:05,but shows that were going out live weekly.
00:18:05,00:18:09,"And so it came with a long list of things, jokes about lavatories,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,immorality of any kind.
00:18:11,00:18:14,"You couldn't make any suggestive references to honeymoon couples,"
00:18:14,00:18:18,"fig leaves, ladies underwear, baskets."
00:18:18,00:18:22,Because baskets could be used as a new endo in sexual relation.
00:18:22,00:18:23,"You could, if you, a nicely placed basket"
00:18:23,00:18:25,in a sentence could suggest sex.
00:18:25,00:18:26,- What?
00:18:26,00:18:30,"- Yeah, it was used as a replacement word, let's say."
00:18:30,00:18:32,- I'm sure Shakespeare used baskets of China.
00:18:32,00:18:33,He must have seen it.
00:18:33,00:18:34,- He must have seen it.
00:18:34,00:18:35,It must have been a hot bag.
00:18:35,00:18:38,(laughing)
00:18:38,00:18:41,"- Did you ever come across the censors yourselves, Michael?"
00:18:41,00:18:43,"- Yeah, we had some censorship on Python."
00:18:43,00:18:44,- Yeah.
00:18:44,00:18:45,- What did they object to?
00:18:45,00:18:48,- Were they objected to the word masturbation?
00:18:48,00:18:49,- Oh yeah.
00:18:49,00:18:51,- What is this?
00:18:51,00:18:52,"- I'll give you the context, you know what I'm saying?"
00:18:52,00:18:54,"So you're just gonna, if you just come out and say,"
00:18:54,00:18:56,"""Oh, we love the later sketch, Michael."""
00:18:56,00:18:58,"- No, no, we're not sure, we're sorry."
00:18:58,00:19:01,- It was cut out of the power sketch.
00:19:01,00:19:03,It was not interested in masturbation.
00:19:03,00:19:04,(laughing)
00:19:04,00:19:08,"No, the context was we did a sort of northern quiz show,"
00:19:08,00:19:12,sort of an onstage thing where people came on stage.
00:19:12,00:19:15,"And it was a, it was a thing, I said, I didn't,"
00:19:15,00:19:18,"but people had to sum up, proofs."
00:19:18,00:19:20,"- It was, it was officially called"
00:19:20,00:19:22,the all-England summarized proofs competition.
00:19:22,00:19:24,- The all-England proofs competition.
00:19:24,00:19:27,So they had 15 seconds to summarize proofs.
00:19:27,00:19:28,"Anyway, the ones that comes up,"
00:19:28,00:19:29,"and they get a little cheery,"
00:19:29,00:19:32,"will frid pickles, oh, hello, how are you?"
00:19:32,00:19:32,What are your hobbies?
00:19:32,00:19:35,"And this man's hobbies are strangling animals,"
00:19:35,00:19:36,golf and masturbation.
00:19:36,00:19:38,(laughing)
00:19:38,00:19:40,It was a huge laugh.
00:19:40,00:19:44,"And anyway, very quickly, the sketch itself."
00:19:44,00:19:46,"This one, my favorite bits, because, all right,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,you've got 15 seconds now.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"Summarize proofs in this master work,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,and all the various volumes of proofs
00:19:52,00:19:54,were on the sort of thermometer.
00:19:54,00:19:55,(laughing)
00:19:55,00:19:58,"So he goes, oh, yeah, oh, ah, did it,"
00:19:58,00:20:03,"that on verb, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,"
00:20:03,00:20:04,"swan comes along, swan comes along, swan comes,"
00:20:04,00:20:09,"and bings, but the, the BBC said you can't,"
00:20:09,00:20:13,they reviewed the tape and said you can't say masturbating.
00:20:13,00:20:15,And so you'll have to cut it out.
00:20:15,00:20:17,"And in those days, we recorded on tape,"
00:20:17,00:20:19,so you had to physically cut the tape.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"So our director said he cut the thing out,"
00:20:22,00:20:26,"the word masturbating, but he left the gap,"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"which is brilliant, so you hear, what are your hobbies?"
00:20:30,00:20:34,"Strung the animals, golf, huge laugh."
00:20:34,00:20:35,(laughing)
00:20:35,00:20:39,"Never has golf got a laugh, absolutely colossal laugh."
00:20:39,00:20:41,And that's a good summary of the life of proofs
00:20:41,00:20:42,from what I remember.
00:20:42,00:20:43,- Probably.
00:20:43,00:20:46,"- He spent, I mean, he was in his bedroom for a lot of time."
00:20:46,00:20:47,- Very true. - He was.
00:20:47,00:20:52,"- He was, I think he was putting pins in mice or something,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,wasn't he when he was a kid?
00:20:54,00:20:54,- Was it?
00:20:54,00:20:55,- I think so.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"- I've never heard of him playing golf,"
00:20:56,00:20:59,"and I would know if proofs play golf, I would know that."
00:20:59,00:21:00,- I love the shame.
00:21:00,00:21:03,"- I love that there's a great story in your diaries,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"the Python years, the first diaries,"
00:21:05,00:21:10,which is that you had obviously the most famous story
00:21:10,00:21:13,"of censorship and banning in comedy history, life of Brian,"
00:21:13,00:21:15,and all the things that you guys had to do
00:21:15,00:21:19,in order to say that this wasn't an attack on religion.
00:21:19,00:21:22,"It was, you know, Jesus is not being mocked"
00:21:22,00:21:23,"and it was the big thing, right?"
00:21:23,00:21:26,"And you got banned in places like Norway,"
00:21:26,00:21:29,"and in the diary, you point out that in Sweden,"
00:21:29,00:21:33,"the posters read so funny, it was banned in Norway."
00:21:33,00:21:35,"- Yeah, I just think that's fantastic."
00:21:35,00:21:36,- Yeah.
00:21:36,00:21:38,"- And you, because it was a great moment,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,'cause it did get banned in a lot of places
00:21:40,00:21:41,"from cinema altogether,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,"and one of those places was in Wales,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"and that was overturned by the mayor,"
00:21:46,00:21:50,"Sue Jones Davies, who happened to be in the life of Brian."
00:21:50,00:21:52,"- She was Brian's girlfriend,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,skipping around naked.
00:21:54,00:21:54,- Oh yeah.
00:21:54,00:21:55,- She was the revolutionary leader.
00:21:55,00:21:56,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:56,00:21:59,"- So she suddenly becomes mayor of Aberystwyth,"
00:21:59,00:22:00,"and for one night, she says,"
00:22:00,00:22:03,"""I'm going to overturn the ban."""
00:22:03,00:22:06,And Terry and myself and her went to the local Odin
00:22:06,00:22:08,"in Aberystwyth, with arms, links,"
00:22:08,00:22:09,"like, you know, we were all in the sort of,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,"tell them a much, or something like that."
00:22:11,00:22:14,We saw one night of life in Brian.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"I think it was banned in the night after that, yeah."
00:22:17,00:22:19,- I was looking at a few songs
00:22:19,00:22:21,"that maybe should have been banned,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,'cause the BBC had a lot of rules about songs as well.
00:22:23,00:22:24,- Yeah.
00:22:24,00:22:26,"- So they banned things like,"
00:22:26,00:22:27,"""My Generation,"" by the who?"
00:22:27,00:22:28,- Really?
00:22:28,00:22:29,"- '60s classic, that was banned."
00:22:29,00:22:31,Not because of any profanity.
00:22:31,00:22:32,It was banned because it has a stammer.
00:22:32,00:22:33,- A stammer?
00:22:33,00:22:34,- I was mad.
00:22:34,00:22:35,- I really liked it.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"- People put, you know, that it's--"
00:22:36,00:22:36,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:36,00:22:39,"- Yeah, and that was just that people with a stammer"
00:22:39,00:22:40,will find that offensive.
00:22:40,00:22:42,- That's interesting.
00:22:42,00:22:45,- Space Audity by David Bowie was banned
00:22:45,00:22:46,"because it was, I think it was banned"
00:22:46,00:22:49,until Neil Armstrong had safely got back to Earth.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"- Oh, really?"
00:22:50,00:22:51,- It out.
00:22:51,00:22:52,"- Okay, yeah, I'm stronger than Collins,"
00:22:52,00:22:54,"because they thought, oh, it's a bit sensationalist."
00:22:54,00:22:55,"- Oh, really?"
00:22:55,00:22:56,- Yeah.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"- Very clear, he's stuck in a tin can, of course, right?"
00:22:58,00:22:59,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:22:59,00:23:00,"- Yeah, that makes sense."
00:23:00,00:23:02,"But there's this whole, there's this whole genre of songs"
00:23:02,00:23:05,"called ""Dirty Blues"" from the '20s and '30s,"
00:23:05,00:23:08,"which are all sort of, they're all black singers,"
00:23:08,00:23:12,"many women, but the lyrics and the song titles"
00:23:12,00:23:14,are so extraordinarily rude.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"I can't believe the songs are released, basically."
00:23:17,00:23:18,So I just want to give you a few of them.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- Yeah, for it."
00:23:19,00:23:21,- Please warm my weenah.
00:23:21,00:23:24,"I mean, that's the single ""On Tundra"" it's basically."
00:23:24,00:23:27,"- Yeah, they're really popular, but get 'em"
00:23:27,00:23:30,"from the peanut man, brackets, hot nuts."
00:23:30,00:23:31,- Yeah.
00:23:31,00:23:34,- Lil Johnson was one of the women singing these.
00:23:34,00:23:36,Let me roll your lemon.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"Sort of just about the ""Dubel on Tundra."""
00:23:38,00:23:40,My stove is in good condition.
00:23:40,00:23:41,- It's good.
00:23:41,00:23:43,- Any news of her basket?
00:23:43,00:23:47,- Anybody want to buy my cabbage?
00:23:47,00:23:48,- That's not rude.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"- Well, the way she sings it is, sorry."
00:23:50,00:23:53,"- It sounds like sort of Gordon Ramsay's songbook, really."
00:23:53,00:23:56,(all laughing)
00:23:56,00:23:58,"Margaret Carter, they were actually their loads of cooking ones."
00:23:58,00:24:01,"So Margaret Carter had, I want plenty grease in my frying pan"
00:24:01,00:24:05,"and meant this mini had, I'm selling my pork chops,"
00:24:05,00:24:07,"but I'm giving my gravy away,"
00:24:07,00:24:09,which has lost me completely.
00:24:09,00:24:11,- Is that like my milkshake brings other bites to the yard?
00:24:11,00:24:13,"- I think it is, but with more pork."
00:24:13,00:24:15,"- I think it's sort of, yeah."
00:24:15,00:24:18,More sex took place in the kitchen than anywhere else.
00:24:18,00:24:19,- That sounds like it.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:20,00:24:23,- Do you know who's was the first song band
00:24:23,00:24:25,from the BBC at somebody you've all heard of?
00:24:25,00:24:26,- So. - Okay.
00:24:26,00:24:27,- 1933.
00:24:27,00:24:28,- 1933.
00:24:28,00:24:29,- Adolf Hitler.
00:24:29,00:24:31,- With his...
00:24:31,00:24:32,(all laughing)
00:24:32,00:24:34,"- Is that called ""Chancellor's Waltz""?"
00:24:34,00:24:35,- 33.
00:24:35,00:24:37,- So we've all heard of.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Some of you've all heard of.
00:24:38,00:24:40,Someone from my part of the world.
00:24:40,00:24:42,- George. - George Foreman.
00:24:42,00:24:43,- I was about to say George Foreman.
00:24:43,00:24:43,- George Foreman. - George Foreman.
00:24:43,00:24:46,"- George Foreman, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:46,00:24:49,"- His song with my little ukulele in hand was banned,"
00:24:49,00:24:50,but he was a real double entendre.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"- Yes, and lovely. - Yeah, yeah."
00:24:52,00:24:55,"- Like one of his songs, ""My Little Stick of Black Poor Rock"""
00:24:55,00:24:57,"goes, ""It may be sticky, but I never complain."
00:24:57,00:24:59,"It's nice to have a nibble of it now and again."""
00:24:59,00:25:00,(all laughing)
00:25:00,00:25:02,- So. - That is sort of...
00:25:02,00:25:04,- The role of double entendre is all the way for me.
00:25:04,00:25:05,- Very interesting.
00:25:05,00:25:08,"- There was a number one hit in the UK,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,"which was a very famous song, ""Jetem."""
00:25:10,00:25:13,"- Oh, yeah. - So Jamesburg, Jamesburg, again."
00:25:13,00:25:15,That was banned as well.
00:25:15,00:25:17,I read this in the monkey diaries.
00:25:17,00:25:20,"Jane Berkins diaries, other diaries are available."
00:25:20,00:25:23,(all laughing)
00:25:23,00:25:25,The problem that they had was it got too popular.
00:25:25,00:25:27,It got so popular that it made it to number one.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"And so in order to be able to play it within the charts,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,they had to get an orchestral version of it
00:25:32,00:25:35,and just play it completely without any voice
00:25:35,00:25:36,at all.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"'Cause it wasn't even the lyrics, it was the moaning."
00:25:38,00:25:40,"- Yes, exactly. - That was the big problem of the song."
00:25:40,00:25:42,"- It was a breathing, wasn't it?"
00:25:42,00:25:44,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:25:44,00:25:45,"- And all these, my generation, all this,"
00:25:45,00:25:48,this is why Radio Caroline became a big thing.
00:25:48,00:25:49,- Was that pirate?
00:25:49,00:25:51,"- Offshore pirate radio, because no one was playing"
00:25:51,00:25:53,any of these songs.
00:25:53,00:25:57,"Yeah, I've got one last one, which I find pretty amazing,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,which is King Charles.
00:25:59,00:26:01,I didn't realize he was part of the reviews
00:26:01,00:26:02,in Cambridge when he was there.
00:26:02,00:26:05,He did footlight smokers and he was part of them.
00:26:05,00:26:06,"What does that mean, so?"
00:26:06,00:26:08,- So people--
00:26:08,00:26:11,"- People on stage, you do sort of funny things, don't you?"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"- Yeah, exactly, it's comedy stuff."
00:26:13,00:26:13,- It's comedy stuff.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"- It's comedy, yeah, yeah, it's a smoker."
00:26:15,00:26:17,"- Smoking room, yeah."
00:26:17,00:26:18,"- You and Terry Jones were in Oxford,"
00:26:18,00:26:21,but Eric Idol and John Cleese and Graham Chapman
00:26:21,00:26:24,"would have been part of the Cambridge Footlight,"
00:26:24,00:26:25,"Breon the Fringe, all that."
00:26:25,00:26:27,And so he was part of the Cambridge Footlights.
00:26:27,00:26:31,And there's a story that goes that they were not allowed
00:26:31,00:26:33,to make fun of him or his family
00:26:33,00:26:38,"while he was part of the footlights, which is pretty amazing."
00:26:38,00:26:42,"And he did a few reviews, he was on stage quite a lot."
00:26:42,00:26:45,"- Yeah, he was in the magic circle as well, wasn't he?"
00:26:45,00:26:46,- Really?
00:26:46,00:26:47,"- When he was Prince Charles, yeah."
00:26:47,00:26:49,"Well, you guys with me when I didn't"
00:26:49,00:26:51,"horror the magic circle, I can't remember who was there."
00:26:51,00:26:52,- We weren't allowed it.
00:26:52,00:26:54,"- Well, we went there and they told us about when,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,'cause you have to do a trick to get into the magic circle
00:26:56,00:26:59,and he did the balls trick like the cups and balls.
00:26:59,00:27:03,"Apparently, not the best person who's ever done it,"
00:27:03,00:27:04,but they decided that it was good enough
00:27:04,00:27:06,for him to join the magic circle.
00:27:06,00:27:07,- The edge of the throne.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"- Yeah, I'm sorry, come again next week."
00:27:09,00:27:10,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:10,00:27:12,"- I can make your head disappear, actually."
00:27:12,00:27:15,(laughing)
00:27:15,00:27:16,- So he took part in two reviews.
00:27:16,00:27:19,One was called Revolution with a U instead of the U
00:27:19,00:27:23,in the middle and quietly flows the Don.
00:27:23,00:27:25,And so you weren't allowed to make any jokes about him
00:27:25,00:27:29,"or royalty, but also the first play got in a bit of trouble"
00:27:29,00:27:34,in 1969 because they were putting it on a Sunday
00:27:34,00:27:37,and the Lord's Day observant society got in touch
00:27:37,00:27:39,"and said, ""Absolutely not."""
00:27:39,00:27:40,So it's basically a society looking out
00:27:40,00:27:42,for anything going on on a Sunday that shouldn't be.
00:27:42,00:27:44,- And I'd rather think about them
00:27:44,00:27:46,as they can only work on Sundays.
00:27:46,00:27:47,(laughing)
00:27:47,00:27:50,"- Can't do anything on a Saturday like this, exactly."
00:27:50,00:27:52,"- Yeah, but yeah, apparently it was quite odd"
00:27:52,00:27:55,"because when he was on stage, they would sell tickets"
00:27:55,00:27:56,"to the smokers, as they were called,"
00:27:56,00:27:57,the performances that you could go to.
00:27:57,00:28:00,"And they would field in calls from Japan saying,"
00:28:00,00:28:01,"""How many tickets are available?"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"""We have a full plane load of tourists"
00:28:03,00:28:06,"""who are ready to fly over to see the prints and performance."""
00:28:06,00:28:07,"- Well, there we are."
00:28:07,00:28:10,"He's still performing, isn't he really?"
00:28:10,00:28:11,"- Yeah, he is."
00:28:11,00:28:13,- And he's what he learned for the footlights.
00:28:13,00:28:17,"Probably very useful for public life, you know."
00:28:17,00:28:20,- And the magic circle he made prints Andrew disappear?
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Yes.
00:28:21,00:28:22,(laughing)
00:28:22,00:28:24,(upbeat music)
00:28:26,00:28:28,"- Okay, there's time for fact number three,"
00:28:28,00:28:29,and that is Andy.
00:28:29,00:28:32,"My fact is, the rescue team who tried to find"
00:28:32,00:28:35,the Lost Franklin Expedition did so
00:28:35,00:28:38,"with rockets, kites, flashing lights, gunshots, horns,"
00:28:38,00:28:42,"drums, and by putting collars on Arctic foxes."
00:28:42,00:28:44,"- Hmm, wow."
00:28:44,00:28:45,"- It didn't work, we should say."
00:28:45,00:28:46,- And that's sad.
00:28:46,00:28:48,"- Well, the collars, was this before"
00:28:48,00:28:49,they had some radio equipment?
00:28:49,00:28:51,"So I mean, you just put the collars on,"
00:28:51,00:28:52,there was no recording device.
00:28:52,00:28:53,"- Yeah, 100%."
00:28:53,00:28:55,- 100%. - So what they did?
00:28:55,00:28:57,- This is in the 1840s and '50s.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"This expedition, which you've written about Michael,"
00:28:59,00:29:03,went north over Canada.
00:29:03,00:29:06,They were trying to find a shorter route through the Arctic
00:29:06,00:29:08,because that will be amazing for shipping.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"There's fabled things called the Northwest Passage,"
00:29:10,00:29:12,and it would cut thousands of miles.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"- So this is before the Panama Canal, right?"
00:29:14,00:29:15,"- Yes, it is."
00:29:15,00:29:18,- So they previously had to go all the way down South America.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"- Exactly, and it's just a very, very long route"
00:29:20,00:29:22,"to sail from Europe to Asia, basically."
00:29:22,00:29:24,"So if you could find the Northwest Passage,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,it would be a huge boon to mankind.
00:29:26,00:29:28,"And this expedition went out, the Franklin expedition,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"two ships, terror and aerobus."
00:29:31,00:29:35,"They went missing, and a lot of search parties went out for them."
00:29:35,00:29:39,And some sources estimate more than 30 search missions went out.
00:29:39,00:29:40,- And one of them.
00:29:40,00:29:41,- Mostly financed by his wife.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"- Yeah, absolutely, yeah."
00:29:43,00:29:45,- And he determined that she could find him
00:29:45,00:29:47,"and everyone was saying, ""No, it's too late now, he's dead."""
00:29:47,00:29:49,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:29:49,00:29:53,"And one of them decided to put collars on foxes,"
00:29:53,00:29:56,"Arctic foxes, wild fox cubs,"
00:29:56,00:29:59,"which had the coordinates of where they were,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,"saying, ""We are looking for you."
00:30:01,00:30:03,"This is where we are based."""
00:30:03,00:30:05,And they just released the foxes into the wilds.
00:30:05,00:30:06,"And it was clever, it didn't work."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"I mean, the foxes, I imagine,"
00:30:08,00:30:09,- It's the survivors.
00:30:09,00:30:10,(laughing)
00:30:10,00:30:12,- Normally they're there to read them.
00:30:12,00:30:13,"- No, exactly, they're all inew it."
00:30:13,00:30:16,"So they wouldn't say, ""What does this mean?"""
00:30:16,00:30:17,"- Yeah, so read that."
00:30:17,00:30:18,- It's simply did not work.
00:30:18,00:30:20,- That's a fascinating fact.
00:30:20,00:30:22,- So they did some very strange things at that time.
00:30:22,00:30:25,It was a kind of hysteria to try and find him
00:30:25,00:30:27,and a refusal to admit that they might be dead.
00:30:27,00:30:31,Because they basically completely got it wrong.
00:30:31,00:30:35,The whole expedition was given enormous amounts of money.
00:30:35,00:30:39,They had lots of wine on board and libraries
00:30:39,00:30:40,and all that sort of thing.
00:30:40,00:30:42,And they just took a wrong turn and got stuck down
00:30:42,00:30:47,a sort of fairly narrow stretch of water
00:30:47,00:30:49,where it was quite an extreme winter then.
00:30:49,00:30:51,And that froze and they were stuck.
00:30:51,00:30:53,"So yeah, thank all the wines."
00:30:53,00:30:56,"So when the spring comes, it's a melt and they go off,"
00:30:56,00:30:57,the spring didn't melt.
00:30:57,00:31:00,There was two or three years of the worst
00:31:00,00:31:04,and the coldest winters up in the Northwest Passage.
00:31:04,00:31:07,"So basically, we just stuck there for about two years,"
00:31:07,00:31:11,"ran out of food, went out trying to get the trade"
00:31:11,00:31:14,"with the inew it, but they didn't do that very well."
00:31:14,00:31:17,Because no one had actually done the research
00:31:17,00:31:19,"and saying, ""Well, how do we speak to inew it?"""
00:31:19,00:31:20,The people who lived there.
00:31:20,00:31:24,"So when it came to wanting to be helped by those people,"
00:31:24,00:31:24,they couldn't do it.
00:31:24,00:31:27,"Whereas later, Amundsen or something like that"
00:31:27,00:31:30,"was very much a sort of, you know,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,the ground you're on sort of traveler.
00:31:32,00:31:35,"He always knew what to ask the local people, right?"
00:31:35,00:31:37,So it was a bit arrogant really.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"So frankly, next."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"Well, were they a bit unlucky with the weather,"
00:31:40,00:31:41,like if they'd gone a few years later?
00:31:41,00:31:48,"Yeah, I mean, I think it was these two very, very cold winters."
00:31:48,00:31:52,"But they'd also, you know, they've gone a slightly different route"
00:31:52,00:31:53,and not gone down.
00:31:53,00:31:56,"They took like a shortcut, and then it got trapped."
00:31:56,00:32:00,And the ice is always stronger when you've got the confined space.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"So if they've gone a bit further ahead,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,"where there's more open water, they might have got through."
00:32:04,00:32:06,The absolute disappointment of the ice
00:32:06,00:32:08,not melting that spring must have been.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Yeah, must be near the spring now."
00:32:10,00:32:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:11,00:32:13,"So you wrote a brilliant book about aerobus,"
00:32:13,00:32:16,and you went and visited a lot of these places as well.
00:32:16,00:32:17,"I mean, it's pretty fascinating"
00:32:17,00:32:21,that it was lost for so long only found in 2014.
00:32:21,00:32:21,Yeah.
00:32:21,00:32:23,"I mean, that's remarkable."
00:32:23,00:32:26,"Well, the end of it at the time in the late 19th century,"
00:32:26,00:32:30,"people went out there, said they had seen a ship,"
00:32:30,00:32:33,"or the master of a ship, they knew exactly where it was."
00:32:33,00:32:36,"But there was sort of, because they only had an oral tradition,"
00:32:36,00:32:38,didn't write things down.
00:32:38,00:32:41,"People thought, oh, wow, they're just saying that."
00:32:41,00:32:42,And they didn't find it up.
00:32:42,00:32:45,"And in the end, aerobus was found almost exactly"
00:32:45,00:32:48,where they had said a hundred and a hundred years
00:32:48,00:32:51,with their local residents was just going on.
00:32:51,00:32:52,"Frayed so, yeah."
00:32:52,00:32:55,It's a real sort of imperial sort of attitude you have.
00:32:55,00:32:56,"No, no, you don't know."
00:32:56,00:32:59,"There's just, you just lived here for 500 years."
00:32:59,00:33:00,"Yeah, we know."
00:33:00,00:33:01,"I think we, the 31st Expedition."
00:33:01,00:33:04,"Yeah, we wanted to find them without any help from you guys."
00:33:04,00:33:04,Thank you.
00:33:04,00:33:06,"Colin Wolfson, you go."
00:33:06,00:33:09,"Oh, I should say where I saw the,"
00:33:09,00:33:10,I've seen one of these collars in the flesh.
00:33:10,00:33:11,It's so exciting.
00:33:11,00:33:12,"Oh, wow."
00:33:12,00:33:12,It's a few of us.
00:33:12,00:33:13,With words on it.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Yeah.
00:33:14,00:33:15,And the coordinates.
00:33:15,00:33:18,"Behind the scenes at the Royal Geographical Society,"
00:33:18,00:33:20,which I believe you've been president.
00:33:20,00:33:21,I was president for three years.
00:33:21,00:33:22,Yeah.
00:33:22,00:33:25,"And they have, in the back rooms,"
00:33:25,00:33:29,"they have these amazing collections of extraordinary stuff,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,because it was founded in 1830 and basically contributed
00:33:32,00:33:34,to founding geography as a discipline.
00:33:34,00:33:37,Geography is a much newer area of study than many others.
00:33:37,00:33:38,So it's an incredible place.
00:33:38,00:33:40,And they've got these collars there as amazing to say.
00:33:40,00:33:41,Very cool.
00:33:41,00:33:43,"The thing is, which is quite interesting,"
00:33:43,00:33:48,"I think one of the many attempts to find out where they were,"
00:33:48,00:33:50,was a ship called HMS Resolution.
00:33:50,00:33:52,That was about sort of five of us out there left.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"And the desk from the captain's cabin,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"the HMS Resolution, is the desk in the White House?"
00:33:57,00:33:58,"Oh, really?"
00:33:58,00:34:00,It's in the White House offices.
00:34:00,00:34:02,I have heard it called the Resolution desk.
00:34:02,00:34:05,I have not found what that came from the search for Franklin.
00:34:05,00:34:08,Isn't Trump just trying to turn that into a solid gold desk?
00:34:08,00:34:11,It will be easier if he's guilty in that right now.
00:34:11,00:34:11,Yeah.
00:34:11,00:34:15,"And I read that they took 8,000 tins of food for the voyage."
00:34:15,00:34:16,Sounds like Ron.
00:34:16,00:34:17,Exactly.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"You're Ron, mate."
00:34:18,00:34:19,"You're a ship, haven't you?"
00:34:19,00:34:20,Yeah.
00:34:20,00:34:21,"And nobody, Tino."
00:34:21,00:34:24,"Oh, come on."
00:34:24,00:34:27,"We could ask the locals, no, no."
00:34:27,00:34:31,"And 7,088 pounds of tobacco, which, according to my calculation,"
00:34:31,00:34:34,in today's money would be enough for three million cigarettes.
00:34:34,00:34:35,Yeah.
00:34:35,00:34:37,"Which really, really, enough, wouldn't it?"
00:34:37,00:34:39,"But yeah, I think a lot of people thought"
00:34:39,00:34:41,that the tins were the problem.
00:34:41,00:34:42,Right.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"So a lot of the men went away from the ship,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,maybe to try and find the way off somewhere.
00:34:48,00:34:51,"But they walked away with the load of stuff they wouldn't really need,"
00:34:51,00:34:55,"like button polish and curtain rods, sort of writing desk and stuff."
00:34:55,00:34:56,Time to try and get it.
00:34:56,00:34:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:34:57,00:34:58,"And people thought, well, maybe they went mad."
00:34:58,00:35:01,And I think now we do think that there was some lead poisoning.
00:35:01,00:35:04,"And for a long time, they thought it was the tins of food,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,because they were soldered with lead.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"Now, I think we're not quite so sure it might have been"
00:35:08,00:35:11,because the pipes in the boat had lead in them.
00:35:11,00:35:13,Because the levels of lead were so high
00:35:13,00:35:15,that it couldn't just be bleached from the tins.
00:35:15,00:35:16,How interesting.
00:35:16,00:35:19,It was about 150 men in total.
00:35:19,00:35:20,"129, I believe."
00:35:20,00:35:21,"OK, right."
00:35:21,00:35:24,"Like, all hands on both ships, not one of them survived."
00:35:24,00:35:25,"Yeah, yeah."
00:35:25,00:35:26,"Is this right, Michael?"
00:35:26,00:35:30,"I read this, and it sounded too wild to be true to me."
00:35:30,00:35:34,But is it the case that when you went out looking and writing the book
00:35:34,00:35:37,"that there's bits where in the snow,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,their footprints are sort of fossilized
00:35:39,00:35:41,that you can see them in the ground?
00:35:41,00:35:43,I don't know.
00:35:43,00:35:44,"I mean, you can see there are graves,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,the first people who died.
00:35:46,00:35:47,Right.
00:35:47,00:35:48,I'm not sure about the fossil.
00:35:48,00:35:50,"OK, yeah, it felt weird."
00:35:50,00:35:51,"Yeah, I mean, that's why I'm a fossil."
00:35:51,00:35:54,"Yeah, but unless it was that Fener's Wailing guy with a massive--"
00:35:54,00:35:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:55,00:36:00,"--he had no map, you 24 yards across."
00:36:00,00:36:02,We died of large feet.
00:36:02,00:36:04,"I'm able to cut his turn, then."
00:36:04,00:36:09,"So I mean, it's a lumberjack's to get in there."
00:36:09,00:36:12,"But they did find a lot of very well-preserved bodies, I believe."
00:36:12,00:36:13,And I don't know if they are.
00:36:13,00:36:14,I think they must have been dug up.
00:36:14,00:36:18,"But bodies were found in 1984, incredibly well-preserved."
00:36:18,00:36:20,And you could see they had blue eyes.
00:36:20,00:36:23,"So there was a crew member called John Torrington,"
00:36:23,00:36:26,who was found 138 years after he died.
00:36:26,00:36:28,But he was put on people magazine's list
00:36:28,00:36:31,of the most intriguing people of 1984.
00:36:31,00:36:32,Really?
00:36:32,00:36:33,"Yeah, yeah, wow."
00:36:33,00:36:35,"Bit of a post-industrial recognition, which I suppose is nice."
00:36:35,00:36:36,But you are on ice.
00:36:36,00:36:39,"You know, that's what they say about like places like Everest."
00:36:39,00:36:42,Cryogenics and situation.
00:36:42,00:36:44,"When they found Mallory's body, Mallory's body"
00:36:44,00:36:46,was just still Mallory's body.
00:36:46,00:36:47,It was there.
00:36:47,00:36:48,But they didn't get that many.
00:36:48,00:36:52,"Not many of that many were brought back, actually."
00:36:52,00:36:54,We should say Lady Franklin as well.
00:36:54,00:36:54,Yeah.
00:36:54,00:36:57,"So John Franklin was the commander of the whole mission, wasn't he?"
00:36:57,00:36:59,"Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:36:59,00:37:01,"And I think there were questions about whether he was suitable,"
00:37:01,00:37:02,whether he was the best man to draw--
00:37:02,00:37:03,Absolutely.
00:37:03,00:37:06,"For a start, Franklin wasn't the first person"
00:37:06,00:37:07,they wanted to lead it.
00:37:07,00:37:09,"They wanted James Clark Ross to lead it,"
00:37:09,00:37:14,because he had extraordinary success in Antarctica in 1841
00:37:14,00:37:17,and stood on places that no human being had ever been before.
00:37:17,00:37:19,"But he didn't want to do it, quite rightly."
00:37:19,00:37:23,"And so they got Franklin, because he was quite old at the time."
00:37:23,00:37:24,He was nearly 60.
00:37:24,00:37:25,But he ever liked him.
00:37:25,00:37:26,He was all right.
00:37:26,00:37:27,He was pretty intellectual.
00:37:27,00:37:29,And I spoke to everybody.
00:37:29,00:37:30,"Yeah, I want to do it."
00:37:30,00:37:32,And his wife was very dynamic.
00:37:32,00:37:35,"Must have pushed him forward and said,"
00:37:35,00:37:36,"""My husband's available."""
00:37:36,00:37:37,And here he is.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"John, come in."
00:37:39,00:37:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:40,00:37:43,"On the other hand, I read that James Ross, one of the reasons"
00:37:43,00:37:45,"he declined this, because he promised his wife"
00:37:45,00:37:47,that he wouldn't go to any more polar expedition.
00:37:47,00:37:47,Yes.
00:37:47,00:37:50,So it's all we're blaming the wives for the whole thing of this.
00:37:50,00:37:52,That's such a great detail.
00:37:52,00:37:52,Yeah.
00:37:52,00:37:55,"No, I promise my wife that we'll have to go get it."
00:37:55,00:37:57,"If he's just done four years, you know, the Antarctic."
00:37:57,00:37:58,It's reasonable.
00:37:58,00:38:00,Where are you going?
00:38:00,00:38:02,Just to enjoy the Antarctic.
00:38:02,00:38:06,Lady Franklin was very smitten with James Clarke Ross.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"Oh, sort of dashing character."
00:38:08,00:38:09,Really?
00:38:09,00:38:10,"Tall, yeah, yeah."
00:38:10,00:38:12,That's why the wife didn't want him at all.
00:38:12,00:38:13,"Yeah, yeah."
00:38:13,00:38:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:15,00:38:18,"Actually, it doesn't say that it was his wife"
00:38:18,00:38:19,who didn't want him to go around.
00:38:19,00:38:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:21,00:38:22,Wow.
00:38:22,00:38:23,That's really interesting.
00:38:23,00:38:26,So James Clarke Ross led one of the expeditions.
00:38:26,00:38:29,And that was the one that put the collars on the foxes.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Really?
00:38:30,00:38:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:38:31,00:38:33,"And Lady Franklin did all the lobbying, didn't she?"
00:38:33,00:38:36,"She said, we must send our search parties."
00:38:36,00:38:37,It's quite moving.
00:38:37,00:38:41,She wrote him letters for eight years after he departed.
00:38:41,00:38:43,"And you know, the large majority of that time"
00:38:43,00:38:44,he would have died.
00:38:44,00:38:45,"No one knew, for sure."
00:38:45,00:38:47,But what would happen to those letters?
00:38:47,00:38:49,Would they just be kept in her house?
00:38:49,00:38:53,Or would she post them and send it to Canada maybe?
00:38:53,00:38:57,She would have had them indexed and looked after well.
00:38:57,00:39:01,"Yeah, she had an assistant, a woman who worked with her."
00:39:01,00:39:04,And they organized the whole sort of rescue business
00:39:04,00:39:07,down to the last detail.
00:39:07,00:39:10,"So the letters, I'm sure, everything that she'd written"
00:39:10,00:39:11,would be kept.
00:39:11,00:39:12,"That's the other thing, right?"
00:39:12,00:39:15,"Where they were going, there was no post box right."
00:39:15,00:39:17,So they didn't take a post box with them.
00:39:17,00:39:19,They should have done it in the true Imperial spirit.
00:39:19,00:39:22,We're going to put the first post box in the North.
00:39:22,00:39:25,I can imagine a postman coming to collect those
00:39:25,00:39:29,definitely wearing shorts.
00:39:29,00:39:32,No collection on Sunday.
00:39:32,00:39:34,"Well, the Lord's Day Observant Society have been in touch."
00:39:34,00:39:43,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:39:43,00:39:44,And that is James.
00:39:44,00:39:47,"OK, my fact this week is that in Bologna,"
00:39:47,00:39:50,"there is a word, um, a role, which describes"
00:39:50,00:39:53,"a grumpy pensioner who stands with his hands behind his back,"
00:39:53,00:39:57,complaining about road works.
00:39:57,00:39:58,The dream.
00:39:58,00:40:00,"The dream for me, dream life."
00:40:00,00:40:02,We'll all end up there eventually handy.
00:40:02,00:40:04,"You were a lot earlier than others, I'm sure."
00:40:04,00:40:08,"Andy's there, I'm there."
00:40:08,00:40:12,So this is a term that was coined in 2005 by a writer
00:40:12,00:40:14,called Danilo Masotti.
00:40:14,00:40:17,And he had noticed that there was a lot of people
00:40:17,00:40:19,doing this in Bologna.
00:40:19,00:40:21,And they've decided that it's going to be a thing
00:40:21,00:40:23,and they've really embraced it.
00:40:23,00:40:27,"And now if you go to Bologna and they do road works,"
00:40:27,00:40:32,the people who are doing the work will talk to the umorals.
00:40:32,00:40:33,"When they finish some works, they'll"
00:40:33,00:40:35,put a sign up saying where they're going
00:40:35,00:40:38,to be next week so that the umorals can go and see them.
00:40:38,00:40:39,Wonderful.
00:40:39,00:40:43,And they was a very good way of institutionalizing grumpy
00:40:43,00:40:44,pensioner.
00:40:44,00:40:47,Go ahead and deal with it.
00:40:47,00:40:50,And there was a Burger King advert in 2016
00:40:50,00:40:53,"about these guys. And in 2021, the word entered"
00:40:53,00:40:55,the official Italian dictionary.
00:40:55,00:40:56,Incredible.
00:40:56,00:40:58,So this is a real proper thing now.
00:40:58,00:41:00,Isn't the umorals sounds really nice?
00:41:00,00:41:03,"It sounds like a laxative, to be honest."
00:41:03,00:41:05,"No, it's a very glamorous term for grumpy old men."
00:41:05,00:41:08,"Yeah, but also it doesn't sound very Italian, I think."
00:41:08,00:41:09,Umoral.
00:41:09,00:41:10,Umorale.
00:41:10,00:41:11,Umorale.
00:41:11,00:41:12,Umorale.
00:41:12,00:41:13,I think it's the way you pronounce it.
00:41:13,00:41:16,"Yeah, but he's a, it comes from a Bologna"
00:41:16,00:41:20,"like regional dialects word, meaning little guy."
00:41:20,00:41:23,"So is it, are they annoying to the builders?"
00:41:23,00:41:25,Are they looking through the fence?
00:41:25,00:41:27,"And they're saying, I wouldn't put it there if I,"
00:41:27,00:41:29,I wouldn't put that R.S.J. there if I were you.
00:41:29,00:41:32,I think it all depends on the attitude of the builders.
00:41:32,00:41:32,OK.
00:41:32,00:41:35,I think some of the builders embrace it and like them.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"And it's someone to chat to and, you know, they use the knowledge"
00:41:38,00:41:41,of people who have maybe done this job before or know about it.
00:41:41,00:41:45,And then there are other builders who go off my building site.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"Yeah, a lot of these guys will be retired."
00:41:47,00:41:49,"Yeah, no, no, no, don't put it through to Houston."
00:41:49,00:41:54,"Oh, all right, we've made the tunnels."
00:41:54,00:41:58,"Well, you should have asked us, asked us, yeah."
00:41:58,00:42:01,I just think a lot of these guys are going to be retired solicitors
00:42:01,00:42:03,"or people who are not, oh, yeah, builders."
00:42:03,00:42:05,There's a lot of people who thought that they kind of stand
00:42:05,00:42:07,with their eyes and their backs.
00:42:07,00:42:10,"You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, like a, like a sort of, that's a costume."
00:42:10,00:42:13,"In, uh, Villa Santa, which is near Monza in the north of Italy."
00:42:13,00:42:17,"Um, they have officially used these umorals."
00:42:17,00:42:20,"And the local government have spoken to them and said, right,"
00:42:20,00:42:23,you can stand next to this bit of world works and let us know
00:42:23,00:42:24,if anything's wrong.
00:42:24,00:42:26,So they're like professional umorals.
00:42:26,00:42:29,"All right, the government, the snitches as well."
00:42:29,00:42:30,"Basically, and that's true."
00:42:30,00:42:33,"I'd think of it like that, but I found a line."
00:42:33,00:42:39,"You can get a 3D printed model of an umoral, uh, for your desk."
00:42:39,00:42:43,And the idea is you just pop him here and he will look there and work
00:42:43,00:42:43,for your doing.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"Yeah, and brilliant idea."
00:42:46,00:42:48,You'll get a lot more done because you're so frightened that he's going to complain.
00:42:48,00:42:50,"It's just, it's lovely."
00:42:50,00:42:54,"Yeah, I feel like I would very happily, even if, because I don't speak the language,"
00:42:54,00:42:57,just listen to a live stream of just the old man.
00:42:57,00:42:59,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:59,00:43:03,"And I think the theory is a lot of these guys, well, they're all retarded."
00:43:03,00:43:03,Yeah.
00:43:03,00:43:07,And I think part of the theory is their wives do not want them around the household day.
00:43:07,00:43:10,"So very much like Lady Franklin, they've said,"
00:43:10,00:43:13,"""Why don't you pop out and discopital for passage?"""
00:43:13,00:43:15,"And quite often what they'll do is they'll go in the morning,"
00:43:15,00:43:20,"have their cappuccino, sit around, chat about the football scores or whatever."
00:43:20,00:43:23,"But then once it comes to mid-morning, what do you do then, right?"
00:43:23,00:43:26,"Ah, going to a lot of work's happening."
00:43:26,00:43:27,So you go and touch.
00:43:27,00:43:31,"They sort of sound a bit like superannuated train spotters, really."
00:43:31,00:43:31,Yeah.
00:43:31,00:43:34,"Rather than glamorous and Italian way, you know?"
00:43:34,00:43:36,They wouldn't be nerdy.
00:43:36,00:43:42,"Train spotters, Italian, sort of, had seen all the Fellini movies."
00:43:42,00:43:45,I do really hope that you're just mentioning Franklin
00:43:45,00:43:49,that there were a group of innuit old men just standing around the air of us.
00:43:49,00:43:50,I won't go down that.
00:43:50,00:43:51,I won't go down that.
00:43:51,00:43:52,"Yeah, you're going down that body of water."
00:43:52,00:43:56,"Sorry, mate, back up."
00:43:56,00:44:01,"Michael, you're doing a live show at the moment."
00:44:01,00:44:05,"And one of the themes is aging disgracefully, right?"
00:44:05,00:44:05,As part of a--
00:44:05,00:44:06,"Yeah, yeah."
00:44:06,00:44:07,Is that sort of this?
00:44:07,00:44:08,Yes.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"Does that appeal, the idea of humoral, to be--"
00:44:10,00:44:13,"Yeah, I mean, I'd like to be a bit more active."
00:44:13,00:44:16,But I think you just keep going.
00:44:16,00:44:20,And there's two ways of approaching age one is to sit in a chair.
00:44:20,00:44:22,And the others become fanatically busy.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"And just say, I just got to have things to do all the time."
00:44:25,00:44:29,"So I couldn't, you know, otherwise it's completely boring."
00:44:29,00:44:32,"But some people choose one, some people choose the other."
00:44:32,00:44:36,There's another term that I really like.
00:44:36,00:44:39,"The window side tribe, they're known as in Japan."
00:44:39,00:44:43,And it means an employee who at work is quite old.
00:44:43,00:44:45,And they can't really get them to do what they used to do.
00:44:45,00:44:46,So they sort of sideline them.
00:44:46,00:44:47,They just give them a desk by the window.
00:44:47,00:44:49,And they don't really do anything anymore.
00:44:49,00:44:52,"So it's apparently the biggest dream, yeah."
00:44:52,00:44:53,It's quite big in Japan.
00:44:53,00:44:56,"They just, rather than firing or retiring someone,"
00:44:56,00:44:57,"they just take away all their responsibilities,"
00:44:57,00:44:59,"put them by the window and just say,"
00:44:59,00:45:00,"""All right, just keep going."""
00:45:00,00:45:03,"That's called ""execitive producer"" that you beat yourself."
00:45:03,00:45:08,But it's true that most other countries
00:45:08,00:45:11,have a more enlightened attitude to aging.
00:45:11,00:45:13,They think it's valuable that people get older.
00:45:13,00:45:16,"I mean most tribal societies, you're the top man."
00:45:16,00:45:19,"If you argue, the more you know,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,the more experience you can pass on to others.
00:45:21,00:45:24,So I'm the idea of care homes here.
00:45:24,00:45:25,"It's quite sad, really."
00:45:25,00:45:28,"Yeah, I quite like, you know,"
00:45:28,00:45:31,"getting involved in a heist, for example,"
00:45:31,00:45:33,in your older years.
00:45:33,00:45:35,The fascinating story from a few years ago
00:45:35,00:45:38,"that the greatest, largest burglary in English history"
00:45:38,00:45:41,was committed by people in their 70s.
00:45:41,00:45:42,The oldest guy was 76.
00:45:42,00:45:43,That's the hat I'm talking about.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"Was the hat in 2001, which is just pretty astonishing."
00:45:45,00:45:47,They went down an elevator shaft.
00:45:47,00:45:48,They drilled through.
00:45:48,00:45:51,They stole millions of pounds worth of stuff.
00:45:51,00:45:53,I didn't know they were that old.
00:45:53,00:45:55,They had a combined age of 500.
00:45:55,00:45:57,"They just, oh, bloke from the pub, you know."
00:45:57,00:45:59,Let's go out and do it for real.
00:45:59,00:46:01,"Yeah, and they had a history of having done"
00:46:01,00:46:04,quite a few heists in the past over a long career.
00:46:04,00:46:06,But they'd been scripted by Richard Osmond.
00:46:06,00:46:08,It just feels like quite so.
00:46:08,00:46:09,It just splashed.
00:46:09,00:46:10,One of them got to the high.
00:46:10,00:46:13,So I'm a boss using his pensioners past.
00:46:13,00:46:15,"Like it was, ironically, his freedom pass."
00:46:15,00:46:16,"Yes, yes."
00:46:16,00:46:17,Yeah.
00:46:17,00:46:21,"But then what do you do with the money, really?"
00:46:21,00:46:23,"Well, we never want to find out, because I've got less of your life"
00:46:23,00:46:25,"to, you know, going up a few years to spend it."
00:46:25,00:46:27,"Some of it still missing, isn't it?"
00:46:27,00:46:28,"I think it is quite a lot of it, really."
00:46:28,00:46:31,"So, and they're all going to come out at some stage."
00:46:31,00:46:36,"We need to look for a care home that has installed, you know."
00:46:36,00:46:37,Gold tax.
00:46:37,00:46:38,"Gold tax, Vegas style fountain."
00:46:38,00:46:40,That would be it.
00:46:40,00:46:41,It's called the Trump home.
00:46:41,00:46:42,"Yeah, exactly."
00:46:42,00:46:45,"Well, there's one mystery man still missing who's called Bazzle."
00:46:45,00:46:48,"And there's a £20,000 reward on his head."
00:46:48,00:46:55,"Did you find in the course of this, the word gongusula?"
00:46:55,00:46:59,"No, it's basically the British umeral."
00:46:59,00:47:03,"It's someone who stands and watches activity on a canal, quite specifically."
00:47:03,00:47:06,Is this voyeuristic or just finished?
00:47:06,00:47:11,The canal activities that happen near me is basically graffiti.
00:47:11,00:47:12,"Yeah, taking drugs."
00:47:12,00:47:13,"Oh, really?"
00:47:13,00:47:14,I think hotbeds are vise.
00:47:14,00:47:15,I didn't know that.
00:47:15,00:47:19,"Oh, well, I'm used to the Gentile Southern Kennet and Avon canals"
00:47:19,00:47:21,"of places like that, where it's just simply watching a lot."
00:47:21,00:47:23,"Well, the least Liverpool I can tell you."
00:47:23,00:47:24,Drug-free canal.
00:47:24,00:47:25,Yeah.
00:47:25,00:47:28,And loads of joy-riders on the least Liverpool canal.
00:47:28,00:47:29,Going up four miles an hour.
00:47:29,00:47:35,I was reading a little about Britain's self-styled dullest man.
00:47:35,00:47:38,Because this is about standing around.
00:47:38,00:47:40,Yeah.
00:47:40,00:47:42,"Anyway, I'm very proud to have been nominated."
00:47:42,00:47:43,"Oh, actually."
00:47:43,00:47:47,I think he's called Kev.
00:47:47,00:47:50,"And he was featured in the Guardian a couple of years ago,"
00:47:50,00:47:53,because he's the man behind roundabouts of Redditch.
00:47:53,00:47:57,"Oh, a calendar, which did enormously well about 20 years ago"
00:47:57,00:47:58,and has led to a number of other works.
00:47:58,00:48:02,"You know, roundabouts of Great Britain, Carparks of Britain."
00:48:02,00:48:04,"Well, he's blown it, hasn't he?"
00:48:04,00:48:07,"You know, he can't be dull if you've been in the Guardian."
00:48:07,00:48:08,And you've got 12 books out.
00:48:08,00:48:11,"He's sort of, he sort of has."
00:48:11,00:48:14,And he founded the Carpark Appreciation Society.
00:48:14,00:48:17,"Claims to be the only member, but I did have a look and tried to join."
00:48:17,00:48:19,And I don't think it's a closed shop.
00:48:19,00:48:20,"I don't know, I'm not sure he's admitting."
00:48:21,00:48:24,"And he said, ""My three ex-wives found me dull,"
00:48:24,00:48:27,"not in the bedroom, but in every other part of the house."""
00:48:27,00:48:34,"Hey, apparently there's been a study done by a professor in Brighton"
00:48:34,00:48:38,"who says, ""The people that you shouldn't listen to about longevity."
00:48:38,00:48:40,"There's one group of people you shouldn't listen to."""
00:48:40,00:48:43,"Oh, I would guess centenarians."
00:48:43,00:48:45,"Yeah, people age 100 and more."
00:48:45,00:48:45,Why?
00:48:45,00:48:47,Their advice is just terrible.

00:49:14,00:49:16,I think that's great.
00:49:16,00:49:17,Is this really true?
00:49:17,00:49:19,"I mean, is there anything that's kept me drinking whisky?"
00:49:19,00:49:21,No.
00:49:21,00:49:22,And I've got to age you too.
