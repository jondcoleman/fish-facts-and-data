1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hey everyone, before we start this week's show, we just want to remind you that we have a little documentary on the internet, don't we?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 We sure do. It's not quite as hard-hitting as Louis the Roof, but there may be a couple more gags in it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 It's the behind-the-scenes look at our tour from last year when we were stalked with the camera and they filmed us doing japes and stuff.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Yeah, there's loads of behind-the-scenes, bits and pieces, there's loads of interviews with us, there's little bits from the show, it's really, really fun.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 You can get it on the internet, it's called Behind the Gills, you can get it on Apple, Google, Amazon, Ask Jeeps, MySpace and all those places where you get stuff from.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Yeah, okay, I'm on the show.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Moxupt's Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tajinsky and Alex Bell.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days, starting with James.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that if all the bacteria in the world disappeared, we wouldn't notice for about a week.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Would scientists notice in a lab if they were studying bacteria?

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Yes.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Would they just think that they must be down the other end of the Petri dish today?

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 They are small.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But I think I'm talking more of the day-to-day person going about their life.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 So this anyway is from a paper it's called Life in a World Without Microbes by Jack A. Gilbert and Josh D. Neufeld.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And it's absolutely brilliant, I love it.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 In this paper they say it would take us nearly a week to realise what had happened and then that they predict complete societal collapse only within a year or so.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Oh, that's good.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So the first week, you don't know to say anything and then 51 weeks later...

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I thought downhill.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 The whole of society collapses.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 So that 51 weeks is really horrible.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I reckon it would be, probably get progressively worse.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And you know the end is night.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 They say then annihilation of most humans and non-microscopic life on the planet would follow a prolonged period of starvation disease unrest, civil war, anarchy, and global biogeochemical asphyxiation.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 But would you then 90% of that already with the bacteria?

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 That's true.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 But for the first week, it's fine.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 We're okay.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Yeah.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So the thing is, let's think, what is there that we need microbes for and bacteria?

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So they're in your stomach, right?

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And they help you digest things.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Okay.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 But I found it really weird that you don't need, humans don't actually need them.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Exactly.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 We could be unwell without them or we could find it harder to digest things, but we can survive without bacteria.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I read that and I can quite believe it, because I thought we sure we must need them.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I think we just get constipated, wouldn't we?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yeah.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So there are some animals which do need them, aren't there?

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Although no one has said that.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Okay, for the first week we might be constipated.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Okay.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 But at least it's not prolonged period of starvation disease unrest, civil war, anarchy, and global biogeochemical asphyxiation.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Depends how bad your constipation is as well, you know?

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So yes, animals do need it, so cows would need it, for instance, because they can't digest cellulose without microbes.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And a few other animals would as well.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 But basically, eventually what would happen is all the nitrogen wouldn't be able to be fixed.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 The nitrogen cycle would stop, which is something that we need for life.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 So the plant all plants use that and then so the plants are going to die out.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Yeah, basically that life needs nitrogen and it goes around in the cycle like what it does.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 But without the microbes that would stop, which means that the oceans would get full of nitrogen, which means all the fish would die.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 We'd struggle to make oxygen as well because a lot of microbes make oxygen.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So a lot of bad things would happen.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And there's been a week too.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And there's been oftentimes everything is dying, and so nitrogen isn't being produced, but all the dead things just stay there.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Yes, it basically means that we need the mushrooms, and I hate to say this.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Well, we need the fungi.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 If all the microbes die and they can't break anything down, the only thing left to break things down is the mushrooms.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 They step in and save us.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Who'd have thought it?

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 It's not an action film. I especially want to say.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Would your poo stop smelling?

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Well, and your sweat.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I think that's one of the real bonuses of week one.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Is that the smell of sweat is just caused by all the bacteria.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 That's true.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And so we would smell great from you.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 You're constipated, so it doesn't really matter whether your poo smells or not.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 No, that is true.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 That would happen.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 So Louis Pasteur, the famous guy, scientist guy.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 For the sound of this Wikipedia page.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 He thought that we needed bacteria to live in microorganisms, otherwise we'd all die.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And then a bit after him, two guys came along.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Ten years later, two guys came along called George Nuttall and Hans Thurfelder.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 He disproved it by getting a guinea pig and getting rid of all its bacteria and microbes

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 and the guinea pig still managed to live.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 How did they do that?

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Well, I reckon there was probably a lot of antibiotics involved.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 They didn't just give it a shower.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I reckon there was a shower involved.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Yeah, you might as well soak it down.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 There must have been, right?

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Yeah.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And this is called nobiotic living.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 G-N-O, nobiotic.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Get this.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 There is a place in the world where this has kind of happened.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Your horror scenario, James, so it's in Chernobyl.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Lots of microbes and fungi got contamination and they died.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And as a result, there are loads of trees in this place called the red forest,

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 which is where all the trees turned red and died, and they're not decaying.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 So there's leaf litter, you know, there's sort of leaf mulch on the ground.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 It's three times thicker in the hottest bit of Chernobyl radiation-wise than it is in areas without radiation.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's quite cool, isn't it?

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Because leaf litter is quite a nice thing to walk through and kick it up in the area.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 So you'd go for some really nice, awesome walks, because it's still going to be raining.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 So it's still going to get wet and soggy and nasty.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's just going to be pretty hard to dust.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Yeah, he's right.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It's going to be really gross.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Yeah, it's going to be mulch, isn't it?

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Yeah, it is mulch on the face.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 That's not a romantic walk through the woods, is it?

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 When you kick it up.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 So bacteria are really cool, right?

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And you do, actually, when you do our job, you get really bored, actually,

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 of reading all the journalists you say, we have to do too much of it.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 But all journalists say, everyone thinks bacteria just disease-causing bastards

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 and actually some of them are really great, but some of them are really great.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And some of them are just cool.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So I learned about this one, which is the, let's see if I can bring out this,

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Aciditheobaculous, and you find it in caves.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And it only comes like a lot of bacteria in kind of microbial mats.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So they hang out together, bacteria often work together,

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 comes in these microbial mats with, you know, many millions of them,

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 all squashed up together, and it hangs off the ceiling,

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 and it looks exactly like a staluck mite.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Tite scoot.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I always thought tight was off the ceiling, and then someone told me it was the other way around.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Yeah, it's tights come down.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Yeah.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 That's what I always thought, and someone told me I was wrong.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Well, we're telling you, you're right.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Static tight, hold on tight.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Exactly, and staluck mite might, because it grows up.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Or mite, poke you in the bum.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 That's what I might follow your head.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Oh, yeah.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Tite to the ground is hard, isn't it?

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 The monarchs are hard.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Well, anyway, this stuff looks like a staluck tight,

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 and it hangs off the roof of caves,

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 but it's got the exact consistency of bogies.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And if you read about it in...

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Is that a scientific term?

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Yeah, because bogies have lots of different consistencies.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Of a healthy bogie, James.

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 A country bogie, not one of these horrible London polluted bogies.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 What would happen to your bogies, if all the bacteria disappeared?

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Great question.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Would they get stuck in your nose, like your poo?

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 No, no.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 No, no.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 You're going to get stuck in your nose.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 The nasal concentration is what I'm asking.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 They would not be colourful, like bogies are now.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I know, your pink bogies are always impressed me.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But the colours are the bacteria, aren't they?

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So you would still have mucus, but it would be...

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Really?

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 But what would it gather around?

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I thought the bacteria was the start of a mucus party.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Yes, well, you might have hairs in your nose.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I have got hairs on my nose.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And they could be used as a nucleus?

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Yes, I see that now.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 But, I mean, it's cleaner.

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 It's your first week of your body.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It's great.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 You don't smell no mucus, no pooing.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Oh, it's got some soft stops.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It's brilliant.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 You got glassy smell.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I can't think of it.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 We've gone off topic.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Sorry, we have something.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 We've strayed.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 What I'm saying is, there's a lot of bacteria,

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 which are basically bogies hanging from the ceiling.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And if you read journal articles about them,

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 they're referred to snottites as "insalactites".

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 So, you know, scientific journals.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 It's talking about the snottites.

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And they're actually really cool because they excrete sulfuric acid.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And that dissolves the limestone.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And it makes caves go sparkly.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 So, you get really sparkly caves,

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 because it creates gypsum, which is like gypsum crystals.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 It's very cool.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 But they are called snottites.

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 That sounds like an ancient people.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It does, isn't it?

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Yeah.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 They're fighting against their tights.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So, I looked up a few other what-ifs.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Oh, good idea.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So, this is a bit off topic, I know.

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 But I just basically went to Google and started going through what?

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I just, what if X happened?

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And there are loads of amazing results.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So, what would happen if there was no number six?

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 This is on 538.com.

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I just got straight from 5 to 7.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Well, no, this is the...

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I would.

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 You might.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 But basically, this was a question asked by a child who was five and a half years old.

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And clearly, interested in what happens next.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And they went to mathematics professors at Duke University.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And they said, well, everything would fall apart.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 They said.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 They said.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I imagine they said, stop wasting my time.

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I have no more important research to be getting on with.

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 They said it's really interesting.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Because basically, if there's no six, there can't be any numbers higher than six.

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 You can't have seven.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 That's true.

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 This is a math professor who said all the other integers are out.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 It's very detrimental.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 If you think about it, how do you define six?

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 One more than five.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 How do you define seven?

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Two more than five.

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Then you're five.

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Oh, exactly.

221
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 So, if you define it as one more than six, you're in trouble.

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 But if you define it as two more than five, you're absolutely fine.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But then, if you start working that way, how do you define 11?

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Six more than five.

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Yeah.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 But there's no six.

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 So now 11's in trouble.

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Exactly.

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 This is an actual math professor who said, we are screwed if we lose six.

230
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I think to reassure him, you just get low.

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 You just bump seven down, don't you?

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And then you bump eight down.

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Everyone gets a bump down one.

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Or you could promote everyone from zero to five.

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And then you promote zero to one.

236
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Zero is always wanted to be one.

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Zero is just sitting there uselessly.

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 The concept of zero is a useless one as established by all that.

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But it didn't exist until, you know.

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 It wasn't about the seventh century.

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 How do we get to the seventh century without zero?

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It's impossible.

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Exactly.

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It was the sixth century then, all the eight.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Anyway, I was looking at some motive stuff as well.

246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Mainly because you said you were.

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And I thought, I'll copy Andy.

248
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 That's what I do.

249
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 So there's the what if everyone thinks about if we all jumped at the same time,

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 what would happen?

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And if we all gathered together in the same place and jumped at the same time,

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 then we would push the earth in the opposite direction to the way we jumped

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 by a hundred the radius of a hydrogen atom, which I think is actually decent.

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Yeah, that's not bad.

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Is it worth the organisation required?

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Yeah, that's not, I think that's not much actually.

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 We could jump.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 As soon as you come back down, the earth comes back up to meet you, doesn't it?

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Yeah, so it's not long-lasting.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It's a very rare circumstance in which we need the earth to move that little distance

261
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 for that shorter time.

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Would everyone at the other end of the earth go, "Well, what was that?"

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 No, we're all.

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 No one's even there to experience.

265
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 It would be amazing, Alex, if you were the only person on the other side of the earth.

266
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 No, we just did it as the elaborate.

267
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Where is everyone?

268
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I must have missed a memo.

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 You're like, "Where is everyone?"

270
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And why have I just moved one half of the hydrogen atom?

271
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I have a two-way hydrogen atom.

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 The entire world's jumping in a party and it's like on Facebook.

273
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Oh, that's where they are.

274
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Seven billion, attending.

275
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 One has not replied.

276
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Great.

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Can I give you one more what if?

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Then I'm done.

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I didn't know if you shot a powerful gun, like a sort of a cannon gun,

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 but a gun that exists today, a modern gun, on the moon,

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 you can shoot yourself in the back.

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It's so cool.

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 It's an elaborate suicide method, isn't it?

284
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 If you want to fox the detective.

285
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 One of Agatha Christie's later, great stories.

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 The man has found dead a lone on the moon.

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I'm just saying.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So hang on, does the bullet go all the way around the moon?

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 It does, so the moon's small enough that the gravitation of the pool isn't too much.

290
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 It basically goes, you have to be on top of a hill or something.

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 On a mountain, yeah.

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 It kind of stays in very, very low orbit if you get the right velocity.

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 You obviously have to have a very precise shot to make sure you do hit yourself.

294
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Does it only work its way on once, but if you shot it and then you felt it go past your it,

295
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 would it go around against you?

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Have time to stand one click for that.

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 No, I think you've only got one chance.

298
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Really?

299
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Because then you'd lose momentum, wouldn't you?

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It does still have a gravitation.

301
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Yeah, it might still hit you, but it might hit you lower down like in the testicles.

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Oh, yeah.

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 In height.

304
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 In height.

305
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I've found shot in the testicles on the moon alone.

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 That is a great what if.

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 That's incredible.

308
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 It's probably all from Randall Monroe.

309
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Who knows when you're looking up stuff, hypothetical stuff on the internet?

310
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 How many of them were originally Randall Monroe?

311
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So we should credit him just in case.

312
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Randall Monroe basically invented the two words, what an if.

313
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 He did, yeah.

314
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Yeah.

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 No, he, that's ridiculous.

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 He just invented putting them together.

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 What if he did?

318
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 My fact is the world's largest wine cellar has tunnels 150 miles long,

320
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 and it's so big it has to have traffic rules for people who drive through it.

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 That is very cool.

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Yeah, it's incredible.

323
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 It's incredible.

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 It's in Moldova, and it's got streets, and all the streets are named after different grapes.

325
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And you can drive a car through it, and a lot of employees there.

326
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 They just cycle around all the time, which is something it's called.

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 It's called Milesty Michi, and it's in, it's near the capital of Chiznau.

328
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Yeah, it's incredible.

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Yeah, who knew, I mean, James, obviously, but who knew of the rest of humanity

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 about Moldova's wine industry?

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 I know, because I've had Moldova wine.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Yeah, you don't.

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 You love it, don't you?

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Well, I do not rate it very highly on my list of wines by country.

335
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I must say.

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Drunk a lot in Russia.

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 They drink a lot in Russia, and the same way they drink Georgian wines.

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I was reading that they really messed up the Moldova wine trade.

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 In fact, I think it was about 2005, when Putin imposed some sanctions on Moldova,

340
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 and he banned all imports of their wine from going into Russia

341
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 because they were a bit too pro-EU for him.

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Or I think he said it was some other reason, but I think it was because they were too pro-EU.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And they're just loosening it, so that really damaged their wine trade.

344
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Because about 40% of their exports went to Russia.

345
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 That's so weird, because Vladimir Putin, he has his own cave in the second largest wine seller in Moldova.

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 That was really pissing off.

347
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 No, no, no, it's a nice fight.

348
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 That's only 120 kilometers, but he has his own cave there.

349
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And lots of celebrities or wealthy people have their own special little zone.

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Oh, I thought it was Beverly Hills, but for wine.

351
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Yeah, but he had his 50th birthday party in that second largest wine seller in Cricova.

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 So cool.

353
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 The wine seller at Cricova.

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Have you heard about this? They have a race there?

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 No.

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 So it hosts a 10 kilometer race around the wine seller.

357
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And you wear a headlamp, because obviously it's quite dark, a lot of the place.

358
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And at the end of it, you get a glass of Mold wine.

359
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 But during the race, they hire someone to dress up as the grim reaper and chase you.

360
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 No, hey.

361
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 It sounds to me like the prizes get in the wine, right?

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Yeah.

363
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Kind of.

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But you're running around next to a load of wine.

365
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Yeah.

366
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 No one ever gets to the end.

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 They also realise that it's like building an Olympic stadium out of gold medals.

368
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 We should say that that second largest wine tunnel or cave or seller in Moldova is also the second largest in the world.

369
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Oh, yeah, absolutely.

370
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 It majors in this thing, having big wine sellers.

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And this one, the biggest one, Milesty Meatsy.

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Two million bottles it has, which is more than the next 10 sellers combined.

373
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Wow.

374
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 No.

375
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's a big sellermate.

376
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Jesus.

377
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 That is really big.

378
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Yeah.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Try some.

380
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 We are actually drinking wine now, aren't we?

381
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 To celebrate this fact.

382
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 That's pretty good.

383
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 We are.

384
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I was thinking to celebrate, nice one, James.

385
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 You've earned yourself another glass for that.

386
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 That's good.

387
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 That's really going to help my performance later on.

388
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I'll cave in and have a glass too.

389
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Very strong.

390
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Alex, have you got a pun that will earn you a glass of this red wine?

391
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 I don't have to have one because I'm the banker.

392
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I've got nothing.

393
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Oh, well.

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Well, we've got some beer here.

395
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Yeah.

396
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 What else can we say?

397
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 So in Moldova, you will find the world's largest building in the shape of a bottle.

398
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And it is.

399
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 It hosts the Strong Drinks Museum.

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Wow.

401
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 It sounds like an awesome museum, right?

402
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Yeah.

403
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Hello, welcome to this.

404
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 What did you like the audio guy?

405
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 The audio guy was the same guy as me.

406
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 My wife.

407
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Is it all I've ever understood?

408
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 When you say the largest building shape, like a bottle,

409
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 it's not that it's the largest building in the world and it's shaped like a bottle.

410
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 No, mate.

411
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 It's just that there are some buildings in the world, shaped like bottles, and Moldova has the biggest one.

412
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Yeah.

413
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 So the largest building in the world is somewhere in Dubai or something, isn't it?

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 No, it's not Taipei.

415
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And we would probably know if it was shaped like a white bottle.

416
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Oh, yeah.

417
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Well, kind of odd.

418
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Scrape is all shaped a bit like wine bottle.

419
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Wow.

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 It's a great philosophical point for another time.

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 A bit.

422
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 The Gurkin, isn't.

423
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Uh, no, that's true.

424
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 That's shaped like a Gurkin, the walkie-talkie.

425
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 No, true.

426
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 The entire state building is shaped like a novelty liquor bottle, I would say.

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 The shot is shaped like a tiny bit of broken wine bottle.

428
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 But we didn't bottle wine until 1860.

429
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I think it was.

430
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 So it was illegal to sell wine by the bottle between 1636 and 1860.

431
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And the reason was that people who were doing it before that, when glass first came in,

432
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 it was really easy to cheat on the sides.

433
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So you could sell someone a bottle that wasn't enough wine.

434
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 So you sold it by the barrel and then you took it home and you put it in your own bottle.

435
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 There were bottles of wine that existed.

436
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Yeah, yeah, they had them at home.

437
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I didn't know how you siphoned it in.

438
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 You couldn't buy a bottle.

439
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Yeah.

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Because I get a bit annoyed when there's not a reasonable size option at a bar.

441
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 And if I had to choose between a glass of wine and a barrel of wine, I'd be very annoyed.

442
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I'd like a large glass.

443
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 No, we don't do that.

444
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 We're 125 ml or a barrel.

445
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I'll have a barrel.

446
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Have you heard about the government's wine seller?

447
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 No.

448
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 So the government of this country has a wine seller and it's for when they host parties or receptions

449
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 or dignitaries or big dinners, you know, they do loads of official occasions.

450
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And so they have to have a wine seller and it's got about 34,000 bottles of wine in it.

451
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Valued, I think about £800,000.

452
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 But it's really clever.

453
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 They try and sell fund by selling off every year or every few years.

454
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 They sell off some really good wines.

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 You know, they sell one bottle of a great wine which allows them to throw an entire party with rubbish wine.

456
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Sure.

457
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And during the Second World War, one of the first aggressive actions of Britain and the entire wall

458
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 was to requisition the wine from the German Embassy.

459
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Similarly, I didn't know about the Bolshevik revolution and it's running into wine problems.

460
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 So this was when the Bolshevik stormed the Winter Palace.

461
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 The Winter Palace obviously had this enormous wine seller which they all discovered

462
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 or the red guard had been sent in.

463
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And they got really drunk immediately.

464
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Was there a rosé guard as well who were not as popular?

465
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 So yeah, they went and got really drunk and then they'd send others in.

466
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 So the leaders, the Bolshevik leaders, your Lenin's, they're quite annoyed because they really want to get on with the job.

467
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And they keep sending in more guards and more people in their revolutionary lot.

468
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And they kept getting drunk.

469
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And I was reading an extract from this guy called Antonov Of Sienko who was a Bolshevik commander.

470
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And he remembered repeatedly sending troops in and them succumbing.

471
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Eventually, he said we sent armoured cars to drive away other crowds.

472
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 But the armoured cars started weaving suspiciously after a short amount of time.

473
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And then he said they tried to flood the sellers so that this wine issue was totally removed.

474
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And the firemen they deployed to flood the sellers ended up getting drunk.

475
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So they failed to do that.

476
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 It was just havoc.

477
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 That is amazing.

478
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Yeah, very undisciplined.

479
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 That's so funny.

480
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Have you had Octavian vaults?

481
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 No.

482
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 It's another mine actually and it's in Wiltshire.

483
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And it's got five million bottles of wine in it.

484
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 What?

485
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 No.

486
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 But this one that's of the world's biggest has got two million.

487
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 No, you're right.

488
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 I'm looking at that and doubting it now.

489
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But it's under caution in Wiltshire.

490
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I mean, it's not...

491
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Wait, caution is where the secret nuclear bunker is as well.

492
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It got a lot on the ground, man.

493
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 It's basically for wealthy people or famous people.

494
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But it's the size of 20 football pitches and they hold a huge amount of wine there.

495
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Which people have as investments and things like that.

496
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I think I should go and check it out for research purposes.

497
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 If I don't come out for a while, I'll not come along.

498
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Just make sure I'm...

499
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 I think they'll send me in.

500
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I think they'll send in Alex as well.

501
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I'm gonna send it back and find that Anna's finished it all off.

502
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 You're gonna be waiting to end one of these things.

503
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 If Anna had been in the Russian Revolution, it would have all been over a lot faster.

504
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Well, I quite like about wine is how French wine has just always been the best wine.

505
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So...

506
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Just the one-kissing you've ever said on a podcast.

507
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 What I love about it...

508
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 When the Greeks first met the goals and tasted what the grapes were like, what the wine was like.

509
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 They were like, this is obviously the only wine we're gonna drink.

510
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 The same with the Romans from the start of the Roman Empire, the invasion of the goals in like the 50s BC.

511
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 They immediately started making sure all their wine was imported from there.

512
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 To the extent that by 92 AD, the Emperor Demission said that he wasn't gonna allow any new planting in France.

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 So they had they possessed France in France by that point.

514
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 He said, you're not allowed to plant vines here because it's ruining the industry back home.

515
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 It's ruining the Roman industry because people only want to drink French wine.

516
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So there must be an objective quality to French wine that must be better?

517
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Well, there's an objective quality to Moldovan wine that says it's not as good in my opinion.

518
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 They weren't banning any Moldovan from growing their own vines and export them.

519
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Sure, feel free to try to sell this to your wine.

520
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Yeah.

521
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So, obviously wine sellers can have rat problems.

522
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Yeah, they can, as Incas, they're sellers. And a lot of French wine sellers have rat problems.

523
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And you get populations of alcoholic rats.

524
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 To the extent where there is a traditional Bordeaux recipe for rat that you want?

525
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 What?

526
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Real alcoholic rats.

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 It specifies alcoholic rats as part of the recipe because they've drunk rats.

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 How do you identify whether a rat is an alcoholic or not?

529
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 If you notice the rat drinking in the morning, is that when you know that you can cook the rat?

530
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 They've got shaky paws.

531
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Can we rat identify that it's an alcoholic?

532
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I think there's a big stage denial of rats.

533
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Admitting you have a problem is the first step.

534
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Admitting you are a rat at the best step.

535
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Well, on stage 12, the cooking is you skin them and eviscerate them.

536
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 With a thick sauce of olive oil and crushed shallots and grill them over fire of broken wine barrels.

537
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 So, I mean, there is a sort of element of remapsism about the wine, including that picture.

538
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Yeah, it's about a wine barrel as well.

539
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But, like, that's kind of cool, right?

540
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 That's very subtle.

541
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Real mansicism.

542
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 It does sound post-apocalyptic as well.

543
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 That's true.

544
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I think it's a shame Valentine's Day is over otherwise.

545
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 We'd all be serenading our partners with this kind of recipe.

546
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

547
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Yep, my fact this week is that, before they settled on the name Windsor,

548
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 surnames that were considered for the royal family,

549
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 included gulf, whipper, wetting, chewed a steward, and England.

550
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I like chewed a steward because it's like a double barrel where they've taken both sides of the family.

551
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I know, but I think they were worried it might sound a bit posh,

552
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 and the royal family knew how they liked to not give that impression.

553
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Yeah, they went really old, good old winds.

554
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Sort of, yeah.

555
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I like gulf and wetting, especially.

556
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I've been in a lot of, you know, first idea brainstorming meetings,

557
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 where there's no bad ideas, and that really sounds like it's one of those.

558
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 What is gulf?

559
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 How do you spell gulf?

560
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 So, it's G-U-E-L-P-H, so I don't know if that's the right pronunciation, actually.

561
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Well, the house of gulf sounds so rubber.

562
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 So there was reasoning for all of this. This was in 1917.

563
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So the royal family descended from Queen Victoria, who'd married Albert,

564
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 were really officially the Saxkobergotha family,

565
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 which had a bit of a German ring to it,

566
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 and in 1917, for obvious reasons, Germany wasn't everyone's favourite country,

567
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 and they decided to change their name, and they changed it to Windsor,

568
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 and all of these other names genuinely were justified.

569
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 So, Albert's house, the Saxon royal house,

570
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 had the names wetting and whipper in it,

571
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 and then gulf came from the Hannah Varian royal house,

572
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 and then, yeah, people threw in Tudor Stuart, why not?

573
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Everyone loved the Tudors, everyone loved the Stuart.

574
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Who gets had over is in Germany.

575
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Right, so people would have picked up. That's probably why I was dismissed quite early on.

576
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I think you've buried the most hilarious lead in the story,

577
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 and that they took the name from Windsor Castle,

578
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 so the royal family was named after Windsor Castle rather than vice versa.

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 I think that's insane. That is very weird.

580
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 It's so funny.

581
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 But nobody knew what the official surname was,

582
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 because they'd never been used. They didn't really know if they had a surname or not.

583
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Yeah.

584
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And when they got rid of the surname, it wasn't just the surname,

585
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 it was the use of degree styles, dignitaries, titles,

586
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 and honours of dukes and duchess of Saxony and princes

587
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 and princesses of the Sax, Cobra, and Gotha,

588
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 and all other German degree styles, dignitaries, titles, honours and appellations,

589
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 because they have all this crap, like at the beginning of the end of their name.

590
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So, they had to completely re-brand themselves.

591
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It's not just case changing your name, it's not.

592
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 But isn't the Queen now Windsor Mount Baton?

593
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Yes.

594
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Because you of Philip took, he wanted to say it. No, it's for a favourite cake.

595
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Is it, even though you're always all in there,

596
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 when she's just a man with your thing of Mount Batonburg?

597
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 It's like horseshoe or more Batonburgs on top of it.

598
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 That is weird though, because the Batonburgs were the Batonburgs,

599
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 but they changed to the Batonburgs of Philip's family,

600
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and at the same time, they thought we need to sound a bit less German,

601
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 so they changed to Mount Baton.

602
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 So, get this.

603
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Do you know the exact thing which prompted them to change?

604
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Because we'd had three years of total war against Germany before they thought,

605
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 "Oh, maybe we should be sounding so German."

606
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 The thing which prompted it was that there was a bombing raid on London.

607
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And before that, there were some bombs from Zeppelin's,

608
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 but this is the first time there was a heavy bomber plane dropping bombs on the British population.

609
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 June 1917, and the bomber planes were called Gotha Plains.

610
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 That was the name.

611
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And people looked and thought, hang on, if they're called Gotha Plains,

612
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 and those guys are called Bessachsikober Gothas, something's not right.

613
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And it was within a month, they changed the name.

614
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 That was how first the turnaround was, which is quite a speedy...

615
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 We still have Goths.

616
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Yeah, that's true, yeah.

617
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Why didn't they rebrand it?

618
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Imagine, oh, look, there's a pack of winters over there.

619
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 It was pretty good.

620
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 But the other thing is, why didn't the Germans then just rename their planes, winters?

621
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Just every time the Queen changed her name, they just renamed the planes.

622
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 I think the priority of the German Luftwaffe was to gently troll the Royal family into submission.

623
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I think they were trying to just blow up the whole country.

624
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I agree with that, but then on the other hand, there is a certain kind of propaganda thing

625
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 that they're trying to do all the time, isn't it?

626
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Yeah, I reckon it would work that.

627
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I do agree, they miss the trick.

628
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Do you know why Elizabeth is Windsor Mountbatten rather than just Windsor,

629
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 which was the suggestion?

630
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 No, it's Mountbatten something to do with Prince Philip or something.

631
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 It certainly is, but they were the Windsor House and actually when they were born Charles and Anne,

632
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 weren't born Windsor Mountbatten, but then a, what's described as an expert amateur,

633
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 wrote to the Royal family or wrote to the government and said,

634
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 if this Prince Andrew who was about to be born,

635
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 if this baby that the Queen's pregnant with is born, not with his father's name,

636
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 then he will have the badge of bastardry upon him.

637
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Wow.

638
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Because, you know, it's a piss embarrassing to not have your father.

639
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 The implies your parents might not be married.

640
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And this causes huge consternation and there was an official parliamentary investigation into it

641
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 where they decided eventually that they had to add Mountbatten to the name,

642
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 because otherwise it would people would just assume Prince Andrew was a bastard born out of wedlock.

643
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I mean, and of course, clearly people knew, didn't they?

644
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 It was literally his parents with the Queen and Prince Philip.

645
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 You would have thought.

646
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 At least at that point on the Royal family went on to avoid any control of these two parities.

647
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Thank God that was down the line.

648
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Well, Prince Andrew, have a course.

649
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 But Prince Charles calls himself Charles Wales, doesn't he?

650
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Yeah, they still put it pretty fast at loose with their surnames, don't they?

651
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Which would have been even more embarrassing if they'd been called England.

652
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Yeah.

653
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Yeah, you're right.

654
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Especially like we call it.

655
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Would you have hibernated to England Wales?

656
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 If it's like a football match.

657
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 What was that thing that you said they would have if the child was born with?

658
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 At the badge of bastardry.

659
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 That weirdly is my only boy scout achievement.

660
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 For the other lads club together and gone over me, it's pretty proud.

661
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 What was the guy, what was he an amateur or what was he called?

662
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Expert amateur.

663
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He was an expert amateur.

664
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 I feel like we get quite a lot of those actually writing into QI and we love them by the way.

665
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 He was a real expert, wasn't it?

666
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I think he'd previously embarrassed the government on other occasions by pointing out,

667
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 "Actually, if you do that, then genealogically you're screwed."

668
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 So he was good.

669
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Yeah, and it wasn't that tone of voice, would you have fun and joy?

670
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Did you know that another role surname, Stuart, way further back, like Mary Queen of Scots,

671
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 was originally steward, as in like an S steward, as in Steward.

672
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 That's where he got a role.

673
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 He was somewhere for Ryanair, didn't he?

674
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Yeah, he would, after his coronation, he would push the royal trolley all the way down Westminster Abbey,

675
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 offering due to free on the left of the right.

676
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 To the pews.

677
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 So Mary Queen of Scots changed her name from Steward to Steward, S-T-U-A-R-T.

678
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Yeah, because the French wouldn't have been able to pronounce it, they would have pronounced the W as a V,

679
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 and it would have been steward.

680
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 She would have been Mary Steward.

681
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Are you serious? That's why Stuart doesn't have a W now.

682
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Yeah, and she just did it.

683
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And they just do it just because people weren't pronouncing it correctly, so they're just like, "Well, fine."

684
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 But the French wouldn't pronounce the D all the T at the end of that word, would they?

685
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Because they miss out the...

686
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 So it doesn't really matter if it's Steward or Steward.

687
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 No, it's weird that you change the D to a T.

688
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 No, yeah, that makes sense. But then she would be Steward. It's the Steward.

689
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 But maybe it was just those rhino jokes that just got to her agenda.

690
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I think there may be a change in the Royal Family's name coming up soon.

691
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Oh, hello.

692
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I'm all certain about this.

693
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Sorry. You do say that.

694
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I know I do.

695
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Come on.

696
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 What are you saying the other day?

697
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I use the word "hello" sometimes to me.

698
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Oh, hello.

699
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Did you do that?

700
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I didn't believe him.

701
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I didn't believe it either.

702
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Yeah, I do sometimes.

703
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I do.

704
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 But I think that that was the original meaning of the word "hello", wasn't it?

705
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Yeah.

706
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 I'm not making a point. It's just what I say.

707
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 No, I know.

708
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I just didn't believe you.

709
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And I'm really sorry for interrupting Andy.

710
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 When you guys are quite finished.

711
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 So when the throne is inherited from a queen, i.e. down a matrilineal line, right?

712
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 The Royal House often changes to reflect the patrilineal descent of the new monarch.

713
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It's a bit naughty.

714
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 But...

715
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 So Queen Elizabeth is in the wet in Dynasty, as you say, from a branch of the House of the

716
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Saxco-Bergotha line, okay?

717
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 But Prince Charles, his father's line, is Prince Philip, obviously.

718
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 And Prince Philip is a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluckstburg.

719
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 So genealogically...

720
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Goodness, we won't have the German problem again.

721
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 So Charles William, everybody down that line, because of that sort of ancient, slightly sexist,

722
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 you know, tradition of the patrilineal thing, they are all members of that dynasty.

723
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 They probably will not change to make themselves the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluckstburgs,

724
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 but there's an outside chance.

725
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 That's like all of the names they brainstormed put together.

726
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 It's really weird that they have a hype...

727
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Like, their surname is a hypothetical surname.

728
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 They're like, "Well, this is what our surname would be if we ever really used it."

729
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Yeah, because they don't use them, don't they?

730
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 But they don't because they have time they literally never use them.

731
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 So this whole thing is pointless.

732
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Don't need them. It's like Madonna. Don't need a surname.

733
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Yeah.

734
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Same thing.

735
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 She's made Chicone, you mean?

736
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 I was sort of...

737
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Hey, in royal news.

738
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Yeah.

739
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 This is the thing that's happened this week, which you probably read about,

740
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 is the thing about Prince Henrik, who was the Danish Queen Margaret's husband

741
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 who died this week or last week.

742
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 But it's just a thing that's in the news this week, so I was reminded of it.

743
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 But I find it really weird that Prince Henrik of Denmark has been annoyed his whole life

744
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 that he hasn't been promoted to the same level as his wife.

745
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Like, he has made no secret of the fact that he's furious that he's not King Consort.

746
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 He's Prince Consort.

747
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 That is weird.

748
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 He doesn't have the same status as his son or his wife.

749
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 So he's just died and he has refused to be buried next to his wife, the Danish Queen Margaret,

750
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 because he's like, "Well, if you don't think we're equal in life, I suppose we're not equal in life."

751
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 But she's still alive.

752
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Yeah.

753
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Well, I think she can make the decision for now, can I say?

754
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 I'm sorry to be crude about it, but...

755
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 She's been... she's done the graceful thing and allowed him not to be buried in the graceful mind.

756
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 I mean, you could have a compromise and he would just be buried facing away with his arms crossed.

757
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Clutching the TV remote.

758
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Did you know all Spanish people have a secret surname?

759
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 I'm not even joking.

760
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Is it the same for everyone?

761
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 No, it's different for everyone.

762
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Right, okay.

763
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Different.

764
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 For everyone.

765
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Well, no, logically, I've boxed myself into a corner of that.

766
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Do you know the Thai in Thailand? Sorry to interrupt, but we'll get back to that, but in Thailand.

767
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Every family has to have a different surname.

768
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 You just knocked Andy off the fact stool with your feet and then jumped on it.

769
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Oh, no.

770
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 This is, it's extremely relevant.

771
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Yeah.

772
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Okay.

773
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 You don't know if it's relevant or not.

774
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I haven't told you about facts.

775
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 I think I'm going to be a nice follow-on fact.

776
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 How have Andy finished his?

777
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 No, it's relevant to the little stupid joke that I made in the middle of Andy's thing,

778
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 which wasn't really relevant.

779
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Yeah.

780
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Yeah, but a single family has to have a given family name, but it's not allowed to be the same as anyone else.

781
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Wait, so everyone's got a different surname.

782
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 How do you know someone's your cousin?

783
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 You don't.

784
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Oh.

785
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Why don't they're going to run out?

786
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Well, they're quite long Thai names, aren't they?

787
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 They aren't.

788
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 That's why they're so, that's probably why they're so long, yeah?

789
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Just like your password for your computer.

790
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 The name is long enough.

791
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 No one else is going to have the same name.

792
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 We all live with this issue online every day.

793
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 We have to have unique codes for it.

794
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 But you then have to have a surname plus one, two, three and then the cat's name.

795
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 What's your name?

796
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 It's Andrew Smith, 1986.

797
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Right.

798
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Did you know that all Spanish people have a secret second surname that no one outside Spain knows about?

799
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 What?

800
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Yeah.

801
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 So children inherit two surnames, one from their mother, one from their father.

802
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 So there are Spanish people who are called.

803
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 You'll have heard of them.

804
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Raphael Nadel Pereira, Enrique Iglesias Prasler and Fernando Alonso Diaz.

805
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 These are all their actual names.

806
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 So there's third ones.

807
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Why aren't they?

808
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Why don't we know about the third ones?

809
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 It's not common.

810
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 It's not reported.

811
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And how did you get the scoop?

812
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Well, here's the interesting thing is that until recently, automatically the first one would be from the husband,

813
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 from the male parent and the second one from the female parent, the mother.

814
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And children would only inherit properly the first surname of each parent.

815
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 So there's over time there's a trend towards keeping male surnames and not female ones.

816
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And as of last year, parents get to choose.

817
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 So that will now be bounced out of them.

818
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 True in Russia as well.

819
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 They have secret surnames.

820
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 So Vladimir Vich Putin.

821
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 That's his real name.

822
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 I can see what he cut the unnecessary.

823
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Yeah.

824
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 That's why Russian novels are so confusing to read.

825
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Yes.

826
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 So many different bloody names.

827
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 The Spanish one was quite interesting because it's kind of like natural selection through surnames because the nicer surname, from now on, the nicer surname will be picked.

828
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 So you'll get lovely surnames.

829
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 That's true, actually.

830
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Because it's unlikely you're going to be called, you know, tick-face cockhead.

831
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 And then I even got two shit names to pay for them, which one they do.

832
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Yeah, that is an unlikely name.

833
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Road names are dying out.

834
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 So in 1881, there were 3,211 cocks in the UK.

835
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 And now there are only 785.

836
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 And they're all in the House of Commons.

837
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Yeah.

838
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 That's a joke. It's 650 capacity.

839
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Sorry, it doesn't work.

840
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 It doesn't make any sense.

841
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Wow, only 785.

842
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Yeah, same with a lot of surnames like Shuffle Bottom.

843
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 That's massively declined.

844
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Only 322 of those left darts are going down.

845
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 It's about 75% decline in these names.

846
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 That's a shame.

847
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I tell you the way to protect a name is by giving people money to have the name.

848
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 The University of Glasgow.

849
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 How much money would you need to be called Alex Cock?

850
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 That's a good point.

851
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 If I gave you £10,000, but you had to keep Alex Cock for the rest of your life.

852
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 No.

853
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 You serious?

854
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Are you kidding me?

855
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 James, I'll do it for a tenor.

856
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Oh, I'm not going to bargain up to a tenor immediately.

857
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 We have a winner.

858
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Great.

859
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 It's just a name cock.

860
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 No, no, no, no, no.

861
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 I got cocked.

862
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Yeah, but that's still...

863
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Like in Bolton, that's just a nice way of saying hello to Emma.

864
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 All right, Emma cock.

865
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Okay.

866
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Is it?

867
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Yeah.

868
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 That sounds like the kind of thing you're telling me now.

869
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Anyway, the University of Glasgow offer a grant of up to £500 for anyone with a surname Graham.

870
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 It's called the Graham Trust.

871
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 And they offer it because traditionally Graham was a name for poor people a long time ago.

872
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Are you joking?

873
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 I know.

874
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 You still get that.

875
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 It's just on their website.

876
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 And there's just a paragraph saying that the original name from 1759 was the distribution to persons of the name of Graham,

877
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 or descendants of persons of that name, such sums that they shall just requisite and to put poor boys of the same name,

878
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 or descendants of such Bavara to enable the...

879
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 But then that is not a poor name now, is it?

880
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 No, but it's carried on.

881
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 But is it...

882
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 So it's for how much money?

883
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 £500.

884
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Well, Heather Graham, if you're listening, and we know you do, your quid's in now.

885
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 For an Arsenal manager, George Graham.

886
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 Yeah.

887
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 For another reference, I guess you didn't get the Heather Graham one.

888
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Do you know any of the Graham's?

889
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 I was trying to think of like a rich Graham.

890
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 I can't really think of them.

891
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 No, it's good.

892
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Heather Graham's got to be worth a bubble too.

893
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 I don't know who that is.

894
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 Heather Graham's.

895
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 I'm Austin Powers.

896
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 She's in the second Austin Powers film.

897
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 She plays Felicity Shagwell.

898
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 That's an unusual segment.

899
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 There aren't that many Shagwells these days.

900
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Actually, if you're called Shagwell, you can get a £50 grant from the University of Kiel.

901
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number four, and that is Alex.

902
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 My fact of this week is that in 2012, thieves stole an entire ski lift from the Czech Republic.

903
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 I'm glad that you specified it was thieves because imagine if it was law-abiding people who stole it.

904
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 It has to be thieves.

905
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Yes, I'm sorry.

906
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 That's amazing.

907
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Sorry, just one of the things on the lift or the whole tyre lift.

908
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 So all of the pylons, the cables, all of the gondola chairs on it.

909
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 The whole thing was just taken away overnight.

910
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 It wasn't that crazy.

911
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Was there another ski resort that opened its magical new lift two days later?

912
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 The thing is, I reckon more than one person was involved in this theft, right?

913
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 I'm pretty anxious.

914
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 I'm pretty anxious not to chuck around.

915
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 I just don't think so.

916
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 James walking around with his note pad and his face is coming out.

917
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 I think this is more than one person.

918
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Certainly, I'm putting my Sherlock Holmes hat on.

919
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 But I think, you know, you can't do it on your own.

920
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 No, that would be another great agatha Christy, where Poirot calls them all together in the drawing room.

921
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Actually, you all sculled it.

922
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Where is the jealous now on the moon?

923
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 That's incredible.

924
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 Yeah, I don't know how they did it.

925
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 I don't sure you'd need, sort of, like, jamburget to take it away and stuff or huge lorries.

926
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 It's unbelievable.

927
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 I think, well, I think, because if you think about ski lifts, you can take them apart.

928
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 I suppose you have the right equipment and you're able to chop up all the pylons.

929
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 A lot of it, you know, getting the right equipment, you can take anything apart.

930
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 That's true, but it is.

931
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 It's all, like, if you think about it, they're quite simply made things.

932
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 They're huge, just lots and lots and lots of metal.

933
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 It's not rumbly, really complicated, dense stuff.

934
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 You've got hollow pylons.

935
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 You've got a long, long strands of cable.

936
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 And you've got lots of individual stackable gauntletes.

937
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 You can just wind up the cable onto a reel or something, can't you?

938
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 Well, I'd wind it around one of the gauntletes.

939
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 I think that's probably the easiest way.

940
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 When Christmas lights, when you wind up the fog.

941
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 But as soon as you put it away, it gets gnawed.

942
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 That's why they haven't set it up yet.

943
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 They're still trying to get it apart.

944
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 They sort of got all the pylons together and tied it together with a string.

945
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Yeah.

946
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 So that, that, that happens.

947
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Are we going to talk about ski lifts or massive things that have been stolen?

948
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Can I tell you my one favourite, amazing, my favourite fact about lifts?

949
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 And then that's the only thing I've got on a big ski lift.

950
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Yeah.

951
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Well, cable calls specifically, because there's no skiing involved in this one.

952
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 But this is potentially my favourite fact, if it's true.

953
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 And I rang TFL to find out today and they haven't got back to me yet.

954
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 So Coco may yet run in with a note telling me it's true.

955
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Well, there's the last fact.

956
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 So, yeah, it's not looking good for this combination.

957
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Well, either way, it's a cool idea.

958
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And it's sort of half interesting anyway.

959
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Is that the Emirates cable car, Emirates airline,

960
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 the gauntlet, which goes from Grennage to the Docklands over the River Thames.

961
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 It's about 90 metres above the water.

962
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 The fact that I read was that that's tall enough for most ships to go under.

963
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 But, you know, just like with Tower Bridge,

964
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 they have the capabilities to lift the road for tall ships to get through.

965
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 The same capability exists with this cable car,

966
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 which is that if you take off all the gauntlets off the cable car,

967
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 then the reduction in weight means that the cable raises by a few metres,

968
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 meaning that even ships are just all of them that can get through.

969
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 I would say if you're wanting to steal that cable car,

970
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 then you turn up and you take all of the bits first, don't you?

971
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 You take all of these bubbles first and you say,

972
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 "Oh, no, I'm just doing it because there's a ship on its way."

973
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 And then after that, all you have to do is wind up the rope.

974
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,960
 Very driving the Eastway would be to put a hook on top of a 90-meter high ship and just drive it as fast as you can

975
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,560
 Actually, to be honest if this is we're doing this in a karting universe then you probably would stretch and then you go

976
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,000
 Straight back into central. That's the old dog taking a string of sausages

977
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,680
 All you need is one of the sausages to be in your mouth

978
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,340
 I googled biggest things ever stolen and the internet seems to think it's a mountain

979
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,560
 a mountain called Humta Pahad

980
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:40,760
 Which is in eastern India and apparently what's happened is locals have just climbed up there and start chiseling bits off the top

981
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,400
 And so now if you go there, it's like got a flat top, but it used to have a peeked top

982
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,620
 And so they stolen the difference from stealing the whole mountain

983
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,100
 They stolen some of them. That's like stealing one gondola and saying I've stolen the whole

984
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,100
 You've got to make a start somewhere

985
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
 Not all these things could be stolen overnight

986
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:05,820
 Actually Scarfell Pike had a bit of a theft problem as well speaking of stealing mountains. Yeah, there was is it in 2015

987
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,620
 And an artist took the top of Scarfell Pike. He took

988
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,820
 He took a bit of rock which I think was about inch squared

989
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:20,840
 It was in an art exhibition called the intruder about how humans like impose our incategories on nature and so he

990
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,540
 Mounted this rock. They take him to the top of Scarfell Pike and he got a nose of trouble for it

991
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,620
 And like the head of Cumbria tourism said this is taking the Mickey and we want the top of our mountain back

992
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,700
 Yeah, yeah, what are you going to say if you're the head of Cumbria tourism? What are you gonna say? Yeah, come and have a bit more of Cumbria

993
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,100
 He's got to preserve Cumbria

994
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:44,260
 That's his job. It's his job. He can't have a laissez faire attitude to this. His neck is on the line

995
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,580
 And he's not even got the DA busting his ass over losing the top of Scarfell Pike all right

996
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,980
 He's the most important part of Cumbria. The worst part of Cumbria is a lose to finding we come into work and find you're missing one bit

997
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,780
 It's not unreasonable to think that he's going to be pissed off with this

998
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,820
 Headline from the bomb the feco in 2013

999
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:05,840
 Stolen prosthetic arm discovered in second hand shop in

1000
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:18,740
 In 2012 police apprehended a woman after she hobbled to the exit from a shop in Oslo in Norway

1001
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,100
 And she was wearing a long skirt covering a 42-inch television

1002
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,940
 That she was carrying between her legs. I think you go for a smaller TV, don't you?

1003
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,100
 It's I think her eyes are bigger than her groin in this

1004
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:38,940
 In 2012 Jamie Oliver complained that 30,000 napkins were stolen from his restaurants every month

1005
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,780
 And so I was looking at restaurants there some people do steal stuff from restaurants

1006
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,020
 So the Jamie Oliver ones just to say they have his branding on don't they?

1007
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,740
 They're like they're nice kind of they look a bit like tea towels

1008
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,340
 But they got Jamie Oliver branding so the police should go for so for people who also called Jamie Oliver

1009
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,300
 No, no, it's people who like Jamie Oliver not people who were named Jamie

1010
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,140
 I can't say Connor Jamie, you know, it's not a name tag Jamie Oliver doesn't put that name on his towel

1011
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:07,940
 So that if he loses and they get returned to him. Do you put your name on all your napkins? Yes, I put them on on

1012
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,940
 I put it on all my tissues

1013
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,740
 Takes ages to monogram and then you play in those ones

1014
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,460
 Have you had of the South American endoscopy gangs?

1015
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:23,700
 Are they thieves? They must be in this section and what are they stealing with their endoscopes?

1016
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,700
 Well, no, they are stealing endoscopes

1017
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,460
 This is a gang who go around hospitals in Europe

1018
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,820
 Stealing specifically endoscopy equipment i.e. things that you put up people's bottoms to look inside them

1019
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,820
 Are they really daring thefts like while they're in use?

1020
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,580
 That's weird. I'm not getting a feed on it

1021
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:45,900
 So when all the lights come out, so all the feeds go down

1022
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,500
 In the hospital, they've just got a massive bank of monitor and they're all going out, what am I doing?

1023
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,500
 A bank of monitor is all showing boasting guards

1024
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,500
 It's going on, that means that is the worst security catch up in the world

1025
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:05,700
 2005 in York, £300,000 worth of endoscopes, less to the same year, £250,000

1026
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,700
 How much are they? Do you reckon? I don't know

1027
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:14,300
 They must be expensive, but 2017 last year a gang took 1.2 million, I think it was Canadian dollars worth of kit

1028
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,100
 2014 to 17, 16 million euro is worth of Germany

1029
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,100
 Well, what they think is that it's so that you can check that drug meals have swallowed the drugs

1030
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,100
 Got it? Oh, wow

1031
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,100
 I was thinking who's getting backstreet endoscopes in this game?

1032
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,100
 Every endoscope is a back alley

1033
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:38,100
 Should we wrap up?

1034
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,500
 Yeah, do you want to know one amazing thing about a ski lift?

1035
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,100
 I would like to know that, yes please

1036
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:47,500
 Okay, cool, so one amazing thing about a ski lift I learned is that in the last couple of years a snowball

1037
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,300
 I got stuck on a ski lift, he was stuck for six hours and this was in the Austrian Alps

1038
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,900
 It was incredibly cold, it was -18 degrees

1039
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,100
 He was going to be, he didn't know how long he was going to be stuck for, they closed it for the night

1040
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,100
 So yeah, he's been there for six hours

1041
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,900
 And he's getting really, really cold, he said he kept falling asleep into some cold and juice stupor

1042
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,500
 And he realised that he had a lighter on him

1043
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,700
 So the only thing he could do was burn anything flammable on him

1044
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:14,300
 And so he's not burning everything he had, so he burned he had a bunch of tissues, he burned them

1045
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,300
 Then he burned some business cards he had

1046
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,700
 So it's business cards on a snowballing trip?

1047
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,700
 Boy, you might meet an executive

1048
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,700
 Sorry

1049
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,700
 I'd like to give you a room

1050
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,700
 He must have had them in his wallet or something, right?

1051
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,700
 Yeah, but I mean, you probably will meet an executive, you're on a skiing club

1052
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,700
 I agree, you start off with tissues less important than business cards

1053
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,700
 Yeah, right? Both my tissues at my business cards have my name and I'm on a ground on them

1054
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,700
 Okay, so what did he burn next?

1055
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,700
 Then he had about 100 euros in bank notes

1056
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,700
 And he burned each bank note one by one

1057
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,700
 And he was on the last bank note when someone on the snow reveal saw him

1058
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,700
 The bad news is he was then stolen by some guys from the chatroom

1059
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:04,700
 Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts
