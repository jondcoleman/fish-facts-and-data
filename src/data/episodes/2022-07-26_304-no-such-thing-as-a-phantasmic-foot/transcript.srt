00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Coburn, Garden.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Jizinski.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Starting with you, Andy.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 My fact is that in Britain alone, unnecessary emails create nearly 24,000 tons of carbon every year.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Wow. Yeah.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 See, and you guys always give me crap for not replying to my emails.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I'm the most environmentally conscious of us.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 To be fair, Dan, the number of emails that you send, which are completely pointless, outweighs the fact that you don't send many.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Yeah, you're actually, we often don't get emails in reply to the important stuff from you, and then we'll be like, "Dan must be away from his computer."

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And then suddenly you'll be like, "Hey, guys, did you see this ridiculous meme? No one gives a shit about this."

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Okay, I can't listen. I didn't like this.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 How has you not?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I've just gone against what I was hoping I would be. So what this is, this is a calculation done by an energy company called OVO.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And they looked at the carbon footprint of an email, basically.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So the figures vary, but it varies between one gram and three or four grams. It's not very much.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 But they did also look at how many unnecessary emails are sent each day.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 For example, people writing back to just say, "Thanks." And sending that email through the system.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Is that unnecessary?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Well, it depends how good your manners are, I guess. But if we're agreeing that that's a sort of superfluous thing, then what they want us to do is to add a little signature to our door emails, saying something like, "This is a thanks in advance."

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Now that sounds really passive to me.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 It's like, "Hey, Andy, can you please do your QI scripts by the end of the week, thanks in advance."

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Sounds like I've said, "You better bloody hell do it."

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Yeah.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 That's a really good point.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It'll be better than what you normally so, which is you better bloody hell don't you.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 But the really cool thing about this research is that the men who advise them on this is a man called Mike Berners-Lee.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And you might know that surname. He's the brother of Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Yeah.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Can we just quickly go through how it does it?

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 So is it carbon or carbon dioxide? Is it from big servers processing the information?

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's from all these things. So it's from, for example, using electricity in the first place.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 The cost of running a computer network, the cost of keeping all the data on servers and travelling across the planet.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So the whole thing, you know, using your computer while it's on to send us email.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 It's very hard to quantify, obviously, but there's a rough figure.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And the calculations, they depend on how important that email is a little bit.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Because let's say I send an email back to Andy just saying, "Thanks, on low."

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Now you don't spend much time reading it.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And so it means that it doesn't use up as much electricity.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And it's so it means that the carbon footprint is lower.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So for instance, over 70% of emails are sent to spam.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 But they only use up 22% of your carbon footprint.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And that's because you hardly ever read them.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And they go straight into your junk folder and then get deleted.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 So it's like a one-way system.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 It's only the making of it that uses carbon.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Unless you're over the age of 78 and you're a woman living alone.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It's just donated to a million phony charities so far.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 This Mike Berners-Lee has written a book about carbon footprints.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And the amount of carbon used for lots of different things.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's called How Bad Are Bananas, the carbon footprint of everything.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And one thing that is bad as well as bananas was the 2010 World Cup,

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 which he says cost was 2.8 million tons of CO2.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And to put that into perspective, it's the equivalent of every man, woman, and child in the UK having 20 cheeseburgers.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Oh, that's the same amount.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 In terms of obesity rates or anything.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 In terms of carbon usage.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Yeah, exactly. The amount of carbon.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Or 6,000 space shuttle flights.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Got football low cup.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 But it's a good well cup.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Right.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Don't be worth it.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Mike writes a lot of articles online as well.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 So he has an article series that's called What's the Carbon Footprint of?

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Dot, dot, dot.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So it's things like the carbon footprint of, say, the Iraq war.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 He's looked at all the numbers and made an estimate.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And then this one's a bit of a guilty sort of, you don't need this really.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 The carbon footprint of the heart bypass operation.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I don't think you need to be thinking about offsetting when you're on your way in.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It's going to end up being too hard by passes, isn't it?

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 If you wake up and they go, do you know how many flies you've ruined with that?

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 There's 1.1 tons.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Wow.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Is that bad?

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Yeah.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 It's not, it's not any carbon footprint. It's not great.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 It's all relative.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 It is a, you know, a lot of modern life.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 If you think about one email is one grab.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Right. Okay. That's good perspective.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Yeah. But if you, obviously, if you sent an email saying,

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 can I book a heart bypass in, then that's only adding to the footprint.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Yeah.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 So here's one.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 If you have a BLT sandwich and you want to lower your carbon footprint,

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 which one ingredient should you throw away the bacon?

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Yeah.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Throw away the bacon.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It's the tomato.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 The tea.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Whoa.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 It's the tea.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Okay. This is nuts.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Tomatoes require so much heating and lighting of greenhouses

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 that apparently their carbon footprint is higher than the bacon.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 No way.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Which I find extraordinary.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 No.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 But what if I just get my tomato from a very hot country, many, many miles away,

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 and it just gets flown over by jet?

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 That's a great pie.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Does it need to be greenhouse?

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Is it a private jet that your tomato is being flown in?

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Just one tomato.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Yeah. It's one small bunch.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 One little box.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 I mean, that I can't, that is amazing.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I find extraordinary.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 There are a few sort of counterintuitive ones.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I apparently, a New Zealand lamb.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 If you imported a New Zealand lamb to England to use,

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 there's less carbon output than a British lamb because the rearing is so much more

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 that even if you include the shipping, the lamb is far less if it comes from New Zealand.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Really?

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And it's not just because the natural climate requires less input.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Yeah, it must be just all the procedures that they're doing.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Because I would have thought that lambs are not that hard to read.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 They're one of the few things that the British climate is okay with rearing,

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 but that's a particular common input.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Lamb and beef do have, they're the two highest meats with,

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 although that's, I think that's total ecological impact, but a lot of that's carbon.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 But I'm amazed that the New Zealand lamb is somehow requiring less carbon.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I mean, they send a lot less emails done they in New Zealand with the lambs.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 It's mostly just lesser writing for the lamb still.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Do you know what the third meat is?

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 So the first beef.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Beef lamb.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Second is lamb.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Pork?

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I actually think the second is pork.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Okay.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And this thing has a bigger carbon footprint than lamb.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Chicken.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 No, it's crustaceans.

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So I can't believe this.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I always think crustaceans is such an ethical thing to eat in proportion to other meat,

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 but they use a huge amount of fuel compared to other seafood.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 So most seafood has a carbon footprint, a bit like chicken,

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 but shellfish is up there with beef in terms of its footprint.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I'm so delighted.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 I only hate it, don't you?

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I hate eating crustaceans, but it's just because I'm a bit fatty.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And now I can say it's because I want to save the environment.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Oh god, as if you didn't have enough moral high ground.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Do you know one thing that has an insanely high carbon footprint?

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 One practice.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 I mean lots.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Having asthma.

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Is that because you're breathing out lots of carbon dioxide all the time?

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It's not that.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 It's not that.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Okay, again, I don't feel comfortable causing people with asthma to hyperventilate with guilt.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 No, no, no, no.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I used to have asthma, and I don't have it anymore.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Is that an ecological position?

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 No, but I did use to have it.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I used to have those, you know, inhalers.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Yeah.

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And you know, they use a gas called hydroflora alcan, which is a propellant.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 That's what squirts the medicine out, you know, it's like a little gas cartridge.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Those inhalers account for 4% of the NHS greenhouse gas expenditure.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Those inhalers alone, 4%.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Isn't that massive?

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 So if you replaced one in 10 of those inhalers, you would reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 58,000 tonnes.

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 What can replace them with, do they have like eco ones?

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 There are other ecological ones, which some people can have, I think, not everyone.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 But yeah, 58,000 tonnes, just to replace one in 10 of those, you would say.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Wow.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 That would say.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 The NHS actually had an incredible carbon mistake quite recently, didn't they?

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 To speaking of them.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 So did you read about this?

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 It had an email storm in 2016, where 186 million useless emails ended up being sent.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So this is, the history of email storms is so fun.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 So basically, this apparently is the industry term for when someone accidentally sends an email to a huge mailing list.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And in this case, it was the IT guy who was sending a test email.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 He sent it to 1.2 million employees.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And then they all replied all, saying, please unsubscribe me from this list.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And then there are other ones who replied all, saying, stop replying all, everyone, stop replying all.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And eventually it ended up being 186 million emails.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And I believe it took down the NHS mail system.

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 There was a very funny quote from Spokesperson, the NHS digital Spokesperson, who said,

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 some users have experienced short delays in the NHS mail system this morning, but the issue has been resolved.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 But she did have to dictate that over the phone because her email still wasn't working.

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Wow, wow.

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 So next time the NHS gives you shit about your heart by pass.

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 2016, mate.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 There's a guy called Joey M.

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 He's lives in Rhode Island.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And he has the world record, most number of unread emails in his inbox.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Oh wait, can we guess?

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Yeah.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 In the thousands.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 What?

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 2000, I'm right.

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I'm pretty sure these two, that's me.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Okay.

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 58 million.

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Can I go, can I go ridiculous, say a billion?

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 A billion.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I can say a billion.

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Four billion.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Wow!

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 294 million, 967,256.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And he evidenced it by uploading a video onto recordsetter.com, which allows you to,

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 if you think you've done more keepy upies than anyone else, you can put a video on this site.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Yeah.

212
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And he showed it on his phone, just deleting one message to get down.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 So just over four billion.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Oh, what?

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But isn't that amazing?

216
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 It's a lot of mailing lists.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Does he work for the NHS?

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And there was a survey done by Adobe, quite recently, about emails that says 55% of people,

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 whenever they get to zero inbox, say it's relieving, 22%, say it's amazing, and 10%, say it's impossible.

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And the only reason I bring up this survey is because they categorise people into boomers,

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Gen X millennials and Gen Z, and they put millennials starting in 1977, which makes me a millennial.

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Nice.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 So that's the other reason I bring up.

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 As a long buildup to emphasise that you're a millennial.

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 That was the price for the record.

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I was going to ask you about that skateboard you're holding.

227
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 So just one weird bit of carbon news.

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 So in 1981, Ronald Reagan made this speech, made this statement where he said,

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 "Trees produce more pollution than automobiles."

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 So he said that, and people thought, "Well, that's very funny," and probably some idiots believed him,

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 and he probably set the world back by about 100 years.

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 But he said this, "But trees do emit greenhouse gases."

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So they emit loads of methane, and we've only just discovered this.

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 It was in 2014, there was this huge methane surplus in the atmosphere.

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 People didn't know where it was coming from.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And this woman went to the Amazon and tested its trees and figured out they were all pumping out methane.

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 They're all farting.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 They're all farting.

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 All farting, tree thoughts, and the atmosphere.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 But this isn't a problem, is it?

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 It's definitely, definitely offset by the amount of CO2 that they're absorbing.

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And so we don't want to get rid of the trees.

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Guys, trees are good thumbs up, but it is a thing that we need to work out why they're doing it.

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And so it might be more in wetlands, which have a lot of methane within them that they're pumping out.

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 So maybe we don't plant trees on big piles of methane, for instance.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Right.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Hey, remember we had that fact a long, long time ago about every tree.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I think it's in Melbourne that has an email address.

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Oh, yeah.

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Oh, that's a bit of a...

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Oh my god, they're really shooting themselves in the tree, aren't they?

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number two.

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And that is James.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that hot dogs are called hot dogs because people used to think they contain dog.

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And did they?

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 No, don't think so.

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 No, I don't think so.

258
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 So this is something I read in the Oxford English Dictionary.

259
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 The word hot dog appears to be college slang from America in the late 19th century.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And according to the OED, who cite the Oxford companion to food and drink and the historical dictionary of American slang.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 The reason people called them hot dogs is one, they were hot.

262
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And two, they had this weird meat that they didn't know where it quite came from.

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And it might as well come from dogs come from anywhere else.

264
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Okay.

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 In fact, I think that it could have been in there.

266
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 So I got two into these three people called Gerald Leonard Cohen.

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And I'd buy, I don't think he's related, a Barry Poppig.

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And David Shulman, who have devoted over 20 years of their life to working out the roof, the phrase hot dog.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And so they're into it.

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And Gerald Leonard Cohen says that scandalous but true, some butchers even hired dog killers in the US who were going club some dogs and stuff them in sausages.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Even though it wasn't legit, he's found some instances of that and then they'd sell the carcass to the butcher.

272
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And yeah, I think what was 1884 that they started calling sausages dogs and then they added the hot in the 1890s.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I read a bit about Gerald Leonard Cohen and Barry Poppig.

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 They've written a 300 page book about the origin of the phrase hot dog.

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And he does this, he publishes his own journal which is called comments on etymology.

276
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 The circulation is under 100, you have to write to him and send him money and he will then send you a copy of this thing.

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 He wants wrote 167 page paper on just the word jazz.

278
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 He is a serious etymologist.

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And he is, we should say, also a professor.

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So he's a professor for our languages at a university so he does make an income other than from these hundreds of writers.

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 But he said, I think he was interviewed and he said, what else am I going to do with my time?

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I'm going to go skiing, I'll probably get hurt. So I guess I've got to just research hot dogs for her.

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I'm supposed to go skiing this weekend.

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Well, I suggest you instead devote two decades to researching hot dogs origins.

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I reckon the first hot dogs must have been quite good actually because the phrase hot dog, which means like something which is really awesome,

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 is only one year younger than the word hot dog meaning the food stuff.

287
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So they had hot dogs for one year and then people thought it was a word that meant this is great.

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 That's Mickey Mouse's first words.

289
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Yeah, he goes hot dogs.

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 He plural, he pluralises it.

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I'm so glad we've done this because I've always wondered in its wonderful life when the James Stewart character says hot dog.

292
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And it's when it's something totally unregistered hot dogs has happened.

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 What's the name of this? He said hot.

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Some people were annoyed about it.

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 So they started at one of the early sites.

296
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 They were sold with Coney Island.

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Is that New Jersey?

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 No, it's New York.

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 New York.

300
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Sorry, it's Coney Island, New York.

301
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 It was so annoyed by the association with hot dogs thinking they were a slightly lower class thing.

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 That in 1913 the Chamber of Commerce passed a law forbidding the use of the phrase hot dog on signs.

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Really?

304
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 You weren't allowed to have a sign up saying hot dog.

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I think it was not because of the implication that there might be dog meat in them.

306
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Slightly, yeah.

307
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 What's that?

308
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Did you want that?

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 So we were in New York not too long ago and I went for a walk one day to Central Park and hot dog vendors everywhere along the roads.

310
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And I was just reading that in order to park their hot dog vending machines in these spots, do you know what they pay?

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 The prices there.

312
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 So just to, should we have a guess?

313
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Yeah, just the American dollars just to be there.

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Per year or a year, let's say.

315
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Per year.

316
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Just to park there, I'm going to say it's probably in the region of $10,000 US dollars.

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I'm going to say about the same.

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 15, let's say.

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 15.

320
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 I'd say they pay in kind and it's like 10 hot dogs a year.

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 We lost it.

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Okay, so there was one guy who was parked on Fifth Avenue, East 62nd Street, very near Central Park.

323
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 289,500.

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 No.

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 For his annual, yeah.

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And that's, that is, he's got to get that to break even obviously because he's got to push and then everything is proper from there.

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 But they all managed to do it.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Yeah.

329
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Because hot dogs in New York sell for $10,000.

330
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Exactly.

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 That is quite a lot of money.

332
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Yeah, so on average, they have to pay the city $200,000 each year.

333
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 I've never been to one of those stands and got a hot dog and I feel incredibly guilty that I've been driving these poor people out of business.

334
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Do you know one thing that doesn't have to park that is associated with hot dogs?

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Have you heard of the Weenemobile?

336
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Oh, I have maybe half.

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I'm not sure.

338
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 I've never been for a ride in the Weenemobile.

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I haven't.

340
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Not a jack-up line.

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 So, you know, Oscar Mayors, a big hot dog company, they have a fleet, a small fleet of Weenemobiles, which are cars shaped like hot dogs, which have been going since 1936.

342
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Obviously, they've changed them, you know.

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 But basically, they were a huge promotional thing.

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 So they would hand out hot dogs, small hot dogs, from inside the big hot dog, because the cars shaped like a hot dog.

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And they would hand out things called Weenow whistles to children.

346
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 So that if a child ever saw the Weenemobile, they would blow their whistle and attract other children to come and get a hot dog.

347
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And they would have a sort of an ice cream van.

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 You're getting the kid to do the job for you.

349
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yeah, exactly.

350
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And they train their drivers at a place called Hot Dog High.

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And then, once you're in, like, Starfleet Academy for Hot Dog High, you drive around the country.

352
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It's mostly sort of students and things they hire.

353
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And you drive in pairs, and one person has to drive, and the other one has to wave to people, which is called Riding Shot Bun.

354
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Shot Bun?

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Yeah, and sometimes they let you in, and they ask you to fasten your meat belt.

356
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Wow, it's disgusting.

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 I think someone's driving around, picking up children, and telling them to fasten their meat.

358
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 It's a car-shaped, like a sausage.

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 You're defenseless, guys.

360
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 It's not looking good, mate.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Yeah.

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 But he blew up my Weenow whistle.

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 There's only ever been one accident involving a Weenemobile, and one of them rammed into a house.

364
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Imagine that coming through the window.

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Yeah, it'd be like a bad ring ram, as well.

366
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Take the whole thing down.

367
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Another famous Hot Dog company in America is Nathan's.

368
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Okay.

369
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And that's a really good story about them.

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 So there was another Hot Dog maker on Coney Island called Feltmans, and they were really, really huge and really, really popular.

371
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And they had what some people said was possibly the largest restaurant in the world, which just sold Hot Dogs.

372
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 But then they had a guy who came to work for them, who was a Jewish immigrant from Poland called Nathan Handwerker.

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And Nathan Handwerker was working just slightly, I'd be like, what are you laughing at?

374
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 To work. Handwerker's a funny name.

375
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Yeah, but he wasn't masturbating people.

376
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 He was spending his week slicing buns.

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Okay, so he sounds like masturbating people.

378
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 He was working as a bun slicer.

379
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And then he decided, well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell my own company.

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And he needed to get some money together.

381
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 So he lived entirely on Hot Dogs for a year.

382
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 He had nothing but Hot Dogs, and he slept on the kitchen floor of this place.

383
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 So he got all the money together.

384
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And then eventually he started his own business and then undercut Feltmans by selling his Hot Dogs for half the price.

385
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And became what's quite synonymous, as well as Oscar Meyers and as well as Feltmans, but kind of synonymous with Hot Dogs in America now.

386
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Wow.

387
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 But he didn't have to have quadruple heart bypass.

388
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Oh my god, the carbon, carbon.

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So that's the big competition, isn't it, in America?

390
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 They have Nathan, it's called Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.

391
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And the men's champion is a man called Joey Chestnut, who's won it nine times.

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 His all-time record is eating 74 Hot Dogs and Buns in 10 minutes.

393
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 That's 7.4 a minute, if my master's correct.

394
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Yeah.

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And there's such rivalry in the...

396
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But you have to eat the buns as well, don't you?

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 You have to eat the buns.

398
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 What's he going to do with the buns? Otherwise you haven't eaten the hot dog eating the dog.

399
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Yeah, that's true.

400
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 No, that's not hot. It's not a bread.

401
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 It's not a bread. Oh, the bread's keeping this dog warm.

402
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 It's not like a blanket.

403
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I'm on the Atkins start. I'll just have the dog, please.

404
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 But the previous champion was this guy called Takeru Kobayashi from Japan.

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And no one had ever eaten more than, I can't remember what it was, like 20 or something.

406
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And then he walked on stage in 2001, he ate 50.

407
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 It completely revolutionized the sport and the art.

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 But what was his thing? You know in the Fosbury flop.

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 You changed the way that you jumped over, the high jump.

410
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 So one was his training method.

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 His training method was he would practice drinking three gallons of water in 90 seconds,

412
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 meaning that his stomach got used to expanding very quickly.

413
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Wow.

414
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Can I say, I tried to do that once and was extreme.

415
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Like, do not try that at home. Extremely sick.

416
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Send us your videos of you not trying it at home.

417
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Oh my goodness. I was just vomiting water for ages afterwards.

418
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And why did you rejoin to enter this competition?

419
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I was young and it was a bet.

420
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 You're a millennial. That's the kind of crazy thing they do.

421
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So the other thing he did, he invented this method where you split each hot dog in two

422
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 and you force both ends in your mouth at once.

423
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Because your mouth is wide enough for two hot dogs.

424
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 I cannot believe that I thought of that before.

425
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 What? I don't understand.

426
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 So you chop each hot dog in half half way along, so you've got the two ends.

427
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And then you just shove both ends in your mouth at the same time.

428
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And they called this the Solomon method, which is an illusion to King Solomon

429
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 because he wants threatened to split a baby in two in a biblical story.

430
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It is.

431
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Yeah.

432
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And it's a very high brow contest, isn't it?

433
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So you get a lot of these biblical in-classical references.

434
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Wow.

435
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Two parents were arguing over who got custody of a baby and Solomon said,

436
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 "Well, we'll cut the baby in two."

437
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And then you guys get the whole thing in his mouth.

438
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 No, no, you didn't. No one ate the baby.

439
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Baby eating contest. It's in John, part one.

440
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 What was that?

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 One of the parents said, "Oh, that's fine by me.

442
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 You're a good idea. Let's split the baby in two."

443
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And the other one said, "No, don't do that."

444
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And then King Solomon said, "We usually probably have the baby."

445
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Is that what happens?

446
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 That's right.

447
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I think that's right.

448
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Yeah.

449
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 That's amazing, but so obvious.

450
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 I would have split it.

451
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I don't want to claim that I would have won this competition,

452
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 but I think it would have had a chance.

453
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Because obviously you put it in half and shove it in both sides.

454
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 I would say into three parts.

455
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Well, I was just going to say, where do you stop?

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Is it possible to cut into three, four, five, six or seven parts?

457
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 How wide is your mouth?

458
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Well, you're looking at me.

459
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 The people at home don't have this option,

460
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 but I don't think I could fit.

461
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 In fact, I'm not sure I could fit, too, in mine.

462
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I'm not.

463
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 No, I don't know.

464
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 You're a two-man, three-max.

465
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I think there's a point at which there are diminishing returns

466
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 from cutting your hot dogs into an increasing number of pieces

467
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 before you put them in your mouth.

468
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Still with a knife and fork on the first hot dog.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I'll have the competition.

470
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Those guys are going to feel so stupid as you cut it into the hundred pieces.

471
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 I'm going to get this whole thing on my mouth.

472
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Do you know that the Pentagon used to have a hot dog stand?

473
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 There was a rumor, which they tour guides still tell to this day

474
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 when you get taken around Pentagon.

475
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 It got taken down in 2006.

476
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 But during the Cold War, apparently, the Russians were convinced

477
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 that some amazing stuff was going their secretive conversations

478
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 because people would meet there.

479
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So apparently, they had two missiles aimed at this hot dog stand

480
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 the entire time of the Cold War.

481
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And that was the rumor, no one's ever--

482
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Imagine if the missile hit.

483
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 How many pieces those hot dogs could be in?

484
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 You've got to stuff them all that you've got.

485
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Still strategizing for the next tournament.

486
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

487
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And that is my fact.

488
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 My fact this week is that the oldest recording we have of a poet

489
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 reading his own poem is of Robert Browning,

490
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 who forgets the words to the poem halfway through

491
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 and ends the recording with an apology.

492
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 That's amazing.

493
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 So this was in April of 1889.

494
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 There's only a few months before he died and Robert Browning--

495
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 I think he was at a party and it was being held by the artist Rudolf Lehman.

496
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And he had with him one of those Edison wax cylinder talking machines

497
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 and he got Robert Browning to recite his poem which was called

498
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 "How they brought the good news from Ghent to X. I."

499
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 No, it's X.

500
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Yeah, like X number once.

501
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Yeah.

502
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Andy was just doing his allergy impression.

503
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Hi.

504
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Hi.

505
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Is it really?

506
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Yeah, I did it.

507
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 You should listen to it.

508
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 I don't know why I memorized it when I was ten.

509
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Did you?

510
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I did.

511
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I had to do it for a recital competition and I--

512
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Oh, this actual poem, the Browning.

513
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Did you get through it without apologising?

514
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 I did better than Browning did.

515
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Wow.

516
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 I got through it and then I was rereading it and I was so ashamed

517
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 at how little of it I could remember.

518
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I think they all I could remember is because it's such a good poem actually.

519
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 It's done galloping.

520
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 You never really know what the good news is.

521
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And it's got this great rhythm of horse.

522
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 It's just galloping from Ghent to X.

523
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And all I remember is they galloped, galloped, we galloped all three.

524
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 You know what?

525
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 You're embarrassed that you couldn't remember much of it.

526
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I still think that's pretty impressive.

527
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 I think you almost got further than Browning himself.

528
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 That's right.

529
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 No, you're right.

530
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And the pace, when you listen to him speak it and this is online.

531
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 So if you go on YouTube and put this in, anyone listening can actually hear the man himself.

532
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 It does feel like it's an old western.

533
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 It's got this fantastic pace to it.

534
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 But he only gets to a few lines in and he suddenly says, I'm most terribly sorry that I can't remember my own verses.

535
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 But then ads, but the one thing I will remember all my life,

536
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 is this astonishing sensation produced upon me by your wonderful invention.

537
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And then you hear people cheering for him in the background.

538
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It's a real politician's answer the way he says, I can't remember the poem.

539
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 You specifically asked me to read, but one thing I can remember.

540
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 It's an amazing pivot.

541
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 It's incredible pivot.

542
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Yeah.

543
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And so one nice thing about it was that there were a lot of people recording at the time.

544
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 But supposedly he was one of the first notable people to pass away.

545
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 So soon after the recording, and it was a year after he died when they had a memorial for him

546
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 that they played his voice at the memorial and they said it was like him coming back from the dead.

547
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 It was this eerie thing that no one had ever experienced before.

548
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 I think it was the first time that anyone's voice had been played or any more notable person anyway after they died,

549
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 which that must have been pretty weird, right?

550
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Yeah.

551
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 That must have been weird.

552
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 But also, it's kind of embarrassing.

553
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I say, please don't play the recording right, cocked up after I'm dead on my anniversary.

554
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Yeah.

555
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 It's true.

556
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 It was pointing and laughing.

557
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Some of his relatives did say it was embarrassing, but they played it.

558
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Did they?

559
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Not everyone was happy that it was there.

560
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 The fans.

561
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 It was at a browning society gathering in London.

562
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 They were all huddled around this.

563
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 They were societies.

564
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 There were societies decades before he died.

565
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Not maybe not decades, but certainly in the last decade before he died.

566
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 There were people meeting up and he found that embarrassing.

567
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Oh, everyone was so embarrassed all the time.

568
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Because he was so popular, I think it was Westminster Abbey where his funeral was held.

569
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 They got over a thousand applications and the dean of Westminster wrote saying,

570
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 "Everyone has been trying to get into Browning's funeral.

571
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I've had to really limit it to people who had a really good reason to be there."

572
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Really?

573
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Do you know?

574
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Because he wasn't popular throughout most of his life.

575
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And then he did get very popular towards the end.

576
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And all these people wanted to go to his funeral.

577
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And also, he sparked a fashion for dressing in Brown.

578
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Did he?

579
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 No.

580
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 He did. Just after he died in America, he sparked a brief fashion for dressing up in Brown items of clothing.

581
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Just because he was called Browning.

582
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 He didn't dress in Brown himself.

583
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 No, it was just the name, yeah.

584
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Wow.

585
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 How did they do when Dickens died?

586
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 A lot of arrests.

587
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Do you have any more on that about how that came about?

588
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 I know.

589
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I've only found it in one place.

590
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And sorry, it was before he died.

591
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 It was 1979 to 1980 when he just released one of his very popular works.

592
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 1979, wow.

593
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 So that was just starting out there.

594
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 It was 1879 to 1880 when he just released one of his popular works.

595
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Wow.

596
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 His romance with Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who he became husband and wife.

597
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And she was way more famous to start with than him.

598
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 It was really interesting because he started as a correspondence.

599
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And she was housebound.

600
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And she was invalid.

601
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 And her father was extremely strict about who she didn't didn't see.

602
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Despite the fact she was also a famous poet, which I don't really understand.

603
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 But he started writing to her and they started a passionate correspondence.

604
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And then they eloped and got married.

605
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And they had a son who they called Penn.

606
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 He was actually called Robert as well.

607
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But they nicknamed him Penn.

608
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And that's all they called him.

609
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 No, he was called Vydeman or Weedeman.

610
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Robert Weedeman.

611
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Yeah.

612
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 But the reason they called him Penn is because he couldn't pronounce the word Weedeman as a baby.

613
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Well, that was a baby.

614
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 We couldn't pronounce anything as a baby.

615
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 They had massive arguments about how Penn should grow up.

616
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Did you read about these?

617
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 No, no.

618
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 So basically he wanted the child to grow up looking sort of very blokey, Victorian, you know,

619
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 wearing trousers and having his hair cut short.

620
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And she wanted petticoats and shoulder length ringlets of hair.

621
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And she won, maybe because she was more famous or more authoritative.

622
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 But basically until the child was 10, he wore petticoats.

623
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And then as soon as she died, when Penn was 10 years old,

624
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Robert had the child's hair cut really short.

625
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Yeah, okay.

626
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 So I'm pronouncing it differently.

627
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 There was a big bone of contention between them.

628
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 But he turned out quite different to what she would have wanted then because he,

629
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 so he did have this quite fade upbringing.

630
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 And he slept in her room until he was 12.

631
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And I thought, I thought, hang on, I thought Elizabeth Browning died when he was 10.

632
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And you're saying it was a really tragic last two years.

633
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Really.

634
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Very traumatising for him.

635
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Well, I've gotten until he was 12.

636
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Okay.

637
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So we'll fact check that.

638
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 He ended up this real kind of, well, what is described in one of his biography,

639
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 in one of Browning's biographies, as a beefy and berry middle-aged man in Nicarbockers

640
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 with a reputation for promiscuity.

641
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And also his home, his house was just a filthy pigstie.

642
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 He had people around for parties.

643
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And so his house was nicknamed the Palazzo pigstie.

644
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The pigstie palace.

645
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And well, he was called Penn.

646
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Yeah.

647
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 It's like a pigpen.

648
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Oh, yeah.

649
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Penn's pigpen.

650
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 So he was.

651
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 He was a painter.

652
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 But I think not a great one.

653
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And apparently, his contract for painting for a luxurious female nude

654
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 did not encourage sales in Victorian England.

655
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Well, he was a sculptor, too.

656
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Oh, was he?

657
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Yeah, one of his very few sculpted works is of a woman communing with a python.

658
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And it's quite sexy.

659
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 It's called Driope or Driope Fascinated by Apollo.

660
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 But during the sculpting process, the python tried to strangle the model that he got.

661
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 And he then had to shoot it.

662
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Oh, my God.

663
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 The python.

664
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Yes.

665
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Wow.

666
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 I know.

667
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Do they have a paint portrait outtakes?

668
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 That would have been just a stunning.

669
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 It's interesting.

670
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 The idea of his voice coming back from the death at his funeral, I find interesting.

671
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Because he was one of the people who was very against spiritualism.

672
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 He used to sit on salances because Elizabeth was really into salances.

673
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 And this was the time where Arthur Conan Doyle was into it and so on.

674
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And Houdini.

675
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And Houdini was again.

676
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Houdini was a skeptic.

677
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 He was a skeptic.

678
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 They just sound like all the most famous people in the world where it sounds like you just go along to a normal sale,

679
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 to hoping to speak to a relative.

680
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And then suddenly, Houdini stands up and Arthur Conan Doyle stands up to be a brownings there.

681
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Well, they were going for the rich people, weren't they?

682
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Yeah.

683
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 The mediums.

684
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Well, this was a very famous medium.

685
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 It was called Daniel Dungless.

686
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Hume.

687
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Daniel Dungless.

688
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Daniel Dungless.

689
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 And Dungless wasn't.

690
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 He was Daniel Hume and he added Dungless.

691
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And so.

692
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And it's so weird, isn't it, because it looks like it's a misprint of Dungless.

693
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 It really does.

694
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And he was, he was someone who was very famous back in the day.

695
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 And he used to do all these salances.

696
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And one salancy did was with the brownings and they were sitting there.

697
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 And he was really skeptical, Robert.

698
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And Elizabeth was really into it.

699
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And Daniel Dungless suddenly said, your son who passed away who was very young is here with us.

700
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 And there was an apparition that was, that was near them.

701
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And they were like, oh my god, this is amazing.

702
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And it's so great.

703
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Browning went, this is not, this is not my son.

704
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And he grabbed the apparition.

705
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 And it was Hume's naked foot.

706
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 That was hanging in the air.

707
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Yeah.

708
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Such a good story.

709
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 It was a bare foot and then he was going, ooh.

710
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Very embarrassing.

711
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Literally put his foot in it.

712
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Wait, the thing was, he didn't have a son.

713
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 No, he didn't have a son.

714
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Yeah, there was no dead son.

715
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 At least do your research as a medium.

716
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Do the very basic research.

717
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 If you're going to claim the dead sons come back, make sure there's a dead son.

718
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Yeah, especially when the people around the table are really famous.

719
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And he could probably have just gone onto Wikipedia and check.

720
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Every QI person's favourite poem by Robert Browning is Pippa Passes.

721
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And that's because it contains the lines.

722
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Sing to the bats, sleek sisterhoods, full compliance with gallantry, then owls and bats, cows and twats,

723
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 munks and nuns in a cloister's moods.

724
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And this is because he thought that the word 'twat' was a kind of headdress worn by a nun.

725
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 He had taken this from a 1660s satirical poem called Vanity of the Vanities,

726
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 which says they talked of having a cardinal's hat.

727
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 They'd sent him a soon an old nun's twat.

728
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And he'd read that and thought, well, they could only be talking about a headdress.

729
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 It can't be anything else.

730
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 So it must be that.

731
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 And he'd put it in his, imagine putting it in your own purse.

732
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 So good.

733
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And what's great is, we only reason we know that is the OED itself chased him up to say,

734
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 do you have some sort of secret etymology about this that we don't know of?

735
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Nope, nope, just onto that.

736
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Did the OED tell him, you know what you've done here?

737
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Well, they must have said we're approaching you because 'twat' doesn't mean that.

738
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Or they might have just said, we're interested in you all.

739
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Yeah.

740
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Anyone who heard that poem, the very first time he read it out has gone to him.

741
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Robert, did you just say nun's twat?

742
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 He doesn't need to wait for the OED to come over.

743
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 He's a laughingstock of the whole town.

744
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Oh, but for a while he would have been going through his town going,

745
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Oh, lovely twat, because he pointed to a nun's head.

746
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 It's so annoying, because it's such a good word for rhyming with things.

747
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Yeah, you're right.

748
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Yeah.

749
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Oh, here's the poem.

750
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Oh, actually, you could have said hats.

751
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 There you go.

752
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 It would have worked.

753
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 The meaning would have been the same.

754
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Perfect.

755
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Robert.

756
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Apparently he's, well, I mean, so his poems at the time were known for being kind of impenetrable

757
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 and impossible to understand.

758
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 And, you know, really great poets read them and did not get what he was on about.

759
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 So Tennyson said of his poem "Saudello," which was an early one before he'd become a bit more accessible.

760
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Tennyson said he only understood the first and last lines of the entire thing.

761
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 The first line is, who will, as in who will read this, who will may hear Saudello's story told?

762
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And the last line is, who would has read Saudello's story told?

763
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And the in between was nonsense.

764
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And then Henry James, another great author he would have thought would understand most things,

765
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 said he was comforted on hearing, browning, read his poems in a self to an audience that,

766
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 at least if you don't understand them, he apparently understands them even less.

767
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Wow.

768
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Henry James wrote some of the most complicated sentences in the whole of English literature.

769
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 He's so hard to read, and if he didn't get browning.

770
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 But browning's like, why did Henry James come up to me and call me a nuns?

771
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski.

772
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 My fact this week is that in 1948 in Idaho, left over World War II parachutes,

773
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 were used to drop beavers out of airplanes.

774
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 For any particular reason?

775
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 No, just one.

776
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Just, yeah, why not?

777
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 You know, you've got to do something.

778
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 So this was post-war, and people were feeling kind of related in America,

779
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 because they won, and they started moving to this place in Idaho called Payette Lake,

780
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 near a place called McCool, and there were beavers there.

781
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 And beavers get in the way of humans sometimes, because they sort of built dams,

782
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 they disrupt water flows, and they just change the surrounding environment.

783
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 So the people wanted them out.

784
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And there was this guy called Elmo Hater, who worked for Idaho.

785
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 He really did not like Sesame Street, did he?

786
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 It was spelled differently, but he did have a problem with puppets.

787
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 He worked for Idaho Fish and Game Association,

788
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 and he knew of a place called Chamberlain Basin, 200 miles away,

789
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 which he thought perfect for beavers.

790
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And he also knew that World War II had just ended, and there were all these leftover parachutes.

791
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 So he was like, let's marry the two.

792
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Okay.

793
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 And he did, well, he tried, he actually tried taking them to this place by horse and carriage

794
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 for a horse and cart, because there were no roads going between the two destinations.

795
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 And the horses hated the beavers.

796
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 So apparently horses, if you put two beavers on their cart, they freak out.

797
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Did you really?

798
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 His phrase about it.

799
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 No.

800
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 You write this gorgeous phrase.

801
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 He said horses and mules become spooky and quarrelsome when loaded

802
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 with a struggling, odorous pair of live beavers.

803
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Spooky and quarrelsome.

804
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Spooky and quarrelsome.

805
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 So the horses didn't like the beavers.

806
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Beavers didn't like the horses.

807
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 And so this guy dropped them in boxes into the forest and said.

808
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Yeah.

809
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Have you seen the footage of it?

810
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Yes.

811
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 It's awesome.

812
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Yeah.

813
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 So this was only uncovered quite recently, right?

814
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 So it was lost for a long time.

815
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 It was footage, but no one knew where it was.

816
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 It's been uncovered a few years back, I think.

817
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 And you see the beaver being packed into this box, which is a sort of bite-proof box.

818
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 It's not locked down.

819
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 So the idea is that they're sort of holding it shut.

820
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 And the weight of heading towards the ground is what's holding it shut.

821
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 As soon as they land, it can open up and the leaver can get out.

822
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 But they don't drop from a high height.

823
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 It's a really quick descent.

824
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 It's like only a hundred feet.

825
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 So it's really crazy.

826
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Yeah.

827
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Have no idea how they survive the impact.

828
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Well, they were very happy.

829
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 I think there were 76 that were dropped and 75 survived.

830
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 And it was because they tried it.

831
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 There was a set of story.

832
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Oh.

833
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Oh.

834
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 That one, it was very sad.

835
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 That one somehow jumped up.

836
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Okay, open the lid of the box.

837
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Open the lid.

838
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Open the lid.

839
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Yeah.

840
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 But they had one training beaver.

841
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 They did.

842
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 They called Geronimo.

843
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 And they would...

844
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 I think that Geronimo has the record for the beaver who's done the most parachute drops in the world.

845
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 I think even if he'd only done it twice, that would be a record.

846
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 That's a lot for the most parachute drops from a beaver.

847
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 But he was this hard.

848
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 I'm not sure if you told him that now.

849
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 You mean I didn't have to do it.

850
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 There's under 350 times.

851
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 In fact, I'd argue if Geronimo had only done it once, he would have had the jite record.

852
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 Well, he was this old tough old male.

853
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 And they thought he's going to be a practice dummy.

854
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 They used dummies first and then they thought we need a live one.

855
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 And every time he climbed out of the box, someone picked him up.

856
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 And then eventually he got so used to it that as soon as they saw him approaching,

857
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 he crawled back into the box of his own accord.

858
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Ready for the next jump.

859
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 It's so sweet.

860
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 It's time for that.

861
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Beavers are cool, are they?

862
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 So cool.

863
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Right, love beavers.

864
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 You love most about them.

865
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 Well, one thing is this stuff I didn't know about called castorium.

866
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 I've been pronouncing that right.

867
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 What, they're anal secretions.

868
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Where that says, what do you love most about beavers?

869
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 They're anal secretions.

870
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 So it's, right, let's just clear this up.

871
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 It's not anal.

872
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Is it not?

873
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 It's not their anal.

874
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 It's just extremely near their anal.

875
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Is it?

876
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 They have these glands.

877
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 And if you lift up the tail, it's really close to the bum.

878
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 And it produces a kind of scent.

879
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 It's this kind of brown slime.

880
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 It's not feces.

881
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 It's just very near the feces.

882
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 But it smells heavenly.

883
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 And there was a, it smells so good.

884
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 And it's a product of their diet of the bark and leaves.

885
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 And it's very hard to get hold of.

886
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 You have to knock a beaver out and then basically milk its anus.

887
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 It's not the anal, it's not the anal.

888
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 It's not the anal, it's not the anal.

889
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 You're milking it wrong, no.

890
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 No, it wasn't castar and beavers.

891
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 What's all the slime I've got?

892
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 But it's, it used to be used to flavour vanilla.

893
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 It used to be a legitimate product.

894
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 And it's, so NPR investigated whether it's still used.

895
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 And it turns out that there is a snaps in Sweden, which does still use it.

896
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Really?

897
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 But it's so expensive to produce, because there's only a limited number of beavers.

898
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 And the global consumption these days is only about 132 kilos a year.

899
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 So what's your favourite thing about beavers?

900
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 No, you've stolen the castorium thing.

901
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 This is a disaster.

902
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 My favourite thing is related.

903
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 It's the beaver myth that was pervasive for about over a thousand years.

904
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Which is that if you're hunting a beaver, it would bite off its testicles and throw them at you.

905
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 And then run away.

906
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 And people just used to think this.

907
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Definitely a myth.

908
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Do you know what?

909
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 I don't have any first-hand proof that it doesn't happen.

910
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 I think we assume it's a myth now.

911
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 This came up in a text called a physiologous in the second century AD.

912
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And it's based on the same thing, the castorium glands, which people thought were its testicles.

913
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Because they look very similar to testicles.

914
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 And people used this delicious smelling fragrance as medicine and there's various other things.

915
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 I think women used to sniff it like snuff.

916
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And so beavers knew this is the idea.

917
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 And they were like, "Well, this guy's hunting me. He only wants my testicles."

918
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 So he'd bite them off and chuck them at the hunter.

919
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 And then the hunter would give up.

920
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 And as the myth went, if the hunter continued chasing the beaver would turn around,

921
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 display his antitestical area.

922
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 And be like, "Look, there's nothing for you here."

923
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 That's really interesting.

924
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Because I read an article that said that the 17th century beavers' testicles were used to cure toothache.

925
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 And when minced, they added delicate flavour to tobacco.

926
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 But now I realise it's not the testicles, is it?

927
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Yeah, no.

928
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 It's these anal glands.

929
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 It is. And I think the Algonquins, another American...

930
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Native American tribes used to have it in tobacco, because it made it taste delicious.

931
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 In fact, I believe they used to be...

932
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 It used to be used to flavour camel cigarettes.

933
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 And a few other types of cigarettes.

934
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 I think they used to use castorium.

935
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Yeah, camels and winstens.

936
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 That was it.

937
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Yeah.

938
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Used to have beavers' accretia.

939
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 How many beavers would you have to knock out and milk to get this stuff?

940
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 It just is amazing.

941
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 I mean, there must have been a lot of...

942
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 I think there were a lot more back in the day.

943
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 I'm surprised they called it camels if you're getting the good stuff from the beavers.

944
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Yeah, that's true.

945
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 You've been sucking on a beaver.

946
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 Damn, your favourite thing about beavers?

947
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 That's a Robert Browning poem, isn't it?

948
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 Sucking on a beaver.

949
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Yeah, but he did think it was a lawyer's sleeve.

950
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Damn, favourite thing about beavers?

951
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 I like that they have a second set of lips.

952
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 So they've got their normal lips just hanging out there in the front.

953
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 And they've got their teeth.

954
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 And then they've got another set of lips.

955
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Yeah, sitting right behind.

956
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 No.

957
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Yeah, and it's for when they've gone underwater and they've picked up a nice bit of wood.

958
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 And they're coming back up.

959
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 So obviously they've got to bite into the wood, but you bite into the wood.

960
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Your lips are open.

961
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 You're letting the water in.

962
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Second set of lips.

963
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 You stop the water coming into your body.

964
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 It's a classic.

965
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 How much lipstick must they get through?

966
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 Hi there.

967
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 Because do you remember in the bee series of QI, we were looking into beavers.

968
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 And we sent Molly Oldfield a good friend to look into what beavers lips look like.

969
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 And she went on to the internet and Googled it.

970
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 No.

971
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 And she suddenly was less innocent than she was at the start of the day.

972
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Do you think base one and base two and base three and base four?

973
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 Do you think base one for beavers is snogging their first lips?

974
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Base two is snogging their second lips.

975
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 And then I think you'd have two base threes as well.

976
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Base three is she showed me her nuns head gear.

977
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Hang on, James.

978
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 What's your favourite thing about beavers?

979
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 I thought you'd never ask.

980
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 You've been asking all of us.

981
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 I know.

982
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 Let me think.

983
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 You must be so confident you have an obscure one that you allow three beavers.

984
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 I don't.

985
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 Okay, what about this?

986
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 My favourite is the movie "Zombievers".

987
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Of course.

988
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Yes, he's done it.

989
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 He's done it.

990
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Which I found on IMDb, which is about zombie beavers.

991
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 What I like about it is they mentioned in the script about a Guiardia lamblier parasite,

992
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 which is actually, beavers actually have it.

993
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 And they used to think that it gave people something called beaver fever.

994
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 It might actually do it.

995
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 It can infect you.

996
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 I saw a review of it that says, "Zombievers is not a total wash and seen at night

997
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 under the right combination of low expectations and controlled substances.

998
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 It may even seem better than it really is."

999
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 And also, when I went onto IMDb, it said that people who like zombie beavers will also like

1000
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 "Zombies", which is when a strange virus quickly spreads through a safari park

1001
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 and turns all the zoo animals into zombies.

1002
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Oh, zoo beavers.

1003
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Oh, zoo beavers.

1004
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 I thought it was going to be a zombie bee.

1005
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Yeah, exactly.

1006
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Well, actually, spoiler alert, at the end credits, after the end credits of Zombievers,

1007
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 there's a brief segment that shows a bee feeding on the corpse of a beaver

1008
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 and the bee flies back to its hive and the implication is that it's become a Zombie.

1009
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 Brilliant.

1010
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 We were in a sequel.

1011
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 That's so exciting.

1012
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Yeah.

1013
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 The ruin film for me.

1014
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 I won't watch it now.

1015
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 It's my night ruined.

1016
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 One other thing about beavers.

1017
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 For a beaver, the days in winter are longer than they are in the summer.

1018
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 For a beaver.

1019
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 What?

1020
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 What?

1021
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 They're nocturnal.

1022
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 Is that it?

1023
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 Yes, they are nocturnal, but that's not why.

1024
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 Imagine if James was just trying to make the idea of a nocturnal animal just sound really

1025
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 exciting suddenly.

1026
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 How can we rebrand this?

1027
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 Repackage it.

1028
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 This is literal, as literally the days are longer in the winter.

1029
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 And that is because they live underground in the dams in winter.

1030
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 And without any signals from nature, they don't know when the sun's going up and when the

1031
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 sun's going down.

1032
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,560
 And so their circadian rhythm changes and they end up living on 27-hour days in the winter

1033
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,360
 when they're living inside their dams.

1034
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,480
 And then when they come up in the summer, they live on normal days because of the sun going

1035
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,480
 up and down.

1036
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
 Wow.

1037
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
 Isn't that amazing?

1038
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,480
 I cannot believe that given that, that Zombievers was your favourite thing about beavers.

1039
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,800
 Okay, that's it.

1040
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
 That is all of our facts.

1041
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,400
 Thank you so much for listening.

1042
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,680

1049
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,520
 We got everything up there from our previous episodes.

1050
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,800
 We don't have upcoming tour dates, but we have a video of us on tour.

1051
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,640
 If you want to see that, it's called Behind the Gills.

1052
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,640
 Do download that.

1053
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,320
 We'll be back again next week.

1054
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,320
 We'll see you then.

1055
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,320
 Goodbye.

1056
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:36,120
 They've got married, and they had a son who they called Penn.

1057
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
 Yeah.

1058
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,240
 He was actually called Robert as well, but they nicknamed him Penn, and that's all they

1059
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,240
 called him.

1060
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,400
 He was called Vydeman or Weedeman.

1061
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
 Robert Weedeman.

1062
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
 Yeah.

1063
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
 But the reason they called him Penn is because he couldn't pronounce the word Weedeman.

1064
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,240
 It's also called him Penn, because they did some tests and they found out he was mightier

1065
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,240
 than a sword.

1066
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,680
 Are you going to keep that in?

1067
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,680
 Yeah.

1068
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,680
 Of course he is.

1069
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,920
 I don't know if that's real quick right now.

1070
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,920
 That's why I left the gap.

1071
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
 Sorry.

1072
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,920
 We could have left that hang.

1073
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,920
 Well, I'll get.
