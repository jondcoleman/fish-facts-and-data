00:00:02,00:00:23,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Coburn, Garden."
00:00:23,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Jizinski."
00:00:29,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:40,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:40,00:00:49,"My fact is that in Britain alone, unnecessary emails create nearly 24,000 tons of carbon every year."
00:00:49,00:00:51,Wow. Yeah.
00:00:51,00:00:54,"See, and you guys always give me crap for not replying to my emails."
00:00:54,00:00:57,I'm the most environmentally conscious of us.
00:00:57,00:01:06,"To be fair, Dan, the number of emails that you send, which are completely pointless, outweighs the fact that you don't send many."
00:01:06,00:01:12,"Yeah, you're actually, we often don't get emails in reply to the important stuff from you, and then we'll be like, ""Dan must be away from his computer."""
00:01:12,00:01:17,"And then suddenly you'll be like, ""Hey, guys, did you see this ridiculous meme? No one gives a shit about this."""
00:01:17,00:01:19,"Okay, I can't listen. I didn't like this."
00:01:19,00:01:20,How has you not?
00:01:20,00:01:29,"I've just gone against what I was hoping I would be. So what this is, this is a calculation done by an energy company called OVO."
00:01:29,00:01:32,"And they looked at the carbon footprint of an email, basically."
00:01:32,00:01:38,"So the figures vary, but it varies between one gram and three or four grams. It's not very much."
00:01:38,00:01:41,But they did also look at how many unnecessary emails are sent each day.
00:01:41,00:01:47,"For example, people writing back to just say, ""Thanks."" And sending that email through the system."
00:01:47,00:01:48,Is that unnecessary?
00:01:48,00:02:02,"Well, it depends how good your manners are, I guess. But if we're agreeing that that's a sort of superfluous thing, then what they want us to do is to add a little signature to our door emails, saying something like, ""This is a thanks in advance."""
00:02:02,00:02:05,Now that sounds really passive to me.
00:02:05,00:02:11,"It's like, ""Hey, Andy, can you please do your QI scripts by the end of the week, thanks in advance."""
00:02:11,00:02:13,"Sounds like I've said, ""You better bloody hell do it."""
00:02:13,00:02:14,Yeah.
00:02:14,00:02:15,That's a really good point.
00:02:15,00:02:18,"It'll be better than what you normally so, which is you better bloody hell don't you."
00:02:18,00:02:24,But the really cool thing about this research is that the men who advise them on this is a man called Mike Berners-Lee.
00:02:24,00:02:29,"And you might know that surname. He's the brother of Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web."
00:02:29,00:02:30,Yeah.
00:02:30,00:02:32,Can we just quickly go through how it does it?
00:02:32,00:02:36,So is it carbon or carbon dioxide? Is it from big servers processing the information?
00:02:36,00:02:41,"It's from all these things. So it's from, for example, using electricity in the first place."
00:02:41,00:02:46,"The cost of running a computer network, the cost of keeping all the data on servers and travelling across the planet."
00:02:46,00:02:51,"So the whole thing, you know, using your computer while it's on to send us email."
00:02:51,00:02:54,"It's very hard to quantify, obviously, but there's a rough figure."
00:02:54,00:02:59,"And the calculations, they depend on how important that email is a little bit."
00:02:59,00:03:04,"Because let's say I send an email back to Andy just saying, ""Thanks, on low."""
00:03:04,00:03:06,Now you don't spend much time reading it.
00:03:06,00:03:09,And so it means that it doesn't use up as much electricity.
00:03:09,00:03:12,And it's so it means that the carbon footprint is lower.
00:03:12,00:03:15,"So for instance, over 70% of emails are sent to spam."
00:03:15,00:03:18,But they only use up 22% of your carbon footprint.
00:03:18,00:03:20,And that's because you hardly ever read them.
00:03:20,00:03:23,And they go straight into your junk folder and then get deleted.
00:03:23,00:03:25,So it's like a one-way system.
00:03:25,00:03:27,It's only the making of it that uses carbon.
00:03:27,00:03:31,Unless you're over the age of 78 and you're a woman living alone.
00:03:31,00:03:35,It's just donated to a million phony charities so far.
00:03:35,00:03:40,This Mike Berners-Lee has written a book about carbon footprints.
00:03:40,00:03:42,And the amount of carbon used for lots of different things.
00:03:42,00:03:46,"It's called How Bad Are Bananas, the carbon footprint of everything."
00:03:46,00:03:51,"And one thing that is bad as well as bananas was the 2010 World Cup,"
00:03:51,00:03:56,which he says cost was 2.8 million tons of CO2.
00:03:56,00:04:03,"And to put that into perspective, it's the equivalent of every man, woman, and child in the UK having 20 cheeseburgers."
00:04:03,00:04:06,"Oh, that's the same amount."
00:04:06,00:04:08,In terms of obesity rates or anything.
00:04:08,00:04:10,In terms of carbon usage.
00:04:10,00:04:12,"Yeah, exactly. The amount of carbon."
00:04:12,00:04:15,"Or 6,000 space shuttle flights."
00:04:15,00:04:16,Got football low cup.
00:04:16,00:04:17,But it's a good well cup.
00:04:17,00:04:18,Right.
00:04:18,00:04:20,Don't be worth it.
00:04:20,00:04:22,Mike writes a lot of articles online as well.
00:04:22,00:04:26,So he has an article series that's called What's the Carbon Footprint of?
00:04:26,00:04:27,"Dot, dot, dot."
00:04:27,00:04:30,"So it's things like the carbon footprint of, say, the Iraq war."
00:04:30,00:04:32,He's looked at all the numbers and made an estimate.
00:04:32,00:04:36,"And then this one's a bit of a guilty sort of, you don't need this really."
00:04:36,00:04:39,The carbon footprint of the heart bypass operation.
00:04:39,00:04:43,I don't think you need to be thinking about offsetting when you're on your way in.
00:04:43,00:04:46,"It's going to end up being too hard by passes, isn't it?"
00:04:46,00:04:50,"If you wake up and they go, do you know how many flies you've ruined with that?"
00:04:50,00:04:51,There's 1.1 tons.
00:04:51,00:04:52,Wow.
00:04:52,00:04:53,Is that bad?
00:04:53,00:04:54,Yeah.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"It's not, it's not any carbon footprint. It's not great."
00:04:56,00:04:57,It's all relative.
00:04:57,00:04:59,"It is a, you know, a lot of modern life."
00:04:59,00:05:02,If you think about one email is one grab.
00:05:02,00:05:04,Right. Okay. That's good perspective.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"Yeah. But if you, obviously, if you sent an email saying,"
00:05:06,00:05:09,"can I book a heart bypass in, then that's only adding to the footprint."
00:05:09,00:05:10,Yeah.
00:05:10,00:05:11,So here's one.
00:05:11,00:05:15,"If you have a BLT sandwich and you want to lower your carbon footprint,"
00:05:15,00:05:18,which one ingredient should you throw away the bacon?
00:05:18,00:05:19,Yeah.
00:05:19,00:05:20,Throw away the bacon.
00:05:20,00:05:21,It's the tomato.
00:05:21,00:05:22,The tea.
00:05:22,00:05:23,Whoa.
00:05:23,00:05:24,It's the tea.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Okay. This is nuts.
00:05:25,00:05:28,Tomatoes require so much heating and lighting of greenhouses
00:05:28,00:05:32,that apparently their carbon footprint is higher than the bacon.
00:05:32,00:05:33,No way.
00:05:33,00:05:35,Which I find extraordinary.
00:05:35,00:05:36,No.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"But what if I just get my tomato from a very hot country, many, many miles away,"
00:05:39,00:05:41,and it just gets flown over by jet?
00:05:41,00:05:42,That's a great pie.
00:05:42,00:05:43,Does it need to be greenhouse?
00:05:43,00:05:45,Is it a private jet that your tomato is being flown in?
00:05:45,00:05:46,Just one tomato.
00:05:46,00:05:47,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:47,00:05:48,Yeah. It's one small bunch.
00:05:48,00:05:49,One little box.
00:05:49,00:05:51,"I mean, that I can't, that is amazing."
00:05:51,00:05:52,I find extraordinary.
00:05:52,00:05:54,There are a few sort of counterintuitive ones.
00:05:54,00:05:56,"I apparently, a New Zealand lamb."
00:05:56,00:06:00,"If you imported a New Zealand lamb to England to use,"
00:06:00,00:06:05,there's less carbon output than a British lamb because the rearing is so much more
00:06:05,00:06:09,"that even if you include the shipping, the lamb is far less if it comes from New Zealand."
00:06:09,00:06:10,Really?
00:06:10,00:06:14,And it's not just because the natural climate requires less input.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"Yeah, it must be just all the procedures that they're doing."
00:06:16,00:06:18,Because I would have thought that lambs are not that hard to read.
00:06:18,00:06:21,"They're one of the few things that the British climate is okay with rearing,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,but that's a particular common input.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"Lamb and beef do have, they're the two highest meats with,"
00:06:25,00:06:28,"although that's, I think that's total ecological impact, but a lot of that's carbon."
00:06:28,00:06:32,But I'm amazed that the New Zealand lamb is somehow requiring less carbon.
00:06:32,00:06:36,"I mean, they send a lot less emails done they in New Zealand with the lambs."
00:06:36,00:06:39,It's mostly just lesser writing for the lamb still.
00:06:39,00:06:41,Do you know what the third meat is?
00:06:41,00:06:42,So the first beef.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Beef lamb.
00:06:43,00:06:44,Second is lamb.
00:06:44,00:06:45,Pork?
00:06:45,00:06:46,I actually think the second is pork.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Okay.
00:06:47,00:06:49,And this thing has a bigger carbon footprint than lamb.
00:06:49,00:06:50,Chicken.
00:06:50,00:06:51,"No, it's crustaceans."
00:06:51,00:06:53,So I can't believe this.
00:06:53,00:06:57,"I always think crustaceans is such an ethical thing to eat in proportion to other meat,"
00:06:57,00:07:00,but they use a huge amount of fuel compared to other seafood.
00:07:00,00:07:03,"So most seafood has a carbon footprint, a bit like chicken,"
00:07:03,00:07:06,but shellfish is up there with beef in terms of its footprint.
00:07:06,00:07:07,I'm so delighted.
00:07:07,00:07:09,"I only hate it, don't you?"
00:07:09,00:07:12,"I hate eating crustaceans, but it's just because I'm a bit fatty."
00:07:12,00:07:15,And now I can say it's because I want to save the environment.
00:07:15,00:07:17,"Oh god, as if you didn't have enough moral high ground."
00:07:17,00:07:20,Do you know one thing that has an insanely high carbon footprint?
00:07:20,00:07:21,One practice.
00:07:21,00:07:24,I mean lots.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Having asthma.
00:07:25,00:07:29,Is that because you're breathing out lots of carbon dioxide all the time?
00:07:29,00:07:30,It's not that.
00:07:30,00:07:31,It's not that.
00:07:31,00:07:34,"Okay, again, I don't feel comfortable causing people with asthma to hyperventilate with guilt."
00:07:34,00:07:35,"No, no, no, no."
00:07:35,00:07:38,"I used to have asthma, and I don't have it anymore."
00:07:38,00:07:40,Is that an ecological position?
00:07:40,00:07:43,"No, but I did use to have it."
00:07:43,00:07:45,"I used to have those, you know, inhalers."
00:07:45,00:07:46,Yeah.
00:07:46,00:07:50,"And you know, they use a gas called hydroflora alcan, which is a propellant."
00:07:50,00:07:53,"That's what squirts the medicine out, you know, it's like a little gas cartridge."
00:07:53,00:07:59,Those inhalers account for 4% of the NHS greenhouse gas expenditure.
00:07:59,00:08:01,"Those inhalers alone, 4%."
00:08:01,00:08:02,Isn't that massive?
00:08:02,00:08:08,"So if you replaced one in 10 of those inhalers, you would reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 58,000 tonnes."
00:08:08,00:08:11,"What can replace them with, do they have like eco ones?"
00:08:11,00:08:15,"There are other ecological ones, which some people can have, I think, not everyone."
00:08:15,00:08:18,"But yeah, 58,000 tonnes, just to replace one in 10 of those, you would say."
00:08:18,00:08:19,Wow.
00:08:19,00:08:20,That would say.
00:08:20,00:08:25,"The NHS actually had an incredible carbon mistake quite recently, didn't they?"
00:08:25,00:08:26,To speaking of them.
00:08:26,00:08:27,So did you read about this?
00:08:27,00:08:35,"It had an email storm in 2016, where 186 million useless emails ended up being sent."
00:08:35,00:08:39,"So this is, the history of email storms is so fun."
00:08:39,00:08:45,"So basically, this apparently is the industry term for when someone accidentally sends an email to a huge mailing list."
00:08:45,00:08:48,"And in this case, it was the IT guy who was sending a test email."
00:08:48,00:08:51,He sent it to 1.2 million employees.
00:08:51,00:08:56,"And then they all replied all, saying, please unsubscribe me from this list."
00:08:56,00:09:00,"And then there are other ones who replied all, saying, stop replying all, everyone, stop replying all."
00:09:00,00:09:02,And eventually it ended up being 186 million emails.
00:09:02,00:09:05,And I believe it took down the NHS mail system.
00:09:05,00:09:10,"There was a very funny quote from Spokesperson, the NHS digital Spokesperson, who said,"
00:09:10,00:09:16,"some users have experienced short delays in the NHS mail system this morning, but the issue has been resolved."
00:09:16,00:09:20,But she did have to dictate that over the phone because her email still wasn't working.
00:09:20,00:09:21,"Wow, wow."
00:09:21,00:09:25,So next time the NHS gives you shit about your heart by pass.
00:09:25,00:09:28,"2016, mate."
00:09:28,00:09:32,There's a guy called Joey M.
00:09:32,00:09:34,He's lives in Rhode Island.
00:09:34,00:09:39,"And he has the world record, most number of unread emails in his inbox."
00:09:39,00:09:41,"Oh wait, can we guess?"
00:09:41,00:09:42,Yeah.
00:09:42,00:09:44,In the thousands.
00:09:44,00:09:45,What?
00:09:45,00:09:46,"2000, I'm right."
00:09:46,00:09:49,"I'm pretty sure these two, that's me."
00:09:49,00:09:51,Okay.
00:09:51,00:09:52,58 million.
00:09:52,00:09:54,"Can I go, can I go ridiculous, say a billion?"
00:09:54,00:09:55,A billion.
00:09:55,00:09:56,I can say a billion.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Four billion.
00:09:57,00:09:58,Wow!
00:09:58,00:10:02,"294 million, 967,256."
00:10:02,00:10:10,"And he evidenced it by uploading a video onto recordsetter.com, which allows you to,"
00:10:10,00:10:14,"if you think you've done more keepy upies than anyone else, you can put a video on this site."
00:10:14,00:10:15,Yeah.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"And he showed it on his phone, just deleting one message to get down."
00:10:18,00:10:20,So just over four billion.
00:10:20,00:10:21,"Oh, what?"
00:10:21,00:10:22,But isn't that amazing?
00:10:22,00:10:23,It's a lot of mailing lists.
00:10:23,00:10:25,Does he work for the NHS?
00:10:25,00:10:34,"And there was a survey done by Adobe, quite recently, about emails that says 55% of people,"
00:10:34,00:10:42,"whenever they get to zero inbox, say it's relieving, 22%, say it's amazing, and 10%, say it's impossible."
00:10:42,00:10:48,"And the only reason I bring up this survey is because they categorise people into boomers,"
00:10:48,00:10:56,"Gen X millennials and Gen Z, and they put millennials starting in 1977, which makes me a millennial."
00:10:56,00:10:57,Nice.
00:10:57,00:10:58,So that's the other reason I bring up.
00:10:58,00:11:00,As a long buildup to emphasise that you're a millennial.
00:11:00,00:11:01,That was the price for the record.
00:11:01,00:11:06,I was going to ask you about that skateboard you're holding.
00:11:06,00:11:08,So just one weird bit of carbon news.
00:11:08,00:11:13,"So in 1981, Ronald Reagan made this speech, made this statement where he said,"
00:11:13,00:11:16,"""Trees produce more pollution than automobiles."""
00:11:16,00:11:21,"So he said that, and people thought, ""Well, that's very funny,"" and probably some idiots believed him,"
00:11:21,00:11:24,and he probably set the world back by about 100 years.
00:11:24,00:11:28,"But he said this, ""But trees do emit greenhouse gases."""
00:11:28,00:11:31,"So they emit loads of methane, and we've only just discovered this."
00:11:31,00:11:35,"It was in 2014, there was this huge methane surplus in the atmosphere."
00:11:35,00:11:37,People didn't know where it was coming from.
00:11:37,00:11:41,And this woman went to the Amazon and tested its trees and figured out they were all pumping out methane.
00:11:41,00:11:42,They're all farting.
00:11:42,00:11:43,They're all farting.
00:11:43,00:11:46,"All farting, tree thoughts, and the atmosphere."
00:11:46,00:11:48,"But this isn't a problem, is it?"
00:11:48,00:11:53,"It's definitely, definitely offset by the amount of CO2 that they're absorbing."
00:11:53,00:11:55,And so we don't want to get rid of the trees.
00:11:55,00:11:58,"Guys, trees are good thumbs up, but it is a thing that we need to work out why they're doing it."
00:11:58,00:12:02,"And so it might be more in wetlands, which have a lot of methane within them that they're pumping out."
00:12:02,00:12:06,"So maybe we don't plant trees on big piles of methane, for instance."
00:12:06,00:12:07,Right.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"Hey, remember we had that fact a long, long time ago about every tree."
00:12:10,00:12:12,I think it's in Melbourne that has an email address.
00:12:12,00:12:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:13,00:12:14,"Oh, that's a bit of a..."
00:12:14,00:12:17,"Oh my god, they're really shooting themselves in the tree, aren't they?"
00:12:17,00:12:23,"Okay, it's time for fact number two."
00:12:23,00:12:25,And that is James.
00:12:25,00:12:32,"Okay, my fact this week is that hot dogs are called hot dogs because people used to think they contain dog."
00:12:32,00:12:33,And did they?
00:12:33,00:12:35,"No, don't think so."
00:12:35,00:12:37,"No, I don't think so."
00:12:37,00:12:41,So this is something I read in the Oxford English Dictionary.
00:12:41,00:12:47,The word hot dog appears to be college slang from America in the late 19th century.
00:12:47,00:12:54,"And according to the OED, who cite the Oxford companion to food and drink and the historical dictionary of American slang."
00:12:54,00:12:58,"The reason people called them hot dogs is one, they were hot."
00:12:58,00:13:02,"And two, they had this weird meat that they didn't know where it quite came from."
00:13:02,00:13:05,And it might as well come from dogs come from anywhere else.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Okay.
00:13:06,00:13:09,"In fact, I think that it could have been in there."
00:13:09,00:13:13,So I got two into these three people called Gerald Leonard Cohen.
00:13:13,00:13:17,"And I'd buy, I don't think he's related, a Barry Poppig."
00:13:17,00:13:23,"And David Shulman, who have devoted over 20 years of their life to working out the roof, the phrase hot dog."
00:13:23,00:13:26,And so they're into it.
00:13:26,00:13:34,"And Gerald Leonard Cohen says that scandalous but true, some butchers even hired dog killers in the US who were going club some dogs and stuff them in sausages."
00:13:34,00:13:40,"Even though it wasn't legit, he's found some instances of that and then they'd sell the carcass to the butcher."
00:13:40,00:13:48,"And yeah, I think what was 1884 that they started calling sausages dogs and then they added the hot in the 1890s."
00:13:48,00:13:51,I read a bit about Gerald Leonard Cohen and Barry Poppig.
00:13:51,00:13:55,They've written a 300 page book about the origin of the phrase hot dog.
00:13:55,00:13:59,"And he does this, he publishes his own journal which is called comments on etymology."
00:13:59,00:14:05,"The circulation is under 100, you have to write to him and send him money and he will then send you a copy of this thing."
00:14:05,00:14:09,He wants wrote 167 page paper on just the word jazz.
00:14:09,00:14:11,He is a serious etymologist.
00:14:11,00:14:14,"And he is, we should say, also a professor."
00:14:14,00:14:21,So he's a professor for our languages at a university so he does make an income other than from these hundreds of writers.
00:14:21,00:14:25,"But he said, I think he was interviewed and he said, what else am I going to do with my time?"
00:14:25,00:14:30,"I'm going to go skiing, I'll probably get hurt. So I guess I've got to just research hot dogs for her."
00:14:30,00:14:32,I'm supposed to go skiing this weekend.
00:14:32,00:14:36,"Well, I suggest you instead devote two decades to researching hot dogs origins."
00:14:36,00:14:44,"I reckon the first hot dogs must have been quite good actually because the phrase hot dog, which means like something which is really awesome,"
00:14:44,00:14:49,is only one year younger than the word hot dog meaning the food stuff.
00:14:49,00:14:54,So they had hot dogs for one year and then people thought it was a word that meant this is great.
00:14:54,00:14:56,That's Mickey Mouse's first words.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"Yeah, he goes hot dogs."
00:14:58,00:15:00,"He plural, he pluralises it."
00:15:00,00:15:06,I'm so glad we've done this because I've always wondered in its wonderful life when the James Stewart character says hot dog.
00:15:06,00:15:09,And it's when it's something totally unregistered hot dogs has happened.
00:15:09,00:15:12,What's the name of this? He said hot.
00:15:12,00:15:14,Some people were annoyed about it.
00:15:14,00:15:16,So they started at one of the early sites.
00:15:16,00:15:18,They were sold with Coney Island.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Is that New Jersey?
00:15:19,00:15:20,"No, it's New York."
00:15:20,00:15:21,New York.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"Sorry, it's Coney Island, New York."
00:15:23,00:15:27,It was so annoyed by the association with hot dogs thinking they were a slightly lower class thing.
00:15:27,00:15:33,That in 1913 the Chamber of Commerce passed a law forbidding the use of the phrase hot dog on signs.
00:15:33,00:15:34,Really?
00:15:34,00:15:35,You weren't allowed to have a sign up saying hot dog.
00:15:35,00:15:38,I think it was not because of the implication that there might be dog meat in them.
00:15:38,00:15:39,"Slightly, yeah."
00:15:39,00:15:40,What's that?
00:15:40,00:15:41,Did you want that?
00:15:41,00:15:49,So we were in New York not too long ago and I went for a walk one day to Central Park and hot dog vendors everywhere along the roads.
00:15:49,00:15:54,"And I was just reading that in order to park their hot dog vending machines in these spots, do you know what they pay?"
00:15:54,00:15:56,The prices there.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"So just to, should we have a guess?"
00:15:58,00:16:00,"Yeah, just the American dollars just to be there."
00:16:00,00:16:02,"Per year or a year, let's say."
00:16:02,00:16:03,Per year.
00:16:03,00:16:08,"Just to park there, I'm going to say it's probably in the region of $10,000 US dollars."
00:16:08,00:16:09,I'm going to say about the same.
00:16:09,00:16:10,"15, let's say."
00:16:10,00:16:11,15.
00:16:11,00:16:14,I'd say they pay in kind and it's like 10 hot dogs a year.
00:16:14,00:16:16,We lost it.
00:16:16,00:16:23,"Okay, so there was one guy who was parked on Fifth Avenue, East 62nd Street, very near Central Park."
00:16:23,00:16:25,"289,500."
00:16:25,00:16:26,No.
00:16:26,00:16:27,"For his annual, yeah."
00:16:27,00:16:33,"And that's, that is, he's got to get that to break even obviously because he's got to push and then everything is proper from there."
00:16:33,00:16:35,But they all managed to do it.
00:16:35,00:16:36,Yeah.
00:16:36,00:16:38,"Because hot dogs in New York sell for $10,000."
00:16:38,00:16:39,Exactly.
00:16:39,00:16:41,That is quite a lot of money.
00:16:41,00:16:47,"Yeah, so on average, they have to pay the city $200,000 each year."
00:16:47,00:16:53,I've never been to one of those stands and got a hot dog and I feel incredibly guilty that I've been driving these poor people out of business.
00:16:53,00:16:56,Do you know one thing that doesn't have to park that is associated with hot dogs?
00:16:56,00:16:58,Have you heard of the Weenemobile?
00:16:58,00:17:00,"Oh, I have maybe half."
00:17:00,00:17:01,I'm not sure.
00:17:01,00:17:02,I've never been for a ride in the Weenemobile.
00:17:02,00:17:03,I haven't.
00:17:03,00:17:06,Not a jack-up line.
00:17:06,00:17:15,"So, you know, Oscar Mayors, a big hot dog company, they have a fleet, a small fleet of Weenemobiles, which are cars shaped like hot dogs, which have been going since 1936."
00:17:15,00:17:17,"Obviously, they've changed them, you know."
00:17:17,00:17:20,"But basically, they were a huge promotional thing."
00:17:20,00:17:26,"So they would hand out hot dogs, small hot dogs, from inside the big hot dog, because the cars shaped like a hot dog."
00:17:26,00:17:29,And they would hand out things called Weenow whistles to children.
00:17:29,00:17:35,"So that if a child ever saw the Weenemobile, they would blow their whistle and attract other children to come and get a hot dog."
00:17:35,00:17:37,And they would have a sort of an ice cream van.
00:17:37,00:17:39,You're getting the kid to do the job for you.
00:17:39,00:17:40,"Yeah, exactly."
00:17:40,00:17:43,And they train their drivers at a place called Hot Dog High.
00:17:43,00:17:49,"And then, once you're in, like, Starfleet Academy for Hot Dog High, you drive around the country."
00:17:49,00:17:52,It's mostly sort of students and things they hire.
00:17:52,00:17:58,"And you drive in pairs, and one person has to drive, and the other one has to wave to people, which is called Riding Shot Bun."
00:17:58,00:17:59,Shot Bun?
00:17:59,00:18:03,"Yeah, and sometimes they let you in, and they ask you to fasten your meat belt."
00:18:03,00:18:05,"Wow, it's disgusting."
00:18:05,00:18:10,"I think someone's driving around, picking up children, and telling them to fasten their meat."
00:18:10,00:18:12,"It's a car-shaped, like a sausage."
00:18:12,00:18:13,"You're defenseless, guys."
00:18:13,00:18:14,"It's not looking good, mate."
00:18:14,00:18:15,Yeah.
00:18:15,00:18:18,But he blew up my Weenow whistle.
00:18:18,00:18:25,"There's only ever been one accident involving a Weenemobile, and one of them rammed into a house."
00:18:25,00:18:27,Imagine that coming through the window.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"Yeah, it'd be like a bad ring ram, as well."
00:18:29,00:18:31,Take the whole thing down.
00:18:31,00:18:36,Another famous Hot Dog company in America is Nathan's.
00:18:36,00:18:37,Okay.
00:18:37,00:18:39,And that's a really good story about them.
00:18:39,00:18:45,"So there was another Hot Dog maker on Coney Island called Feltmans, and they were really, really huge and really, really popular."
00:18:45,00:18:50,"And they had what some people said was possibly the largest restaurant in the world, which just sold Hot Dogs."
00:18:50,00:18:57,"But then they had a guy who came to work for them, who was a Jewish immigrant from Poland called Nathan Handwerker."
00:18:57,00:19:01,"And Nathan Handwerker was working just slightly, I'd be like, what are you laughing at?"
00:19:01,00:19:03,To work. Handwerker's a funny name.
00:19:03,00:19:06,"Yeah, but he wasn't masturbating people."
00:19:06,00:19:10,He was spending his week slicing buns.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"Okay, so he sounds like masturbating people."
00:19:13,00:19:16,He was working as a bun slicer.
00:19:16,00:19:20,"And then he decided, well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell my own company."
00:19:20,00:19:23,And he needed to get some money together.
00:19:23,00:19:27,So he lived entirely on Hot Dogs for a year.
00:19:27,00:19:31,"He had nothing but Hot Dogs, and he slept on the kitchen floor of this place."
00:19:31,00:19:33,So he got all the money together.
00:19:33,00:19:39,And then eventually he started his own business and then undercut Feltmans by selling his Hot Dogs for half the price.
00:19:39,00:19:46,"And became what's quite synonymous, as well as Oscar Meyers and as well as Feltmans, but kind of synonymous with Hot Dogs in America now."
00:19:46,00:19:47,Wow.
00:19:47,00:19:50,But he didn't have to have quadruple heart bypass.
00:19:50,00:19:53,"Oh my god, the carbon, carbon."
00:19:53,00:19:56,"So that's the big competition, isn't it, in America?"
00:19:56,00:19:59,"They have Nathan, it's called Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest."
00:19:59,00:20:04,"And the men's champion is a man called Joey Chestnut, who's won it nine times."
00:20:04,00:20:08,His all-time record is eating 74 Hot Dogs and Buns in 10 minutes.
00:20:08,00:20:11,"That's 7.4 a minute, if my master's correct."
00:20:11,00:20:12,Yeah.
00:20:12,00:20:14,And there's such rivalry in the...
00:20:14,00:20:16,"But you have to eat the buns as well, don't you?"
00:20:16,00:20:17,You have to eat the buns.
00:20:17,00:20:20,What's he going to do with the buns? Otherwise you haven't eaten the hot dog eating the dog.
00:20:20,00:20:21,"Yeah, that's true."
00:20:21,00:20:23,"No, that's not hot. It's not a bread."
00:20:23,00:20:26,"It's not a bread. Oh, the bread's keeping this dog warm."
00:20:26,00:20:27,It's not like a blanket.
00:20:27,00:20:29,"I'm on the Atkins start. I'll just have the dog, please."
00:20:29,00:20:35,But the previous champion was this guy called Takeru Kobayashi from Japan.
00:20:35,00:20:39,"And no one had ever eaten more than, I can't remember what it was, like 20 or something."
00:20:39,00:20:41,"And then he walked on stage in 2001, he ate 50."
00:20:41,00:20:44,It completely revolutionized the sport and the art.
00:20:44,00:20:47,But what was his thing? You know in the Fosbury flop.
00:20:47,00:20:50,"You changed the way that you jumped over, the high jump."
00:20:50,00:20:52,So one was his training method.
00:20:52,00:20:56,"His training method was he would practice drinking three gallons of water in 90 seconds,"
00:20:56,00:20:59,meaning that his stomach got used to expanding very quickly.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Wow.
00:21:00,00:21:03,"Can I say, I tried to do that once and was extreme."
00:21:03,00:21:06,"Like, do not try that at home. Extremely sick."
00:21:06,00:21:08,Send us your videos of you not trying it at home.
00:21:08,00:21:12,Oh my goodness. I was just vomiting water for ages afterwards.
00:21:12,00:21:15,And why did you rejoin to enter this competition?
00:21:15,00:21:17,I was young and it was a bet.
00:21:17,00:21:20,You're a millennial. That's the kind of crazy thing they do.
00:21:20,00:21:25,"So the other thing he did, he invented this method where you split each hot dog in two"
00:21:25,00:21:27,and you force both ends in your mouth at once.
00:21:27,00:21:30,Because your mouth is wide enough for two hot dogs.
00:21:30,00:21:33,I cannot believe that I thought of that before.
00:21:33,00:21:35,What? I don't understand.
00:21:35,00:21:38,"So you chop each hot dog in half half way along, so you've got the two ends."
00:21:38,00:21:41,And then you just shove both ends in your mouth at the same time.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"And they called this the Solomon method, which is an illusion to King Solomon"
00:21:44,00:21:48,because he wants threatened to split a baby in two in a biblical story.
00:21:48,00:21:49,It is.
00:21:49,00:21:50,Yeah.
00:21:50,00:21:52,"And it's a very high brow contest, isn't it?"
00:21:52,00:21:54,So you get a lot of these biblical in-classical references.
00:21:54,00:21:55,Wow.
00:21:55,00:21:59,"Two parents were arguing over who got custody of a baby and Solomon said,"
00:21:59,00:22:00,"""Well, we'll cut the baby in two."""
00:22:00,00:22:02,And then you guys get the whole thing in his mouth.
00:22:02,00:22:06,"No, no, you didn't. No one ate the baby."
00:22:06,00:22:09,"Baby eating contest. It's in John, part one."
00:22:09,00:22:10,What was that?
00:22:10,00:22:12,"One of the parents said, ""Oh, that's fine by me."
00:22:12,00:22:14,"You're a good idea. Let's split the baby in two."""
00:22:14,00:22:16,"And the other one said, ""No, don't do that."""
00:22:16,00:22:19,"And then King Solomon said, ""We usually probably have the baby."""
00:22:19,00:22:20,Is that what happens?
00:22:20,00:22:21,That's right.
00:22:21,00:22:22,I think that's right.
00:22:22,00:22:23,Yeah.
00:22:23,00:22:25,"That's amazing, but so obvious."
00:22:25,00:22:26,I would have split it.
00:22:26,00:22:28,"I don't want to claim that I would have won this competition,"
00:22:28,00:22:29,but I think it would have had a chance.
00:22:29,00:22:32,Because obviously you put it in half and shove it in both sides.
00:22:32,00:22:33,I would say into three parts.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Well, I was just going to say, where do you stop?"
00:22:35,00:22:38,"Is it possible to cut into three, four, five, six or seven parts?"
00:22:38,00:22:39,How wide is your mouth?
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Well, you're looking at me."
00:22:41,00:22:44,"The people at home don't have this option,"
00:22:44,00:22:45,but I don't think I could fit.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"In fact, I'm not sure I could fit, too, in mine."
00:22:47,00:22:48,I'm not.
00:22:48,00:22:49,"No, I don't know."
00:22:49,00:22:51,"You're a two-man, three-max."
00:22:51,00:22:53,I think there's a point at which there are diminishing returns
00:22:53,00:22:55,from cutting your hot dogs into an increasing number of pieces
00:22:55,00:22:57,before you put them in your mouth.
00:22:57,00:23:00,Still with a knife and fork on the first hot dog.
00:23:00,00:23:01,I'll have the competition.
00:23:01,00:23:04,Those guys are going to feel so stupid as you cut it into the hundred pieces.
00:23:04,00:23:06,I'm going to get this whole thing on my mouth.
00:23:07,00:23:11,Do you know that the Pentagon used to have a hot dog stand?
00:23:11,00:23:16,"There was a rumor, which they tour guides still tell to this day"
00:23:16,00:23:18,when you get taken around Pentagon.
00:23:18,00:23:20,It got taken down in 2006.
00:23:20,00:23:24,"But during the Cold War, apparently, the Russians were convinced"
00:23:24,00:23:27,that some amazing stuff was going their secretive conversations
00:23:27,00:23:29,because people would meet there.
00:23:29,00:23:32,"So apparently, they had two missiles aimed at this hot dog stand"
00:23:32,00:23:34,the entire time of the Cold War.
00:23:34,00:23:37,"And that was the rumor, no one's ever--"
00:23:37,00:23:39,Imagine if the missile hit.
00:23:39,00:23:42,How many pieces those hot dogs could be in?
00:23:42,00:23:44,You've got to stuff them all that you've got.
00:23:44,00:23:47,Still strategizing for the next tournament.
00:23:47,00:23:53,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:23:53,00:23:54,And that is my fact.
00:23:54,00:23:58,My fact this week is that the oldest recording we have of a poet
00:23:58,00:24:01,"reading his own poem is of Robert Browning,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,who forgets the words to the poem halfway through
00:24:04,00:24:06,and ends the recording with an apology.
00:24:06,00:24:08,That's amazing.
00:24:08,00:24:11,So this was in April of 1889.
00:24:11,00:24:14,There's only a few months before he died and Robert Browning--
00:24:14,00:24:18,I think he was at a party and it was being held by the artist Rudolf Lehman.
00:24:18,00:24:23,And he had with him one of those Edison wax cylinder talking machines
00:24:23,00:24:27,and he got Robert Browning to recite his poem which was called
00:24:27,00:24:32,"""How they brought the good news from Ghent to X. I."""
00:24:32,00:24:33,"No, it's X."
00:24:33,00:24:35,"Yeah, like X number once."
00:24:35,00:24:36,Yeah.
00:24:36,00:24:39,Andy was just doing his allergy impression.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Hi.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Hi.
00:24:41,00:24:42,Is it really?
00:24:42,00:24:43,"Yeah, I did it."
00:24:43,00:24:44,You should listen to it.
00:24:44,00:24:46,I don't know why I memorized it when I was ten.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Did you?
00:24:47,00:24:48,I did.
00:24:48,00:24:51,I had to do it for a recital competition and I--
00:24:51,00:24:53,"Oh, this actual poem, the Browning."
00:24:53,00:24:55,Did you get through it without apologising?
00:24:55,00:24:57,I did better than Browning did.
00:24:57,00:24:58,Wow.
00:24:58,00:25:00,I got through it and then I was rereading it and I was so ashamed
00:25:00,00:25:02,at how little of it I could remember.
00:25:02,00:25:05,I think they all I could remember is because it's such a good poem actually.
00:25:05,00:25:07,It's done galloping.
00:25:07,00:25:09,You never really know what the good news is.
00:25:09,00:25:11,And it's got this great rhythm of horse.
00:25:11,00:25:13,It's just galloping from Ghent to X.
00:25:13,00:25:17,"And all I remember is they galloped, galloped, we galloped all three."
00:25:17,00:25:18,You know what?
00:25:18,00:25:20,You're embarrassed that you couldn't remember much of it.
00:25:20,00:25:22,I still think that's pretty impressive.
00:25:22,00:25:24,I think you almost got further than Browning himself.
00:25:24,00:25:25,That's right.
00:25:25,00:25:26,"No, you're right."
00:25:26,00:25:29,"And the pace, when you listen to him speak it and this is online."
00:25:29,00:25:34,"So if you go on YouTube and put this in, anyone listening can actually hear the man himself."
00:25:34,00:25:37,It does feel like it's an old western.
00:25:37,00:25:40,It's got this fantastic pace to it.
00:25:40,00:25:45,"But he only gets to a few lines in and he suddenly says, I'm most terribly sorry that I can't remember my own verses."
00:25:45,00:25:48,"But then ads, but the one thing I will remember all my life,"
00:25:48,00:25:52,is this astonishing sensation produced upon me by your wonderful invention.
00:25:52,00:25:55,And then you hear people cheering for him in the background.
00:25:55,00:25:58,"It's a real politician's answer the way he says, I can't remember the poem."
00:25:58,00:26:01,"You specifically asked me to read, but one thing I can remember."
00:26:01,00:26:03,It's an amazing pivot.
00:26:03,00:26:04,It's incredible pivot.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:10,And so one nice thing about it was that there were a lot of people recording at the time.
00:26:10,00:26:15,But supposedly he was one of the first notable people to pass away.
00:26:15,00:26:19,"So soon after the recording, and it was a year after he died when they had a memorial for him"
00:26:19,00:26:24,that they played his voice at the memorial and they said it was like him coming back from the dead.
00:26:24,00:26:27,It was this eerie thing that no one had ever experienced before.
00:26:27,00:26:32,"I think it was the first time that anyone's voice had been played or any more notable person anyway after they died,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,"which that must have been pretty weird, right?"
00:26:34,00:26:35,Yeah.
00:26:35,00:26:36,That must have been weird.
00:26:36,00:26:38,"But also, it's kind of embarrassing."
00:26:38,00:26:43,"I say, please don't play the recording right, cocked up after I'm dead on my anniversary."
00:26:43,00:26:44,Yeah.
00:26:44,00:26:45,It's true.
00:26:45,00:26:49,It was pointing and laughing.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"Some of his relatives did say it was embarrassing, but they played it."
00:26:52,00:26:53,Did they?
00:26:53,00:26:55,Not everyone was happy that it was there.
00:26:55,00:26:56,The fans.
00:26:56,00:26:58,It was at a browning society gathering in London.
00:26:58,00:27:00,They were all huddled around this.
00:27:00,00:27:01,They were societies.
00:27:01,00:27:04,There were societies decades before he died.
00:27:04,00:27:08,"Not maybe not decades, but certainly in the last decade before he died."
00:27:08,00:27:10,There were people meeting up and he found that embarrassing.
00:27:10,00:27:12,"Oh, everyone was so embarrassed all the time."
00:27:12,00:27:16,"Because he was so popular, I think it was Westminster Abbey where his funeral was held."
00:27:16,00:27:20,"They got over a thousand applications and the dean of Westminster wrote saying,"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"""Everyone has been trying to get into Browning's funeral."
00:27:22,00:27:25,"I've had to really limit it to people who had a really good reason to be there."""
00:27:25,00:27:26,Really?
00:27:26,00:27:27,Do you know?
00:27:27,00:27:30,Because he wasn't popular throughout most of his life.
00:27:30,00:27:32,And then he did get very popular towards the end.
00:27:32,00:27:34,And all these people wanted to go to his funeral.
00:27:34,00:27:37,"And also, he sparked a fashion for dressing in Brown."
00:27:37,00:27:38,Did he?
00:27:38,00:27:39,No.
00:27:39,00:27:45,"He did. Just after he died in America, he sparked a brief fashion for dressing up in Brown items of clothing."
00:27:45,00:27:47,Just because he was called Browning.
00:27:47,00:27:49,He didn't dress in Brown himself.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"No, it was just the name, yeah."
00:27:50,00:27:51,Wow.
00:27:51,00:27:53,How did they do when Dickens died?
00:27:53,00:27:56,A lot of arrests.
00:27:56,00:28:01,Do you have any more on that about how that came about?
00:28:01,00:28:02,I know.
00:28:02,00:28:03,I've only found it in one place.
00:28:03,00:28:04,"And sorry, it was before he died."
00:28:04,00:28:08,It was 1979 to 1980 when he just released one of his very popular works.
00:28:08,00:28:09,"1979, wow."
00:28:09,00:28:11,So that was just starting out there.
00:28:11,00:28:19,It was 1879 to 1880 when he just released one of his popular works.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Wow.
00:28:20,00:28:25,"His romance with Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who he became husband and wife."
00:28:25,00:28:28,And she was way more famous to start with than him.
00:28:28,00:28:32,It was really interesting because he started as a correspondence.
00:28:32,00:28:33,And she was housebound.
00:28:33,00:28:34,And she was invalid.
00:28:34,00:28:37,And her father was extremely strict about who she didn't didn't see.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"Despite the fact she was also a famous poet, which I don't really understand."
00:28:40,00:28:43,But he started writing to her and they started a passionate correspondence.
00:28:43,00:28:46,And then they eloped and got married.
00:28:46,00:28:48,And they had a son who they called Penn.
00:28:48,00:28:51,He was actually called Robert as well.
00:28:51,00:28:52,But they nicknamed him Penn.
00:28:52,00:28:53,And that's all they called him.
00:28:53,00:28:56,"No, he was called Vydeman or Weedeman."
00:28:56,00:28:57,Robert Weedeman.
00:28:57,00:28:58,Yeah.
00:28:58,00:29:02,But the reason they called him Penn is because he couldn't pronounce the word Weedeman as a baby.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Well, that was a baby."
00:29:04,00:29:07,We couldn't pronounce anything as a baby.
00:29:07,00:29:09,They had massive arguments about how Penn should grow up.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Did you read about these?
00:29:10,00:29:11,"No, no."
00:29:11,00:29:18,"So basically he wanted the child to grow up looking sort of very blokey, Victorian, you know,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,wearing trousers and having his hair cut short.
00:29:20,00:29:23,And she wanted petticoats and shoulder length ringlets of hair.
00:29:23,00:29:26,"And she won, maybe because she was more famous or more authoritative."
00:29:26,00:29:29,"But basically until the child was 10, he wore petticoats."
00:29:29,00:29:33,"And then as soon as she died, when Penn was 10 years old,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,Robert had the child's hair cut really short.
00:29:35,00:29:36,"Yeah, okay."
00:29:36,00:29:37,So I'm pronouncing it differently.
00:29:37,00:29:38,There was a big bone of contention between them.
00:29:38,00:29:42,"But he turned out quite different to what she would have wanted then because he,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,so he did have this quite fade upbringing.
00:29:44,00:29:46,And he slept in her room until he was 12.
00:29:46,00:29:52,"And I thought, I thought, hang on, I thought Elizabeth Browning died when he was 10."
00:29:52,00:29:55,And you're saying it was a really tragic last two years.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Really.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Very traumatising for him.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"Well, I've gotten until he was 12."
00:29:59,00:30:00,Okay.
00:30:00,00:30:01,So we'll fact check that.
00:30:01,00:30:05,"He ended up this real kind of, well, what is described in one of his biography,"
00:30:05,00:30:10,"in one of Browning's biographies, as a beefy and berry middle-aged man in Nicarbockers"
00:30:10,00:30:12,with a reputation for promiscuity.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"And also his home, his house was just a filthy pigstie."
00:30:15,00:30:17,He had people around for parties.
00:30:17,00:30:20,And so his house was nicknamed the Palazzo pigstie.
00:30:20,00:30:22,The pigstie palace.
00:30:22,00:30:24,"And well, he was called Penn."
00:30:24,00:30:25,Yeah.
00:30:25,00:30:26,It's like a pigpen.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:27,00:30:28,Penn's pigpen.
00:30:28,00:30:29,So he was.
00:30:29,00:30:30,He was a painter.
00:30:30,00:30:32,But I think not a great one.
00:30:32,00:30:36,"And apparently, his contract for painting for a luxurious female nude"
00:30:36,00:30:39,did not encourage sales in Victorian England.
00:30:39,00:30:40,"Well, he was a sculptor, too."
00:30:40,00:30:41,"Oh, was he?"
00:30:41,00:30:45,"Yeah, one of his very few sculpted works is of a woman communing with a python."
00:30:45,00:30:46,And it's quite sexy.
00:30:46,00:30:50,It's called Driope or Driope Fascinated by Apollo.
00:30:50,00:30:54,"But during the sculpting process, the python tried to strangle the model that he got."
00:30:54,00:30:56,And he then had to shoot it.
00:30:56,00:30:57,"Oh, my God."
00:30:57,00:30:58,The python.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Yes.
00:30:59,00:31:00,Wow.
00:31:00,00:31:01,I know.
00:31:01,00:31:02,Do they have a paint portrait outtakes?
00:31:02,00:31:05,That would have been just a stunning.
00:31:05,00:31:06,It's interesting.
00:31:06,00:31:12,"The idea of his voice coming back from the death at his funeral, I find interesting."
00:31:12,00:31:16,Because he was one of the people who was very against spiritualism.
00:31:16,00:31:20,He used to sit on salances because Elizabeth was really into salances.
00:31:20,00:31:23,And this was the time where Arthur Conan Doyle was into it and so on.
00:31:23,00:31:24,And Houdini.
00:31:24,00:31:25,And Houdini was again.
00:31:25,00:31:26,Houdini was a skeptic.
00:31:26,00:31:27,He was a skeptic.
00:31:27,00:31:31,"They just sound like all the most famous people in the world where it sounds like you just go along to a normal sale,"
00:31:31,00:31:32,to hoping to speak to a relative.
00:31:32,00:31:37,"And then suddenly, Houdini stands up and Arthur Conan Doyle stands up to be a brownings there."
00:31:37,00:31:39,"Well, they were going for the rich people, weren't they?"
00:31:39,00:31:40,Yeah.
00:31:40,00:31:41,The mediums.
00:31:41,00:31:43,"Well, this was a very famous medium."
00:31:43,00:31:44,It was called Daniel Dungless.
00:31:44,00:31:45,Hume.
00:31:45,00:31:46,Daniel Dungless.
00:31:46,00:31:47,Daniel Dungless.
00:31:47,00:31:48,And Dungless wasn't.
00:31:48,00:31:50,He was Daniel Hume and he added Dungless.
00:31:50,00:31:51,And so.
00:31:51,00:31:57,"And it's so weird, isn't it, because it looks like it's a misprint of Dungless."
00:31:57,00:32:00,It really does.
00:32:00,00:32:03,"And he was, he was someone who was very famous back in the day."
00:32:03,00:32:05,And he used to do all these salances.
00:32:05,00:32:09,And one salancy did was with the brownings and they were sitting there.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"And he was really skeptical, Robert."
00:32:11,00:32:12,And Elizabeth was really into it.
00:32:12,00:32:20,"And Daniel Dungless suddenly said, your son who passed away who was very young is here with us."
00:32:20,00:32:23,"And there was an apparition that was, that was near them."
00:32:23,00:32:25,"And they were like, oh my god, this is amazing."
00:32:25,00:32:26,And it's so great.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"Browning went, this is not, this is not my son."
00:32:28,00:32:29,And he grabbed the apparition.
00:32:29,00:32:31,And it was Hume's naked foot.
00:32:31,00:32:33,That was hanging in the air.
00:32:33,00:32:34,Yeah.
00:32:34,00:32:37,Such a good story.
00:32:37,00:32:41,"It was a bare foot and then he was going, ooh."
00:32:41,00:32:43,Very embarrassing.
00:32:43,00:32:45,Literally put his foot in it.
00:32:45,00:32:49,"Wait, the thing was, he didn't have a son."
00:32:49,00:32:50,"No, he didn't have a son."
00:32:50,00:32:52,"Yeah, there was no dead son."
00:32:52,00:32:54,At least do your research as a medium.
00:32:54,00:32:56,Do the very basic research.
00:32:56,00:32:59,"If you're going to claim the dead sons come back, make sure there's a dead son."
00:32:59,00:33:02,"Yeah, especially when the people around the table are really famous."
00:33:02,00:33:05,And he could probably have just gone onto Wikipedia and check.
00:33:05,00:33:11,Every QI person's favourite poem by Robert Browning is Pippa Passes.
00:33:11,00:33:14,And that's because it contains the lines.
00:33:14,00:33:21,"Sing to the bats, sleek sisterhoods, full compliance with gallantry, then owls and bats, cows and twats,"
00:33:21,00:33:25,munks and nuns in a cloister's moods.
00:33:25,00:33:33,And this is because he thought that the word 'twat' was a kind of headdress worn by a nun.
00:33:33,00:33:39,"He had taken this from a 1660s satirical poem called Vanity of the Vanities,"
00:33:39,00:33:42,which says they talked of having a cardinal's hat.
00:33:42,00:33:45,They'd sent him a soon an old nun's twat.
00:33:45,00:33:49,"And he'd read that and thought, well, they could only be talking about a headdress."
00:33:49,00:33:51,It can't be anything else.
00:33:51,00:33:52,So it must be that.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"And he'd put it in his, imagine putting it in your own purse."
00:33:55,00:33:56,So good.
00:33:56,00:34:01,"And what's great is, we only reason we know that is the OED itself chased him up to say,"
00:34:01,00:34:05,do you have some sort of secret etymology about this that we don't know of?
00:34:05,00:34:08,"Nope, nope, just onto that."
00:34:08,00:34:11,"Did the OED tell him, you know what you've done here?"
00:34:11,00:34:14,"Well, they must have said we're approaching you because 'twat' doesn't mean that."
00:34:14,00:34:17,"Or they might have just said, we're interested in you all."
00:34:17,00:34:18,Yeah.
00:34:18,00:34:22,"Anyone who heard that poem, the very first time he read it out has gone to him."
00:34:22,00:34:27,"Robert, did you just say nun's twat?"
00:34:27,00:34:31,He doesn't need to wait for the OED to come over.
00:34:31,00:34:35,He's a laughingstock of the whole town.
00:34:35,00:34:38,"Oh, but for a while he would have been going through his town going,"
00:34:38,00:34:42,"Oh, lovely twat, because he pointed to a nun's head."
00:34:42,00:34:45,"It's so annoying, because it's such a good word for rhyming with things."
00:34:45,00:34:46,"Yeah, you're right."
00:34:46,00:34:47,Yeah.
00:34:47,00:34:48,"Oh, here's the poem."
00:34:48,00:34:50,"Oh, actually, you could have said hats."
00:34:50,00:34:51,There you go.
00:34:51,00:34:52,It would have worked.
00:34:52,00:34:54,The meaning would have been the same.
00:34:54,00:34:55,Perfect.
00:34:55,00:34:56,Robert.
00:34:56,00:35:01,"Apparently he's, well, I mean, so his poems at the time were known for being kind of impenetrable"
00:35:01,00:35:02,and impossible to understand.
00:35:02,00:35:06,"And, you know, really great poets read them and did not get what he was on about."
00:35:06,00:35:13,"So Tennyson said of his poem ""Saudello,"" which was an early one before he'd become a bit more accessible."
00:35:13,00:35:18,Tennyson said he only understood the first and last lines of the entire thing.
00:35:18,00:35:24,"The first line is, who will, as in who will read this, who will may hear Saudello's story told?"
00:35:24,00:35:28,"And the last line is, who would has read Saudello's story told?"
00:35:28,00:35:30,And the in between was nonsense.
00:35:30,00:35:34,"And then Henry James, another great author he would have thought would understand most things,"
00:35:34,00:35:39,"said he was comforted on hearing, browning, read his poems in a self to an audience that,"
00:35:39,00:35:43,"at least if you don't understand them, he apparently understands them even less."
00:35:43,00:35:44,Wow.
00:35:44,00:35:47,Henry James wrote some of the most complicated sentences in the whole of English literature.
00:35:47,00:35:50,"He's so hard to read, and if he didn't get browning."
00:35:50,00:35:54,"But browning's like, why did Henry James come up to me and call me a nuns?"
00:35:54,00:36:02,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski."
00:36:02,00:36:08,"My fact this week is that in 1948 in Idaho, left over World War II parachutes,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,were used to drop beavers out of airplanes.
00:36:11,00:36:13,For any particular reason?
00:36:13,00:36:14,"No, just one."
00:36:14,00:36:15,"Just, yeah, why not?"
00:36:15,00:36:16,"You know, you've got to do something."
00:36:16,00:36:21,"So this was post-war, and people were feeling kind of related in America,"
00:36:21,00:36:26,"because they won, and they started moving to this place in Idaho called Payette Lake,"
00:36:26,00:36:29,"near a place called McCool, and there were beavers there."
00:36:29,00:36:32,"And beavers get in the way of humans sometimes, because they sort of built dams,"
00:36:32,00:36:36,"they disrupt water flows, and they just change the surrounding environment."
00:36:36,00:36:38,So the people wanted them out.
00:36:38,00:36:42,"And there was this guy called Elmo Hater, who worked for Idaho."
00:36:42,00:36:46,"He really did not like Sesame Street, did he?"
00:36:46,00:36:52,"It was spelled differently, but he did have a problem with puppets."
00:36:52,00:36:56,"He worked for Idaho Fish and Game Association,"
00:36:56,00:36:59,"and he knew of a place called Chamberlain Basin, 200 miles away,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,which he thought perfect for beavers.
00:37:01,00:37:05,"And he also knew that World War II had just ended, and there were all these leftover parachutes."
00:37:05,00:37:08,"So he was like, let's marry the two."
00:37:08,00:37:09,Okay.
00:37:09,00:37:13,"And he did, well, he tried, he actually tried taking them to this place by horse and carriage"
00:37:13,00:37:17,"for a horse and cart, because there were no roads going between the two destinations."
00:37:17,00:37:20,And the horses hated the beavers.
00:37:20,00:37:23,"So apparently horses, if you put two beavers on their cart, they freak out."
00:37:23,00:37:24,Did you really?
00:37:24,00:37:25,His phrase about it.
00:37:25,00:37:26,No.
00:37:26,00:37:27,You write this gorgeous phrase.
00:37:27,00:37:30,He said horses and mules become spooky and quarrelsome when loaded
00:37:30,00:37:33,"with a struggling, odorous pair of live beavers."
00:37:33,00:37:35,Spooky and quarrelsome.
00:37:35,00:37:36,Spooky and quarrelsome.
00:37:36,00:37:37,So the horses didn't like the beavers.
00:37:37,00:37:38,Beavers didn't like the horses.
00:37:38,00:37:43,And so this guy dropped them in boxes into the forest and said.
00:37:43,00:37:44,Yeah.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Have you seen the footage of it?
00:37:45,00:37:46,Yes.
00:37:46,00:37:47,It's awesome.
00:37:47,00:37:48,Yeah.
00:37:48,00:37:50,"So this was only uncovered quite recently, right?"
00:37:50,00:37:52,So it was lost for a long time.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"It was footage, but no one knew where it was."
00:37:54,00:37:56,"It's been uncovered a few years back, I think."
00:37:56,00:38:00,"And you see the beaver being packed into this box, which is a sort of bite-proof box."
00:38:00,00:38:02,It's not locked down.
00:38:02,00:38:04,So the idea is that they're sort of holding it shut.
00:38:04,00:38:08,And the weight of heading towards the ground is what's holding it shut.
00:38:08,00:38:11,"As soon as they land, it can open up and the leaver can get out."
00:38:11,00:38:13,But they don't drop from a high height.
00:38:13,00:38:15,It's a really quick descent.
00:38:15,00:38:16,It's like only a hundred feet.
00:38:16,00:38:17,So it's really crazy.
00:38:17,00:38:18,Yeah.
00:38:18,00:38:20,Have no idea how they survive the impact.
00:38:20,00:38:21,"Well, they were very happy."
00:38:21,00:38:24,I think there were 76 that were dropped and 75 survived.
00:38:24,00:38:26,And it was because they tried it.
00:38:26,00:38:27,There was a set of story.
00:38:27,00:38:28,Oh.
00:38:28,00:38:29,Oh.
00:38:29,00:38:31,"That one, it was very sad."
00:38:31,00:38:32,That one somehow jumped up.
00:38:32,00:38:33,"Okay, open the lid of the box."
00:38:33,00:38:34,Open the lid.
00:38:34,00:38:35,Open the lid.
00:38:35,00:38:36,Yeah.
00:38:36,00:38:37,But they had one training beaver.
00:38:37,00:38:38,They did.
00:38:38,00:38:39,They called Geronimo.
00:38:39,00:38:40,And they would...
00:38:40,00:38:46,I think that Geronimo has the record for the beaver who's done the most parachute drops in the world.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"I think even if he'd only done it twice, that would be a record."
00:38:49,00:38:51,That's a lot for the most parachute drops from a beaver.
00:38:51,00:38:52,But he was this hard.
00:38:52,00:38:54,I'm not sure if you told him that now.
00:38:54,00:38:55,You mean I didn't have to do it.
00:38:55,00:38:57,There's under 350 times.
00:38:57,00:39:03,"In fact, I'd argue if Geronimo had only done it once, he would have had the jite record."
00:39:03,00:39:05,"Well, he was this old tough old male."
00:39:05,00:39:08,And they thought he's going to be a practice dummy.
00:39:08,00:39:10,They used dummies first and then they thought we need a live one.
00:39:10,00:39:12,"And every time he climbed out of the box, someone picked him up."
00:39:12,00:39:16,"And then eventually he got so used to it that as soon as they saw him approaching,"
00:39:16,00:39:18,he crawled back into the box of his own accord.
00:39:18,00:39:20,Ready for the next jump.
00:39:20,00:39:21,It's so sweet.
00:39:21,00:39:22,It's time for that.
00:39:22,00:39:24,"Beavers are cool, are they?"
00:39:24,00:39:25,So cool.
00:39:25,00:39:26,"Right, love beavers."
00:39:26,00:39:27,You love most about them.
00:39:27,00:39:31,"Well, one thing is this stuff I didn't know about called castorium."
00:39:31,00:39:33,I've been pronouncing that right.
00:39:33,00:39:34,"What, they're anal secretions."
00:39:34,00:39:37,"Where that says, what do you love most about beavers?"
00:39:37,00:39:38,They're anal secretions.
00:39:38,00:39:41,"So it's, right, let's just clear this up."
00:39:41,00:39:42,It's not anal.
00:39:42,00:39:43,Is it not?
00:39:43,00:39:44,It's not their anal.
00:39:44,00:39:46,It's just extremely near their anal.
00:39:46,00:39:48,Is it?
00:39:48,00:39:50,They have these glands.
00:39:50,00:39:54,"And if you lift up the tail, it's really close to the bum."
00:39:54,00:39:56,And it produces a kind of scent.
00:39:56,00:39:58,It's this kind of brown slime.
00:39:58,00:39:59,It's not feces.
00:39:59,00:40:01,It's just very near the feces.
00:40:01,00:40:03,But it smells heavenly.
00:40:03,00:40:06,"And there was a, it smells so good."
00:40:06,00:40:09,And it's a product of their diet of the bark and leaves.
00:40:09,00:40:11,And it's very hard to get hold of.
00:40:11,00:40:14,You have to knock a beaver out and then basically milk its anus.
00:40:14,00:40:16,"It's not the anal, it's not the anal."
00:40:16,00:40:18,"It's not the anal, it's not the anal."
00:40:18,00:40:20,"You're milking it wrong, no."
00:40:20,00:40:22,"No, it wasn't castar and beavers."
00:40:22,00:40:24,What's all the slime I've got?
00:40:24,00:40:26,"But it's, it used to be used to flavour vanilla."
00:40:26,00:40:28,It used to be a legitimate product.
00:40:28,00:40:32,"And it's, so NPR investigated whether it's still used."
00:40:32,00:40:35,"And it turns out that there is a snaps in Sweden, which does still use it."
00:40:35,00:40:36,Really?
00:40:36,00:40:39,"But it's so expensive to produce, because there's only a limited number of beavers."
00:40:39,00:40:43,And the global consumption these days is only about 132 kilos a year.
00:40:43,00:40:45,So what's your favourite thing about beavers?
00:40:45,00:40:47,"No, you've stolen the castorium thing."
00:40:47,00:40:49,This is a disaster.
00:40:49,00:40:51,My favourite thing is related.
00:40:51,00:40:55,It's the beaver myth that was pervasive for about over a thousand years.
00:40:55,00:41:01,"Which is that if you're hunting a beaver, it would bite off its testicles and throw them at you."
00:41:01,00:41:03,And then run away.
00:41:03,00:41:05,And people just used to think this.
00:41:05,00:41:06,Definitely a myth.
00:41:06,00:41:07,Do you know what?
00:41:07,00:41:10,I don't have any first-hand proof that it doesn't happen.
00:41:10,00:41:12,I think we assume it's a myth now.
00:41:12,00:41:16,This came up in a text called a physiologous in the second century AD.
00:41:16,00:41:21,"And it's based on the same thing, the castorium glands, which people thought were its testicles."
00:41:21,00:41:23,Because they look very similar to testicles.
00:41:23,00:41:29,And people used this delicious smelling fragrance as medicine and there's various other things.
00:41:29,00:41:32,I think women used to sniff it like snuff.
00:41:32,00:41:35,And so beavers knew this is the idea.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"And they were like, ""Well, this guy's hunting me. He only wants my testicles."""
00:41:38,00:41:41,So he'd bite them off and chuck them at the hunter.
00:41:41,00:41:43,And then the hunter would give up.
00:41:43,00:41:47,"And as the myth went, if the hunter continued chasing the beaver would turn around,"
00:41:47,00:41:50,display his antitestical area.
00:41:50,00:41:53,"And be like, ""Look, there's nothing for you here."""
00:41:53,00:41:54,That's really interesting.
00:41:54,00:42:02,Because I read an article that said that the 17th century beavers' testicles were used to cure toothache.
00:42:02,00:42:06,"And when minced, they added delicate flavour to tobacco."
00:42:06,00:42:08,"But now I realise it's not the testicles, is it?"
00:42:08,00:42:09,"Yeah, no."
00:42:09,00:42:10,It's these anal glands.
00:42:10,00:42:13,"It is. And I think the Algonquins, another American..."
00:42:13,00:42:16,"Native American tribes used to have it in tobacco, because it made it taste delicious."
00:42:16,00:42:18,"In fact, I believe they used to be..."
00:42:18,00:42:20,It used to be used to flavour camel cigarettes.
00:42:20,00:42:22,And a few other types of cigarettes.
00:42:22,00:42:23,I think they used to use castorium.
00:42:23,00:42:24,"Yeah, camels and winstens."
00:42:24,00:42:25,That was it.
00:42:25,00:42:26,Yeah.
00:42:26,00:42:28,Used to have beavers' accretia.
00:42:28,00:42:32,How many beavers would you have to knock out and milk to get this stuff?
00:42:32,00:42:33,It just is amazing.
00:42:33,00:42:35,"I mean, there must have been a lot of..."
00:42:35,00:42:36,I think there were a lot more back in the day.
00:42:36,00:42:39,I'm surprised they called it camels if you're getting the good stuff from the beavers.
00:42:39,00:42:40,"Yeah, that's true."
00:42:40,00:42:42,You've been sucking on a beaver.
00:42:42,00:42:45,"Damn, your favourite thing about beavers?"
00:42:45,00:42:47,"That's a Robert Browning poem, isn't it?"
00:42:47,00:42:48,Sucking on a beaver.
00:42:48,00:42:53,"Yeah, but he did think it was a lawyer's sleeve."
00:42:53,00:42:57,"Damn, favourite thing about beavers?"
00:42:57,00:43:01,I like that they have a second set of lips.
00:43:01,00:43:05,So they've got their normal lips just hanging out there in the front.
00:43:05,00:43:06,And they've got their teeth.
00:43:06,00:43:07,And then they've got another set of lips.
00:43:07,00:43:09,"Yeah, sitting right behind."
00:43:09,00:43:10,No.
00:43:10,00:43:15,"Yeah, and it's for when they've gone underwater and they've picked up a nice bit of wood."
00:43:15,00:43:16,And they're coming back up.
00:43:16,00:43:19,"So obviously they've got to bite into the wood, but you bite into the wood."
00:43:19,00:43:20,Your lips are open.
00:43:20,00:43:21,You're letting the water in.
00:43:21,00:43:22,Second set of lips.
00:43:22,00:43:24,You stop the water coming into your body.
00:43:24,00:43:25,It's a classic.
00:43:25,00:43:27,How much lipstick must they get through?
00:43:27,00:43:29,Hi there.
00:43:29,00:43:33,"Because do you remember in the bee series of QI, we were looking into beavers."
00:43:33,00:43:38,And we sent Molly Oldfield a good friend to look into what beavers lips look like.
00:43:38,00:43:40,And she went on to the internet and Googled it.
00:43:40,00:43:41,No.
00:43:41,00:43:47,And she suddenly was less innocent than she was at the start of the day.
00:43:47,00:43:50,Do you think base one and base two and base three and base four?
00:43:50,00:43:54,Do you think base one for beavers is snogging their first lips?
00:43:54,00:43:59,Base two is snogging their second lips.
00:43:59,00:44:03,And then I think you'd have two base threes as well.
00:44:03,00:44:06,Base three is she showed me her nuns head gear.
00:44:06,00:44:09,"Hang on, James."
00:44:09,00:44:11,What's your favourite thing about beavers?
00:44:11,00:44:12,I thought you'd never ask.
00:44:12,00:44:13,You've been asking all of us.
00:44:13,00:44:14,I know.
00:44:14,00:44:15,Let me think.
00:44:15,00:44:18,You must be so confident you have an obscure one that you allow three beavers.
00:44:18,00:44:19,I don't.
00:44:19,00:44:20,"Okay, what about this?"
00:44:20,00:44:23,"My favourite is the movie ""Zombievers""."
00:44:23,00:44:24,Of course.
00:44:24,00:44:25,"Yes, he's done it."
00:44:25,00:44:26,He's done it.
00:44:26,00:44:32,"Which I found on IMDb, which is about zombie beavers."
00:44:32,00:44:39,"What I like about it is they mentioned in the script about a Guiardia lamblier parasite,"
00:44:39,00:44:42,"which is actually, beavers actually have it."
00:44:42,00:44:46,And they used to think that it gave people something called beaver fever.
00:44:46,00:44:47,It might actually do it.
00:44:47,00:44:49,It can infect you.
00:44:49,00:44:54,"I saw a review of it that says, ""Zombievers is not a total wash and seen at night"
00:44:54,00:44:58,under the right combination of low expectations and controlled substances.
00:44:58,00:45:01,"It may even seem better than it really is."""
00:45:01,00:45:06,"And also, when I went onto IMDb, it said that people who like zombie beavers will also like"
00:45:06,00:45:12,"""Zombies"", which is when a strange virus quickly spreads through a safari park"
00:45:12,00:45:15,and turns all the zoo animals into zombies.
00:45:15,00:45:16,"Oh, zoo beavers."
00:45:16,00:45:17,"Oh, zoo beavers."
00:45:17,00:45:19,I thought it was going to be a zombie bee.
00:45:19,00:45:20,"Yeah, exactly."
00:45:20,00:45:25,"Well, actually, spoiler alert, at the end credits, after the end credits of Zombievers,"
00:45:25,00:45:29,there's a brief segment that shows a bee feeding on the corpse of a beaver
00:45:29,00:45:35,and the bee flies back to its hive and the implication is that it's become a Zombie.
00:45:35,00:45:36,Brilliant.
00:45:36,00:45:37,We were in a sequel.
00:45:37,00:45:38,That's so exciting.
00:45:38,00:45:39,Yeah.
00:45:39,00:45:40,The ruin film for me.
00:45:40,00:45:42,I won't watch it now.
00:45:42,00:45:43,It's my night ruined.
00:45:43,00:45:45,One other thing about beavers.
00:45:45,00:45:49,"For a beaver, the days in winter are longer than they are in the summer."
00:45:49,00:45:50,For a beaver.
00:45:50,00:45:51,What?
00:45:51,00:45:52,What?
00:45:52,00:45:53,They're nocturnal.
00:45:53,00:45:54,Is that it?
00:45:54,00:45:57,"Yes, they are nocturnal, but that's not why."
00:45:57,00:46:02,Imagine if James was just trying to make the idea of a nocturnal animal just sound really
00:46:02,00:46:03,exciting suddenly.
00:46:03,00:46:05,How can we rebrand this?
00:46:05,00:46:06,Repackage it.
00:46:06,00:46:12,"This is literal, as literally the days are longer in the winter."
00:46:12,00:46:18,And that is because they live underground in the dams in winter.
00:46:18,00:46:22,"And without any signals from nature, they don't know when the sun's going up and when the"
00:46:22,00:46:23,sun's going down.
00:46:23,00:46:29,And so their circadian rhythm changes and they end up living on 27-hour days in the winter
00:46:29,00:46:31,when they're living inside their dams.
00:46:31,00:46:34,"And then when they come up in the summer, they live on normal days because of the sun going"
00:46:34,00:46:35,up and down.
00:46:35,00:46:36,Wow.
00:46:36,00:46:37,Isn't that amazing?
00:46:37,00:46:44,"I cannot believe that given that, that Zombievers was your favourite thing about beavers."
00:46:44,00:46:48,"Okay, that's it."
00:46:48,00:46:49,That is all of our facts.

00:47:13,00:47:16,"We don't have upcoming tour dates, but we have a video of us on tour."

00:47:22,00:47:23,Goodbye.
00:47:23,00:47:36,"They've got married, and they had a son who they called Penn."
00:47:36,00:47:37,Yeah.
00:47:37,00:47:40,"He was actually called Robert as well, but they nicknamed him Penn, and that's all they"
00:47:40,00:47:41,called him.
00:47:41,00:47:44,He was called Vydeman or Weedeman.
00:47:44,00:47:45,Robert Weedeman.
00:47:45,00:47:46,Yeah.
00:47:46,00:47:48,But the reason they called him Penn is because he couldn't pronounce the word Weedeman.
00:47:48,00:47:52,"It's also called him Penn, because they did some tests and they found out he was mightier"
00:47:52,00:47:53,than a sword.
00:47:53,00:47:55,Are you going to keep that in?
00:47:55,00:47:56,Yeah.
00:47:56,00:47:57,Of course he is.
00:47:57,00:48:00,I don't know if that's real quick right now.
00:48:00,00:48:01,That's why I left the gap.
00:48:01,00:48:02,Sorry.
00:48:02,00:48:04,We could have left that hang.
00:48:04,00:48:05,"Well, I'll get."
