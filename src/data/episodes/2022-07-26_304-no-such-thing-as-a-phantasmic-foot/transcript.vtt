 [Bell]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Coburn, Garden.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Jizinski.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 My fact is that in Britain alone, unnecessary emails create nearly 24,000 tons of carbon every year.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Wow. Yeah.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 See, and you guys always give me crap for not replying to my emails.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I'm the most environmentally conscious of us.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 To be fair, Dan, the number of emails that you send, which are completely pointless, outweighs the fact that you don't send many.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Yeah, you're actually, we often don't get emails in reply to the important stuff from you, and then we'll be like, "Dan must be away from his computer."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 And then suddenly you'll be like, "Hey, guys, did you see this ridiculous meme? No one gives a shit about this."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Okay, I can't listen. I didn't like this.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 How has you not?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 I've just gone against what I was hoping I would be. So what this is, this is a calculation done by an energy company called OVO.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 And they looked at the carbon footprint of an email, basically.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 So the figures vary, but it varies between one gram and three or four grams. It's not very much.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 But they did also look at how many unnecessary emails are sent each day.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 For example, people writing back to just say, "Thanks." And sending that email through the system.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Is that unnecessary?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Well, it depends how good your manners are, I guess. But if we're agreeing that that's a sort of superfluous thing, then what they want us to do is to add a little signature to our door emails, saying something like, "This is a thanks in advance."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Now that sounds really passive to me.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 It's like, "Hey, Andy, can you please do your QI scripts by the end of the week, thanks in advance."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Sounds like I've said, "You better bloody hell do it."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Yeah.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 That's a really good point.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 It'll be better than what you normally so, which is you better bloody hell don't you.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 But the really cool thing about this research is that the men who advise them on this is a man called Mike Berners-Lee.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And you might know that surname. He's the brother of Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Yeah.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Can we just quickly go through how it does it?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 So is it carbon or carbon dioxide? Is it from big servers processing the information?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 It's from all these things. So it's from, for example, using electricity in the first place.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 The cost of running a computer network, the cost of keeping all the data on servers and travelling across the planet.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 So the whole thing, you know, using your computer while it's on to send us email.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 It's very hard to quantify, obviously, but there's a rough figure.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 And the calculations, they depend on how important that email is a little bit.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Because let's say I send an email back to Andy just saying, "Thanks, on low."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Now you don't spend much time reading it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 And so it means that it doesn't use up as much electricity.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And it's so it means that the carbon footprint is lower.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 So for instance, over 70% of emails are sent to spam.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 But they only use up 22% of your carbon footprint.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And that's because you hardly ever read them.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And they go straight into your junk folder and then get deleted.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 So it's like a one-way system.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 It's only the making of it that uses carbon.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Unless you're over the age of 78 and you're a woman living alone.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 It's just donated to a million phony charities so far.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 This Mike Berners-Lee has written a book about carbon footprints.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 And the amount of carbon used for lots of different things.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 It's called How Bad Are Bananas, the carbon footprint of everything.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And one thing that is bad as well as bananas was the 2010 World Cup,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 which he says cost was 2.8 million tons of CO2.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And to put that into perspective, it's the equivalent of every man, woman, and child in the UK having 20 cheeseburgers.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Oh, that's the same amount.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 In terms of obesity rates or anything.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 In terms of carbon usage.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Yeah, exactly. The amount of carbon.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Or 6,000 space shuttle flights.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Got football low cup.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 But it's a good well cup.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Right.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Don't be worth it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Mike writes a lot of articles online as well.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 So he has an article series that's called What's the Carbon Footprint of?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Dot, dot, dot.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 So it's things like the carbon footprint of, say, the Iraq war.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 He's looked at all the numbers and made an estimate.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And then this one's a bit of a guilty sort of, you don't need this really.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 The carbon footprint of the heart bypass operation.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 I don't think you need to be thinking about offsetting when you're on your way in.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 It's going to end up being too hard by passes, isn't it?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 If you wake up and they go, do you know how many flies you've ruined with that?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 There's 1.1 tons.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Wow.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Is that bad?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Yeah.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 It's not, it's not any carbon footprint. It's not great.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 It's all relative.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 It is a, you know, a lot of modern life.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 If you think about one email is one grab.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Right. Okay. That's good perspective.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Yeah. But if you, obviously, if you sent an email saying,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 can I book a heart bypass in, then that's only adding to the footprint.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Yeah.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 So here's one.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 If you have a BLT sandwich and you want to lower your carbon footprint,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 which one ingredient should you throw away the bacon?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Yeah.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Throw away the bacon.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 It's the tomato.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 The tea.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Whoa.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 It's the tea.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Okay. This is nuts.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Tomatoes require so much heating and lighting of greenhouses

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 that apparently their carbon footprint is higher than the bacon.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 No way.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Which I find extraordinary.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 No.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 But what if I just get my tomato from a very hot country, many, many miles away,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 and it just gets flown over by jet?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 That's a great pie.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Does it need to be greenhouse?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Is it a private jet that your tomato is being flown in?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Just one tomato.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Yeah. It's one small bunch.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 One little box.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 I mean, that I can't, that is amazing.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 I find extraordinary.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 There are a few sort of counterintuitive ones.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 I apparently, a New Zealand lamb.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 If you imported a New Zealand lamb to England to use,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 there's less carbon output than a British lamb because the rearing is so much more

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 that even if you include the shipping, the lamb is far less if it comes from New Zealand.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Really?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And it's not just because the natural climate requires less input.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Yeah, it must be just all the procedures that they're doing.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Because I would have thought that lambs are not that hard to read.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 They're one of the few things that the British climate is okay with rearing,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 but that's a particular common input.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Lamb and beef do have, they're the two highest meats with,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 although that's, I think that's total ecological impact, but a lot of that's carbon.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 But I'm amazed that the New Zealand lamb is somehow requiring less carbon.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 I mean, they send a lot less emails done they in New Zealand with the lambs.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 It's mostly just lesser writing for the lamb still.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Do you know what the third meat is?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 So the first beef.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Beef lamb.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Second is lamb.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Pork?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 I actually think the second is pork.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Okay.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 And this thing has a bigger carbon footprint than lamb.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Chicken.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 No, it's crustaceans.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 So I can't believe this.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 I always think crustaceans is such an ethical thing to eat in proportion to other meat,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 but they use a huge amount of fuel compared to other seafood.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 So most seafood has a carbon footprint, a bit like chicken,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 but shellfish is up there with beef in terms of its footprint.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 I'm so delighted.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 I only hate it, don't you?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 I hate eating crustaceans, but it's just because I'm a bit fatty.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 And now I can say it's because I want to save the environment.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Oh god, as if you didn't have enough moral high ground.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Do you know one thing that has an insanely high carbon footprint?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 One practice.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 I mean lots.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Having asthma.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Is that because you're breathing out lots of carbon dioxide all the time?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 It's not that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 It's not that.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Okay, again, I don't feel comfortable causing people with asthma to hyperventilate with guilt.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 I used to have asthma, and I don't have it anymore.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Is that an ecological position?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 No, but I did use to have it.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 I used to have those, you know, inhalers.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Yeah.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 And you know, they use a gas called hydroflora alcan, which is a propellant.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 That's what squirts the medicine out, you know, it's like a little gas cartridge.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Those inhalers account for 4% of the NHS greenhouse gas expenditure.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Those inhalers alone, 4%.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Isn't that massive?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 So if you replaced one in 10 of those inhalers, you would reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 58,000 tonnes.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 What can replace them with, do they have like eco ones?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 There are other ecological ones, which some people can have, I think, not everyone.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 But yeah, 58,000 tonnes, just to replace one in 10 of those, you would say.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Wow.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 That would say.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 The NHS actually had an incredible carbon mistake quite recently, didn't they?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 To speaking of them.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 So did you read about this?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 It had an email storm in 2016, where 186 million useless emails ended up being sent.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So this is, the history of email storms is so fun.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 So basically, this apparently is the industry term for when someone accidentally sends an email to a huge mailing list.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 And in this case, it was the IT guy who was sending a test email.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 He sent it to 1.2 million employees.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 And then they all replied all, saying, please unsubscribe me from this list.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And then there are other ones who replied all, saying, stop replying all, everyone, stop replying all.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 And eventually it ended up being 186 million emails.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 And I believe it took down the NHS mail system.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 There was a very funny quote from Spokesperson, the NHS digital Spokesperson, who said,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 some users have experienced short delays in the NHS mail system this morning, but the issue has been resolved.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 But she did have to dictate that over the phone because her email still wasn't working.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Wow, wow.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 So next time the NHS gives you shit about your heart by pass.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 2016, mate.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 There's a guy called Joey M.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 He's lives in Rhode Island.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 And he has the world record, most number of unread emails in his inbox.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Oh wait, can we guess?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Yeah.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 In the thousands.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 What?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 2000, I'm right.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 I'm pretty sure these two, that's me.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Okay.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 58 million.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Can I go, can I go ridiculous, say a billion?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 A billion.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 I can say a billion.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Four billion.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Wow!

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 294 million, 967,256.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And he evidenced it by uploading a video onto recordsetter.com, which allows you to,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 if you think you've done more keepy upies than anyone else, you can put a video on this site.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Yeah.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 And he showed it on his phone, just deleting one message to get down.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 So just over four billion.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Oh, what?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 But isn't that amazing?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 It's a lot of mailing lists.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Does he work for the NHS?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And there was a survey done by Adobe, quite recently, about emails that says 55% of people,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 whenever they get to zero inbox, say it's relieving, 22%, say it's amazing, and 10%, say it's impossible.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 And the only reason I bring up this survey is because they categorise people into boomers,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Gen X millennials and Gen Z, and they put millennials starting in 1977, which makes me a millennial.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Nice.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 So that's the other reason I bring up.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 As a long buildup to emphasise that you're a millennial.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 That was the price for the record.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 I was going to ask you about that skateboard you're holding.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 So just one weird bit of carbon news.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 So in 1981, Ronald Reagan made this speech, made this statement where he said,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 "Trees produce more pollution than automobiles."

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 So he said that, and people thought, "Well, that's very funny," and probably some idiots believed him,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 and he probably set the world back by about 100 years.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 But he said this, "But trees do emit greenhouse gases."

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 So they emit loads of methane, and we've only just discovered this.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 It was in 2014, there was this huge methane surplus in the atmosphere.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 People didn't know where it was coming from.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 And this woman went to the Amazon and tested its trees and figured out they were all pumping out methane.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 They're all farting.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 They're all farting.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 All farting, tree thoughts, and the atmosphere.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 But this isn't a problem, is it?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 It's definitely, definitely offset by the amount of CO2 that they're absorbing.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And so we don't want to get rid of the trees.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Guys, trees are good thumbs up, but it is a thing that we need to work out why they're doing it.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 And so it might be more in wetlands, which have a lot of methane within them that they're pumping out.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 So maybe we don't plant trees on big piles of methane, for instance.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Right.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Hey, remember we had that fact a long, long time ago about every tree.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 I think it's in Melbourne that has an email address.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Oh, that's a bit of a...

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Oh my god, they're really shooting themselves in the tree, aren't they?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Okay, it's time for fact number two.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 And that is James.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that hot dogs are called hot dogs because people used to think they contain dog.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And did they?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 No, don't think so.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 No, I don't think so.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 So this is something I read in the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 The word hot dog appears to be college slang from America in the late 19th century.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 And according to the OED, who cite the Oxford companion to food and drink and the historical dictionary of American slang.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 The reason people called them hot dogs is one, they were hot.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 And two, they had this weird meat that they didn't know where it quite came from.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 And it might as well come from dogs come from anywhere else.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Okay.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 In fact, I think that it could have been in there.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 So I got two into these three people called Gerald Leonard Cohen.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 And I'd buy, I don't think he's related, a Barry Poppig.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And David Shulman, who have devoted over 20 years of their life to working out the roof, the phrase hot dog.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And so they're into it.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And Gerald Leonard Cohen says that scandalous but true, some butchers even hired dog killers in the US who were going club some dogs and stuff them in sausages.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Even though it wasn't legit, he's found some instances of that and then they'd sell the carcass to the butcher.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 And yeah, I think what was 1884 that they started calling sausages dogs and then they added the hot in the 1890s.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 I read a bit about Gerald Leonard Cohen and Barry Poppig.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 They've written a 300 page book about the origin of the phrase hot dog.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 And he does this, he publishes his own journal which is called comments on etymology.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 The circulation is under 100, you have to write to him and send him money and he will then send you a copy of this thing.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 He wants wrote 167 page paper on just the word jazz.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 He is a serious etymologist.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 And he is, we should say, also a professor.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 So he's a professor for our languages at a university so he does make an income other than from these hundreds of writers.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 But he said, I think he was interviewed and he said, what else am I going to do with my time?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 I'm going to go skiing, I'll probably get hurt. So I guess I've got to just research hot dogs for her.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 I'm supposed to go skiing this weekend.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Well, I suggest you instead devote two decades to researching hot dogs origins.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 I reckon the first hot dogs must have been quite good actually because the phrase hot dog, which means like something which is really awesome,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 is only one year younger than the word hot dog meaning the food stuff.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 So they had hot dogs for one year and then people thought it was a word that meant this is great.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 That's Mickey Mouse's first words.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Yeah, he goes hot dogs.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 He plural, he pluralises it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 I'm so glad we've done this because I've always wondered in its wonderful life when the James Stewart character says hot dog.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And it's when it's something totally unregistered hot dogs has happened.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 What's the name of this? He said hot.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Some people were annoyed about it.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 So they started at one of the early sites.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 They were sold with Coney Island.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Is that New Jersey?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 No, it's New York.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 New York.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Sorry, it's Coney Island, New York.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 It was so annoyed by the association with hot dogs thinking they were a slightly lower class thing.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 That in 1913 the Chamber of Commerce passed a law forbidding the use of the phrase hot dog on signs.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Really?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 You weren't allowed to have a sign up saying hot dog.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 I think it was not because of the implication that there might be dog meat in them.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Slightly, yeah.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 What's that?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Did you want that?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 So we were in New York not too long ago and I went for a walk one day to Central Park and hot dog vendors everywhere along the roads.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 And I was just reading that in order to park their hot dog vending machines in these spots, do you know what they pay?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 The prices there.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 So just to, should we have a guess?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Yeah, just the American dollars just to be there.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Per year or a year, let's say.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 Per year.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Just to park there, I'm going to say it's probably in the region of $10,000 US dollars.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 I'm going to say about the same.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 15, let's say.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 15.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 I'd say they pay in kind and it's like 10 hot dogs a year.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 We lost it.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Okay, so there was one guy who was parked on Fifth Avenue, East 62nd Street, very near Central Park.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 289,500.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 No.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 For his annual, yeah.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 And that's, that is, he's got to get that to break even obviously because he's got to push and then everything is proper from there.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 But they all managed to do it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Yeah.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Because hot dogs in New York sell for $10,000.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Exactly.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 That is quite a lot of money.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Yeah, so on average, they have to pay the city $200,000 each year.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 I've never been to one of those stands and got a hot dog and I feel incredibly guilty that I've been driving these poor people out of business.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Do you know one thing that doesn't have to park that is associated with hot dogs?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Have you heard of the Weenemobile?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Oh, I have maybe half.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 I'm not sure.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 I've never been for a ride in the Weenemobile.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 I haven't.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Not a jack-up line.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 So, you know, Oscar Mayors, a big hot dog company, they have a fleet, a small fleet of Weenemobiles, which are cars shaped like hot dogs, which have been going since 1936.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Obviously, they've changed them, you know.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 But basically, they were a huge promotional thing.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 So they would hand out hot dogs, small hot dogs, from inside the big hot dog, because the cars shaped like a hot dog.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 And they would hand out things called Weenow whistles to children.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 So that if a child ever saw the Weenemobile, they would blow their whistle and attract other children to come and get a hot dog.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 And they would have a sort of an ice cream van.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 You're getting the kid to do the job for you.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 And they train their drivers at a place called Hot Dog High.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 And then, once you're in, like, Starfleet Academy for Hot Dog High, you drive around the country.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 It's mostly sort of students and things they hire.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And you drive in pairs, and one person has to drive, and the other one has to wave to people, which is called Riding Shot Bun.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Shot Bun?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Yeah, and sometimes they let you in, and they ask you to fasten your meat belt.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Wow, it's disgusting.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 I think someone's driving around, picking up children, and telling them to fasten their meat.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 It's a car-shaped, like a sausage.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 You're defenseless, guys.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 It's not looking good, mate.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Yeah.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 But he blew up my Weenow whistle.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 There's only ever been one accident involving a Weenemobile, and one of them rammed into a house.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Imagine that coming through the window.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Yeah, it'd be like a bad ring ram, as well.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Take the whole thing down.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Another famous Hot Dog company in America is Nathan's.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Okay.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 And that's a really good story about them.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 So there was another Hot Dog maker on Coney Island called Feltmans, and they were really, really huge and really, really popular.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 And they had what some people said was possibly the largest restaurant in the world, which just sold Hot Dogs.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 But then they had a guy who came to work for them, who was a Jewish immigrant from Poland called Nathan Handwerker.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And Nathan Handwerker was working just slightly, I'd be like, what are you laughing at?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 To work. Handwerker's a funny name.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Yeah, but he wasn't masturbating people.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 He was spending his week slicing buns.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Okay, so he sounds like masturbating people.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 He was working as a bun slicer.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 And then he decided, well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell my own company.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 And he needed to get some money together.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 So he lived entirely on Hot Dogs for a year.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 He had nothing but Hot Dogs, and he slept on the kitchen floor of this place.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 So he got all the money together.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And then eventually he started his own business and then undercut Feltmans by selling his Hot Dogs for half the price.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And became what's quite synonymous, as well as Oscar Meyers and as well as Feltmans, but kind of synonymous with Hot Dogs in America now.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Wow.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 But he didn't have to have quadruple heart bypass.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Oh my god, the carbon, carbon.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 So that's the big competition, isn't it, in America?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 They have Nathan, it's called Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 And the men's champion is a man called Joey Chestnut, who's won it nine times.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 His all-time record is eating 74 Hot Dogs and Buns in 10 minutes.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 That's 7.4 a minute, if my master's correct.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Yeah.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And there's such rivalry in the...

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 But you have to eat the buns as well, don't you?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 You have to eat the buns.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 What's he going to do with the buns? Otherwise you haven't eaten the hot dog eating the dog.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 No, that's not hot. It's not a bread.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 It's not a bread. Oh, the bread's keeping this dog warm.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 It's not like a blanket.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 I'm on the Atkins start. I'll just have the dog, please.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 But the previous champion was this guy called Takeru Kobayashi from Japan.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 And no one had ever eaten more than, I can't remember what it was, like 20 or something.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 And then he walked on stage in 2001, he ate 50.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 It completely revolutionized the sport and the art.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 But what was his thing? You know in the Fosbury flop.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 You changed the way that you jumped over, the high jump.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 So one was his training method.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 His training method was he would practice drinking three gallons of water in 90 seconds,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 meaning that his stomach got used to expanding very quickly.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Wow.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Can I say, I tried to do that once and was extreme.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Like, do not try that at home. Extremely sick.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Send us your videos of you not trying it at home.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Oh my goodness. I was just vomiting water for ages afterwards.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 And why did you rejoin to enter this competition?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 I was young and it was a bet.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 You're a millennial. That's the kind of crazy thing they do.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 So the other thing he did, he invented this method where you split each hot dog in two

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 and you force both ends in your mouth at once.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 Because your mouth is wide enough for two hot dogs.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 I cannot believe that I thought of that before.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 What? I don't understand.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 So you chop each hot dog in half half way along, so you've got the two ends.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And then you just shove both ends in your mouth at the same time.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And they called this the Solomon method, which is an illusion to King Solomon

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 because he wants threatened to split a baby in two in a biblical story.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 It is.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Yeah.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 And it's a very high brow contest, isn't it?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 So you get a lot of these biblical in-classical references.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Wow.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Two parents were arguing over who got custody of a baby and Solomon said,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 "Well, we'll cut the baby in two."

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 And then you guys get the whole thing in his mouth.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 No, no, you didn't. No one ate the baby.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Baby eating contest. It's in John, part one.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 What was that?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 One of the parents said, "Oh, that's fine by me.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 You're a good idea. Let's split the baby in two."

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 And the other one said, "No, don't do that."

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 And then King Solomon said, "We usually probably have the baby."

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Is that what happens?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 That's right.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 I think that's right.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Yeah.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 That's amazing, but so obvious.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 I would have split it.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 I don't want to claim that I would have won this competition,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 but I think it would have had a chance.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Because obviously you put it in half and shove it in both sides.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 I would say into three parts.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Well, I was just going to say, where do you stop?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Is it possible to cut into three, four, five, six or seven parts?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 How wide is your mouth?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Well, you're looking at me.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 The people at home don't have this option,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 but I don't think I could fit.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 In fact, I'm not sure I could fit, too, in mine.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 I'm not.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 No, I don't know.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 You're a two-man, three-max.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 I think there's a point at which there are diminishing returns

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 from cutting your hot dogs into an increasing number of pieces

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 before you put them in your mouth.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Still with a knife and fork on the first hot dog.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 I'll have the competition.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Those guys are going to feel so stupid as you cut it into the hundred pieces.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 I'm going to get this whole thing on my mouth.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Do you know that the Pentagon used to have a hot dog stand?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 There was a rumor, which they tour guides still tell to this day

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 when you get taken around Pentagon.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 It got taken down in 2006.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 But during the Cold War, apparently, the Russians were convinced

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 that some amazing stuff was going their secretive conversations

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 because people would meet there.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 So apparently, they had two missiles aimed at this hot dog stand

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 the entire time of the Cold War.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 And that was the rumor, no one's ever--

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Imagine if the missile hit.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 How many pieces those hot dogs could be in?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 You've got to stuff them all that you've got.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Still strategizing for the next tournament.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 And that is my fact.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 My fact this week is that the oldest recording we have of a poet

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 reading his own poem is of Robert Browning,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 who forgets the words to the poem halfway through

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 and ends the recording with an apology.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 That's amazing.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 So this was in April of 1889.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 There's only a few months before he died and Robert Browning--

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 I think he was at a party and it was being held by the artist Rudolf Lehman.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 And he had with him one of those Edison wax cylinder talking machines

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 and he got Robert Browning to recite his poem which was called

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 "How they brought the good news from Ghent to X. I."

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 No, it's X.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Yeah, like X number once.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Yeah.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Andy was just doing his allergy impression.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Hi.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Hi.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 Is it really?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Yeah, I did it.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 You should listen to it.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 I don't know why I memorized it when I was ten.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Did you?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 I did.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 I had to do it for a recital competition and I--

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Oh, this actual poem, the Browning.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Did you get through it without apologising?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 I did better than Browning did.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Wow.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 I got through it and then I was rereading it and I was so ashamed

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 at how little of it I could remember.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 I think they all I could remember is because it's such a good poem actually.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 It's done galloping.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 You never really know what the good news is.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 And it's got this great rhythm of horse.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 It's just galloping from Ghent to X.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 And all I remember is they galloped, galloped, we galloped all three.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 You know what?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 You're embarrassed that you couldn't remember much of it.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 I still think that's pretty impressive.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 I think you almost got further than Browning himself.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 That's right.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 No, you're right.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And the pace, when you listen to him speak it and this is online.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 So if you go on YouTube and put this in, anyone listening can actually hear the man himself.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 It does feel like it's an old western.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 It's got this fantastic pace to it.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 But he only gets to a few lines in and he suddenly says, I'm most terribly sorry that I can't remember my own verses.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 But then ads, but the one thing I will remember all my life,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 is this astonishing sensation produced upon me by your wonderful invention.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And then you hear people cheering for him in the background.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 It's a real politician's answer the way he says, I can't remember the poem.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 You specifically asked me to read, but one thing I can remember.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 It's an amazing pivot.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 It's incredible pivot.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Yeah.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 And so one nice thing about it was that there were a lot of people recording at the time.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 But supposedly he was one of the first notable people to pass away.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 So soon after the recording, and it was a year after he died when they had a memorial for him

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 that they played his voice at the memorial and they said it was like him coming back from the dead.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 It was this eerie thing that no one had ever experienced before.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 I think it was the first time that anyone's voice had been played or any more notable person anyway after they died,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 which that must have been pretty weird, right?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Yeah.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 That must have been weird.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 But also, it's kind of embarrassing.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 I say, please don't play the recording right, cocked up after I'm dead on my anniversary.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Yeah.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 It's true.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 It was pointing and laughing.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Some of his relatives did say it was embarrassing, but they played it.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Did they?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Not everyone was happy that it was there.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 The fans.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 It was at a browning society gathering in London.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 They were all huddled around this.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 They were societies.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 There were societies decades before he died.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Not maybe not decades, but certainly in the last decade before he died.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 There were people meeting up and he found that embarrassing.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Oh, everyone was so embarrassed all the time.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Because he was so popular, I think it was Westminster Abbey where his funeral was held.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 They got over a thousand applications and the dean of Westminster wrote saying,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 "Everyone has been trying to get into Browning's funeral.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 I've had to really limit it to people who had a really good reason to be there."

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Really?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Do you know?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Because he wasn't popular throughout most of his life.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 And then he did get very popular towards the end.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And all these people wanted to go to his funeral.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 And also, he sparked a fashion for dressing in Brown.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Did he?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 No.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 He did. Just after he died in America, he sparked a brief fashion for dressing up in Brown items of clothing.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 Just because he was called Browning.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 He didn't dress in Brown himself.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 No, it was just the name, yeah.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Wow.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 How did they do when Dickens died?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 A lot of arrests.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Do you have any more on that about how that came about?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 I know.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 I've only found it in one place.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 And sorry, it was before he died.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 It was 1979 to 1980 when he just released one of his very popular works.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 1979, wow.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 So that was just starting out there.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 It was 1879 to 1880 when he just released one of his popular works.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Wow.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 His romance with Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who he became husband and wife.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 And she was way more famous to start with than him.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 It was really interesting because he started as a correspondence.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 And she was housebound.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 And she was invalid.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 And her father was extremely strict about who she didn't didn't see.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Despite the fact she was also a famous poet, which I don't really understand.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 But he started writing to her and they started a passionate correspondence.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 And then they eloped and got married.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 And they had a son who they called Penn.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 He was actually called Robert as well.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 But they nicknamed him Penn.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 And that's all they called him.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 No, he was called Vydeman or Weedeman.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Robert Weedeman.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Yeah.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 But the reason they called him Penn is because he couldn't pronounce the word Weedeman as a baby.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 Well, that was a baby.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 We couldn't pronounce anything as a baby.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 They had massive arguments about how Penn should grow up.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Did you read about these?

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 No, no.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 So basically he wanted the child to grow up looking sort of very blokey, Victorian, you know,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 wearing trousers and having his hair cut short.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 And she wanted petticoats and shoulder length ringlets of hair.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 And she won, maybe because she was more famous or more authoritative.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 But basically until the child was 10, he wore petticoats.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 And then as soon as she died, when Penn was 10 years old,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Robert had the child's hair cut really short.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 So I'm pronouncing it differently.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 There was a big bone of contention between them.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 But he turned out quite different to what she would have wanted then because he,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 so he did have this quite fade upbringing.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 And he slept in her room until he was 12.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 And I thought, I thought, hang on, I thought Elizabeth Browning died when he was 10.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 And you're saying it was a really tragic last two years.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Really.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Very traumatising for him.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Well, I've gotten until he was 12.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Okay.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 So we'll fact check that.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 He ended up this real kind of, well, what is described in one of his biography,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 in one of Browning's biographies, as a beefy and berry middle-aged man in Nicarbockers

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 with a reputation for promiscuity.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 And also his home, his house was just a filthy pigstie.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 He had people around for parties.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 And so his house was nicknamed the Palazzo pigstie.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 The pigstie palace.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 And well, he was called Penn.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Yeah.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 It's like a pigpen.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 Penn's pigpen.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 So he was.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 He was a painter.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 But I think not a great one.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 And apparently, his contract for painting for a luxurious female nude

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 did not encourage sales in Victorian England.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Well, he was a sculptor, too.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Oh, was he?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Yeah, one of his very few sculpted works is of a woman communing with a python.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 And it's quite sexy.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 It's called Driope or Driope Fascinated by Apollo.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 But during the sculpting process, the python tried to strangle the model that he got.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 And he then had to shoot it.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 Oh, my God.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 The python.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Yes.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Wow.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 I know.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Do they have a paint portrait outtakes?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 That would have been just a stunning.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 It's interesting.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 The idea of his voice coming back from the death at his funeral, I find interesting.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Because he was one of the people who was very against spiritualism.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 He used to sit on salances because Elizabeth was really into salances.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 And this was the time where Arthur Conan Doyle was into it and so on.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And Houdini.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 And Houdini was again.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Houdini was a skeptic.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 He was a skeptic.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 They just sound like all the most famous people in the world where it sounds like you just go along to a normal sale,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 to hoping to speak to a relative.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 And then suddenly, Houdini stands up and Arthur Conan Doyle stands up to be a brownings there.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Well, they were going for the rich people, weren't they?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Yeah.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 The mediums.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Well, this was a very famous medium.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 It was called Daniel Dungless.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Hume.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Daniel Dungless.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Daniel Dungless.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 And Dungless wasn't.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 He was Daniel Hume and he added Dungless.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 And so.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 And it's so weird, isn't it, because it looks like it's a misprint of Dungless.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 It really does.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 And he was, he was someone who was very famous back in the day.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 And he used to do all these salances.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 And one salancy did was with the brownings and they were sitting there.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 And he was really skeptical, Robert.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And Elizabeth was really into it.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 And Daniel Dungless suddenly said, your son who passed away who was very young is here with us.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 And there was an apparition that was, that was near them.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 And they were like, oh my god, this is amazing.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And it's so great.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Browning went, this is not, this is not my son.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 And he grabbed the apparition.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 And it was Hume's naked foot.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 That was hanging in the air.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Yeah.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Such a good story.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 It was a bare foot and then he was going, ooh.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Very embarrassing.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Literally put his foot in it.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Wait, the thing was, he didn't have a son.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 No, he didn't have a son.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Yeah, there was no dead son.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 At least do your research as a medium.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Do the very basic research.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 If you're going to claim the dead sons come back, make sure there's a dead son.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Yeah, especially when the people around the table are really famous.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 And he could probably have just gone onto Wikipedia and check.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 Every QI person's favourite poem by Robert Browning is Pippa Passes.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 And that's because it contains the lines.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Sing to the bats, sleek sisterhoods, full compliance with gallantry, then owls and bats, cows and twats,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 munks and nuns in a cloister's moods.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 And this is because he thought that the word 'twat' was a kind of headdress worn by a nun.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 He had taken this from a 1660s satirical poem called Vanity of the Vanities,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 which says they talked of having a cardinal's hat.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 They'd sent him a soon an old nun's twat.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 And he'd read that and thought, well, they could only be talking about a headdress.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 It can't be anything else.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 So it must be that.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 And he'd put it in his, imagine putting it in your own purse.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 So good.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 And what's great is, we only reason we know that is the OED itself chased him up to say,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 do you have some sort of secret etymology about this that we don't know of?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Nope, nope, just onto that.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Did the OED tell him, you know what you've done here?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Well, they must have said we're approaching you because 'twat' doesn't mean that.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Or they might have just said, we're interested in you all.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 Yeah.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Anyone who heard that poem, the very first time he read it out has gone to him.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Robert, did you just say nun's twat?

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 He doesn't need to wait for the OED to come over.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 He's a laughingstock of the whole town.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Oh, but for a while he would have been going through his town going,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Oh, lovely twat, because he pointed to a nun's head.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 It's so annoying, because it's such a good word for rhyming with things.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Yeah, you're right.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Yeah.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Oh, here's the poem.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Oh, actually, you could have said hats.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 There you go.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 It would have worked.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 The meaning would have been the same.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Perfect.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Robert.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 Apparently he's, well, I mean, so his poems at the time were known for being kind of impenetrable

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 and impossible to understand.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 And, you know, really great poets read them and did not get what he was on about.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 So Tennyson said of his poem "Saudello," which was an early one before he'd become a bit more accessible.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Tennyson said he only understood the first and last lines of the entire thing.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 The first line is, who will, as in who will read this, who will may hear Saudello's story told?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 And the last line is, who would has read Saudello's story told?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 And the in between was nonsense.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 And then Henry James, another great author he would have thought would understand most things,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 said he was comforted on hearing, browning, read his poems in a self to an audience that,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 at least if you don't understand them, he apparently understands them even less.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Wow.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Henry James wrote some of the most complicated sentences in the whole of English literature.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 He's so hard to read, and if he didn't get browning.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 But browning's like, why did Henry James come up to me and call me a nuns?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 My fact this week is that in 1948 in Idaho, left over World War II parachutes,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 were used to drop beavers out of airplanes.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 For any particular reason?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 No, just one.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 Just, yeah, why not?

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 You know, you've got to do something.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 So this was post-war, and people were feeling kind of related in America,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 because they won, and they started moving to this place in Idaho called Payette Lake,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 near a place called McCool, and there were beavers there.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 And beavers get in the way of humans sometimes, because they sort of built dams,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 they disrupt water flows, and they just change the surrounding environment.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 So the people wanted them out.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 And there was this guy called Elmo Hater, who worked for Idaho.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 He really did not like Sesame Street, did he?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 It was spelled differently, but he did have a problem with puppets.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 He worked for Idaho Fish and Game Association,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 and he knew of a place called Chamberlain Basin, 200 miles away,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 which he thought perfect for beavers.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 And he also knew that World War II had just ended, and there were all these leftover parachutes.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 So he was like, let's marry the two.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Okay.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 And he did, well, he tried, he actually tried taking them to this place by horse and carriage

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 for a horse and cart, because there were no roads going between the two destinations.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 And the horses hated the beavers.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 So apparently horses, if you put two beavers on their cart, they freak out.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 Did you really?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 His phrase about it.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 No.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 You write this gorgeous phrase.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 He said horses and mules become spooky and quarrelsome when loaded

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 with a struggling, odorous pair of live beavers.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Spooky and quarrelsome.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Spooky and quarrelsome.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 So the horses didn't like the beavers.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 Beavers didn't like the horses.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 And so this guy dropped them in boxes into the forest and said.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 Yeah.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 Have you seen the footage of it?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Yes.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 It's awesome.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Yeah.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 So this was only uncovered quite recently, right?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 So it was lost for a long time.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 It was footage, but no one knew where it was.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 It's been uncovered a few years back, I think.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 And you see the beaver being packed into this box, which is a sort of bite-proof box.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 It's not locked down.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 So the idea is that they're sort of holding it shut.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 And the weight of heading towards the ground is what's holding it shut.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 As soon as they land, it can open up and the leaver can get out.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 But they don't drop from a high height.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 It's a really quick descent.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 It's like only a hundred feet.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 So it's really crazy.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Yeah.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Have no idea how they survive the impact.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Well, they were very happy.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 I think there were 76 that were dropped and 75 survived.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 And it was because they tried it.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 There was a set of story.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Oh.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Oh.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 That one, it was very sad.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 That one somehow jumped up.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Okay, open the lid of the box.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Open the lid.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Open the lid.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Yeah.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 But they had one training beaver.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 They did.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 They called Geronimo.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 And they would...

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 I think that Geronimo has the record for the beaver who's done the most parachute drops in the world.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 I think even if he'd only done it twice, that would be a record.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 That's a lot for the most parachute drops from a beaver.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 But he was this hard.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 I'm not sure if you told him that now.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 You mean I didn't have to do it.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 There's under 350 times.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 In fact, I'd argue if Geronimo had only done it once, he would have had the jite record.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 Well, he was this old tough old male.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 And they thought he's going to be a practice dummy.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 They used dummies first and then they thought we need a live one.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 And every time he climbed out of the box, someone picked him up.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 And then eventually he got so used to it that as soon as they saw him approaching,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 he crawled back into the box of his own accord.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 Ready for the next jump.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 It's so sweet.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 It's time for that.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Beavers are cool, are they?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 So cool.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Right, love beavers.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 You love most about them.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 Well, one thing is this stuff I didn't know about called castorium.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 I've been pronouncing that right.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 What, they're anal secretions.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 Where that says, what do you love most about beavers?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 They're anal secretions.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 So it's, right, let's just clear this up.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 It's not anal.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 Is it not?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 It's not their anal.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 It's just extremely near their anal.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 Is it?

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 They have these glands.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 And if you lift up the tail, it's really close to the bum.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 And it produces a kind of scent.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 It's this kind of brown slime.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 It's not feces.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 It's just very near the feces.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 But it smells heavenly.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 And there was a, it smells so good.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 And it's a product of their diet of the bark and leaves.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 And it's very hard to get hold of.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 You have to knock a beaver out and then basically milk its anus.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 It's not the anal, it's not the anal.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 It's not the anal, it's not the anal.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 You're milking it wrong, no.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 No, it wasn't castar and beavers.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 What's all the slime I've got?

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 But it's, it used to be used to flavour vanilla.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 It used to be a legitimate product.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 And it's, so NPR investigated whether it's still used.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 And it turns out that there is a snaps in Sweden, which does still use it.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Really?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 But it's so expensive to produce, because there's only a limited number of beavers.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 And the global consumption these days is only about 132 kilos a year.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 So what's your favourite thing about beavers?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 No, you've stolen the castorium thing.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 This is a disaster.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 My favourite thing is related.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 It's the beaver myth that was pervasive for about over a thousand years.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 Which is that if you're hunting a beaver, it would bite off its testicles and throw them at you.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 And then run away.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 And people just used to think this.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 Definitely a myth.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 Do you know what?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 I don't have any first-hand proof that it doesn't happen.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 I think we assume it's a myth now.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 This came up in a text called a physiologous in the second century AD.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 And it's based on the same thing, the castorium glands, which people thought were its testicles.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 Because they look very similar to testicles.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 And people used this delicious smelling fragrance as medicine and there's various other things.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 I think women used to sniff it like snuff.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 And so beavers knew this is the idea.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 And they were like, "Well, this guy's hunting me. He only wants my testicles."

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 So he'd bite them off and chuck them at the hunter.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 And then the hunter would give up.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 And as the myth went, if the hunter continued chasing the beaver would turn around,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 display his antitestical area.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 And be like, "Look, there's nothing for you here."

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 That's really interesting.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Because I read an article that said that the 17th century beavers' testicles were used to cure toothache.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 And when minced, they added delicate flavour to tobacco.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 But now I realise it's not the testicles, is it?

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Yeah, no.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 It's these anal glands.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 It is. And I think the Algonquins, another American...

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Native American tribes used to have it in tobacco, because it made it taste delicious.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 In fact, I believe they used to be...

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 It used to be used to flavour camel cigarettes.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 And a few other types of cigarettes.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 I think they used to use castorium.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 Yeah, camels and winstens.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 That was it.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Yeah.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Used to have beavers' accretia.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 How many beavers would you have to knock out and milk to get this stuff?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 It just is amazing.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 I mean, there must have been a lot of...

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 I think there were a lot more back in the day.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 I'm surprised they called it camels if you're getting the good stuff from the beavers.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 You've been sucking on a beaver.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 Damn, your favourite thing about beavers?

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 That's a Robert Browning poem, isn't it?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 Sucking on a beaver.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 Yeah, but he did think it was a lawyer's sleeve.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Damn, favourite thing about beavers?

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 I like that they have a second set of lips.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 So they've got their normal lips just hanging out there in the front.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 And they've got their teeth.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 And then they've got another set of lips.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 Yeah, sitting right behind.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 No.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 Yeah, and it's for when they've gone underwater and they've picked up a nice bit of wood.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 And they're coming back up.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 So obviously they've got to bite into the wood, but you bite into the wood.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Your lips are open.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 You're letting the water in.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 Second set of lips.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 You stop the water coming into your body.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 It's a classic.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 How much lipstick must they get through?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Hi there.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Because do you remember in the bee series of QI, we were looking into beavers.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 And we sent Molly Oldfield a good friend to look into what beavers lips look like.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 And she went on to the internet and Googled it.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 No.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 And she suddenly was less innocent than she was at the start of the day.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 Do you think base one and base two and base three and base four?

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 Do you think base one for beavers is snogging their first lips?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 Base two is snogging their second lips.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 And then I think you'd have two base threes as well.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 Base three is she showed me her nuns head gear.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 Hang on, James.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 What's your favourite thing about beavers?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 I thought you'd never ask.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 You've been asking all of us.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 I know.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 Let me think.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 You must be so confident you have an obscure one that you allow three beavers.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 I don't.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 Okay, what about this?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 My favourite is the movie "Zombievers".

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Of course.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Yes, he's done it.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 He's done it.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Which I found on IMDb, which is about zombie beavers.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 What I like about it is they mentioned in the script about a Guiardia lamblier parasite,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 which is actually, beavers actually have it.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 And they used to think that it gave people something called beaver fever.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 It might actually do it.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 It can infect you.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 I saw a review of it that says, "Zombievers is not a total wash and seen at night

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 under the right combination of low expectations and controlled substances.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 It may even seem better than it really is."

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 And also, when I went onto IMDb, it said that people who like zombie beavers will also like

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 "Zombies", which is when a strange virus quickly spreads through a safari park

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 and turns all the zoo animals into zombies.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Oh, zoo beavers.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 Oh, zoo beavers.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 I thought it was going to be a zombie bee.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Well, actually, spoiler alert, at the end credits, after the end credits of Zombievers,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 there's a brief segment that shows a bee feeding on the corpse of a beaver

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 and the bee flies back to its hive and the implication is that it's become a Zombie.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 Brilliant.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 We were in a sequel.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 That's so exciting.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 Yeah.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 The ruin film for me.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 I won't watch it now.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 It's my night ruined.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 One other thing about beavers.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 For a beaver, the days in winter are longer than they are in the summer.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 For a beaver.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 What?

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 What?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 They're nocturnal.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Is that it?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 Yes, they are nocturnal, but that's not why.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Imagine if James was just trying to make the idea of a nocturnal animal just sound really

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 exciting suddenly.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 How can we rebrand this?

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Repackage it.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 This is literal, as literally the days are longer in the winter.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 And that is because they live underground in the dams in winter.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 And without any signals from nature, they don't know when the sun's going up and when the

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 sun's going down.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.560
 And so their circadian rhythm changes and they end up living on 27-hour days in the winter

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.360
 when they're living inside their dams.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.480
 And then when they come up in the summer, they live on normal days because of the sun going

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.480
 up and down.

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.480
 Wow.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480
 Isn't that amazing?

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:44.480
 I cannot believe that given that, that Zombievers was your favourite thing about beavers.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.800
 Okay, that's it.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.800
 That is all of our facts.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.400
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.680

 We got everything up there from our previous episodes.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.800
 We don't have upcoming tour dates, but we have a video of us on tour.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.640
 If you want to see that, it's called Behind the Gills.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.640
 Do download that.

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.320
 We'll be back again next week.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.320
 We'll see you then.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.320
 Goodbye.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:36.120
 They've got married, and they had a son who they called Penn.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.120
 Yeah.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.240
 He was actually called Robert as well, but they nicknamed him Penn, and that's all they

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.240
 called him.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.400
 He was called Vydeman or Weedeman.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.400
 Robert Weedeman.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.400
 Yeah.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.400
 But the reason they called him Penn is because he couldn't pronounce the word Weedeman.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.240
 It's also called him Penn, because they did some tests and they found out he was mightier

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.240
 than a sword.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.680
 Are you going to keep that in?

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.680
 Yeah.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.680
 Of course he is.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.920
 I don't know if that's real quick right now.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.920
 That's why I left the gap.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.920
 Sorry.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.920
 We could have left that hang.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920
 Well, I'll get.
