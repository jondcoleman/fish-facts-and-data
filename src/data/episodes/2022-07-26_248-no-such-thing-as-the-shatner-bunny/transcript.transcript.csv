00:00:00,00:00:19,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this"
00:00:19,00:00:25,"week coming to you from our book of the year 2018 tour, live from the Union Chapel in London."""
00:00:25,00:00:42,"""My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anichesinski, Andrew Huntamari, and James"
00:00:42,00:00:46,"Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:46,00:00:51,"from the last seven days at a no particular order, here we go."
00:00:51,00:00:54,"Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week."
00:00:54,00:01:04,"My fact is, the world's oldest krill was nine years old and was called Alan, he was called"
00:01:04,00:01:05,Alan.
00:01:05,00:01:09,"He was a nine-year-old krill and Alan would have lived to have been older, but unfortunately"
00:01:09,00:01:13,during a routine cleaning of his tank he escaped and fell down a drain.
00:01:13,00:01:17,"So yeah, it's a shame because he possibly had many more years."
00:01:17,00:01:21,"Maybe he survived the drainfall as well, maybe like finding Nemo, like he might be out there."
00:01:21,00:01:26,"""He thinks Alan is a less good title."""
00:01:26,00:01:30,"He might be more than nine as well because when they caught him he was an adult, so he probably"
00:01:30,00:01:32,at least two more years on top of that.
00:01:32,00:01:37,"""What do you escape as a krill because mostly your water based aren't you, but presumably"
00:01:37,00:01:40,"he had to sort of struggle out along some surfaces."""
00:01:40,00:01:43,"""They were changing the tanks, so they were cleaning the water out, so it was in the process"
00:01:43,00:01:49,of taking the lid off and exchanging waters that Alan thought finally after nine years.
00:01:49,00:01:50,"It's my chance."""
00:01:50,00:01:53,"""Yeah, but unfortunately there was a drain right next to it."""
00:01:53,00:01:59,"""Well, he was kept in his own jar for all those nine years by guy called Tom Akeda who is"
00:01:59,00:02:02,like one of the best krill scientists in the world.
00:02:02,00:02:03,"I mean, you all know him."""
00:02:03,00:02:04,"""Yeah."""
00:02:04,00:02:09,"""Well, I mean, we are actually going to do 20 minutes about krill."""
00:02:09,00:02:13,"But they found out that he was this age, probably about 11, and that is about five times"
00:02:13,00:02:16,longer than any krill had been known to be alive in the past.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"""Wow."""
00:02:17,00:02:21,"That's how we found out that they might be this old, and actually that had huge repercussions"
00:02:21,00:02:26,for the krill farming industry and the world at last.
00:02:26,00:02:28,So there's an interesting thing about krill.
00:02:28,00:02:34,"So they are the biggest species on earth by biomass, biggest wild species on earth."
00:02:34,00:02:42,"So humans, all of us all together, weigh about 350 million tons, cows beat us."
00:02:42,00:02:43,They win.
00:02:43,00:02:50,"They're kind of domesticated, so, but krill, which are not domesticated, just you try,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,can't be done.
00:02:52,00:02:56,"Well, for nine years you can keep one in a jar, but you can imprison it, but you can never"
00:02:56,00:02:57,tame his soul.
00:02:57,00:03:03,"""Good old Alan, always free at heart, wasn't it?"""
00:03:03,00:03:09,"""Krill, all the krill in the world weigh 379 million tons, so they beat humans in a fight,"
00:03:09,00:03:14,"they would, yeah, it would be a weird old fight, I think we can all agree that."""
00:03:14,00:03:16,"And that's just one type of krill, right?"
00:03:16,00:03:19,That's just the Antarctic krill species.
00:03:19,00:03:23,"So they're the ones, often when people say krill, they're actually talking about Antarctic"
00:03:23,00:03:24,krill.
00:03:24,00:03:25,Bear that in mind.
00:03:25,00:03:30,"They're actually about 85 species, but yeah, Antarctic krill are outweighing us."
00:03:30,00:03:31,It's incredible.
00:03:31,00:03:34,"And also, they swim in these big swarms, right?"
00:03:34,00:03:38,"So they can be up to 20 kilometers, these swarms that you see in the ocean, and some"
00:03:38,00:03:41,are so big that they've been spotted from space.
00:03:41,00:03:47,"You can see some of the swarms, not some of the krill, no krill is bigger than about two"
00:03:47,00:03:48,and a half inches.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"Oh, so it's the swarms, okay?"
00:03:50,00:03:57,"Yeah, no, obviously the swarms, yeah, they're tiny, but they have they swim in these huge"
00:03:57,00:03:58,lumps.
00:03:58,00:04:01,"And most of them are doing that, aren't they?"
00:04:01,00:04:08,So I think basically the vast majority of your Antarctic krill are in five or six swarms
00:04:08,00:04:14,"around the Antarctic at any one time, about 70% of the biomass in the whole Antarctic region"
00:04:14,00:04:18,will be in these four or five or six big swarms of krill.
00:04:18,00:04:21,They love flocking together and we don't really know why they swarm together.
00:04:21,00:04:23,We can't tell why it's particularly useful.
00:04:23,00:04:26,"In fact, it's actively almost sometimes not useful, right?"
00:04:26,00:04:31,Because they're eaten by almost everything else that lives around them.
00:04:31,00:04:34,"And once they get together that, it just gives them a bigger meal on their plate."
00:04:34,00:04:35,I don't get it.
00:04:35,00:04:42,"Another exciting few decades for krill discoveries, because we've just absolutely just blown"
00:04:42,00:04:45,our minds with new information as the years have gone by.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"The age of Alan, the age of Alan."
00:04:47,00:04:48,It was also...
00:04:48,00:04:49,I call it the age of Alan actually.
00:04:49,00:04:50,"Oh, yes."
00:04:50,00:04:52,"In the krill world, that's what it's known as."
00:04:52,00:04:53,"Yes, you're right."
00:04:53,00:04:54,It's that period.
00:04:54,00:05:00,"And so Tom, Akeda, he was the person who also discovered that they could survive for"
00:05:00,00:05:02,over 200 days of starvation.
00:05:02,00:05:03,Wow.
00:05:03,00:05:04,"Yeah, I don't know if that was..."
00:05:04,00:05:05,Wow.
00:05:05,00:05:07,It's amazing to think about what krill do when they're hungry.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"Okay, this is so weird."
00:05:08,00:05:11,So they're repeatedly malt throughout their life.
00:05:11,00:05:14,They malt and then they grow a bit and then they malt again.
00:05:14,00:05:18,"But when they're not fed, they shrink after they malt."
00:05:18,00:05:19,And this is really rare.
00:05:19,00:05:21,"And animals that size, basically, nothing else does it."
00:05:21,00:05:26,"But the way you can tell how old a krill is, but after it's malted, is because their eyes"
00:05:26,00:05:28,stay the same size.
00:05:28,00:05:34,So you can tell how hungry a krill is by the ratio of its eye size to the length of the
00:05:34,00:05:35,rest of the krill.
00:05:35,00:05:37,So its eyes are literally bigger than its stomach?
00:05:37,00:05:38,Yes.
00:05:38,00:05:39,Oh.
00:05:39,00:05:40,Oh.
00:05:40,00:05:45,"And the molting thing that you just mentioned, they can malt when they're being attacked."
00:05:45,00:05:47,It's a defense mechanism of there.
00:05:47,00:05:53,"So if you're a predator coming up to a krill and you think you've got it, he's gone, and"
00:05:53,00:05:57,"he's just shed it, his exterior, and you're holding on to it, thinking, yes, this is going"
00:05:57,00:05:58,to be yummy.
00:05:58,00:05:59,And then you've just...
00:05:59,00:06:00,It's like I've got just the skin of you.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Imagine being able to do that.
00:06:01,00:06:02,And you're gone.
00:06:02,00:06:03,Imagine being able to do that.
00:06:03,00:06:05,"But also, is it yummy?"
00:06:05,00:06:06,Because actually...
00:06:06,00:06:10,I don't think you'll imagine being able to do that.
00:06:10,00:06:14,"So, I'm sorry, it's grabbed you in a pub fight."
00:06:14,00:06:15,Yeah.
00:06:15,00:06:16,It's designed taking a jacket off.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"Yeah, you're right."
00:06:17,00:06:20,"The game of rugby would be very bad in the krill world, wouldn't it?"
00:06:20,00:06:21,Yeah.
00:06:21,00:06:22,It would never be able to be tackled.
00:06:22,00:06:27,"All the players would end up about one foot high, because they repeatedly shed themselves."
00:06:27,00:06:31,Imagine going on a first date and finding out two hours later that she left in the first
00:06:31,00:06:34,course.
00:06:34,00:06:38,"This has been a great night, Carla."
00:06:38,00:06:39,"Sorry, Anna."
00:06:39,00:06:40,"No, it's okay."
00:06:40,00:06:42,I didn't take your question seriously enough.
00:06:42,00:06:46,And I don't think you feel better now that we'd sufficiently imagined it.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Yeah.
00:06:47,00:06:49,I think we're done now.
00:06:49,00:06:53,"So, another way to do that."
00:06:53,00:06:59,"You know, another superpower that krill have is that they can go through reverse puberty."
00:06:59,00:07:00,Reverse puberty.
00:07:00,00:07:01,"Oh, cool."
00:07:01,00:07:05,They can downsize and use their protein from their body as fuel.
00:07:05,00:07:09,So adults just malt repeatedly until they look like juveniles again and they lose all
00:07:09,00:07:11,their sexual characteristics.
00:07:11,00:07:12,Really?
00:07:12,00:07:13,Yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:17,"That's a bit traumatic for your partner, isn't it, when they wake up the next day."
00:07:17,00:07:24,"But if wrong krill superpowers, they have bioluminescence and really advance bioluminescence."
00:07:24,00:07:28,So you can basically use a krill as a torch.
00:07:28,00:07:31,And so bioluminescence is when you can create your own light using the bacteria that basically
00:07:31,00:07:36,"live in you and in krill, these bacteria live on their ice stalks and on their hips and"
00:07:36,00:07:38,in their genitals.
00:07:38,00:07:43,And they can control the light that these bacteria give off.
00:07:43,00:07:45,"So they have, literally, you have kind of a light switch."
00:07:45,00:07:50,And the way this works is that basically they control the amount of oxygen that gets to
00:07:50,00:07:51,them.
00:07:51,00:07:54,"So they have a switch in their sphincters, which, if they tighten it up, it will be-"
00:07:54,00:07:57,It will be a very convenient place to put a switch in.
00:07:57,00:08:00,You certainly don't want other people using it.
00:08:00,00:08:04,"But when they turn the switch on, they send a flood of oxygen to these bacteria and then"
00:08:04,00:08:06,"they light up like a torch, like a blue torch."
00:08:06,00:08:07,And you can.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"Like, it's amazing."
00:08:08,00:08:09,Yeah.
00:08:09,00:08:10,Can you?
00:08:10,00:08:11,I don't think you could.
00:08:11,00:08:17,"You probably don't have small enough fingers, but they can turn on their own light switches."
00:08:17,00:08:18,That's so cool.
00:08:18,00:08:22,"I also read that in the 1960s, scientists figured out that you could make them permanently"
00:08:22,00:08:24,glow by giving them LSD.
00:08:24,00:08:25,Wow.
00:08:25,00:08:31,What a decade it was for just giving LSD to different things.
00:08:31,00:08:35,And we need to move on soon.
00:08:35,00:08:36,But no.
00:08:36,00:08:37,More krill.
00:08:37,00:08:38,More krill.
00:08:38,00:08:41,So the krill.
00:08:41,00:08:46,"So krill have this enzyme, right, that no one else in the animal kingdom has."
00:08:46,00:08:50,"And also it's really hard for us to make in the lab, and no one's managed to do it yet."
00:08:50,00:08:53,And it seems like it might become really useful in the future.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"If we can farm krill, we might be able to use it."
00:08:55,00:08:59,And there's a load of patents in the US for things that it might be used for.
00:08:59,00:09:03,"And one of them in particular, I think it's a bit dubious, but they claim that they've"
00:09:03,00:09:09,"patented krill enzymes and that they can cure athlete's foot, foreskin infections."
00:09:09,00:09:12,Pop a krill under there.
00:09:12,00:09:16,"She'll be right, no worries."
00:09:16,00:09:23,"Iron infections, gum infections, herpes, acne, eczema, cancer, HIV, hemorrhoids, wrinkles,"
00:09:23,00:09:26,"reports, diarrhea, boldness and leprosy."
00:09:26,00:09:32,I'm stressed that this is all unproven at the moment.
00:09:32,00:09:36,"Well, also something you shouldn't believe about them that we've been told over the last"
00:09:36,00:09:40,year is that they can save us from the plastic disaster.
00:09:40,00:09:43,So it's quite well covered in a lot of newspapers at the start of this year that there's a krill
00:09:43,00:09:46,species that can digest plastic.
00:09:46,00:09:47,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:47,00:09:50,"So everyone, like headline said, could krill be the secret saviors of our plastic polluted"
00:09:50,00:09:51,seas?
00:09:51,00:09:53,"I'm practically no, they make it worse."
00:09:53,00:09:57,"So basically, they digest microplastics and all they're doing is turning them into little"
00:09:57,00:10:01,"nanoplastics, which are just even smaller, even more likely to be swallowed by other fish"
00:10:01,00:10:04,and even more likely to get into our own human tissue.
00:10:04,00:10:07,"But surely, if we make them small enough, the problem goes away."
00:10:07,00:10:09,It will never disappear.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"The answer is, the answer's never the magic krill, is it?"
00:10:11,00:10:16,"It's always using less plastic, which is, yeah, I'm afraid so."
00:10:16,00:10:18,We need to move on.
00:10:18,00:10:22,"If you guys didn't get a full fix of krill from that, just then, there is an amazing book,"
00:10:22,00:10:26,"which is where we know about this fact from our boss of QI, John Lloyd, actually found this"
00:10:26,00:10:27,fact.
00:10:27,00:10:29,So we should acknowledge his brilliant find.
00:10:29,00:10:34,"And it's called The Curious Life of Krill, it's a brilliant book, and so, yeah."
00:10:34,00:10:40,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski."
00:10:40,00:10:47,"Yes, my fact is that FDR used to hold cocktail parties during the war, where the only rule"
00:10:47,00:10:50,was don't mention the war.
00:10:50,00:10:57,"FDR, so President Roosevelt, the second president, Franklin Roosevelt, held these parties."
00:10:57,00:11:01,"He was the original Basil Faulty, basically."
00:11:01,00:11:05,"And I learned this is in a book called Leadership in Turbulent Times, it's by a woman called"
00:11:05,00:11:10,"Doris Goodwin, who I think is basically the presidential biographer and, you know, the"
00:11:10,00:11:13,leading White House historian of all time.
00:11:13,00:11:17,And she wrote a book about how President's unwind and how important it is as the president
00:11:17,00:11:18,to do that.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"And yeah, apparently he was very good at it."
00:11:19,00:11:23,"He used to host these parties every week, and they were a happy hour."
00:11:23,00:11:26,"He used to actually call them a children's hour, weirdly."
00:11:26,00:11:28,And he loved mixing martinis.
00:11:28,00:11:32,"Roosevelt was a huge martini fan, so he mixed the martinis himself, and the one provider"
00:11:32,00:11:34,"was, you can't talk about the war."
00:11:34,00:11:38,"And the only exception to that was Eleanor, his wife, because she was so serious-minded"
00:11:38,00:11:41,"and sincere that she had to talk about the war, all the bloody time."
00:11:41,00:11:44,But who did she talk to?
00:11:44,00:11:45,The war.
00:11:45,00:11:47,He just put her in a corner facing the war.
00:11:47,00:11:53,"You say that he was good at mixing and throwing these things, but I've read a lot of reports"
00:11:53,00:11:56,saying that he was terrible at making cocktails.
00:11:56,00:11:57,What's that?
00:11:57,00:11:58,"Yeah, people didn't like them at all."
00:11:58,00:12:00,He got experimental on them.
00:12:00,00:12:03,"He would throw just ingredients that he thought were interesting, so he would combine garnish"
00:12:03,00:12:07,"of olives with lemon peels, he'd be like, this is going to be great."
00:12:07,00:12:08,Sounds good.
00:12:08,00:12:11,"It sounds good, but he would just overdo it with too many ingredients."
00:12:11,00:12:15,So they famously know that there was a big supreme court justice who used to just walk over
00:12:15,00:12:20,"to a potted plant and pour his cocktail in every time, because they couldn't stand drinking"
00:12:20,00:12:21,these cocktails.
00:12:21,00:12:22,"Oh, really?"
00:12:22,00:12:25,"Yeah, but you're going to, obviously, not going to just say to the president of the United"
00:12:25,00:12:26,States of America.
00:12:26,00:12:27,This is a crack cocktail.
00:12:27,00:12:32,"The other thing he used to do was he used to get people quite tipsy, so he would get people"
00:12:32,00:12:36,maybe onto their third or fourth drink while he was still slowly nursing his first one.
00:12:36,00:12:38,So I think some people thought that wasn't really fair.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"Yeah, everyone hates that guy."
00:12:40,00:12:41,Does he have that guy?
00:12:41,00:12:42,I think he might have been.
00:12:42,00:12:44,He tried to do that to the entire nation.
00:12:44,00:12:48,"Well, but not all of us can drink as quickly as you as you as not really."
00:12:48,00:12:49,"Next to you, man."
00:12:49,00:12:50,We're all that guy.
00:12:50,00:12:54,It's very annoying when people fall behind.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"But yeah, he was responsible for prohibition, wasn't he?"
00:12:56,00:13:01,"Sorry, for stopping prohibition, because he was quite pro-alcohol."
00:13:01,00:13:03,And I was reading quite a funny thing about that.
00:13:03,00:13:08,"So April the 6th, apparently, in America is New Beer's Eve."
00:13:08,00:13:11,Are there any Americans here?
00:13:11,00:13:13,Have you heard of that?
00:13:13,00:13:14,Right.
00:13:14,00:13:15,"Well, you should be celebrating."
00:13:15,00:13:24,"So this is the night when at midnight in 1933, I want to say, '34'."
00:13:24,00:13:25,This prohibition was stopped.
00:13:25,00:13:30,I had no way I could edit that to make this thing.
00:13:30,00:13:34,Should have ridden that down.
00:13:34,00:13:42,"In 1933, in 1934, basically, he said the prohibition ends at midnight."
00:13:42,00:13:45,"At 1201, you can all start getting boost up again."
00:13:45,00:13:50,"And in Chicago, they realized that people on the East Coast were going to be allowed to drink"
00:13:50,00:13:53,"before they were, because they were a couple of hours behind."
00:13:53,00:13:57,"And so an Illinois House representative launched this whole massive campaign saying,"
00:13:57,00:14:02,'Chicago's clocks need to be moved permanently forward two hours to make sure that we can start drinking
00:14:02,00:14:04,at what would otherwise be 10 p.m.'
00:14:04,00:14:11,"And he kept on petitioning the local parliament, the local politicians, saying, 'We need to"
00:14:11,00:14:12,move the clocks forward.'
00:14:12,00:14:13,And they didn't.
00:14:13,00:14:15,Chicago did not agree to move this clock forward just so that he could get another two hours
00:14:15,00:14:16,of boozing.
00:14:16,00:14:17,That's shame.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"Roosevelt, on just things he did for fun, because he had a load of hobbies and he was a really"
00:14:21,00:14:22,interested guy.
00:14:22,00:14:28,"So he loved detective stories, and he thought of a plot for a detective story, but he wanted"
00:14:28,00:14:29,to involve other people in it.
00:14:29,00:14:34,"So he came up with this plan, he would get a lot of the best detective authors of the day,"
00:14:34,00:14:37,"he would give them all the plot, but the book was written as a round robin."
00:14:37,00:14:42,"So he wrote the first chapter and all the chapters ended on a cliffhanger, and then the next"
00:14:42,00:14:46,"author would write the next chapter, getting the hero out of trouble, but then by the end"
00:14:46,00:14:50,"of the chapter, he'd be in trouble again, and then that went on."
00:14:50,00:14:51,The whole book was like that.
00:14:51,00:14:53,And then the book ended on a cliffhanger.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Yeah.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Yeah.
00:14:55,00:14:56,It was finally finished about 30 years later.
00:14:56,00:14:57,Really?
00:14:57,00:14:58,Yeah.
00:14:58,00:15:00,I don't know how many of consequences it is.
00:15:00,00:15:01,"Yeah, exactly."
00:15:01,00:15:02,"And he was turned into a film, right?"
00:15:02,00:15:07,"The president's mystery story was turned into a film the year after, which apparently was"
00:15:07,00:15:09,a terrible film.
00:15:09,00:15:12,He liked collecting stamps.
00:15:12,00:15:16,"He did that before he was president, and then when he was president, he invented 200 new"
00:15:16,00:15:21,"stamps, so he could collect those as well."
00:15:21,00:15:22,That's so clever.
00:15:22,00:15:25,"No, it's cheating."
00:15:25,00:15:31,"He also, he is said to have coined, so someone's been looking into the phrase ""off the record,"""
00:15:31,00:15:35,and the earliest citation that this person was looking for found it to be from him.
00:15:35,00:15:41,"He was the first person to use it, and the citation was made in a newspaper that was publishing."
00:15:41,00:15:45,"It's actually very hard to find citations of the phrase ""off the record,"" isn't it?"
00:15:45,00:15:46,Yeah.
00:15:46,00:15:48,Exactly.
00:15:48,00:15:51,I think it's because he really drilled it home on his opening encounter with it.
00:15:51,00:16:03,"So North Carolina newspaper, ""The Daily Times,"" this is from November in 1932, 1932."
00:16:03,00:16:07,"It says he Roosevelt said that he was going to talk off the record, and that it was mighty"
00:16:07,00:16:10,nice to be able to talk off the record for a change.
00:16:10,00:16:15,They hoped to be able to talk off the record often in the future.
00:16:15,00:16:19,"And he told a couple of funny stories, and everyone laughed and cheered."
00:16:19,00:16:20,That's the news report.
00:16:20,00:16:22,It was supposedly the first time it's ever been used.
00:16:22,00:16:25,But then they put that on the record.
00:16:25,00:16:26,Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:32,"There's a website called Thrill List, which ranked 43 presidents by how much fun they were."
00:16:32,00:16:38,"So this was a couple of years ago, so it was everyone before Trump."
00:16:38,00:16:41,"Yeah, and yeah, anyway."
00:16:41,00:16:45,"So just interesting where people came on this, it was pretty arbitrary, but, you know,"
00:16:45,00:16:49,"Rutherford B. Hayes was the least fun president of all time, because not only did he not drink"
00:16:49,00:16:52,"himself, but he banned alcohol from the White House."
00:16:52,00:17:02,"His wife was known as Lemonade Lucy, then 42, 42 was James Polk, whose wife banned any dancing"
00:17:02,00:17:07,"in the White House, so you couldn't polk her under Polk."
00:17:07,00:17:10,She was probably so sick of hearing that joke.
00:17:10,00:17:11,Yeah.
00:17:11,00:17:12,Within a week.
00:17:12,00:17:15,The old ones are the best ones.
00:17:15,00:17:16,And then you've got various other presidents.
00:17:16,00:17:17,Harry Truman sounds fun.
00:17:17,00:17:21,He had a shot of bourbon at 5 a.m. every single day.
00:17:21,00:17:22,5 a.m.
00:17:22,00:17:23,Yeah.
00:17:23,00:17:24,Wow.
00:17:24,00:17:25,Three quickly followed by a massage.
00:17:25,00:17:29,Do you see?
00:17:29,00:17:34,"It sounds, it sounds less sweet now than when I wrote it down."
00:17:34,00:17:38,It makes him sound when we discuss it here in this context.
00:17:38,00:17:42,"He sounds like a real character, but if you actually did that in life, people would think"
00:17:42,00:17:43,you were a problem.
00:17:43,00:17:44,Yeah.
00:17:44,00:17:45,Yes.
00:17:45,00:17:46,And had one.
00:17:46,00:17:47,How do you know that people would think that?
00:17:47,00:17:53,My friends have said that it's an issue for other friends of hers.
00:17:53,00:17:57,"Someone who was the opposite of Lemonade Lucy, actually, was I think the best first lady"
00:17:57,00:17:58,of all time.
00:17:58,00:18:04,"And the person for whom the phrase first lady was first used, so this was Dolly Madison."
00:18:04,00:18:08,"So James Madison's wife, so this is between 1809 and 1817."
00:18:08,00:18:09,She was first lady.
00:18:09,00:18:14,"And she threw a massive house party in the White House every week, every Wednesday."
00:18:14,00:18:19,"And she called them a squeeze, and she'd have between three and five hundred guests every"
00:18:19,00:18:22,"single week, this house party."
00:18:22,00:18:26,And the whole purpose was to destroy the rancorous feeling between the politicians on
00:18:26,00:18:29,"different sides, between at that time the Federalists and the Republicans."
00:18:29,00:18:30,And it worked really well.
00:18:30,00:18:34,So there were various things that kind of got done because she had these big cocktail
00:18:34,00:18:35,parties where they started chatting.
00:18:35,00:18:40,"In fact, there was a plan to move the capital back to Philadelphia."
00:18:40,00:18:43,"And then she threw a cocktail party, and then everyone agreed not to do it."
00:18:43,00:18:46,That's why.
00:18:46,00:18:47,It's not.
00:18:47,00:18:52,"Lyndon B. Johnson used to love drinking a lot, and he used to have caused lots of nightmares"
00:18:52,00:18:55,for the secret services he were looking after him.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"He used to drink drive a lot, but on his own property."
00:18:58,00:19:01,"So not at the White House property, but his other place."
00:19:01,00:19:05,"And he used to drive, and he would have a whiskey in his hand."
00:19:05,00:19:10,"And what he would do is he would run out of the whiskey, and he would slow the car down,"
00:19:10,00:19:15,"down the window, and just hold his hand out, while a secret service member had to run up"
00:19:15,00:19:20,"behind the car, grab the glass, head back, refill it, and come back while his hand is still"
00:19:20,00:19:21,just waiting.
00:19:21,00:19:22,Still driving.
00:19:22,00:19:26,"He's still going along, just a bit slower, take it, and then zoom off again."
00:19:26,00:19:30,"You know your car's a crap, don't you, when you can get your member of staff to run alongside"
00:19:30,00:19:31,it?
00:19:31,00:19:32,Yeah.
00:19:32,00:19:34,Have you heard about how a little fun Benjamin Harrison was?
00:19:34,00:19:35,No.
00:19:35,00:19:36,A little fun.
00:19:36,00:19:37,So he's here at the bottom of the list.
00:19:37,00:19:38,He's not at the bottom of the list.
00:19:38,00:19:48,"He's a separate list entirely to the fun list, but he was president around the 1890s."
00:19:48,00:19:52,"First of all, making a thing."
00:19:52,00:19:53,All right.
00:19:53,00:19:59,"No, he was president in 1891, and for some years, I presume, I need the side of that."
00:19:59,00:20:04,And he was the first president to live in the White House when it had electricity.
00:20:04,00:20:08,"So this was a huge innovation at the time, and it was obviously one of the first buildings"
00:20:08,00:20:14,"in America to have electric lighting throughout it, but he and his wife were so scared of being"
00:20:14,00:20:19,electrocuted that they never even dared to touch the light switches that had been lavishly
00:20:19,00:20:20,installed.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"And to be fair, there was probably a much bigger risk than of being electrocuted, but there"
00:20:24,00:20:28,are stories that he and his wife sometimes went to sleep with the lights on because they
00:20:28,00:20:30,were so scared of turning the lights on.
00:20:30,00:20:31,They were being electrocuted.
00:20:31,00:20:34,Wasn't there something about the new Trump administration they couldn't find the light
00:20:34,00:20:35,switches or something?
00:20:35,00:20:40,"Steve, Steve Bannon, when he had, there was the cabinet room where they spoke, which was"
00:20:40,00:20:45,"just off somewhere in the White House, and no one could find the light switch, and it was"
00:20:45,00:20:49,"a very dark room, so they just had all the initial meetings in the dark because they didn't"
00:20:49,00:20:53,want to buckle and ask the Obama administration where the light switch was.
00:20:53,00:20:57,"And actually, the longer you leave it, the more embarrassing they'd get."
00:20:57,00:21:04,"Don't know, they were all in krill's fingers, didn't they?"
00:21:04,00:21:05,We need to move on shortly.
00:21:05,00:21:08,Am I just speaking of presidents who knew how to party?
00:21:08,00:21:14,Do you guys know about George Washington's farewell party from the military in 1787?
00:21:14,00:21:19,"So we've got a record of his bar tab, and this was a party that 55 people attended, including"
00:21:19,00:21:20,him.
00:21:20,00:21:25,"So it was him and a bunch of soldiers, and 55 people, they drank between them, 54 bottles"
00:21:25,00:21:32,"of Madera, 60 bottles of Claret, eight bottles of whiskey, 22 bottles of porter, eight of"
00:21:32,00:21:36,"hard cider, 12 of beer, and seven bowls of alcoholic punch."
00:21:36,00:21:37,Wow.
00:21:37,00:21:38,We've got the tab.
00:21:38,00:21:40,What were they doing with it?
00:21:40,00:21:44,"That's like they each had a full bottle of wine, and then all the rest of it."
00:21:44,00:21:46,And the full bottle of Madera?
00:21:46,00:21:47,"Yeah, exactly."
00:21:47,00:21:48,Mad.
00:21:48,00:21:53,"There was a president, Andrew Jackson, had to escape the White House when he threw a party"
00:21:53,00:21:57,"after his inauguration, because that got too wild with this kind of, let's get everyone."
00:21:57,00:22:00,"They got 20,000 citizens into the White House."
00:22:00,00:22:04,And it used to be that anyone who turned up to the inauguration was allowed into the White
00:22:04,00:22:07,"House, of course, in the Trump one they would all fit."
00:22:07,00:22:14,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:22:14,00:22:21,My fact is that the prop bed in the classic British comedy film Carry On Dick is worth £20
00:22:21,00:22:23,million.
00:22:23,00:22:28,And that's not just by people who like movie props and ones who buy them the Carry On films.
00:22:28,00:22:31,This is such a weird story.
00:22:31,00:22:38,"OK, so there's a bed that was used for a number of decades as a film prop, and it was bought"
00:22:38,00:22:43,"a few years ago at auction as a Victorian bed, and it was bought for about £2,000."
00:22:43,00:22:46,"And the guy who bought it looked at it, and he thought, after he bought it, he thought,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,"""Actually, I don't think it is a Victorian bed."
00:22:48,00:22:49,"It looks older."""
00:22:49,00:22:53,"So he called in a historian, historian called Jonathan Foyle, who's been investigating"
00:22:53,00:22:55,for some years now.
00:22:55,00:23:03,"Foyle has aged it, and it turns out that the bed dates back to 1486, and was the marriage"
00:23:03,00:23:08,bed of King Henry VII.
00:23:08,00:23:11,We think it's the bed that Henry VIII was conceived in.
00:23:11,00:23:19,"This is the only bit of royal tudor furniture left in the world, and it was used as a prop"
00:23:19,00:23:25,company in Carry On Day.
00:23:25,00:23:26,It's been an all of it.
00:23:26,00:23:28,It's been in Poirot.
00:23:28,00:23:30,It was in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice.
00:23:30,00:23:33,"It's got its own IMDB and chain, and it's..."
00:23:33,00:23:34,Yeah.
00:23:34,00:23:41,Can you imagine how low it must think it's sunk since being the reception bed of Henry VIII
00:23:41,00:23:48,"with Kenneth Williams lying, and that is like, ""I use to have Henry VII in me."""
00:23:48,00:23:52,Maggie from EastEnders making lewd jokes with fake breasts of you.
00:23:52,00:23:53,"I mean, that's horrible."
00:23:53,00:24:00,But do we need to start raiding the sets of classic comedies and EastEnders for cabinets
00:24:00,00:24:07,that Mrs. Brown's boys is home to price this ming porcelain.
00:24:07,00:24:11,"Actually the story of this bed goes even further because it was almost thrown away, wasn't"
00:24:11,00:24:12,it?
00:24:12,00:24:15,"It was part of the hotel, and they were selling it off to this auction house, but the"
00:24:15,00:24:20,builders that removed it from the hotel just left it on the side for trash.
00:24:20,00:24:21,Yeah.
00:24:21,00:24:22,"They left it in the car park, didn't they?"
00:24:22,00:24:23,"In the car park, yeah."
00:24:23,00:24:25,Which is quite cool because it means that that was found...
00:24:25,00:24:29,"That was Henry VII's bed, which was found in a car park, and of course, Richard III was"
00:24:29,00:24:31,found in a car park as well.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:32,00:24:34,"And those guys, they didn't like each other much."
00:24:34,00:24:35,No.
00:24:35,00:24:36,They took it to the end.
00:24:36,00:24:38,They've got one thing in common at least.
00:24:38,00:24:41,Do you think they're bonding over that now?
00:24:41,00:24:44,The car park kids in the corner in heaven.
00:24:44,00:24:45,Yeah.
00:24:45,00:24:46,So it's...
00:24:46,00:24:47,It's incredible.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"It's very, very weird."
00:24:48,00:24:49,It has this whole history.
00:24:49,00:24:53,"This historian Jonathan Foyle, who's been investigating it, he's made a film about it."
00:24:53,00:24:57,"If you look at his Twitter feed, there's a really good 40-minute documentary about this"
00:24:57,00:24:58,bed and I swear to goodness.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"When you finish the grill bark, yeah."
00:25:00,00:25:06,"It's really good, it's riveting."
00:25:06,00:25:08,So it ended up in this house.
00:25:08,00:25:11,"The house of Thomas Stanley, who was the Earl of Derby."
00:25:11,00:25:14,"And this was just after Henry VII, because if you were royal, you just had your"
00:25:14,00:25:18,"bed, your bed, sent ahead of you, if you go to stay somewhere, the bed will be disassembled"
00:25:18,00:25:19,and transported.
00:25:19,00:25:26,"But anyway, in 1842, this guy called George Shaw bought it and he didn't know what he had"
00:25:26,00:25:31,"either, because he was a fraudster and he ran a woodworking shop which made fake, too,"
00:25:31,00:25:32,defer nature.
00:25:32,00:25:33,No.
00:25:33,00:25:40,"And he made fake beds based on Henry VII's bed that was nearly identical, but knockoffs,"
00:25:40,00:25:42,"basically, and not quite as good."
00:25:42,00:25:46,"He made copies of it and then he would approach local aristocrats and he would say, ""I found"
00:25:46,00:25:51,your family's ancestral bed and he would slap on that family's coat of arms.
00:25:51,00:25:56,"He would put some polish on it to make it look old and he passed it off as for them, but"
00:25:56,00:26:00,"he could only do it so many times, because obviously, aristocrats talk to each other."
00:26:00,00:26:04,"And after a while, one of them would say, ""Oh, my family's ancestral bed was found recently"
00:26:04,00:26:05,"and I bought it."""
00:26:05,00:26:08,"Then someone else would say, ""Oh, that's what, so was mine."""
00:26:08,00:26:09,Yeah.
00:26:09,00:26:14,"And so, moving to the modern day of this bed, quite recently, they found out that it was"
00:26:14,00:26:18,"definitely chewed through DNA, and so they DNA tested this bed."
00:26:18,00:26:21,"I didn't think you could even do that, but it's the thing."
00:26:21,00:26:25,"So, a lot of people saw it and they thought maybe they looked at the grain of it and thought"
00:26:25,00:26:31,"maybe this has come from some more modern trees in America, but they said, ""No, no, it's"
00:26:31,00:26:36,"from European oak,"" and they could do a DNA test on it that could show that it was a European"
00:26:36,00:26:37,oak.
00:26:37,00:26:42,"Oh, that's really what it's Jeremy Kyle show that would be, you've just got two beds next"
00:26:42,00:26:43,to each other.
00:26:43,00:26:48,"That's the relief, because I thought you were going to say they DNA tested the Henry VII"
00:26:48,00:26:53,the Dracula or something and traced it all the way to one of the royal family and checked
00:26:53,00:26:54,it matched.
00:26:54,00:26:56,I don't know how they do these things.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Wow.
00:26:57,00:27:02,"This bed is very lucky, though, because most beds for royal families did not get used."
00:27:02,00:27:08,"So, monarchs, especially in the 16th, 17th, 18th centuries, had dozens and dozens of beds"
00:27:08,00:27:11,"and never slept in most of them, and this is because, basically, every member of the"
00:27:11,00:27:16,"ability thought and hoped and wished and prayed that the monarch would visit them, because"
00:27:16,00:27:20,"when, as a monarch, he went on a big tour of Britain, then you stayed with your noble friends,"
00:27:20,00:27:24,"and they always made sure they had a room for the king or queen, should they visit with"
00:27:24,00:27:25,a bed for the king or queen.
00:27:25,00:27:27,It's the best room in the house.
00:27:27,00:27:30,Nobody goes near it until the king visits.
00:27:30,00:27:33,"But, yeah, most of them didn't, so people spent enormous amounts of money."
00:27:33,00:27:39,"There was a Lord Scarsdale built an entire wing, I think, at Kedleston Hall, which no monarch"
00:27:39,00:27:43,"ever visited, just in case the monarch came to stay."
00:27:43,00:27:44,There was one really sad story.
00:27:44,00:27:50,"This is a place called Wilton House, and a really elaborate state bed was bought and built"
00:27:50,00:27:54,"there for King George III, just in case he visited."
00:27:54,00:27:59,"And he did, which was brilliant, this was in 1778, and he visited, and they showed him"
00:27:59,00:28:04,"to his room, and he said, ""That's great, I've actually brought my own sort of tent bed if"
00:28:04,00:28:08,"that's all right, so I'll just erect that on the floor next to this lovely prices bed"
00:28:08,00:28:09,"that you've spent years building."""
00:28:09,00:28:13,And he got his little zed bed out and sat on that instead.
00:28:13,00:28:17,"""Hey, just a bit of modern royal bed etiquette."
00:28:17,00:28:18,This is an interesting thing.
00:28:18,00:28:21,There is a modern royal bed habit.
00:28:21,00:28:25,It's about the queen these days in the royal family.
00:28:25,00:28:31,"This is from various newspaper websites, which I'm not sure accurate, but supposedly, it's"
00:28:31,00:28:35,considered rude to go to bed before the queen does.
00:28:35,00:28:40,"So she can keep everybody up all night because it's a breach of protocol, even in the family,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,"to say, ""I'm quite tired."
00:28:41,00:28:43,"I'm going to turn in now, Granny."""
00:28:43,00:28:44,Can't do it.
00:28:44,00:28:45,Wow.
00:28:45,00:28:46,"What time does she go to bed, do we know?"
00:28:46,00:28:47,Yeah.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"This is actually from William Heseltine, who was her private secretary, although I do honestly"
00:28:50,00:28:54,"think as soon as you work for the royal family, you go and just make up a load of crap"
00:28:54,00:28:55,for the press for fun.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"He said this, and he said she goes to bed at midnight."
00:28:58,00:29:01,Although I do like to think some nights she just forces herself to stay awake with three
00:29:01,00:29:06,"days running, just eyeing them all around the table."
00:29:06,00:29:10,Just to make Meghan look tired.
00:29:10,00:29:13,Apparently Diana couldn't hack it.
00:29:13,00:29:18,"Apparently Diana used to be a bit of an early knighter, and used to make her excuses and"
00:29:18,00:29:20,that really got her in the bad books.
00:29:20,00:29:21,Wow.
00:29:21,00:29:22,Yeah.
00:29:22,00:29:24,We should move on shortly to our next fact.
00:29:24,00:29:31,"On Royal Tudor Beds, they saw a lot of action, but they also saw a lot of kind of fake royal"
00:29:31,00:29:32,"action, didn't they?"
00:29:32,00:29:37,"So I'm not sure we've talked about very much about the bedding ceremony, which was basically"
00:29:37,00:29:41,"if you were a royal person and you married another royal, often from another country to"
00:29:41,00:29:46,"forge an alliance, you had to consummate that and everyone had to see it to make sure it"
00:29:46,00:29:47,happened.
00:29:47,00:29:49,"And often it was children, so then you couldn't really consummate."
00:29:49,00:29:51,They just sat in the bed together.
00:29:51,00:29:55,"And so it actually sounds kind of weirdly sweet, with William and Mary."
00:29:55,00:30:01,"They got the trove, and I think Mary was 10 and he was 14, and they had to like officially"
00:30:01,00:30:09,"consummate because then the forces are allied, but so all these spectators, dozens of people"
00:30:09,00:30:13,"thronged into the bedroom, and then they just sat in bed together for 45 minutes."
00:30:13,00:30:17,"Well, everyone hung out with them, and then they were, okay, all that's done, you're married"
00:30:17,00:30:18,now.
00:30:18,00:30:23,"And actually, something's what would happen is that one of the people wasn't there or wasn't"
00:30:23,00:30:28,"in the country, and they could nominate someone else to consummate the marriage with their partner."
00:30:28,00:30:29,Wow.
00:30:29,00:30:33,"And then they would have to, I think they had to have one leg on cloth or something like that."
00:30:33,00:30:34,Yes.
00:30:34,00:30:37,"I think that happened with Henry the seventh's wife, in fact, didn't it?"
00:30:37,00:30:40,"She had on her wedding night, because she was absent."
00:30:40,00:30:41,I think it was Henry the seventh's wife.
00:30:41,00:30:44,So maybe that wasn't his ejacula on the bed.
00:30:44,00:30:53,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, some prop stuff, you go through it."
00:30:53,00:30:59,"Oh, so I got sent this by Alex Bell, our colleague today, and he sent me an article about how they"
00:30:59,00:31:05,use very random things in sci-fi movies to make them look kind of futuristic.
00:31:05,00:31:09,"So in the corridors of the recent Star Trek film, and you can see the stills of this, it's"
00:31:09,00:31:14,"quite obvious when you know to look for it, the corridors aligned with Dyson Airblades."
00:31:14,00:31:19,The most futuristic technology on the planet.
00:31:19,00:31:26,The medical officers diagnosed patients using potato pealers in the old Star Trek.
00:31:26,00:31:35,"And in Star Wars, Qui Gong Gin, I don't know who that is, it's Qui Gong Chin, okay."
00:31:35,00:31:38,"As soon as I saw that round out, I thought, ""I don't know how to pronounce that,"" everyone"
00:31:38,00:31:42,"listened to this, ""doesn't know how to pronounce that."""
00:31:42,00:31:52,"Anyway, his communicator, his communicator is actually a Gillette Sensor Excel women's razor."
00:31:52,00:31:54,"Oh, cool."
00:31:54,00:32:01,"Well, in that sort of vein of things that you're not expecting to be props, in the movie ""Di-Hard,"""
00:32:01,00:32:05,"Bruce Willis, he goes barefooted for a lot of scenes."
00:32:05,00:32:07,He's not barefooted.
00:32:07,00:32:08,He's wearing fake feet.
00:32:08,00:32:09,No.
00:32:09,00:32:10,No way.
00:32:10,00:32:17,"He's wearing fake feet boots that are shaped to his skin colour with five toe, four toes"
00:32:17,00:32:19,"at a, at a, at a big toe."
00:32:19,00:32:20,"Um, that's right."
00:32:20,00:32:22,The foot thumb.
00:32:22,00:32:23,As we sometimes call it.
00:32:23,00:32:24,It's got a foot thumb.
00:32:24,00:32:25,"Oh, my God."
00:32:25,00:32:26,He's lost him.
00:32:26,00:32:27,He's lost him.
00:32:27,00:32:28,He's gone.
00:32:28,00:32:29,He's gone.
00:32:29,00:32:40,"Do you need to recite this little piggy, are you ready?"
00:32:40,00:32:46,"The same as wearing these fake, fake feet."
00:32:46,00:32:47,That's amazing.
00:32:47,00:32:48,Yes.
00:32:48,00:32:49,Why?
00:32:49,00:32:50,Was he embarrassed about his feet?
00:32:50,00:32:52,"No, it was in case an enemy grabbed him."
00:32:52,00:32:59,He could just lose the toe and leave the feet behind.
00:32:59,00:33:01,"That's actually the end of the movie, isn't it?"
00:33:01,00:33:04,And Hannah's grubber falls from the side.
00:33:04,00:33:08,It's with a fake foot in his hand as he drops.
00:33:08,00:33:13,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:33:13,00:33:18,"OK, my fact this week is that shops in the Philippines put their Christmas decorations"
00:33:18,00:33:21,up on the 1st of September.
00:33:21,00:33:27,"In total, they stay up for more than 35% of the year."
00:33:27,00:33:28,So cool.
00:33:28,00:33:32,"Do they all, even though they do this all the time, do they all whine about it every time they"
00:33:32,00:33:33,go up?
00:33:33,00:33:34,"Yes, too fucking early."
00:33:34,00:33:35,"They really don't, because they love it."
00:33:35,00:33:41,"And actually, just to go a bit further on that, in all the traditions in the Philippines,"
00:33:41,00:33:45,"Christmas would last until Candlemas, which is February the 2nd."
00:33:45,00:33:50,"And so in some places, they'll keep it up from the 1st of September to the 2nd of February,"
00:33:50,00:33:54,which means it's up 44.4% of the year.
00:33:54,00:33:55,Wow.
00:33:55,00:33:56,That's pretty good.
00:33:56,00:33:59,Good reason not to move to the Philippines.
00:33:59,00:34:04,"Indian-sipian fascism, slightly behind the insipian fascism."
00:34:04,00:34:09,"But yeah, so basically, people in the Philippines love Christmas."
00:34:09,00:34:12,It's one of the few Catholic countries in that part of the world.
00:34:12,00:34:17,"And they start their countdown 100 days before Christmas, so they count it down from 100."
00:34:17,00:34:21,"And that would be in the middle of September, but they've kind of evolved it into being"
00:34:21,00:34:26,"about the B.E.R. months, the burn months, so September, October, November, December."
00:34:26,00:34:30,"And now the way it does it is basically the 1st of September, that's when they all go up"
00:34:30,00:34:32,and they all stay up the whole time.
00:34:32,00:34:37,"So on Christmas getting earlier, this is a thing that a lot of people debate, don't they?"
00:34:37,00:34:41,"Some people say it gets earlier every year and some people say, no, it's, it can't get"
00:34:41,00:34:44,"earlier every year, because then it would be going way, way back."
00:34:44,00:34:47,But there is a way of tracking how early Christmas is.
00:34:47,00:34:51,"And this is by, this was done this year by The Washington Post, which is the Mariah Carey"
00:34:51,00:34:53,"song, all I want for Christmas is you."
00:34:53,00:35:00,"Okay, so came out in 1994 and The Washington Post analysed when it enters the charts each"
00:35:00,00:35:03,"year, because it does, it re-enters the charts every year."
00:35:03,00:35:08,And they found it's been getting popular slightly earlier in the holiday season.
00:35:08,00:35:09,Really?
00:35:09,00:35:12,"So Christmas music is definitely getting earlier each year, yeah."
00:35:12,00:35:17,"While people are just appreciating how great Mariah Carey is, we can all do that all year"
00:35:17,00:35:18,round.
00:35:18,00:35:22,"And the other way of doing that, of course, is by looking at internet searches."
00:35:22,00:35:27,So they did a study of looking about searches to things like Santa Claus or Elf or Presence.
00:35:27,00:35:34,"And they found that in 2008, people started searching for these things around October the"
00:35:34,00:35:35,12th.
00:35:35,00:35:42,"In 2009, it was on August the 30th and in 2012, it was August the 19th, people were looking"
00:35:42,00:35:43,for things like that.
00:35:43,00:35:47,"And then on the other hand, the other argument is that basically people have been saying this"
00:35:47,00:35:48,forever.
00:35:48,00:35:53,"And there have been examples of people saying, as early as in 1901, the Philadelphia inquire"
00:35:53,00:35:56,a complaint that it seems to get earlier every year.
00:35:56,00:35:58,"So that was happening way, way back that people had been complaining about."
00:35:58,00:36:05,"But was it just that in 1901, it was, you know, noon on the 24th of December?"
00:36:05,00:36:08,It was 1pm last year.
00:36:08,00:36:15,"In 1914, Adverts were appearing advertising to women to buy stuff for Christmas in August."
00:36:15,00:36:20,So it did go back and it was actually a really patriotic thing to do back in the day.
00:36:20,00:36:24,"So there was a campaign led by Florence Kelly, who people might have heard of."
00:36:24,00:36:28,"She was a big deal, a big campaigner at the turn of the century in America."
00:36:28,00:36:34,"She founded the NAACP, so like an association to help African Americans."
00:36:34,00:36:36,She was very big on workers' rights.
00:36:36,00:36:40,And she said quite rightly that the Christmas rush in the two weeks leading up to Christmas
00:36:40,00:36:44,"was very unfair on these poor, you know, enslaved workers in these big malls."
00:36:44,00:36:46,"So said, do your Christmas shopping early?"
00:36:46,00:36:51,"And these posters went up all over all the big cities of America and people were told, you"
00:36:51,00:36:54,"know, you've got to start Christmas shopping."
00:36:54,00:36:58,"And in fact, and that carried on after World War One, because then ironically all the big"
00:36:58,00:36:59,malls picked up on it.
00:36:59,00:37:02,"And we're like, yeah, we'd love it if people started shopping for Christmas in July."
00:37:02,00:37:03,Great.
00:37:03,00:37:09,"So I like this advert that was in The Washington Times in the 1920s, which said the headline"
00:37:09,00:37:17,"was, it was a little essay and the headline was, if Christmas came tomorrow, would you be ready?"
00:37:17,00:37:22,It is one of the few things that isn't just going to sneak up on you.
00:37:22,00:37:26,Christmas is going to be the same time every time.
00:37:26,00:37:29,Do you guys like holiday music?
00:37:29,00:37:30,Christmas music?
00:37:30,00:37:31,Yes.
00:37:31,00:37:32,I like Mariah Carey's song.
00:37:32,00:37:33,Sure.
00:37:33,00:37:34,Yeah.
00:37:34,00:37:35,"You're flesh and blood, James."
00:37:35,00:37:38,"Of course, you're like Mariah Carey's song."
00:37:38,00:37:41,So you go and did some polling about whether people like Christmas music.
00:37:41,00:37:42,"Oh, no."
00:37:42,00:37:43,Does it turn out they're all fascists if they do or something?
00:37:43,00:37:45,Because I don't say anything.
00:37:45,00:37:46,No.
00:37:46,00:37:47,It doesn't.
00:37:47,00:37:48,OK.
00:37:48,00:37:51,I think it's whether people like it in shops leading up to Christmas.
00:37:51,00:37:56,So 31% of respondents said they look forward to it a lot.
00:37:56,00:38:00,"An equal, roughly equal number said they like it some."
00:38:00,00:38:03,34% said not much or not at all.
00:38:03,00:38:11,"And then in 2011, there was a service set finding that 23% of Americans dread holiday music."
00:38:11,00:38:16,And 36% of respondents in one poll admitted to leaving a shop sooner because there was music
00:38:16,00:38:17,playing.
00:38:17,00:38:21,And I found my people.
00:38:21,00:38:25,We've actually got an exciting number of Christmas albums coming out this year.
00:38:25,00:38:26,I was looking inside.
00:38:26,00:38:27,I'm excited.
00:38:27,00:38:28,Yeah.
00:38:28,00:38:29,"Well, so since we talk Mariah Carey, it's the benchmark."
00:38:29,00:38:31,It's what every artist wants.
00:38:31,00:38:34,They want that big Christmas song that's just going to be played throughout the years.
00:38:34,00:38:37,So in the past Kylie Mino and everyone have done Christmas albums.
00:38:37,00:38:38,Obviously Michael Buble.
00:38:38,00:38:41,"This year, Jesse J is releasing a Christmas album."
00:38:41,00:38:44,Gwen Stefani is releasing a Christmas album.
00:38:44,00:38:46,And William Schattener is releasing a Christmas album.
00:38:46,00:38:47,Right.
00:38:47,00:38:49,And his one looks extraordinary.
00:38:49,00:38:51,Great list of songs.
00:38:51,00:38:52,He's calling it Schattener Clause.
00:38:52,00:38:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:55,00:38:58,"It doesn't sound quite close enough to Santa, does it?"
00:38:58,00:38:59,It's so.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"They gave up on that title, didn't they?"
00:39:01,00:39:02,Yeah.
00:39:02,00:39:07,"I've never thought about the sound of Schattener until he said, ""Schattener Clause."""
00:39:07,00:39:12,Schattener only reminds you of one other word and is not Santa.
00:39:12,00:39:14,Have you heard James Bras he been?
00:39:14,00:39:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:17,00:39:23,Don't forget to leave out a mince pie and some aluminum.
00:39:23,00:39:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:28,00:39:30,I was just reading about this.
00:39:30,00:39:32,"Everyone might know this, but I didn't know it."
00:39:32,00:39:34,There's a lot of shops in the last couple of years
00:39:34,00:39:39,that have started stocking Easter trees and Easter bobbles.
00:39:39,00:39:40,"Apparently, that's a thing, though."
00:39:40,00:39:42,That's an Easter tree.
00:39:42,00:39:42,No.
00:39:42,00:39:45,"Oh no, I've seen Easter crackers in the shops."
00:39:45,00:39:47,"Yeah, they're not playing Easter songs."
00:39:47,00:39:49,"They've not got the ""Shap the Bunny"" coming along."
00:39:49,00:39:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:55,00:39:57,Very shut-mus.
00:39:57,00:40:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:00,00:40:05,Oh my god.
00:40:05,00:40:06,That's very good.
00:40:06,00:40:09,"On Christmas decorations, so they've always been a big thing."
00:40:09,00:40:12,A big demonstration often is turning on the Christmas lights.
00:40:12,00:40:13,"In America, it's a big deal."
00:40:13,00:40:15,"Apparently, turning on the Christmas lights"
00:40:15,00:40:18,and the president traditionally turned them on.
00:40:18,00:40:22,"So Ronald Reagan, for instance, in 1983,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,thought he turned on the Christmas lights
00:40:24,00:40:27,"as big symbolic move, but he didn't."
00:40:27,00:40:28,He was tricked.
00:40:28,00:40:32,"So basically, they always do it from the ellipse park,"
00:40:32,00:40:33,which is apparently near the White House.
00:40:33,00:40:36,"It's about a kilometer away or something, a half a kilometer."
00:40:36,00:40:38,And the big tree is then all the lights go on from there.
00:40:38,00:40:40,There's this switch.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"And in 1983, there just been this assassination attempt"
00:40:42,00:40:43,on Ronald Reagan.
00:40:43,00:40:46,So the secret service were a little bit antsy
00:40:46,00:40:48,about having him exposed in public.
00:40:48,00:40:51,"And so they said to him, we'll put you on the White House steps"
00:40:51,00:40:53,and we'll rig it up so that there's this massive switch.
00:40:53,00:40:55,And there was a giant switch on the steps.
00:40:55,00:40:57,And you press it and then it'll turn on all the lights.
00:40:57,00:40:58,And it'll be amazing.
00:40:58,00:40:59,And he did that.
00:40:59,00:41:02,And I was reading this in a book by someone
00:41:02,00:41:04,who worked at the White House quite low down
00:41:04,00:41:07,who looked at this massive switch he was going to press
00:41:07,00:41:09,"and said to one of the other people working there,"
00:41:09,00:41:13,I can't see the wire where it connects up to the lights.
00:41:13,00:41:16,"And the other guy said, yeah, yeah, there isn't one."
00:41:16,00:41:17,Yeah.
00:41:17,00:41:20,It's just a big prop switch that Reagan's going to press.
00:41:20,00:41:22,And he'll think he's turned on the Christmas lights.
00:41:22,00:41:25,"And actually, I then immediately have to radio or phone my mate"
00:41:25,00:41:29,"who's in the park, who will then plug in the Christmas lights."
00:41:29,00:41:31,"And we do that with the nuclear button for Trump, please."
00:41:31,00:41:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:34,00:41:43,"If we just swap the nuclear switch for a krill's fincter,"
00:41:43,00:41:47,all he'll do is light up a tiny crustacean.
00:41:47,00:41:49,And his hands are small enough.
00:41:49,00:41:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:52,00:42:01,"OK, that's it."
00:42:01,00:42:02,That is all of our facts.
00:42:02,00:42:04,Thank you so much for listening.

00:42:18,00:42:20,"Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing."
00:42:20,00:42:21,We have a website as well.
00:42:21,00:42:22,NoSuchThing is a fish.com.
00:42:22,00:42:23,It's got everything.
00:42:23,00:42:24,It's got our previous episodes.
00:42:24,00:42:30,"It has a link to our new book, not relevant to you guys here."
00:42:30,00:42:32,And it has all of our previous episodes.
00:42:32,00:42:36,And we are about to give away the prequel to the latest book
00:42:36,00:42:38,to the best fact that has been sent to us
00:42:38,00:42:41,by one of the audience members here at the Union Chapel tonight.
00:42:41,00:42:42,"Anna, have you got the winner?"
00:42:42,00:42:43,Yes.
00:42:43,00:42:45,"I've written down your name, and I can't read my own writing."
00:42:45,00:42:49,I think it's Daniel Afusion.
00:42:49,00:42:51,Afusion?
00:42:51,00:42:52,Are you in?
00:42:52,00:42:54,"Are you in, Dan?"
00:42:54,00:42:55,Maybe.
00:42:55,00:42:56,Is that a note?
00:42:56,00:42:56,Left at the interval.
00:42:56,00:42:58,And there wasn't even an interval.
00:42:58,00:43:03,"All right, so if anyone wants to pretend to be Daniel,"
00:43:03,00:43:04,this is the fact.
00:43:04,00:43:06,And please come and claim your book at the end from us.
00:43:06,00:43:09,So just come up to the front of the queue and grab it.
00:43:09,00:43:11,"The fact is that the composer Rossini,"
00:43:11,00:43:13,"so the composer of the Barber of Seville,"
00:43:13,00:43:16,"was bald, but he didn't want to admit it."
00:43:16,00:43:20,"So what he did was, he had 10 wigs made of different lengths,"
00:43:20,00:43:22,which he changed every week.
00:43:22,00:43:24,"And then after 10 weeks, he'd announced"
00:43:24,00:43:26,he was booking a hair appointment.
00:43:26,00:43:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:27,00:43:28,That's what he got.
00:43:28,00:43:30,[APPLAUSE]
00:43:30,00:43:39,So Daniel--
00:43:39,00:43:40,Atkinson.
00:43:40,00:43:41,Atkinson.
00:43:41,00:43:43,That's a much more normal name than Afusion.
00:43:43,00:43:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:45,00:43:47,It's so obviously atkinson.
00:43:47,00:43:47,Now I look at it.
00:43:47,00:43:48,Atkinson.
00:43:48,00:43:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:51,00:43:52,"OK, that's it."
00:43:52,00:43:53,That is all of our facts.
00:43:53,00:43:54,We'll see you again.
00:43:54,00:43:55,Goodbye.
00:43:55,00:43:58,[APPLAUSE]
00:43:58,00:44:01,(audience cheering)
