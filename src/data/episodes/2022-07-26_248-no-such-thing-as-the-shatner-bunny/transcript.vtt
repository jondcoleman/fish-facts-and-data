00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.640
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.760
 week coming to you from our book of the year 2018 tour, live from the Union Chapel in London."

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:42.040
 "My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anichesinski, Andrew Huntamari, and James

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.480
 Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.840
 from the last seven days at a no particular order, here we go.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.560
 My fact is, the world's oldest krill was nine years old and was called Alan, he was called

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.560
 Alan.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.240
 He was a nine-year-old krill and Alan would have lived to have been older, but unfortunately

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.440
 during a routine cleaning of his tank he escaped and fell down a drain.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.640
 So yeah, it's a shame because he possibly had many more years.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.920
 Maybe he survived the drainfall as well, maybe like finding Nemo, like he might be out there.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.080
 "He thinks Alan is a less good title."

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.320
 He might be more than nine as well because when they caught him he was an adult, so he probably

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.680
 at least two more years on top of that.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.360
 "What do you escape as a krill because mostly your water based aren't you, but presumably

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.120
 he had to sort of struggle out along some surfaces."

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.960
 "They were changing the tanks, so they were cleaning the water out, so it was in the process

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.320
 of taking the lid off and exchanging waters that Alan thought finally after nine years.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.320
 It's my chance."

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.040
 "Yeah, but unfortunately there was a drain right next to it."

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.520
 "Well, he was kept in his own jar for all those nine years by guy called Tom Akeda who is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.160
 like one of the best krill scientists in the world.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160
 I mean, you all know him."

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 "Yeah."

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.560
 "Well, I mean, we are actually going to do 20 minutes about krill."

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.560
 But they found out that he was this age, probably about 11, and that is about five times

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.360
 longer than any krill had been known to be alive in the past.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360
 "Wow."

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.080
 That's how we found out that they might be this old, and actually that had huge repercussions

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.640
 for the krill farming industry and the world at last.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.160
 So there's an interesting thing about krill.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.600
 So they are the biggest species on earth by biomass, biggest wild species on earth.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:42.240
 So humans, all of us all together, weigh about 350 million tons, cows beat us.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.240
 They win.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.040
 They're kind of domesticated, so, but krill, which are not domesticated, just you try,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.520
 can't be done.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.520
 Well, for nine years you can keep one in a jar, but you can imprison it, but you can never

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520
 tame his soul.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.360
 "Good old Alan, always free at heart, wasn't it?"

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.520
 "Krill, all the krill in the world weigh 379 million tons, so they beat humans in a fight,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.720
 they would, yeah, it would be a weird old fight, I think we can all agree that."

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.520
 And that's just one type of krill, right?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.360
 That's just the Antarctic krill species.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.400
 So they're the ones, often when people say krill, they're actually talking about Antarctic

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.400
 krill.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400
 Bear that in mind.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.160
 They're actually about 85 species, but yeah, Antarctic krill are outweighing us.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.160
 It's incredible.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.120
 And also, they swim in these big swarms, right?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.320
 So they can be up to 20 kilometers, these swarms that you see in the ocean, and some

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.520
 are so big that they've been spotted from space.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.160
 You can see some of the swarms, not some of the krill, no krill is bigger than about two

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 and a half inches.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
 Oh, so it's the swarms, okay?

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.640
 Yeah, no, obviously the swarms, yeah, they're tiny, but they have they swim in these huge

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 lumps.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.440
 And most of them are doing that, aren't they?

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.120
 So I think basically the vast majority of your Antarctic krill are in five or six swarms

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.560
 around the Antarctic at any one time, about 70% of the biomass in the whole Antarctic region

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.600
 will be in these four or five or six big swarms of krill.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.680
 They love flocking together and we don't really know why they swarm together.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.560
 We can't tell why it's particularly useful.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.800
 In fact, it's actively almost sometimes not useful, right?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.360
 Because they're eaten by almost everything else that lives around them.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.560
 And once they get together that, it just gives them a bigger meal on their plate.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560
 I don't get it.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.760
 Another exciting few decades for krill discoveries, because we've just absolutely just blown

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.280
 our minds with new information as the years have gone by.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.280
 The age of Alan, the age of Alan.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280
 It was also...

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.800
 I call it the age of Alan actually.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 Oh, yes.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.320
 In the krill world, that's what it's known as.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320
 Yes, you're right.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320
 It's that period.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.040
 And so Tom, Akeda, he was the person who also discovered that they could survive for

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.280
 over 200 days of starvation.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280
 Wow.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.280
 Yeah, I don't know if that was...

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280
 Wow.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.080
 It's amazing to think about what krill do when they're hungry.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.080
 Okay, this is so weird.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.400
 So they're repeatedly malt throughout their life.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.280
 They malt and then they grow a bit and then they malt again.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.120
 But when they're not fed, they shrink after they malt.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 And this is really rare.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.560
 And animals that size, basically, nothing else does it.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.200
 But the way you can tell how old a krill is, but after it's malted, is because their eyes

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.000
 stay the same size.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.200
 So you can tell how hungry a krill is by the ratio of its eye size to the length of the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.200
 rest of the krill.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.760
 So its eyes are literally bigger than its stomach?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760
 Yes.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.760
 Oh.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.760
 Oh.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.440
 And the molting thing that you just mentioned, they can malt when they're being attacked.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.720
 It's a defense mechanism of there.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.040
 So if you're a predator coming up to a krill and you think you've got it, he's gone, and

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.920
 he's just shed it, his exterior, and you're holding on to it, thinking, yes, this is going

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.920
 to be yummy.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.920
 And then you've just...

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920
 It's like I've got just the skin of you.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920
 Imagine being able to do that.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920
 And you're gone.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.920
 Imagine being able to do that.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.680
 But also, is it yummy?

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.680
 Because actually...

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.160
 I don't think you'll imagine being able to do that.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.040
 So, I'm sorry, it's grabbed you in a pub fight.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040
 Yeah.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.800
 It's designed taking a jacket off.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800
 Yeah, you're right.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.960
 The game of rugby would be very bad in the krill world, wouldn't it?

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960
 Yeah.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.960
 It would never be able to be tackled.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.560
 All the players would end up about one foot high, because they repeatedly shed themselves.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.880
 Imagine going on a first date and finding out two hours later that she left in the first

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.320
 course.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.760
 This has been a great night, Carla.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760
 Sorry, Anna.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760
 No, it's okay.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.760
 I didn't take your question seriously enough.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.720
 And I don't think you feel better now that we'd sufficiently imagined it.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
 Yeah.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.720
 I think we're done now.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.280
 So, another way to do that.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.240
 You know, another superpower that krill have is that they can go through reverse puberty.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240
 Reverse puberty.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
 Oh, cool.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.640
 They can downsize and use their protein from their body as fuel.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.360
 So adults just malt repeatedly until they look like juveniles again and they lose all

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.360
 their sexual characteristics.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.360
 Really?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.360
 Yeah.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.520
 That's a bit traumatic for your partner, isn't it, when they wake up the next day.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:24.840
 But if wrong krill superpowers, they have bioluminescence and really advance bioluminescence.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.080
 So you can basically use a krill as a torch.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.960
 And so bioluminescence is when you can create your own light using the bacteria that basically

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.640
 live in you and in krill, these bacteria live on their ice stalks and on their hips and

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.320
 in their genitals.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.040
 And they can control the light that these bacteria give off.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.720
 So they have, literally, you have kind of a light switch.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.120
 And the way this works is that basically they control the amount of oxygen that gets to

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.120
 them.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.920
 So they have a switch in their sphincters, which, if they tighten it up, it will be-

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.120
 It will be a very convenient place to put a switch in.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.400
 You certainly don't want other people using it.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.560
 But when they turn the switch on, they send a flood of oxygen to these bacteria and then

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.960
 they light up like a torch, like a blue torch.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960
 And you can.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960
 Like, it's amazing.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 Yeah.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960
 Can you?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960
 I don't think you could.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.600
 You probably don't have small enough fingers, but they can turn on their own light switches.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 That's so cool.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.880
 I also read that in the 1960s, scientists figured out that you could make them permanently

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.800
 glow by giving them LSD.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 Wow.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.800
 What a decade it was for just giving LSD to different things.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.200
 And we need to move on soon.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.200
 But no.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200
 More krill.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200
 More krill.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.680
 So the krill.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.280
 So krill have this enzyme, right, that no one else in the animal kingdom has.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.360
 And also it's really hard for us to make in the lab, and no one's managed to do it yet.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.120
 And it seems like it might become really useful in the future.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.200
 If we can farm krill, we might be able to use it.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.200
 And there's a load of patents in the US for things that it might be used for.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.200
 And one of them in particular, I think it's a bit dubious, but they claim that they've

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.560
 patented krill enzymes and that they can cure athlete's foot, foreskin infections.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.360
 Pop a krill under there.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.120
 She'll be right, no worries.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:23.640
 Iron infections, gum infections, herpes, acne, eczema, cancer, HIV, hemorrhoids, wrinkles,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.640
 reports, diarrhea, boldness and leprosy.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.160
 I'm stressed that this is all unproven at the moment.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.480
 Well, also something you shouldn't believe about them that we've been told over the last

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.000
 year is that they can save us from the plastic disaster.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.680
 So it's quite well covered in a lot of newspapers at the start of this year that there's a krill

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.440
 species that can digest plastic.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.240
 So everyone, like headline said, could krill be the secret saviors of our plastic polluted

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.240
 seas?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.800
 I'm practically no, they make it worse.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.240
 So basically, they digest microplastics and all they're doing is turning them into little

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.560
 nanoplastics, which are just even smaller, even more likely to be swallowed by other fish

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.080
 and even more likely to get into our own human tissue.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.800
 But surely, if we make them small enough, the problem goes away.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.080
 It will never disappear.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.640
 The answer is, the answer's never the magic krill, is it?

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.480
 It's always using less plastic, which is, yeah, I'm afraid so.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.000
 We need to move on.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.760
 If you guys didn't get a full fix of krill from that, just then, there is an amazing book,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.800
 which is where we know about this fact from our boss of QI, John Lloyd, actually found this

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800
 fact.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.760
 So we should acknowledge his brilliant find.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.600
 And it's called The Curious Life of Krill, it's a brilliant book, and so, yeah.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.880
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:47.040
 Yes, my fact is that FDR used to hold cocktail parties during the war, where the only rule

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.480
 was don't mention the war.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:57.760
 FDR, so President Roosevelt, the second president, Franklin Roosevelt, held these parties.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.440
 He was the original Basil Faulty, basically.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.320
 And I learned this is in a book called Leadership in Turbulent Times, it's by a woman called

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.880
 Doris Goodwin, who I think is basically the presidential biographer and, you know, the

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.320
 leading White House historian of all time.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.520
 And she wrote a book about how President's unwind and how important it is as the president

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.520
 to do that.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.640
 And yeah, apparently he was very good at it.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.440
 He used to host these parties every week, and they were a happy hour.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.640
 He used to actually call them a children's hour, weirdly.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.040
 And he loved mixing martinis.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.200
 Roosevelt was a huge martini fan, so he mixed the martinis himself, and the one provider

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.400
 was, you can't talk about the war.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.040
 And the only exception to that was Eleanor, his wife, because she was so serious-minded

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.320
 and sincere that she had to talk about the war, all the bloody time.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.040
 But who did she talk to?

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.040
 The war.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.520
 He just put her in a corner facing the war.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.720
 You say that he was good at mixing and throwing these things, but I've read a lot of reports

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.080
 saying that he was terrible at making cocktails.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.080
 What's that?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.400
 Yeah, people didn't like them at all.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.040
 He got experimental on them.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.960
 He would throw just ingredients that he thought were interesting, so he would combine garnish

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.280
 of olives with lemon peels, he'd be like, this is going to be great.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.280
 Sounds good.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.040
 It sounds good, but he would just overdo it with too many ingredients.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.800
 So they famously know that there was a big supreme court justice who used to just walk over

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.640
 to a potted plant and pour his cocktail in every time, because they couldn't stand drinking

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640
 these cocktails.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.640
 Oh, really?

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.440
 Yeah, but you're going to, obviously, not going to just say to the president of the United

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.440
 States of America.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.440
 This is a crack cocktail.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.760
 The other thing he used to do was he used to get people quite tipsy, so he would get people

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.840
 maybe onto their third or fourth drink while he was still slowly nursing his first one.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.560
 So I think some people thought that wasn't really fair.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.560
 Yeah, everyone hates that guy.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560
 Does he have that guy?

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.560
 I think he might have been.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.240
 He tried to do that to the entire nation.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.960
 Well, but not all of us can drink as quickly as you as you as not really.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.960
 Next to you, man.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.960
 We're all that guy.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.160
 It's very annoying when people fall behind.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.520
 But yeah, he was responsible for prohibition, wasn't he?

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.560
 Sorry, for stopping prohibition, because he was quite pro-alcohol.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.560
 And I was reading quite a funny thing about that.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.040
 So April the 6th, apparently, in America is New Beer's Eve.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.240
 Are there any Americans here?

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.240
 Have you heard of that?

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240
 Right.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.640
 Well, you should be celebrating.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:24.440
 So this is the night when at midnight in 1933, I want to say, '34'.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.440
 This prohibition was stopped.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.240
 I had no way I could edit that to make this thing.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.240
 Should have ridden that down.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:42.840
 In 1933, in 1934, basically, he said the prohibition ends at midnight.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.440
 At 1201, you can all start getting boost up again.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.240
 And in Chicago, they realized that people on the East Coast were going to be allowed to drink

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.040
 before they were, because they were a couple of hours behind.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.240
 And so an Illinois House representative launched this whole massive campaign saying,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.840
 'Chicago's clocks need to be moved permanently forward two hours to make sure that we can start drinking

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.840
 at what would otherwise be 10 p.m.'

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:11.040
 And he kept on petitioning the local parliament, the local politicians, saying, 'We need to

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.040
 move the clocks forward.'

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.040
 And they didn't.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.840
 Chicago did not agree to move this clock forward just so that he could get another two hours

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.840
 of boozing.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.840
 That's shame.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.440
 Roosevelt, on just things he did for fun, because he had a load of hobbies and he was a really

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440
 interested guy.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:28.040
 So he loved detective stories, and he thought of a plot for a detective story, but he wanted

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.240
 to involve other people in it.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.340
 So he came up with this plan, he would get a lot of the best detective authors of the day,

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.800
 he would give them all the plot, but the book was written as a round robin.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.640
 So he wrote the first chapter and all the chapters ended on a cliffhanger, and then the next

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.840
 author would write the next chapter, getting the hero out of trouble, but then by the end

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.680
 of the chapter, he'd be in trouble again, and then that went on.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.680
 The whole book was like that.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.720
 And then the book ended on a cliffhanger.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720
 Yeah.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720
 Yeah.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720
 It was finally finished about 30 years later.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720
 Really?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720
 Yeah.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.600
 I don't know how many of consequences it is.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.760
 And he was turned into a film, right?

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.040
 The president's mystery story was turned into a film the year after, which apparently was

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.800
 a terrible film.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.160
 He liked collecting stamps.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.280
 He did that before he was president, and then when he was president, he invented 200 new

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.000
 stamps, so he could collect those as well.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 That's so clever.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.840
 No, it's cheating.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.720
 He also, he is said to have coined, so someone's been looking into the phrase "off the record,"

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.600
 and the earliest citation that this person was looking for found it to be from him.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.160
 He was the first person to use it, and the citation was made in a newspaper that was publishing.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.800
 It's actually very hard to find citations of the phrase "off the record," isn't it?

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.800
 Yeah.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.120
 Exactly.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.880
 I think it's because he really drilled it home on his opening encounter with it.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:16:03.120
 So North Carolina newspaper, "The Daily Times," this is from November in 1932, 1932.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.720
 It says he Roosevelt said that he was going to talk off the record, and that it was mighty

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.880
 nice to be able to talk off the record for a change.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.280
 They hoped to be able to talk off the record often in the future.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.240
 And he told a couple of funny stories, and everyone laughed and cheered.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240
 That's the news report.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.600
 It was supposedly the first time it's ever been used.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.320
 But then they put that on the record.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320
 Yeah.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.600
 There's a website called Thrill List, which ranked 43 presidents by how much fun they were.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:38.280
 So this was a couple of years ago, so it was everyone before Trump.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.480
 Yeah, and yeah, anyway.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.120
 So just interesting where people came on this, it was pretty arbitrary, but, you know,

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.720
 Rutherford B. Hayes was the least fun president of all time, because not only did he not drink

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.640
 himself, but he banned alcohol from the White House.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:02.360
 His wife was known as Lemonade Lucy, then 42, 42 was James Polk, whose wife banned any dancing

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.600
 in the White House, so you couldn't polk her under Polk.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.240
 She was probably so sick of hearing that joke.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240
 Yeah.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240
 Within a week.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.000
 The old ones are the best ones.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.440
 And then you've got various other presidents.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440
 Harry Truman sounds fun.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.560
 He had a shot of bourbon at 5 a.m. every single day.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.560
 5 a.m.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.560
 Yeah.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.560
 Wow.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.560
 Three quickly followed by a massage.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.560
 Do you see?

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.880
 It sounds, it sounds less sweet now than when I wrote it down.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.000
 It makes him sound when we discuss it here in this context.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 He sounds like a real character, but if you actually did that in life, people would think

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 you were a problem.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Yeah.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Yes.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 And had one.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 How do you know that people would think that?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.720
 My friends have said that it's an issue for other friends of hers.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.440
 Someone who was the opposite of Lemonade Lucy, actually, was I think the best first lady

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440
 of all time.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.440
 And the person for whom the phrase first lady was first used, so this was Dolly Madison.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.200
 So James Madison's wife, so this is between 1809 and 1817.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.360
 She was first lady.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.840
 And she threw a massive house party in the White House every week, every Wednesday.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.760
 And she called them a squeeze, and she'd have between three and five hundred guests every

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.000
 single week, this house party.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.360
 And the whole purpose was to destroy the rancorous feeling between the politicians on

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.600
 different sides, between at that time the Federalists and the Republicans.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.600
 And it worked really well.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.400
 So there were various things that kind of got done because she had these big cocktail

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.920
 parties where they started chatting.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.360
 In fact, there was a plan to move the capital back to Philadelphia.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.560
 And then she threw a cocktail party, and then everyone agreed not to do it.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.040
 That's why.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.040
 It's not.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:52.120
 Lyndon B. Johnson used to love drinking a lot, and he used to have caused lots of nightmares

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.160
 for the secret services he were looking after him.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.000
 He used to drink drive a lot, but on his own property.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.840
 So not at the White House property, but his other place.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.520
 And he used to drive, and he would have a whiskey in his hand.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.400
 And what he would do is he would run out of the whiskey, and he would slow the car down,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.000
 down the window, and just hold his hand out, while a secret service member had to run up

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.720
 behind the car, grab the glass, head back, refill it, and come back while his hand is still

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720
 just waiting.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.720
 Still driving.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.960
 He's still going along, just a bit slower, take it, and then zoom off again.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.680
 You know your car's a crap, don't you, when you can get your member of staff to run alongside

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.680
 it?

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.680
 Yeah.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.680
 Have you heard about how a little fun Benjamin Harrison was?

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.680
 No.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.680
 A little fun.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.680
 So he's here at the bottom of the list.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.680
 He's not at the bottom of the list.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:48.120
 He's a separate list entirely to the fun list, but he was president around the 1890s.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.520
 First of all, making a thing.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520
 All right.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:59.720
 No, he was president in 1891, and for some years, I presume, I need the side of that.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.880
 And he was the first president to live in the White House when it had electricity.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.640
 So this was a huge innovation at the time, and it was obviously one of the first buildings

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.240
 in America to have electric lighting throughout it, but he and his wife were so scared of being

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.760
 electrocuted that they never even dared to touch the light switches that had been lavishly

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760
 installed.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.160
 And to be fair, there was probably a much bigger risk than of being electrocuted, but there

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.240
 are stories that he and his wife sometimes went to sleep with the lights on because they

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.240
 were so scared of turning the lights on.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240
 They were being electrocuted.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.840
 Wasn't there something about the new Trump administration they couldn't find the light

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.840
 switches or something?

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.400
 Steve, Steve Bannon, when he had, there was the cabinet room where they spoke, which was

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.320
 just off somewhere in the White House, and no one could find the light switch, and it was

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.720
 a very dark room, so they just had all the initial meetings in the dark because they didn't

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.200
 want to buckle and ask the Obama administration where the light switch was.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.480
 And actually, the longer you leave it, the more embarrassing they'd get.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:04.080
 Don't know, they were all in krill's fingers, didn't they?

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.080
 We need to move on shortly.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.800
 Am I just speaking of presidents who knew how to party?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.240
 Do you guys know about George Washington's farewell party from the military in 1787?

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.320
 So we've got a record of his bar tab, and this was a party that 55 people attended, including

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320
 him.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.440
 So it was him and a bunch of soldiers, and 55 people, they drank between them, 54 bottles

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:32.640
 of Madera, 60 bottles of Claret, eight bottles of whiskey, 22 bottles of porter, eight of

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.480
 hard cider, 12 of beer, and seven bowls of alcoholic punch.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.480
 Wow.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.480
 We've got the tab.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.680
 What were they doing with it?

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.880
 That's like they each had a full bottle of wine, and then all the rest of it.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.400
 And the full bottle of Madera?

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400
 Mad.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.600
 There was a president, Andrew Jackson, had to escape the White House when he threw a party

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.680
 after his inauguration, because that got too wild with this kind of, let's get everyone.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.600
 They got 20,000 citizens into the White House.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.360
 And it used to be that anyone who turned up to the inauguration was allowed into the White

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.600
 House, of course, in the Trump one they would all fit.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:14.640
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:21.120
 My fact is that the prop bed in the classic British comedy film Carry On Dick is worth £20

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.120
 million.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.440
 And that's not just by people who like movie props and ones who buy them the Carry On films.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.440
 This is such a weird story.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:38.320
 OK, so there's a bed that was used for a number of decades as a film prop, and it was bought

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.320
 a few years ago at auction as a Victorian bed, and it was bought for about £2,000.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.480
 And the guy who bought it looked at it, and he thought, after he bought it, he thought,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.000
 "Actually, I don't think it is a Victorian bed.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 It looks older."

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.160
 So he called in a historian, historian called Jonathan Foyle, who's been investigating

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160
 for some years now.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:03.560
 Foyle has aged it, and it turns out that the bed dates back to 1486, and was the marriage

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.160
 bed of King Henry VII.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.000
 We think it's the bed that Henry VIII was conceived in.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.160
 This is the only bit of royal tudor furniture left in the world, and it was used as a prop

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:25.480
 company in Carry On Day.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.480
 It's been an all of it.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.760
 It's been in Poirot.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.760
 It was in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.600
 It's got its own IMDB and chain, and it's...

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.600
 Yeah.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:41.400
 Can you imagine how low it must think it's sunk since being the reception bed of Henry VIII

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:48.600
 with Kenneth Williams lying, and that is like, "I use to have Henry VII in me."

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.320
 Maggie from EastEnders making lewd jokes with fake breasts of you.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.640
 I mean, that's horrible.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:00.400
 But do we need to start raiding the sets of classic comedies and EastEnders for cabinets

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:07.880
 that Mrs. Brown's boys is home to price this ming porcelain.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.560
 Actually the story of this bed goes even further because it was almost thrown away, wasn't

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560
 it?

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.920
 It was part of the hotel, and they were selling it off to this auction house, but the

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.160
 builders that removed it from the hotel just left it on the side for trash.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.160
 Yeah.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160
 They left it in the car park, didn't they?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160
 In the car park, yeah.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.680
 Which is quite cool because it means that that was found...

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.640
 That was Henry VII's bed, which was found in a car park, and of course, Richard III was

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.160
 found in a car park as well.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.160
 And those guys, they didn't like each other much.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160
 No.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160
 They took it to the end.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.960
 They've got one thing in common at least.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.640
 Do you think they're bonding over that now?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.840
 The car park kids in the corner in heaven.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.840
 Yeah.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.840
 So it's...

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.840
 It's incredible.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840
 It's very, very weird.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.840
 It has this whole history.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.600
 This historian Jonathan Foyle, who's been investigating it, he's made a film about it.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.240
 If you look at his Twitter feed, there's a really good 40-minute documentary about this

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240
 bed and I swear to goodness.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.480
 When you finish the grill bark, yeah.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.480
 It's really good, it's riveting.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.640
 So it ended up in this house.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.080
 The house of Thomas Stanley, who was the Earl of Derby.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.520
 And this was just after Henry VII, because if you were royal, you just had your

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.880
 bed, your bed, sent ahead of you, if you go to stay somewhere, the bed will be disassembled

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880
 and transported.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:26.320
 But anyway, in 1842, this guy called George Shaw bought it and he didn't know what he had

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.320
 either, because he was a fraudster and he ran a woodworking shop which made fake, too,

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320
 defer nature.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.320
 No.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:40.200
 And he made fake beds based on Henry VII's bed that was nearly identical, but knockoffs,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.200
 basically, and not quite as good.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.760
 He made copies of it and then he would approach local aristocrats and he would say, "I found

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.840
 your family's ancestral bed and he would slap on that family's coat of arms.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.760
 He would put some polish on it to make it look old and he passed it off as for them, but

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.920
 he could only do it so many times, because obviously, aristocrats talk to each other.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.800
 And after a while, one of them would say, "Oh, my family's ancestral bed was found recently

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800
 and I bought it."

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.440
 Then someone else would say, "Oh, that's what, so was mine."

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.440
 Yeah.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.200
 And so, moving to the modern day of this bed, quite recently, they found out that it was

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.840
 definitely chewed through DNA, and so they DNA tested this bed.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.240
 I didn't think you could even do that, but it's the thing.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.440
 So, a lot of people saw it and they thought maybe they looked at the grain of it and thought

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:31.880
 maybe this has come from some more modern trees in America, but they said, "No, no, it's

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.840
 from European oak," and they could do a DNA test on it that could show that it was a European

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840
 oak.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.360
 Oh, that's really what it's Jeremy Kyle show that would be, you've just got two beds next

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360
 to each other.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.520
 That's the relief, because I thought you were going to say they DNA tested the Henry VII

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.960
 the Dracula or something and traced it all the way to one of the royal family and checked

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.960
 it matched.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.600
 I don't know how they do these things.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600
 Wow.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.680
 This bed is very lucky, though, because most beds for royal families did not get used.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:08.520
 So, monarchs, especially in the 16th, 17th, 18th centuries, had dozens and dozens of beds

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.960
 and never slept in most of them, and this is because, basically, every member of the

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:16.040
 ability thought and hoped and wished and prayed that the monarch would visit them, because

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.440
 when, as a monarch, he went on a big tour of Britain, then you stayed with your noble friends,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.600
 and they always made sure they had a room for the king or queen, should they visit with

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.600
 a bed for the king or queen.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.600
 It's the best room in the house.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.600
 Nobody goes near it until the king visits.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.880
 But, yeah, most of them didn't, so people spent enormous amounts of money.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:39.520
 There was a Lord Scarsdale built an entire wing, I think, at Kedleston Hall, which no monarch

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.440
 ever visited, just in case the monarch came to stay.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.760
 There was one really sad story.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:50.920
 This is a place called Wilton House, and a really elaborate state bed was bought and built

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.040
 there for King George III, just in case he visited.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:59.160
 And he did, which was brilliant, this was in 1778, and he visited, and they showed him

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:04.040
 to his room, and he said, "That's great, I've actually brought my own sort of tent bed if

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.120
 that's all right, so I'll just erect that on the floor next to this lovely prices bed

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.640
 that you've spent years building."

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.240
 And he got his little zed bed out and sat on that instead.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.680
 "Hey, just a bit of modern royal bed etiquette.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.920
 This is an interesting thing.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.280
 There is a modern royal bed habit.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.200
 It's about the queen these days in the royal family.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.000
 This is from various newspaper websites, which I'm not sure accurate, but supposedly, it's

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.560
 considered rude to go to bed before the queen does.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.880
 So she can keep everybody up all night because it's a breach of protocol, even in the family,

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880
 to say, "I'm quite tired.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.280
 I'm going to turn in now, Granny."

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.280
 Can't do it.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.280
 Wow.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.280
 What time does she go to bed, do we know?

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.280
 Yeah.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.760
 This is actually from William Heseltine, who was her private secretary, although I do honestly

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.040
 think as soon as you work for the royal family, you go and just make up a load of crap

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.040
 for the press for fun.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.240
 He said this, and he said she goes to bed at midnight.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.520
 Although I do like to think some nights she just forces herself to stay awake with three

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.720
 days running, just eyeing them all around the table.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.040
 Just to make Meghan look tired.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.960
 Apparently Diana couldn't hack it.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.960
 Apparently Diana used to be a bit of an early knighter, and used to make her excuses and

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.800
 that really got her in the bad books.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800
 Wow.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800
 Yeah.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.360
 We should move on shortly to our next fact.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:31.600
 On Royal Tudor Beds, they saw a lot of action, but they also saw a lot of kind of fake royal

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600
 action, didn't they?

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.440
 So I'm not sure we've talked about very much about the bedding ceremony, which was basically

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.320
 if you were a royal person and you married another royal, often from another country to

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.320
 forge an alliance, you had to consummate that and everyone had to see it to make sure it

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.320
 happened.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.920
 And often it was children, so then you couldn't really consummate.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.320
 They just sat in the bed together.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.680
 And so it actually sounds kind of weirdly sweet, with William and Mary.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.880
 They got the trove, and I think Mary was 10 and he was 14, and they had to like officially

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:09.280
 consummate because then the forces are allied, but so all these spectators, dozens of people

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.440
 thronged into the bedroom, and then they just sat in bed together for 45 minutes.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.480
 Well, everyone hung out with them, and then they were, okay, all that's done, you're married

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.480
 now.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.480
 And actually, something's what would happen is that one of the people wasn't there or wasn't

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.480
 in the country, and they could nominate someone else to consummate the marriage with their partner.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.480
 Wow.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.680
 And then they would have to, I think they had to have one leg on cloth or something like that.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.680
 Yes.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.240
 I think that happened with Henry the seventh's wife, in fact, didn't it?

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.360
 She had on her wedding night, because she was absent.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.920
 I think it was Henry the seventh's wife.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.120
 So maybe that wasn't his ejacula on the bed.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:53.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, some prop stuff, you go through it.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.040
 Oh, so I got sent this by Alex Bell, our colleague today, and he sent me an article about how they

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:05.600
 use very random things in sci-fi movies to make them look kind of futuristic.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.040
 So in the corridors of the recent Star Trek film, and you can see the stills of this, it's

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.760
 quite obvious when you know to look for it, the corridors aligned with Dyson Airblades.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.720
 The most futuristic technology on the planet.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:26.280
 The medical officers diagnosed patients using potato pealers in the old Star Trek.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:35.520
 And in Star Wars, Qui Gong Gin, I don't know who that is, it's Qui Gong Chin, okay.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.960
 As soon as I saw that round out, I thought, "I don't know how to pronounce that," everyone

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.040
 listened to this, "doesn't know how to pronounce that."

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:52.000
 Anyway, his communicator, his communicator is actually a Gillette Sensor Excel women's razor.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.840
 Oh, cool.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:01.200
 Well, in that sort of vein of things that you're not expecting to be props, in the movie "Di-Hard,"

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.280
 Bruce Willis, he goes barefooted for a lot of scenes.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.120
 He's not barefooted.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.800
 He's wearing fake feet.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800
 No.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.800
 No way.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:17.000
 He's wearing fake feet boots that are shaped to his skin colour with five toe, four toes

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.160
 at a, at a, at a big toe.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.760
 Um, that's right.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.760
 The foot thumb.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.760
 As we sometimes call it.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760
 It's got a foot thumb.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.760
 Oh, my God.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.760
 He's lost him.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.760
 He's lost him.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760
 He's gone.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760
 He's gone.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:40.000
 Do you need to recite this little piggy, are you ready?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.200
 The same as wearing these fake, fake feet.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200
 That's amazing.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.200
 Yes.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.200
 Why?

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.200
 Was he embarrassed about his feet?

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.200
 No, it was in case an enemy grabbed him.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:59.000
 He could just lose the toe and leave the feet behind.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.240
 That's actually the end of the movie, isn't it?

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.200
 And Hannah's grubber falls from the side.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.600
 It's with a fake foot in his hand as he drops.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.240
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:18.240
 OK, my fact this week is that shops in the Philippines put their Christmas decorations

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.920
 up on the 1st of September.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.760
 In total, they stay up for more than 35% of the year.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.760
 So cool.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.000
 Do they all, even though they do this all the time, do they all whine about it every time they

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 go up?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Yes, too fucking early.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.680
 They really don't, because they love it.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:41.520
 And actually, just to go a bit further on that, in all the traditions in the Philippines,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.040
 Christmas would last until Candlemas, which is February the 2nd.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.520
 And so in some places, they'll keep it up from the 1st of September to the 2nd of February,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.560
 which means it's up 44.4% of the year.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.560
 Wow.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560
 That's pretty good.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.400
 Good reason not to move to the Philippines.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.040
 Indian-sipian fascism, slightly behind the insipian fascism.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.360
 But yeah, so basically, people in the Philippines love Christmas.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.520
 It's one of the few Catholic countries in that part of the world.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.760
 And they start their countdown 100 days before Christmas, so they count it down from 100.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.400
 And that would be in the middle of September, but they've kind of evolved it into being

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.440
 about the B.E.R. months, the burn months, so September, October, November, December.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.720
 And now the way it does it is basically the 1st of September, that's when they all go up

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.520
 and they all stay up the whole time.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.720
 So on Christmas getting earlier, this is a thing that a lot of people debate, don't they?

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.120
 Some people say it gets earlier every year and some people say, no, it's, it can't get

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.240
 earlier every year, because then it would be going way, way back.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.920
 But there is a way of tracking how early Christmas is.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.840
 And this is by, this was done this year by The Washington Post, which is the Mariah Carey

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.960
 song, all I want for Christmas is you.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:35:00.440
 Okay, so came out in 1994 and The Washington Post analysed when it enters the charts each

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.280
 year, because it does, it re-enters the charts every year.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.160
 And they found it's been getting popular slightly earlier in the holiday season.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160
 Really?

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.400
 So Christmas music is definitely getting earlier each year, yeah.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.000
 While people are just appreciating how great Mariah Carey is, we can all do that all year

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 round.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.120
 And the other way of doing that, of course, is by looking at internet searches.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.680
 So they did a study of looking about searches to things like Santa Claus or Elf or Presence.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:34.040
 And they found that in 2008, people started searching for these things around October the

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040
 12th.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:42.320
 In 2009, it was on August the 30th and in 2012, it was August the 19th, people were looking

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.640
 for things like that.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.120
 And then on the other hand, the other argument is that basically people have been saying this

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.120
 forever.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:53.920
 And there have been examples of people saying, as early as in 1901, the Philadelphia inquire

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.320
 a complaint that it seems to get earlier every year.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.800
 So that was happening way, way back that people had been complaining about.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:05.680
 But was it just that in 1901, it was, you know, noon on the 24th of December?

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.600
 It was 1pm last year.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:15.440
 In 1914, Adverts were appearing advertising to women to buy stuff for Christmas in August.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.360
 So it did go back and it was actually a really patriotic thing to do back in the day.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.160
 So there was a campaign led by Florence Kelly, who people might have heard of.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.600
 She was a big deal, a big campaigner at the turn of the century in America.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:34.640
 She founded the NAACP, so like an association to help African Americans.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.160
 She was very big on workers' rights.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.000
 And she said quite rightly that the Christmas rush in the two weeks leading up to Christmas

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.440
 was very unfair on these poor, you know, enslaved workers in these big malls.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.640
 So said, do your Christmas shopping early?

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.200
 And these posters went up all over all the big cities of America and people were told, you

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.360
 know, you've got to start Christmas shopping.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.200
 And in fact, and that carried on after World War One, because then ironically all the big

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.200
 malls picked up on it.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.440
 And we're like, yeah, we'd love it if people started shopping for Christmas in July.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.440
 Great.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.800
 So I like this advert that was in The Washington Times in the 1920s, which said the headline

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:17.400
 was, it was a little essay and the headline was, if Christmas came tomorrow, would you be ready?

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.520
 It is one of the few things that isn't just going to sneak up on you.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.160
 Christmas is going to be the same time every time.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.400
 Do you guys like holiday music?

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.400
 Christmas music?

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.400
 Yes.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.400
 I like Mariah Carey's song.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.400
 Sure.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.400
 Yeah.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400
 You're flesh and blood, James.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.480
 Of course, you're like Mariah Carey's song.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.240
 So you go and did some polling about whether people like Christmas music.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.240
 Oh, no.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.640
 Does it turn out they're all fascists if they do or something?

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.640
 Because I don't say anything.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640
 No.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640
 It doesn't.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.640
 OK.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.760
 I think it's whether people like it in shops leading up to Christmas.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.320
 So 31% of respondents said they look forward to it a lot.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.160
 An equal, roughly equal number said they like it some.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.680
 34% said not much or not at all.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:11.200
 And then in 2011, there was a service set finding that 23% of Americans dread holiday music.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.360
 And 36% of respondents in one poll admitted to leaving a shop sooner because there was music

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.360
 playing.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.360
 And I found my people.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.320
 We've actually got an exciting number of Christmas albums coming out this year.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320
 I was looking inside.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320
 I'm excited.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320
 Yeah.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.920
 Well, so since we talk Mariah Carey, it's the benchmark.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.000
 It's what every artist wants.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.960
 They want that big Christmas song that's just going to be played throughout the years.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.520
 So in the past Kylie Mino and everyone have done Christmas albums.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.760
 Obviously Michael Buble.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.760
 This year, Jesse J is releasing a Christmas album.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.160
 Gwen Stefani is releasing a Christmas album.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.880
 And William Schattener is releasing a Christmas album.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.880
 Right.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.360
 And his one looks extraordinary.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.080
 Great list of songs.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.960
 He's calling it Schattener Clause.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.480
 It doesn't sound quite close enough to Santa, does it?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.960
 It's so.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.520
 They gave up on that title, didn't they?

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.040
 Yeah.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:07.400
 I've never thought about the sound of Schattener until he said, "Schattener Clause."

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.560
 Schattener only reminds you of one other word and is not Santa.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.440
 Have you heard James Bras he been?

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.440
 Don't forget to leave out a mince pie and some aluminum.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.320
 I was just reading about this.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.400
 Everyone might know this, but I didn't know it.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.720
 There's a lot of shops in the last couple of years

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.400
 that have started stocking Easter trees and Easter bobbles.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.920
 Apparently, that's a thing, though.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.280
 That's an Easter tree.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.800
 No.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.280
 Oh no, I've seen Easter crackers in the shops.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.400
 Yeah, they're not playing Easter songs.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.600
 They've not got the "Shap the Bunny" coming along.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.680
 Very shut-mus.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.120
 Oh my god.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.320
 That's very good.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.560
 On Christmas decorations, so they've always been a big thing.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.440
 A big demonstration often is turning on the Christmas lights.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.960
 In America, it's a big deal.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.680
 Apparently, turning on the Christmas lights

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.640
 and the president traditionally turned them on.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.240
 So Ronald Reagan, for instance, in 1983,

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.200
 thought he turned on the Christmas lights

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.440
 as big symbolic move, but he didn't.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.640
 He was tricked.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.160
 So basically, they always do it from the ellipse park,

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.560
 which is apparently near the White House.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.480
 It's about a kilometer away or something, a half a kilometer.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.880
 And the big tree is then all the lights go on from there.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.040
 There's this switch.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.800
 And in 1983, there just been this assassination attempt

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.760
 on Ronald Reagan.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.000
 So the secret service were a little bit antsy

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.040
 about having him exposed in public.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.240
 And so they said to him, we'll put you on the White House steps

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.400
 and we'll rig it up so that there's this massive switch.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.200
 And there was a giant switch on the steps.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.760
 And you press it and then it'll turn on all the lights.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.800
 And it'll be amazing.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.880
 And he did that.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.400
 And I was reading this in a book by someone

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.360
 who worked at the White House quite low down

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.240
 who looked at this massive switch he was going to press

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.080
 and said to one of the other people working there,

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.120
 I can't see the wire where it connects up to the lights.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.000
 And the other guy said, yeah, yeah, there isn't one.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.640
 Yeah.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.960
 It's just a big prop switch that Reagan's going to press.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.800
 And he'll think he's turned on the Christmas lights.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.880
 And actually, I then immediately have to radio or phone my mate

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.000
 who's in the park, who will then plug in the Christmas lights.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.560
 And we do that with the nuclear button for Trump, please.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:43.760
 If we just swap the nuclear switch for a krill's fincter,

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.160
 all he'll do is light up a tiny crustacean.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.080
 And his hands are small enough.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:52.520 --> 00:42:01.720
 OK, that's it.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.920
 That is all of our facts.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.280
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.240

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.960

 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.200

 Andy.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.680
 I'm @AndruhunterM.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.080
 James.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.120
 @JamesHarkin.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:15.920

 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.640
 We have a website as well.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.960
 NoSuchThing is a fish.com.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.600
 It's got everything.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.840
 It's got our previous episodes.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:30.320
 It has a link to our new book, not relevant to you guys here.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.720
 And it has all of our previous episodes.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.120
 And we are about to give away the prequel to the latest book

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.000
 to the best fact that has been sent to us

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.160
 by one of the audience members here at the Union Chapel tonight.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.320
 Anna, have you got the winner?

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.400
 Yes.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.960
 I've written down your name, and I can't read my own writing.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.920
 I think it's Daniel Afusion.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.560
 Afusion?

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.560
 Are you in?

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.640
 Are you in, Dan?

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.160
 Maybe.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.080
 Is that a note?

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:56.800
 Left at the interval.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.080
 And there wasn't even an interval.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:03.320
 All right, so if anyone wants to pretend to be Daniel,

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.440
 this is the fact.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.680
 And please come and claim your book at the end from us.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.040
 So just come up to the front of the queue and grab it.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.480
 The fact is that the composer Rossini,

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.680
 so the composer of the Barber of Seville,

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.480
 was bald, but he didn't want to admit it.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.360
 So what he did was, he had 10 wigs made of different lengths,

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.520
 which he changed every week.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.680
 And then after 10 weeks, he'd announced

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.600
 he was booking a hair appointment.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.600
 That's what he got.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.600
 [APPLAUSE]

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:39.560
 So Daniel--

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.360
 Atkinson.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.280
 Atkinson.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.640
 That's a much more normal name than Afusion.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.200
 It's so obviously atkinson.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:47.960
 Now I look at it.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:48.480
 Atkinson.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.720
 OK, that's it.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.720
 That is all of our facts.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.680
 We'll see you again.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.680
 Goodbye.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.680
 [APPLAUSE]

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.680
 (audience cheering)
