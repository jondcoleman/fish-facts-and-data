1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
 Hey everyone, big news, no such thing as a fish is turning three.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:10,340
 Yeah, it's our birthday coming up on March the 9th and we are going to celebrate it by throwing a big party.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,620
 Well, actually, it's a live recording, but we're calling it a big party.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,100
 And if you want to come along, it's going to be in London.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,180
 It's going to be at our regular recording venue, which is up the creek, which is in Greenwich.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,020
 And we're going to be starting at 7.30pm on the 28th of February.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,780
 Tickets are going to be going on sale this coming Monday, the 20th of February.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,460
 And they're going to be available at qi.com/fishevents and the tickets will go live at 11am.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,740
 It's going to be really fun. There's going to be balloons.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,100
 I've just decided. I've just decided. There's going to be balloons and cake, cake.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:50,660
 We're going to have a cake and Andy is going to do a strip tease and it is going to be packed all together with a live recording.

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,020
 You'll get to see a show recorded live.

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,180
 So please come along, go get the tickets. Again, they'll be available at 11am.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,980
 Monday, the 20th, go to qi.com/fishevents.

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,860
 Okay, on with the show.

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,100
 Three-year-olds birthday party for strip tease.

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,700
 And also if you're not interstripping and you're into wearing stuff,

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,980
 then we have a hoodie.

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,460
 No such thing as a fish hoodie.

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,020
 And you can buy that by going to qi.com/hoody.

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,140
 And we also have t-shirts and we have vinyls, but they've just had a big new delivery of the hoodies that come in basically.

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,020
 All the sizes you could want.

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:30,900
 And it has on the back of the hoodie a huge list of our headline facts that we've done in the first year of our podcast.

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,620
 You want to celebrate the end of winter and the return of wall weather with a new hoodie?

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,580
 Go ahead and come slash hoodie.

26
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,180
 Okay, on with the show.

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:02:02,220
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the qi offices in Covent Garden.

28
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,300
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Anna Chazinski.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,900
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order.

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,740
 Here we go, starting with you Andy.

31
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:25,500
 My fact is the doomsday clock was originally set at seven minutes to midnight because the artist responsible for it thought it looked good.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,940
 Those were literally her words.

33
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:35,660
 She was a lady called Martil Langsdorf and she was asked to come up with a cover for a magazine, basically, but the magazine was the bulletin of atomic scientists.

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,700
 And she said it looked good to my eye when she drew the doomsday clock at the original thing.

35
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,140
 So the doomsday clock for anyone who doesn't know is is a sort of theoretical clock saying how know we are to the end of the world.

36
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:55,380
 And it's put together by a body of atomic scientists and nuclear weapons experts and they have just moved it.

37
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,980
 So we're now two and a half minutes to midnight, which is just about the closest it's ever been.

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,100
 I think at one point it might have been on two minutes.

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,020
 Yeah, I think it was on two at one point. Yeah, you're right.

40
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,380
 Yeah, it was. It was around Cuba Missile Crisis time.

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,060
 No, that's the weird thing.

42
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,060
 They didn't move it for the Cuba Missile Crisis. Do you know why?

43
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,660
 What?

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,180
 They had no idea what was going on.

45
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,420
 They said we just don't have any data to make a judgment.

46
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,380
 Ah, but it wasn't the newspapers.

47
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,780
 Yeah, I don't think they knew whether the missiles were being primed or loaded or whether they were going to get to Cuba or

48
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,500
 but that's one of the times where they didn't change the clock at all.

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,300
 So were they this artist?

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,220
 Hey, was she an atomic scientist as well by night? No, it's by day or?

51
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:40,500
 No, she was married to a guy who worked on both the magazine and was also part of the Manhattan project, I believe.

52
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,260
 He was one of the scientists who was helping out on that.

53
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,220
 She was just asked to design a cover.

54
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,260
 So she wasn't even designing a Doomsday clock as such.

55
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,860
 She thought she was going to do a U, the letter U, for uranium as the cover.

56
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,180
 But she noticed in the talk that a deadline was sort of looming and she thought,

57
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,860
 like a clock going to 12, it's just on its way kind of thing.

58
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,740
 It's an analog clock as well, isn't it?

59
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,540
 So we don't know for sure that it's not like two minutes to midday.

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,820
 Yeah, absolutely fine.

61
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,140
 Oh, that's great. We're whole 12 hours away.

62
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,460
 I think they gave us not very much wiggle room by putting it seven minutes to.

63
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,540
 And I think that's causing the problem now, isn't it?

64
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,860
 Because actually the world could get much, much more dangerous before catastrophe.

65
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,300
 And so for instance, now is the first time that they've only added half a minute rather than a full minute.

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,380
 Yeah, because clearly we're getting closer and closer to midnight,

67
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,780
 but you don't want to say we've gone a full third of the way closer.

68
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,380
 It is like a parent saying, I'm going to count to three to a naughty child.

69
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:42,540
 And like one, two, two and a half, two and a half, two and three quarters.

70
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,140
 Do they factor in for when the clock's going forward?

71
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,980
 I think the important thing for everyone listening is that there is no scientific basis

72
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,740
 or proper scale to this clock.

73
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,500
 They just kind of wing it. There is scientific basis as in.

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,380
 It's a load of scientists who come up with it and assess whether the world is more dangerous or less dangerous.

75
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,300
 Yeah, but it's sort of an arbitrary scale, you know, they haven't actually worked out.

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,020
 This is 20% more dangerous than it was yesterday in it.

77
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,380
 But it's just, I think it's just 10 scientists and security experts and they just get together in a room, don't they?

78
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,780
 And they just kind of discuss things.

79
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,220
 And then at the end of the day before they crack open the whiskey, they go, okay, what we're going to say?

80
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,420
 Two minutes. Pretty much that, isn't it?

81
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,900
 So the Manhattan project, you know, when it was underway.

82
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,980
 So this is when they, obviously, Oppenheimer and co-exploded an atomic bomb.

83
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:38,380
 They discussed at the time when they were planning the Manhattan project, the possibility that it could, in fact, blow up the entire world.

84
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:47,140
 So one of the guys working on it, Edward Teller did some calculations and he said that it was possible that the explosion they generated would create this

85
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,180
 vision reaction that generated heat so intense that it would trigger, run away fusion in the atmosphere.

86
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,460
 Now, I only know what a few of those words mean.

87
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,460
 Essentially, the explosion was going to generate such a huge heat that the fusion in the atmosphere would spread all around the world.

88
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,980
 And the world would explode.

89
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,820
 We'd basically become a sun, which is like the sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion, isn't it?

90
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,020
 Yeah, exactly.

91
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,020
 I really like that Oppenheimer said at one point, and this is before the Manhattan project, that in an interview he said,

92
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,580
 "Two great loves are physics and desert country. It's a pity they can't be combined."

93
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,860
 And then he actually had the chance to marry his two great loves.

94
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,540
 But marry them by blowing one of them up.

95
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:35,700
 My third love, of course, is tiny uninhabited islands in the South Pacific.

96
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,020
 So on the end of the world, there are lots of stories recently about preppers, I think, like us.

97
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,900
 And people, so there's been a recent news story that everyone is buying a house in New Zealand.

98
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,900
 Everyone, everyone who's anyone and has a billion pounds is buying a house in New Zealand.

99
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,140
 My buddy Reese bought a house in New Zealand recently.

100
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,340
 He's from New Zealand.

101
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,780
 Yeah, he lives there.

102
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,940
 I don't think he counts as a prepper in that case.

103
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,420
 Because they think it's less likely to be bombed because everyone basically likes people from New Zealand.

104
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,140
 They're pretty innocuous people.

105
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,140
 But what about Mordor? That's there. That's very dangerous.

106
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,740
 That's true. That is a rogue nation, if ever there was one.

107
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,660
 But did you know, before the American election in November,

108
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,220
 prepper meal firms, a lot of them saw sales triple in the three weeks leading up to the election.

109
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,420
 Wow. Yeah.

110
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,300
 Which is substantial because people were thinking it's all going to kick off once we've had the election.

111
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,020
 Do they think that would be his first move?

112
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,220
 Literally get into the White House, the red button.

113
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,700
 I was reading a prepper's list of things that you take into your bunker with you.

114
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,900
 Should the apocalypse happen, do as they arrive?

115
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,820
 This was actually a crack article and they were saying that one of the things that's on the list

116
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,020
 that sticks out as quite odd is non-lubricated condoms.

117
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,140
 And they say you should have lots of non-lubricated condoms.

118
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,140
 Lubricated condoms?

119
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,740
 So cracked, they start saying, okay, it kind of makes sense.

120
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,860
 Imagine if there's a big group down there and suddenly STI starts spreading.

121
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,300
 So you want to make sure that in any sex that that's happening.

122
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,820
 But then you think, okay, why non-lubricated condoms?

123
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,220
 Turns out that condoms are incredibly practical as a thing to have.

124
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,700
 It's almost like if you were out in a bare-grill situation with nothing.

125
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,100
 You can carry water in them, can you?

126
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,340
 You can carry water in them, where it's called the...

127
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,540
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can carry two leaders.

128
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,940
 They're non-lubricated as well.

129
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,500
 I'm just going to put a bottle in the bunker and carry my water in there.

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 You'll be totally around your condom.

131
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,300
 You can put them around your head and blow it up with your nose.

132
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,900
 Yeah, for fun, yeah.

133
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,340
 Because you need entertainment in these bunkers, very dry places.

134
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,940
 You can make a slingshot out of them.

135
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,900
 No, you can't.

136
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,700
 Yeah, you can.

137
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,980
 So, there's the Prepper's Journal and they have 11 ways a condom can save your life.

138
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,300
 And one of them is make a slingshot and it acts as the actual bit of rubber that you pull back on.

139
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,340
 And they show you how to make it, so you carve out the wood and then you strap two condoms and tie them up.

140
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,860
 That's going to save your life.

141
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,820
 It says a giant coming and you need to send a small boy to defeat him.

142
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,380
 And in the post-New Clear Landscape, there probably will be giants walking around there.

143
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,780
 I hope to be for this.

144
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,260
 Any other ways a condom can save your life?

145
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,740
 Starting fires, starting fire.

146
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,940
 Starting fires.

147
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,340
 That's why sex is such a dangerous business.

148
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,540
 That's the song.

149
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,940
 This sex is on fire.

150
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,980
 Due to this non-lubricated condom.

151
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,140
 It's that friction.

152
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,420
 Does it say how you might start a fire with a condom?

153
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,620
 Well, actually, it's not about starting the fire, it's about protecting Tinder from moisture.

154
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,380
 Not your Tinder app.

155
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,060
 It does feel like that list is compiled by completely insane people.

156
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,620
 Well, no, it's on this amazing site called Preparations.com.

157
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,900
 Yeah, I think they're completely insane people.

158
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,180
 They're really secretive as well.

159
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,100
 So the New York did a profile and the journalist writing the article was approaching

160
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,180
 possible preppers to interview them.

161
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,620
 And one prepper wrote back saying, asking to see my prepper stash.

162
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,420
 You just asked me one of the most personal things I've ever heard.

163
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,900
 That is effectively like going to someone's house, meeting their new girlfriend.

164
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,700
 Have you got any condoms?

165
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,060
 Yeah, he said.

166
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,980
 It's like saying I'd like to see her naked and have sex with her.

167
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,060
 So they are very secretive about it.

168
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,500
 That's because I think they're the kind of people who's prepper stash

169
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,420
 does contain 100 blow-up dolls.

170
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,620
 We should say that this is genuinely really quite widespread in America.

171
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,740
 So there was a study done recently that found 22% of Americans believe

172
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,180
 that the world will end in their lifetime.

173
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,260
 Another study, the National Geographic did, that said 40% of Americans,

174
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,420
 almost half, think that's stocking up on end to the world's applies.

175
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,380
 It's a more sensible idea than getting a pension scheme, getting a mortgage scheme.

176
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,220
 Right.

177
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,820
 If you don't get a pension, but you do have a lot of can food and water,

178
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,900
 you can, once you retire, just go and live in your bunker anyway.

179
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,660
 It doesn't matter that the world's starting.

180
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,260
 It doesn't really affect you whether the world's going on or not.

181
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,700
 It's the red time and everyone's always dreamed of. The windowless can food dependent

182
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,220
 30 years post-working life.

183
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:09,300
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is James.

184
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,900
 OK, my fact this week is that some villagers in the Central African Republic

185
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,060
 deliberately allow lions to live nearby so they can steal their food.

186
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,060
 So what would normally happen if if you lived in a village and there were lions nearby,

187
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,700
 you would always try and shoot them away.

188
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,620
 But these guys kind of allow them to live nearby.

189
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,860
 They don't try and get rid of them because what they know will happen is these

190
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,700
 lions will catch bits of meat and whatever, and then they can shoot them away

191
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,500
 or they can sneak upon them and they can grab the meat and they'll be able to eat it.

192
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,540
 Have you seen the video of people doing this though?

193
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,700
 With the lions.

194
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,020
 I saw the, no.

195
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,180
 What are you about to say? I bought up the YouTube page.

196
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,700
 Yes, I've seen the crown.

197
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,620
 Great, it's 10 parts series. Amazing.

198
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,500
 I've bought up the YouTube page and I saw all the videos but I didn't press play on them.

199
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,340
 So I saw the screen gram that holds the video, but I'm not the advert before it came out.

200
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,540
 There's a new Nokia, so I know you've actually seen the videos.

201
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,700
 I have the really good.

202
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,540
 So basically, I think I saw a video that was of the Derobo hunters in Southern Kenya.

203
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,220
 So as James says, this happens in various places.

204
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,220
 And what they do is they're about 10 lions gathered round a corpse, I think it's a gazelle or something.

205
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,060
 So 10 lions, males and females, and there are three hunters and they, you know,

206
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,020
 scrawny little humans and they just go up to them.

207
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,340
 I think two of them had little spears just wouldn't stick, essentially.

208
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,220
 And the key is confidence.

209
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,260
 And if you just stride up and look like you definitely own the show, then the lions just leave.

210
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,300
 So there's kind of a staring contest in a battle of wills.

211
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,100
 Walk towards the lions and the lions look up at them and sort of meet their eye and size them up.

212
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:52,620
 And then for some reason, this pride of 10 lions thinks, no, I can't handle these three small skinny men.

213
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,780
 And they go away, but they know they have to cut the meat off the animal really quickly.

214
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,940
 Because if the lions stay and watch them long enough and size them up properly,

215
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,980
 then they'll realize that actually I probably can take those guys back.

216
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,260
 So how do you do it at the end? You just walk off?

217
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,380
 Just walk away.

218
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,780
 Just casually stride away.

219
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,500
 Like these guys have read the game, but with lions.

220
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,340
 Just this is completely off subject, but about staring people out.

221
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,700
 Dan, what do you think is the record in the world staring someone out competition?

222
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,740
 So is this the same as a no blinking?

223
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:35,260
 So if you and I are kind of who's going to blink the latest, what you reckon, the two people who were in the final,

224
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,940
 a person who went out, how long do you think it was?

225
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:45,180
 I can't imagine. Is it 1962 between Kennedy and Christophe at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis?

226
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,020
 That is pretty old satire.

227
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,460
 It's because we were talking about the Cuban Missile Crisis.

228
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,220
 It was timely.

229
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,220
 It was weirdly topical.

230
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,300
 Just going from my own eyeballs, your own record, you get my own record.

231
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,940
 I'd say no longer than half an hour or no, no, no, no, no, sorry, sorry.

232
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,300
 Well, half a minute, how do you think someone's not blinking for half an hour?

233
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,020
 James is asking what I think the record is, and I know it's got to be more than half a minute.

234
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,980
 So I'm saying half an hour.

235
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,300
 I'm saying half a minute.

236
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,900
 I believe it's about 40 minutes.

237
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,180
 No, that was one of them dead.

238
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,500
 And they haven't realised.

239
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,340
 That's amazing.

240
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,820
 Did you know that in Nepal, they do the same thing that James is talking about, but with tigers.

241
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,300
 There's kleptoparasitism, humans do this with tigers.

242
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,340
 But it's very often in Nepal elephant trainers who do it, and they do it by, they'll lead their elephants

243
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,700
 into the undergrowth to feed them and things like that.

244
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,260
 And then if there's a tiger nearby, then they take the elephant with them and they use the elephant

245
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,820
 to scare away the tiger, to scare the tiger off a carcass.

246
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,300
 So they employ the elephants as their henchmen in order to get the tiger to scarper.

247
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,700
 Wow, that's very cool.

248
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,700
 Here's the thing.

249
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,980
 So the worst time for being attacked by lions, as in the time it's most likely to happen,

250
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,100
 it's always bad.

251
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,340
 The time it happens most often is just after the full moon.

252
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
 Okay.

253
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,300
 And that's because lions hunt best when it's dark.

254
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,860
 And when it's light at night time, there's a full moon.

255
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,900
 They tend to not really hunt that much and so they don't eat that much.

256
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,620
 And so just after the full moon, they're really hungry.

257
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,620
 And so they're more likely to attack you.

258
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,820
 Really?

259
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,660
 You know how you lure a lion to you if you want it to come to you?

260
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
 With some meat.

261
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,380
 Yeah, you could look as Elkostiub and you front around looking incompetent.

262
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,620
 No, it's an interesting trick that's used by a lot of photographers

263
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,060
 when they're trying to lure them to camera traps to set off to take photos

264
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,660
 for jaguars and for lions.

265
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,820
 It tends to be men's aftershave.

266
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,540
 So with lions, a photographer that I was reading about said that they use old spice

267
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,140
 and what they do is they just spray it all over, say, the leaves of the area where the camera is.

268
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,860
 And that tends to lure the men.

269
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,180
 So the mass eye, obviously, are known for lion killing, the lion killing ways.

270
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,780
 And it's the right of passage in mass eye culture to use it.

271
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,260
 Yeah, when you hit adolescence, then you go out and you kill a lion and that means you're a man

272
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,220
 and it means you're very brave and you come back and the person you killed the lion

273
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,620
 gets to wear the mane on his head at special events and the tails all bejeweled by the women in the tribe.

274
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,380
 And they've started cutting down a bit now because lion populations are under threat.

275
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,780
 So it used to be more individuals that went out.

276
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,140
 Now it's more groups.

277
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:38,660
 But because there's a kind of increasing awareness about how lion populations are in trouble amongst mass eye people,

278
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,620
 that was in Kenya 10 years ago and even then I met a couple of mass eye guys who were campaigning in their tribes

279
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,780
 against killing animals because they don't think they should do it.

280
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,100
 So because there's this increasing awareness, they've started the mass eye Olympics as an alternative way

281
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,100
 for men to prove their kind of status in society.

282
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,700
 And they have all the same kind of skills that it would take to hunt a lion, like sprinting or long distance running,

283
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
 but they don't have to kill lions anymore.

284
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,340
 I watched, just thinking about humans living with lions.

285
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:15,820
 I was watching a video of, do you remember that Melanie Griffith, those pictures came out that she grew up with lions?

286
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,860
 Who's Melanie Griffith?

287
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,860
 She's an actor, very famous, but you might know her through, she was married for years to Antonio Banderas.

288
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,900
 And she was, whose daughter was she?

289
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,700
 To be Hadron.

290
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
 Yeah, to be Hadron.

291
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
 Oh, yeah.

292
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,380
 That's more your era, isn't it Andy?

293
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,580
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

294
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,380
 The 1962 good old days, Hitchcock was alive, the Rolling Stones were still good.

295
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,180
 The Cold Wall was still going, so all your jokes still made sense.

296
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,580
 Hey guys, what about those missile bases in Hungary, huh?

297
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,020
 Yeah, so Melanie Griffith, the actor, she, when she was growing up, lived with lions

298
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,220
 and there's all these photos of them playing in the pool, sleeping in the same bed and so on,

299
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:02,220
 her parents made a movie called Roar, which is a very, very famous movie in which they used actual lions and tigers in the movie.

300
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,380
 And a few of them, I think Melanie Griffith actually got a bit mulled in it.

301
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,900
 She had like a hundred stitches off the back of it, but you can see that footage on the DVD that they've released.

302
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,940
 But you can watch the sort of collected clips from Roar on YouTube of all the lion and tiger attacks in the movie.

303
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,140
 And it is nuts.

304
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,060
 And they lived with like 100 lions, the family itself.

305
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,860
 So Melanie Griffith grew up with these lions.

306
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:30,260
 Yes, I promise it was like 100 lions and tigers and you can see in the footage because they went, they went all in the house like it was an outdoor area.

307
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,140
 Just the sleeping arrangements sort of be that enough.

308
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,420
 We'll put you in the 98th bedroom.

309
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,860
 It still has got a lion in it, obviously. We have a hundred lions.

310
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,420
 But it's not one of the two rooms that I've got two lions in it.

311
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,620
 No.

312
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,660
 You'd never say yes to a sleep over would you?

313
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:57,460
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

314
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:07,300
 And that is my fact, my fact this week is that there is a Victorian time capsule buried in London that contains photographs of the 12 best looking women in England.

315
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,100
 So the 12 best looking from Victorian times.

316
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,620
 Yeah, well, yeah, not it would be an amazing fact of pictures of Kim Bessinger and started it now, wouldn't it?

317
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,460
 Still an incredibly old reference. You had to look at it closer.

318
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,260
 Yeah, I'm so here's the thing.

319
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,100
 I'm not fully sure and I don't know if anyone does properly know who these women were.

320
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:39,460
 So the phrase I kept coming across is 12 best looking women in England or 12 English beauties of the day and no one says any more about it.

321
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,500
 So this is buried as part of a time capsule, which is buried underneath Cleopatra's needle, which if you've ever been to London,

322
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,860
 it's on the embankments. It's on along the Thames.

323
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,140
 Yeah, only down the road from here, we could almost see it from our office.

324
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,820
 Can we get to the pictures to see who they are?

325
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,740
 They're buried, obviously, underneath in a time capsule.

326
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,580
 That's the point.

327
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,100
 When do we get to open it and have a look at these English beauties?

328
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,540
 They haven't said, but that's what's amazing to me.

329
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:13,140
 This is what I find very interesting about the fact is that there is this box buried underneath the Cleopatra's needle, which was brought and erected in 1896.

330
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,140
 There's things that were included in it where a box of cigars is a portrait at Queen Victoria.

331
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,300
 There's a written history about how Cleopatra's needle actually got transported to being on the embankments.

332
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,620
 And then there are 12 photographs of the English beauties of the day.

333
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,420
 And no one has seemed to have gone, huh, and said, who are they? Why is that?

334
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,180
 They just treat it like it's a normal thing you put in a time capsule.

335
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,500
 It's a load of really weird stuff.

336
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,020
 Like there's also a three foot high model of Cleopatra's needle under Cleopatra's needle.

337
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,820
 Yeah. Is that then underneath that? It's a three-centimeter one.

338
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,580
 The original Russian doll is really weird.

339
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,380
 That is strange.

340
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,620
 Yeah. And they've also inserted under one of the hydraulic jacks used to lift it up,

341
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,460
 because it was lifted by just four men using four hydraulic jacks.

342
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,660
 And it was hugely technologically advanced for the time.

343
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,060
 They consulted Joseph Fazzeljet.

344
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,100
 He was the person that they asked about how to get it onto the shore and whether it would be safe.

345
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,220
 People were worried that it was so heavy, it would cause the embankment to collapse.

346
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,380
 And Fazzeljet was, of course, the guy who designed the London sewer system.

347
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,540
 So he knew a lot by that point about what was underneath the earth in London.

348
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,220
 And he said, look, it's fine. It's made of London clay. It's safe.

349
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,460
 Dump it on there. And so they did.

350
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,260
 So we should say what Cleopatra's needle actually is before we go any further.

351
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,980
 So it's a, it's a, it's an obelisk.

352
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:35,300
 It's a huge ancient Egyptian stone sort of pillar covered in higher glyphs.

353
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,820
 And it's got nothing to do with Cleopatra.

354
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,980
 It should be called footmoses needle, because he was the Pharaoh who actually commissioned it.

355
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,660
 It's, you know, way, way, way longer ago than Cleopatra.

356
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,260
 And there are three of them, one of them is in New York.

357
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,780
 It's in Central Park, one of them is in London.

358
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,740
 And there's another one in Paris, but it's from somewhere else.

359
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,140
 Yeah. So that's what they are.

360
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,660
 Yeah. And Anna saying the worries about how placing it there

361
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,340
 was it going to go through the ground.

362
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,980
 The initial proposal for where it was going to be was outside the front of the house

363
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,220
 of Parliament. That's where they wanted to stand.

364
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,460
 And the Metropolitan District Committee said you can't do that because it's

365
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
 directly over one of our tube lines.

366
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,860
 And it's going to be too heavy and it's going to fall.

367
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,700
 The rumbles are going to topple it over.

368
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,100
 And then the weight of it once it topples over, it's going to break through the ground

369
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,980
 and stab a train.

370
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,340
 It's not that hard, come on.

371
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,340
 There wasn't their exact words, but it's a needle point at the top, isn't it?

372
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,820
 So it's not that pointy.

373
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,300
 I don't point you enough to penetrate it.

374
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,620
 It's not so big. It's much less weight than say a building.

375
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,940
 Yeah, like that's the thing.

376
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,060
 Yeah, like you would think that big Ben would be more likely to fall over and stab a train

377
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,060
 than that. Oh, yeah, it's very pointy big Ben, yeah, at the top.

378
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,860
 Yeah, it's very true.

379
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,260
 And also it's got these two Sphinxes which are facing it.

380
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,540
 And they are, firstly, they're the wrong way round.

381
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,180
 These massive bronze Sphinxes, they should be facing away from it,

382
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,340
 protecting it and actually they're looking towards it like idiots.

383
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,300
 And the other thing is that they were actually made in 1881.

384
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,180
 They're so fake. Yes, they're completely knock off Victorian things.

385
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
 Yeah, they're replicas.

386
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,260
 I went down there this morning to look at them and just see if I could see the...

387
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,660
 You were looking for the 12 beauties, weren't you?

388
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,180
 I was looking for a where...

389
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,220
 I thought they might have even acknowledged that maybe there was a time capsule somewhere,

390
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,020
 but they don't. But what you do see is there's a lot of things they tell you about the people

391
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,820
 who died in the process of bringing it over because there was a whole ship container

392
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,060
 that was built for it called the Cleopatra to transport it.

393
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,060
 And it got disattached during a storm, so they lost it for five days.

394
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,940
 They fell over and stabbed a ship.

395
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,780
 They just stabbed a fish. It came out like a sort of lovely cabab.

396
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,140
 This was insane. I think you're under selling it a bit, Dan.

397
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,140
 They literally built an iron capsule with sails on top,

398
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,900
 exactly slotted Cleopatra's needle into it and then towed it behind a ship.

399
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,100
 That's exactly.

400
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,540
 Really, answer the question. What, the men, several men died, didn't they?

401
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:01,300
 There was a storm arose and it was, was it the men going from the main ship

402
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,420
 to try and steady the needle? There was a lost at sea.

403
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,540
 Yeah, there was another ship that realized that there was,

404
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,500
 there'd been a big storm and they were in trouble and they sent some people on a little boat

405
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,300
 to try and rescue the people and those people on the boat died.

406
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,740
 But then I think you were saying Cleopatra's needle itself inside this massive container

407
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,380
 just floated around, lost it, see no one knew if it had sunk.

408
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,580
 And then someone just stumbled upon it. Yeah.

409
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,700
 And I think they thought, well, it's gone.

410
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,220
 It's, it must have, it must have gone down. It's gone.

411
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,300
 Absolutely terrible when they thought we've lost Cleopatra's needle.

412
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,980
 Because the thing is, before it was brought over, right, it was given to the British

413
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,980
 by the ruler of Egypt, who was called Muhammad Ali incidentally,

414
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,380
 to say thank you for winning the Battle of the Nile and the Battle of Alexandra against Napoleon.

415
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,460
 But the British government said, well, we can't really afford to bring it over.

416
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,580
 It was 1819. So they, they then waited 60 years, 59 years until 1878.

417
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,180
 And they said, suppose we better bring it over than they've given it to us.

418
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,820
 It seems churlish now. And then as soon as they try and bring it over, they lose it.

419
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:07,100
 Do you think, do you think when they lost it, they felt, well, we have this three inch version.

420
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,260
 Shall we just put that on display instead?

421
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,660
 We can only fit one photo of a beauty underneath it, unfortunately.

422
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,100
 So yeah, I was going to say, so that it has the names of the guys who died in that, in that process,

423
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,980
 on the back of it, facing the water, facing the Thames.

424
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,140
 And then underneath one of the sphinxes, you can see a little sign that says,

425
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,500
 the shrapnel holes that you can see in here are little holes that were made as a result

426
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,900
 of nighttime bombing in 1917 over London.

427
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,020
 And the bombs hit a tram and, and it shot off metal and so on into it.

428
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,380
 And so you could actually go up to the sink and put your finger through a bomb hole in the,

429
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:51,860
 Oh, it's a lot of control today.

430
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,020
 Well, we've lost everybody listening.

431
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,460
 You didn't, you didn't see it coming, did he?

432
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,100
 You could put your finger in a bomb hole.

433
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,900
 All innocence.

434
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:15,140
 On time capsules, while we've got that subject open, loads of them have been lost.

435
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,940
 So there's an international body called the International Time Capsule Society,

436
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,340
 which set up in 1990, and it reckons that there are 10 to 15,000 capsules worldwide,

437
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,340
 but that most of them have been forgotten and lost.

438
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,860
 Unfortunately, the International Time Capsule Society now says,

439
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,340
 we are not open anymore. We're not open for business.

440
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,300
 We'll be open in 2153.

441
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:44,740
 Did you see, did you see they accidentally dug up a blue Peter time capsule at the end

442
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,940
 of last year, or the start of this year?

443
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,260
 It was under the Millennium Dome, and they accidentally dug it up and damaged it.

444
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,620
 And they've taken all the bits out and put them in the office, and they're going to re-bury them.

445
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,980
 Yeah, and it's, I mean, it was buried in 1998 to sort of go under the Millennium Dome.

446
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,100
 And it is the most '90s collection of things you could find.

447
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,980
 So here's what they thought was worth saying.

448
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,580
 I bet you could guess some of them, okay?

449
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,780
 Is it one of the dogs?

450
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,820
 Yeah, one of the dogs.

451
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
 One of the blue Peter's.

452
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,020
 There's got to be newspapers of the day.

453
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,220
 Richard Bacon.

454
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,780
 There are loads of cocaine.

455
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,700
 It's better in mind, this was selected by children who were watching blue Peter in the '90s.

456
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
 Okay, was it not much cocaine?

457
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,660
 It was a small amount of cocaine.

458
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,100
 Oh, right, you want actual guesses.

459
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,500
 So think of some things to do with the '90s.

460
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,500
 Yeah, blue Peter badges, absolutely, but like really '90s things, that children's things from the '90s.

461
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
 A Spice Girl.

462
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
 A Spice Girl, correct.

463
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,100
 A Spice Girl CD, not bad.

464
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
 Was it?

465
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,300
 Yeah, absolutely. It's got a Tamagotchi.

466
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,940
 It's got a picture of Tony Blair in a high-vis vest.

467
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,540
 And it's got one of the great beauties of the day.

468
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,860
 It's got some felt from the roof of the Millennium Dome.

469
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,060
 What I think strange is like this blue Peter one, for instance, we know what's in it.

470
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,220
 And they were only planning to open it in 2050 or something.

471
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,220
 Yeah, presumably we're still going to know what was in it then.

472
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,940
 I think what they should do is put stuff in and keep it a secret.

473
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,700
 Like the 12 beauties, who are they?

474
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,420
 See, that will be a huge reveal.

475
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,620
 Yeah.

476
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,260
 You know the New York one.

477
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,260
 So there's a Clip Actress Needle in New York.

478
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,140
 Yeah.

479
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,420
 Egypt has asked for the one in New York back, because they're not taking good enough care of it.

480
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,180
 So this was a couple of years ago, the Secretary General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities

481
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,500
 wrote a letter to the mayor, who was Bloomberg at the time, saying,

482
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,940
 "I've seen some pictures of the obelisk that we kindly gifted you in the 19th century,

483
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,780
 and we've noticed that you're not taking good care of it at all, the hieroglyphics have rubbed off.

484
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,140
 It's chipped away at.

485
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,900
 If you don't remember it."

486
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,700
 "It's everywhere."

487
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,620
 Weird guy sticking his finger in it at various times a day.

488
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,780
 And he said, "We're going to have a duty to come and remove it, if you don't saw it."

489
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,700
 One of the first things they did when it arrived in New York was they gave it a thorough cleaning.

490
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,780
 They said, "This is too much, and it did a huge amount of damage to it."

491
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,140
 Yeah, that was pretty much on installation.

492
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,740
 Oh, come on, guys.

493
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,180
 I think we think there are only about 28 left, aren't there?

494
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,580
 And they were all in Egypt, obelisks.

495
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,900
 And I think Egypt only has six left, because it seemed to keep giving them away.

496
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,340
 Thank you, it's constantly.

497
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,740
 The Roman Stoll loads.

498
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,060
 I think there are as many in Rome as there are in Egypt now.

499
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,580
 Did we steal ours or?

500
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,140
 No, we were given it. We were given it for winning those battles.

501
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,420
 Yeah, I think we found it, though, as well.

502
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,380
 We uncovered it.

503
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,380
 It was British archaeologists over there who uncovered it, and so said, "Can we have that?"

504
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,660
 Oh, I didn't know that we found it.

505
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,980
 Yeah, it was found by a circus strongman.

506
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,020
 Oh, come on.

507
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,660
 Yeah, no way.

508
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,180
 Why did he not just carry it home?

509
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,660
 I've been able to. You could carry 12 people up on a, that was part of his act.

510
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:46,620
 He would hold people up on stage, 12 people on a sort of platform and walk across the stage.

511
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,460
 Really?

512
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,780
 But he studied hydraulics initially, and so that was his thing.

513
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,620
 So he was one of the most successful archaeologists of this time.

514
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,260
 I don't need hydraulics with these arms.

515
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:01,940
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was the one who found the obelisks itself.

516
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,140
 If not, he definitely was very much involved with Cleopatra's needle.

517
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,820
 I can't quite remember why, though.

518
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,180
 And he was quite strong, so he ruined a lot of things.

519
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,460
 So to get into sort of...

520
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,620
 Just come lend to get the pyramid in his side.

521
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,420
 Why do you think that guy missed a strong from the Mr. Membergs?

522
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,420
 Actually, all the pyramids used to have square sides.

523
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:27,460
 So his name was Giovanni Battista Belzoni.

524
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,460
 He was born in Italy, but he lived over in England.

525
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,100
 He was six foot seven tall.

526
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,180
 And he was known as the Patagonian Samson, when he was a strong man.

527
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,180
 And he found the tombs of rams he's the first.

528
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,980
 So he made some mega discoveries, but he used to like,

529
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,540
 battering ram his way through in order to get he destroyed a lot of things.

530
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,580
 Is that why he wanted the obelisks, so he could batter some tombs down?

531
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,620
 He just used it as a toothpick.

532
00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:02,620
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

533
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,260
 That is Chuzenski.

534
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,300
 My fact this week is that after women stop breastfeeding,

535
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,460
 they're breast eat themselves.

536
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,660
 And this is something we just found out about human women.

537
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,740
 And it's that...

538
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,540
 So what happens is when we're breastfeeding,

539
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,780
 then we have to produce loads of extra cells, which produce the milk for the babies.

540
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,100
 And so our breasts suddenly become full of these cells.

541
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,140
 And then when you stop breastfeeding, then you're just full of useless cells,

542
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,260
 which die and in normal circumstances,

543
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,940
 if you've got a bit of your body that are full of totally useless dead cells,

544
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,540
 that would create a huge immunoresponse to try and clear them up,

545
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,820
 which would be extremely painful.

546
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,340
 There'd be loads and loads of bruising, there'd be tissue damage,

547
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,580
 because that's just all this dead stuff hanging around in your body,

548
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,380
 that your white blood cells then have to come and eat up.

549
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,460
 So it would be really painful.

550
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,340
 So we've never quite known how it is that once we stop breastfeeding,

551
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,540
 we're able to get back to normal without any serious problems.

552
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,260
 Until now, when it turns out that they thoughtfully kill each other,

553
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,540
 these milk-producing cells.

554
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,260
 So once you stop breastfeeding, then there's a hormone release,

555
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,540
 which means that they stay quite close next to each other, the dead cells,

556
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,940
 and the live ones just swallow them.

557
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,460
 -Why? -And they just keep eating each other and eating each other

558
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,540
 until there are few enough left that the white blood cells

559
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,940
 rock up and swallow the rest.

560
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,780
 -Crikey. -But yeah, a breast of our themselves.

561
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,940
 -That was amazing. -That was amazing.

562
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,580
 Breasts are really intelligent when it comes to

563
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,580
 producing milk for babies. I asked Ash, so my best friend Ash,

564
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,780
 he has become a dad recently, and he'd been telling me a few things

565
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,180
 while Jackie, his wife, was pregnant about what breastfeeding, how it works.

566
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,380
 And he said that basically the nipple sort of listens,

567
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,980
 listens not being, you know, obviously, it has no ears, but it,

568
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,380
 it analyzes baby saliva to give the appropriate milk.

569
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
 And I looked into it and this is true.

570
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,980
 So what it does is, little bits of saliva when the baby is

571
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,780
 sucking on the nipple, makes its way into the nipple.

572
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,180
 And they say that the breast and the body of the mum actually

573
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,980
 manages to sort of diagnose what kind of milk the baby needs in terms of

574
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,380
 if it's actually a bit ill, it might need these, like the extra antibodies

575
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,980
 in order to make the baby healthier.

576
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,980
 So it kind of produces whatever kind of compulsion of milk.

577
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
 -It's really controversial that. -Is it?

578
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,980
 So there's not been any studies done on it, and it's also just very possible.

579
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,380
 And some people think it's much more possible that if you're producing more antibodies,

580
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,180
 it's just because whatever's making the baby ill is also making you ill.

581
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,780
 You've got the virus and so you're producing antibodies.

582
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,180
 But there's a lot of anecdotal evidence, you know,

583
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,580
 mothers say that my milk looks different when my baby's sick.

584
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,380
 -Yeah, there was famously a mother put a picture up on Facebook,

585
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,380
 which said, look at the colour of my milk because it's kind of changed.

586
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,980
 And the suggestion was, is that it was changing because it was adding more stuff into it.

587
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,780
 The weirdly science sometimes requires more evidence than a mum's picture on Facebook.

588
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,980
 -It's so weird. -Honestly, I'm not going to have colouring pics today.

589
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,980
 -No, I'm relying on 70,000. -Oh, wow.

590
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,180
 Well, then that does sound unequivocal.

591
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,380
 One thing that's true, and this is not from a mum's Facebook post,

592
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,780
 it is the past.

593
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:09,780
 No, one thing is that babies can smell breasts very accurately.

594
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,380
 And they're home in on them because after a woman's given birth,

595
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,180
 women give off from the breast these kind of secretions,

596
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,980
 babies can smell very clearly, and babies can smell them and react to them more strongly

597
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,580
 than they react to the smell of actual milk.

598
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,380
 -Oh, wow. -So it's like a homing beacon saying,

599
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,580
 "There is a breast here, make your way towards it."

600
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,180
 And then it's frustrating because most babies can't really move at all,

601
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,780
 so they just press nearby, and get really frustrated.

602
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,980
 There's nothing they can do about this.

603
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,380
 When they smell these secretions, they get more interested,

604
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,980
 and they sort of make more, you know, head movements and, you know,

605
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,980
 suckling gestures and things like this, then they do even when they smell milk.

606
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,380
 -So that's how they sort of... -I thought that was really interesting.

607
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,980
 I was reading about this for the O-series research.

608
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,780
 I was looking into ovulating, but very interesting.

609
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,980
 And this is related to lactation that in the olden days,

610
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,580
 when we were a hunter-gatherer society, we menstruated far, far less.

611
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,780
 I hardly menstruated so much to be honest.

612
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,380
 So we had far fewer menstrual cycles back in the olden days

613
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,180
 because women were breastfeed for much longer.

614
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,980
 So the average in hunter-gatherer societies now,

615
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,180
 then the average length of time he breastfeed for was about three years,

616
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,780
 whereas now there is a lot, I think it's about six months here.

617
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,380
 And so you'd either be breastfeeding, which suppresses your periods,

618
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,980
 or you would be pregnant, where obviously you don't get periods.

619
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,380
 And so someone worked out that back then you'd have about 50 menstrual cycles

620
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,580
 in your lifetime, which is hardly any, and now we have about 420, 430 menstrual cycles.

621
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,980
 And we're just not evolved to be able to cope with these constant wild fluctuations

622
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,180
 of estrogen and progesterone, because we're not supposed to be doing that.

623
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,780
 It's supposed to be kind of an occasional thing between being pregnant and breastfeeding.

624
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,980
 And then you're dead at the age of 25 or 30.

625
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,780
 Exactly, and then everything really drops off in all departments after that.

626
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,780
 I was reading about letdown. It's a phrase called letdown.

627
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,980
 And I think that I've heard it before down, I've heard the phrase several times.

628
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:10,380
 But it's obviously four people around the microphones right now who don't have children.

629
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,980
 So we might be saying a lot of very obvious things to parents in this chat.

630
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,380
 But I'd not heard of this.

631
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,380
 Just check it on Facebook and see if anyone's been here.

632
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:29,180
 So it's the fact that lactating can happen not just when the baby latches on to the breast,

633
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,380
 but things can spark it off.

634
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,780
 For example, if you show a mum a picture of her baby,

635
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,780
 she might let some milk loose just purely by seeing the photos.

636
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,780
 Isn't that incredible?

637
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:49,180
 Or even if she hears another baby cry because of a primal urge to soothe a child,

638
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,180
 knowing that soothes might just release some milk.

639
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,580
 Again, obviously most mums and fathers around the world are going, yeah, we know this,

640
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,380
 but I'd never heard that before.

641
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,980
 I remember reading the year or two ago about the idea.

642
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,380
 There was a study done that a lot of babies, especially mammals, I think,

643
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,980
 all kind of cry similar frequencies.

644
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,180
 And I can't remember why that would happen.

645
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,980
 Maybe you would look after other species.

646
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,580
 Yeah, that's what that would imply, isn't it?

647
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:18,380
 So if you're a stote, if you're a baby stote, you cry in the hope that there'll be a

648
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,380
 your mum, be another stote or see a weasel passing by.

649
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,580
 Or any, any mum will like it.

650
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,980
 And did you see that thing this week speaking of nursing other species?

651
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,980
 The woman in Peru who was being interviewed about floods in Peru at the moment,

652
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,180
 which had devastating agriculture, things like that.

653
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,780
 She was holding a piglet and as the interviewer was interviewing her, she lifted up

654
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,980
 her shirt and just started suckling the pig on their own breast.

655
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,180
 And the cameraman's so tactful.

656
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,780
 I would the camera swings away from that image faster than you can bring.

657
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,380
 It just suddenly takes a real interest in the surrounding scenery.

658
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,580
 Very weird.

659
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,380
 So there are obviously loads and loads and loads of stories about breastfeeding.

660
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,380
 You know, saints who miraculously started lactating when they were starving in the desert.

661
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,980
 So one of them is the Christian holy woman, Christine the astonishing.

662
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,980
 I seem to remember could Christine the astonishing fly as well?

663
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,380
 From her name, I wouldn't be surprised by anything she could do.

664
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,380
 I have a feeling she was in a church once and she flew up into the eaves of the church.

665
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,380
 So also in the Bible, they used to depict the Virgin Mary breastfeeding Jesus.

666
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,580
 But sometimes they didn't want her breast to seem sexy.

667
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,180
 So they put her breasts on her collarbone instead of a breast level.

668
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,580
 So there are all these pictures.

669
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,580
 It's less sexy. It is less sexy. It's more weird, isn't it?

670
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
 Which makes it a bit less sexy.

671
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
 Yeah.

672
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
 That's really funny.

673
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,980
 So there are all these pictures of having a breast of way up here and Jesus feeding on them.

674
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,380
 Did you know that?

675
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,380
 A possums.

676
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,580
 So you know, a possums like possums, but American.

677
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:53,580
 Their nipples grow up to 35 times their original length when they're being suckled.

678
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,180
 Did they start off really small, aren't they?

679
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,180
 Really, really long. They're quite normal size they get incredibly long.

680
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:05,180
 So baby possums climb up into their mother's pouch when they're very undeveloped.

681
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,980
 And they have to latch on immediately.

682
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,580
 And if you don't find a nipple really quickly, you die straight away.

683
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,580
 So you latch on and they latch on and then the nipple swells up inside their mouth.

684
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,980
 So they're locked on and they stay locked on for two months.

685
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,980
 So it becomes like an unbilical cord.

686
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,980
 It grows up to 35 times its own length down into the body.

687
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,380
 Yeah. What is that? Is not sexy.

688
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,380
 Oh my god. Yeah.

689
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,380
 It's weird, isn't it?

690
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,180
 And because it's so swollen up inside it, it's so latched on.

691
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,980
 If you try to detach one from the other, then you tear the nipple because they're locked.

692
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
 They're locked tight.

693
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,180
 Nope. No, no, no, no.

694
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,180
 No, thank you.

695
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,380
 Do you know the effect that breasts have on men?

696
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,580
 Yeah.

697
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:55,380
 Well, they have done experiments on men who they divided men into two groups.

698
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,980
 Normal men and pervert.

699
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,380
 No, they asked them to do the experiment like, you know, the experiment with children,

700
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,380
 we have a marshmallow now or too much amount later.

701
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,380
 So they said you can have one breast now or two breast later.

702
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:14,580
 No, they asked them if they would be willing to delay gratification to get a small cash amount now or a large cash amount later.

703
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,380
 And then they show the two groups of men, two different films.

704
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,980
 One of them was a woman running along a beach in slow motion, like in Baywatch.

705
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,180
 And the other was some countryside.

706
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
 Right.

707
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,980
 And the men who watched the other countryside, was there anything?

708
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,780
 Was it just, was there a piglet there?

709
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,980
 No, no, a piglet.

710
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:36,780
 There were no rutting balls.

711
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,780
 No, so just like boring countryside.

712
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,380
 And the men who watched the Baywatch style video were much like clear to take the small payout now

713
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,980
 rather than wait and defer their gratification.

714
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,980
 So it's believed that the sort of the neurochemical circuits of the brain get hijacked.

715
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,780
 And they're basically saying, pleasure now, take pleasure now.

716
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,580
 That makes a lot of sense.

717
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,380
 Okay.

718
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,580
 When I was researching this, I remembered a scene that I watched in a movie called The Last Emperor,

719
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,980
 which is about the Chinese, the final Chinese Emperor before Mao Zitong kicked him out of power.

720
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,180
 And there was, there's a scene in it where he's quite old and he's being breastfed by one of his nurses.

721
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,180
 He's like eight, nine, something like that in there.

722
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,580
 So I quickly looked into it and that was a thing of Chinese emperors that you can actually see.

723
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:27,580
 This really cool looking device, which is a big steel thing with a hole in the middle.

724
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:34,380
 And women who were basically auditioning their breasts or the emperor would come to have their breasts checked.

725
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,180
 And to see if they were giving enough milk and so on.

726
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:42,180
 So they would audition people and be like, you, why would you have a breast factor?

727
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,580
 Basically, why would they need the steel with the hole in the middle?

728
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,580
 Why, you don't need to put your breasts through a hole in order to breastfeed.

729
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,780
 But it was like the voice way you're not allowed to see their faces.

730
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,580
 No, so it wasn't a full steel door.

731
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,580
 It was just, it was just for the breast and there was a hole at the front where I, presumably, then you went through.

732
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
 How big was it?

733
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,780
 I would say a, a hard back book.

734
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,380
 Like the private eye annual.

735
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,180
 Like the, like no, small in the private eye annual.

736
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,980
 Oh, okay.

737
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,980
 But the third book of general ignorance, where is the previous books of general ignorance?

738
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,380
 We're a smaller format edition.

739
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,980
 Yeah, all available at qi.com/shop.

740
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,780
 And that is the worst plug for anything.

741
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,980
 One of our books, which are of different sizes to the breastplates,

742
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,580
 fully used to feed the emperor.

743
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:36,780
 Okay, that's it.

744
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
 That's all of our facts.

745
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,180
